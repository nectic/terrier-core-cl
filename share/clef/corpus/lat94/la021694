ROBIN ABCARIAN: CELEBRATING VOWS, LOVE -- AND LIVING -- IN SPITE OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a fine Valentine's Day morning, two resplendent brides and their grooms 
stepped gingerly down the blood-red carpet of a cavernous Downtown church. They 
took their vows, exchanged their rings, lit their candles, and walked back up 
the aisle into futures that are hard to think about. 
</P>
<P>
 The tandem ceremonies uniting Robert Molina with Crystal Orozco and Juan 
Uriarte with Rosa Munoz seemed like any others: The flower girls and ring 
bearers either barreled down the aisle at triple speed or were too shy and had 
to be nudged. One bride looked a little dazed. One groom had trouble slipping 
the ring onto his wife's finger. One nuptial kiss was passionate. One was a 
peck. The children from the second ceremony had to be stopped from crashing the 
first. One picked her nose. One baby couldn't stop crying. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 40 or so guests couldn't stop crying, either. That was because the 
vows, especially when each couple repeated "till death do us part" had a more 
immediate meaning than they do for most couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert, 31, has AIDS. Crystal, 26, does not. Both Juan, 26, and Rosa, 23, are 
HIV positive. Between them, the couples have six children -- three each -- 
under 6. So far, the children have tested negative for the virus that causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "One girl I know said, 'Why get married, then die?' " Robert said. "And I 
said, 'Why give up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some people marry to affirm their love and commitment. In the big church on 
Monday, one sensed something else was going on, that these four people were 
marrying for reasons unknown to most couples. Yes, there was love, and yes, 
commitment. But an undercurrent of defiance charged the proceedings. These two 
couples, HIV status notwithstanding, would not be denied the chance to live 
their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the specter of death haunts them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before her wedding, Crystal puffed on a cigarette as she watched 
her 5-year-old son, Phillip, play on a swing set at Bethesda House, the 
Salvation Army's shelter for homeless families dealing with AIDS and HIV. She 
is so shy, so clearly uncomfortable talking to someone holding a notebook, that 
the jarring nature of what she is saying almost slips by unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get sad about being a widow," she said. "And I know it's going to happen. 
Today, Phillip said, 'When Dad dies, you can get a boyfriend because we'll have 
our dad in heaven.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Smetzer is executive director of Bethesda House, where both families 
lived. (The Uriartes moved into a subsidized apartment just before the wedding; 
the Molinas hope to be in an apartment soon.) Smetzer lives there too, so she 
is more than an administrator. She is mother hen and surrogate grandmother. She 
helped organize the volunteers who donated the wedding dresses and tuxedos, the 
flowers and decorations. Monday, she was matron of honor for Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had so much sorrow, so much pain that these weddings are a wonderful 
change," she said. "They really epitomize what Bethesda House is about . . . to 
live every moment, and if this is going to be your last, make it your best." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bethesda House opened in September, 1992. The staff, Smetzer said, believed 
that the place was charmed because its residents seemed to fare so well once 
they had a roof over their heads, beds and food. And three babies were born in 
the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a false sense of security. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went seven months without losing anyone, and then we lost five in one 
month," Smetzer said. "When we lost our first baby, the whole staff needed 
intervention." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert and Crystal and their children have lived in Bethesda House for about a 
month. They said they were evicted from an apartment after refusing to pay rent 
because of the rats and roaches. They've been together eight years and always 
meant to get married, Crystal said, but she dreamed of a beautiful wedding and 
a white satin dress and kept putting off a ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In December, when Robert was found to have AIDS, they decided the time had 
come. They were going to be married, in fact, in the hospital on Christmas Eve. 
But the ceremony never took place, Crystal said, because no one would give her 
a ride to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a strange excuse to miss one's wedding. But when you are poor and 
homeless and trying to keep your kids warm and fed, getting around is a huge 
burden, sometimes insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
 A place like Bethesda House takes away the survival issues and allows its 
residents to recapture the feeling of belonging to the world, of participating 
in the rituals that join us, like birthdays, funerals . . . and weddings.

BOOK REVIEW / BIOGRAPHY; INTRIGUING STUDY OF AN AMERICAN TRAITOR; THE MAN IN 
THE MIRROR: A LIFE OF BENEDICT ARNOLD BY CLARE BRANDT ; RANDOM HOUSE, $25, 384 
PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Benedict Arnold "turned his coat" and sold himself to the British, his 
new masters promptly put him at the head of an expeditionary force and 
dispatched him to Virginia with orders to burn and pillage at will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold interrogated an American prisoner who was not aware of (Arnold's) 
identity," writes Clare Brandt in her new biography of the man whose name is a 
synonym for traitor. "Asked what the local farmers would do when they captured 
General Arnold, the man replied that they would first cut off the leg wounded 
at Saratoga and bury it with honor, then hang the rest." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Brandt makes the point, colorfully enough, in "The Man in the Mirror" 
that Benedict Arnold was very much a man of parts. As a dashing young officer 
of the Continental Army, Arnold repeatedly and fearlessly placed himself in 
harm's way, and he was hailed among his countrymen as the "patriot-hero" of the 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Arnold was a cynical careerist and shameless social climber, 
a man who rose to the rank of general in the Continental Army and yet faced a 
court-martial on charges of smuggling and war profiteering. He may have been 
"another Hannibal" on the battlefield, but he managed to provoke the open 
hatred of his comrades-in-arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I honestly wish some person would try an experiment upon him, viz. to make 
the sun shine through his head with an ounce of (cannon) ball and then see 
whether rays come in a direct or oblique direction," one of his brother 
officers wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt does not try to rehabilitate Arnold, although she insists on showing us 
his strengths as well as his weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arnold had astonishing physical valor but no moral courage, a rigid code of 
'honor' without a shred of inner integrity, and superior intelligence with no 
understanding," Brandt writes. "To fill in the gaps, to become the ideal hero 
he wished to be, Arnold became a master of self-delusion." 
</P>
<P>
 In his own era, Arnold's failings might have been blamed on a flawed character 
or a lack of moral fiber. But Brandt insists on a psychological solution to the 
puzzle of Arnold, and she attributes his darker side -- and even his act of 
treason -- to a shattering childhood experience. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arnold was 14, Brandt explains, his alcoholic father died suddenly and 
left the family penniless. Young Benedict Arnold, who aspired to wealth and 
position in the merchant class of Colonial Connecticut, was forced to leave 
school and take up an apprenticeship at an apothecary's shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "His world turned upside down," Brandt writes. "His humiliation was severe; 
but like many adolescent agonies it remained buried, working its destruction 
secretly, silently and slowly, deep beneath the skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt's psychoanalytic take on Arnold is necessarily based on speculation and 
surmise, but, thankfully, the rest of the book is crafted on sturdy framework 
of thorough scholarship and engaging prose. Indeed, she displays a real gift 
for the intricacies of military strategy and military history. Still, Brandt 
simply cannot resist an occasional flourish so ornate that one suspects a kind 
of self-parody. 
</P>
<P>
 "The landscape of Norwich is precipitous and adamantine," Brandt writes of 
Arnold's birthplace in Connecticut, "much like the interior landscape of its 
most infamous son." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold turns out to be a far more complex figure than his mythic role in 
American history permits us to see. A widower at 36, he courted a 15-year-old 
girl with deeply romantic and even faintly erotic love letters, and when she 
turned him down, he used the same lines on Peggy Shippen, a "shrewd and daring" 
Philadelphia maiden who became his faithful partner in life, love -- and 
treason. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of Arnold's life is that he committed treason to get rich -- and he 
ended up broke and broken. An aging Arnold found himself shunned by both his 
native and adoptive countries: He cooked up a grand scheme "to liberate Chile, 
Peru and (Mexico) from the Dominion of Spain" -- but, in the end, was forced to 
content himself with menial work as a cargo officer on a merchant ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt jettisons much of the psycho-historical baggage in the last third of 
the book and instead gives us an urgent account of the planning and 
consequences of Arnold's momentous act of treason. Indeed, at moments "The Man 
in the Mirror" reads rather like a contemporary spy novel -- it's full of 
intrigue, life-and-death chases and Colonial-era spy craft, including a secret 
code based on the 21st edition of Bailey's Dictionary: "Three numbers make a 
word." Brandt reveals, "The first is the page, the second the line, the third 
the word." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandt appears to overstate the importance of Arnold's abortive act of treason 
and the childhood trauma that accompanied the death of his father. But the 
sheer gusto of her book, the bravado with which she executes her rhetorical 
maneuvers, are exactly what makes "The Man in the Mirror" such a startling and 
even invigorating study of a man who has been consigned to the villain's role 
in most of our school history books.

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; COUNTRY SINGER PUTS IT IN WORDS; JIMMIE DALE GILMORE 
SPREADS CHARM, POETRY AROUND THE CRAZY HORSE, AND THE AUDIENCE RESPONDS 
ENTHUSIASTICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You've got to hand it to the folks who run the Crazy Horse Steak House for 
booking Jimmie Dale Gilmore. 
</P>
<P>
 A singer-songwriter from Texas, Gilmore is as much like your typical country 
musician as sushi is like a McDonald's fish sandwich. Of course, each of those 
culinary creations has its fans, and Gilmore packed the Crazy Horse Monday 
night as tightly as the mainstream, radio-friendly country acts that dominate 
the club's schedule. But what a difference in content.  
</P>
<P>
 When was the last time you were in a country bar and heard an anecdote 
resembling nothing so much as a Zen koan? 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you ever thought about the fact that when you watch 'MTV Unplugged' . . 
. it's on television ?" 
</P>
<P>
 True, the crowd did greet that observation of Gilmore's with the sound of one 
hand clapping. But it was one of the few times during the 90-minute set that 
anything passing his lips met with less than boisterous approval. 
</P>
<P>
 One would expect this 48-year-old musician, who spent years studying Hindu as 
well as honky-tonk philosophy, to get the well-considered accolades of pop 
music critics for his thoughtful, often elliptical lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Gilmore must have been a little surprised by the girlish squeals that 
erupted during his cover of Elvis Presley's 1956 hit "I Was the One." A 
hunka-hunka burnin' love Gilmore's not. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the wiry singer's aw-shucks humility on stage is a considerable 
part of his charm. It comes across as a genuine expression of his personality, 
not as a guise fabricated for maximum audience appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 His widely praised 1993 album (and first major-label release) "Spinning Around 
the Sun" has bolstered his cache of loyalists. It was a welcome sight to see 
the Crazy Horse filled to its 275-seat capacity, especially as country radio 
largely has ignored Gilmore's records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was equally clear Monday that a good portion of those in the house know of 
Gilmore's long-time association with fellow Texans Joe Ely and Butch Hancock. 
They all played together in the early '70s as the Flatlanders, and they still 
exchange songs with each other like neighbors lending garden tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore drew a wave of hearty applause when he mentioned Ely, who has recorded 
a number of his songs. "This is a song I wrote 100 years ago. Joe Ely sang it, 
but now I'm taking it back again," Gilmore said by way of launching into a 
fiery rendition of "Dallas" (which he further introduced as "a medley of my 
greatest hit"). 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing as such banter was, the best thing about Gilmore was his songs, 
which allow a listener to think, to feel and even to wonder about their 
meaning. Gilmore is a refreshing alternative to the Nashville song-factory 
writers who churn out stereotyped characters instead of real people and put 
them in stock situations so they may behave predictably. 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible to admire the sheer poetry of Gilmore's writing in "Where You 
Going" even without necessarily understanding whether he's speaking literally 
or figuratively: 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen crimson roses  
</P>
<P>
 Growing through a chain link fence  
</P>
<P>
 I've seen crystal visions  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they don't make sense  
</P>
<P>
 You can see the future  
</P>
<P>
 It don't make no difference  
</P>
<P>
 Just don't talk about it  
</P>
<P>
 Babe you know I love the suspense  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Such enigmatic lines establish a twangy yin to the yang of the direct 
professions of emotion Gilmore tapped with his heartbreaking reading of Hank 
Williams' "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry." In fact, a subtle note of 
philosophical duality underscored the show. At one point, underscoring his 
neither-fish-nor-fowl status, Gilmore announced: "I have to apologize if my 
music isn't country enough for you. Or if it's too country." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore doesn't so much sing his lyrics as coerce them to leave his larynx. 
It's not a polished voice -- which may be one of the reasons country radio 
steers clear of him -- yet it is all the more effective for its plain-folks, 
direct quality. 
</P>
<P>
 And he inflects every line with a vocal quaver that can pierce the shields so 
many of us use against the pain of real life every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything in the set -- from his own songs to the Presley and Williams 
classics to such little-known gems as Johnny Cash's sublime "I Still Miss 
Someone" -- was enhanced immeasurably by Gilmore's exquisite four-member band. 
Time after time, guitarist Dan Yates and guitarist-keyboardist-mandolinist 
Chris Gage supplied just the right licks. At the end of the set, everybody -- 
including opening act Monte Warden and his band -- joined in on "Oh Boy," an 
inspired rave-up homage to Buddy Holly, another of Texas' musical sons. 
</P>
<P>
 In his own 40-minute set, Warden, the former leader of the country-rock 
Wagoneers, sang a lot of the greatest songs Buddy Holly never wrote. The set 
was, like Warden's 1993 debut solo album, a fun-filled neo-rockabilly romp. But 
Warden remained a bit too close to his rock and R&B influences (Holly, the 
Beatles, Brenton Wood, Wilson Pickett) to leave himself enough room to 
establish his own identity. 
</P>
<P>
 A less-than-ideal sound mix didn't help; it left Warden struggling to rise 
above the instrumental foundation (which included a string of exhilarating 
solos by guitarist David Murray). Still, with his enthusiastic, knee-knocking, 
shoulder-shrugging physicality and his bagful of eminently hummable if 
sometimes lightweight material, Warden earned the enthusiastic ovation he got.

JAZZ REVIEW; STANDARDS PROCEDURE QUIETS JORDAN'S REVOLUTION; THE LONDON-BASED 
GUITARIST AND HIS SEPTET DO THEIR BEST AT THE COACH HOUSE WHEN BREAKING OUT ON 
ORIGINAL MATERIAL WITH STRONG RHYTHMS AND POP-STYLED HOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not an original concept. Many crossover musicians have taken jazz 
standards and beefed up the sound with amplification, accessible beats and 
improvisations that stray only slightly from the tune's melody. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ronny Jordan, the London-based guitarist who played the Coach House on 
Monday, does it better than most. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not Jordan's strong suit. In a 90-minute set, Jordan and his 
backing septet paid homage to their jazz roots but turned in their best 
performances on original material -- music with a touch of jazz sensibility, 
but based more solidly on strong, direct rhythms and pop-styled melodic hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jordan's current release, "The Quiet Revolution," looks to rap and 
hip-hop for its personality, Jordan's live show seemed designed to show that 
he's really a jazz cat at heart. And that is where it failed, sometimes 
miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 The band opened with "My Favorite Things," the ditty from "The Sound of Music" 
that saxophonist John Coltrane made a personal declaration of freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was little of that liberated feeling here, as Jordan and company 
brought a reassuring comfort to the tune with a simple bass line, direct 
percussion and colorless improvs that, while pleasant enough on the surface, 
did little to reveal the personality of the improviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar treatments were given to "All Blues," taken at a moderate tempo, and 
Miles Davis' "So What" (both from Davis' groundbreaking 1959 "Kind of Blue" 
session), the fast-paced modal exercise that has become Jordan's signature 
since the release of his first album, "The Antidote." 
</P>
<P>
 While both were tightly executed and played with a certain amount of 
propulsive spirit -- the interplay between drummer Tony Mason and percussionist 
Sola Akingbola was particularly invigorated -- they paled in comparison, as did 
"My Favorite Things," to the weighty originals. "All Blues" in Jordan's hands 
seemed particularly dull. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood changed considerably when the guitarist switched to his own material. 
Following "My Favorite Things," "Blues Grinder" was a tough, spunky workout 
that featured a unison theme between Jordan and flutist Gary Belfield and 
sharp, five-beat accents that fell just-so during solos. Jordan's guitar work 
was especially attractive: hard-driving and full of unexpected twists and 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballad-paced numbers, including "Nice 'N' Slow" and "The Morning After" came 
across in much warmer fashion than "All Blues." Jordan sounded particularly 
heartfelt on "After," his Wes Montgomery-inspired tones speaking volumes on the 
number, which he dedicated to his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of rapper Radical M.C. to a pair of mid-set numbers was 
unnecessary, with M.C. acting more as a cheerleader for the instrumentalists 
than a presence in his own right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a Shaq T-shirt, M.C. paced the stage on "Season for Change," one of 
the album's better numbers (performed by rapper Guru on "Revolution"). He was 
able to generate little enthusiasm, hurt by amplification that made his lyric 
difficult to decipher. And when he bumped out the line "I've got a tale that's 
never been told . . . " one couldn't help but think we'd heard it before. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's strongest voice belonged to Jordan, whose solos were full of 
lyrical moments, sharp chording and intelligent, inspired lines. Less effective 
were keyboardist Joel Campbell and flutist Belfield, both of whom were 
melodically powered but unable to break from their persistent, uninterrupted 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone jazz standard that seemed best suited Jordan's to approach was Wes 
Montgomery's "Mr. Walker" on which Jordan delivered his most detailed and 
thoughtful solo. But his strongest moments came near the end of the program on 
"Tinsel Town" and "Monte Carlo," when the band fired up the afterburners behind 
Jordan's spark and sizzle.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SPOTLIGHT ON THE SONGS IN TRIBUTE TO CAHN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who says you need a huge amphitheater, flashy lighting and a big orchestra to 
produce a musical tribute? Monday's homage to songwriter Sammy Cahn at the 
Directors Guild Theatre had little more than a stage, a piano and a projection 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was more than enough -- in part because of the array of talent 
assembled to sample the extensive Cahn catalogue, in part because of the 
genuine affection that underscored the entire evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Appropriately, the songs were the real stars of the presentation. With 20 
Academy Award nominations and four Oscars, Cahn, who died a year ago, was the 
preeminent Hollywood film lyricist. Less known is his authorship of pieces that 
have become American popular song classics, including "Time After Time," "Guess 
I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry" and "I'll Never Stop Loving You." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the long list of performers, Joe Williams, with a superbly understated 
reading of "Call Me Irresponsible," was a standout. So, too, were Michael 
Feinstein's whimsical recollections of Cahn parodies, and Cy Coleman's 
composer's view of "Come Dance With Me" and "All My Tomorrows." Saul Chaplin, 
Cahn's first musical collaborator, accompanied Alisa Gyse on "Until the Real 
Thing Comes Along." Other singers included Patty Andrews, Davis Gaines, Ray 
Saar and Valerie Perri. 
</P>
<P>
 Angie Dickinson, Dudley Moore, Morton Gould, Kelly Lange and Charles Nelson 
Reilly provided commentary, and Harper MacKay was the musical director. DON

 OSCAR WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Springsteen, Young Join Lineup: Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young have signed 
on to perform the Oscar-nominated songs they wrote and sang for the movie 
"Philadelphia" on the Academy Awards telecast March 21. Springsteen's "Streets 
of Philadelphia," which opens the AIDS-related drama starring Tom Hanks and 
Denzel Washington, won a Golden Globe Award last month as best original song 
from a movie. Young's ethereal title song closes the film. Producers of the 
Oscar show are still negotiating for live performances by the artists who 
recorded the other best original song nominees: Janet Jackson ("Again" from 
"Poetic Justice"), Harry Connick Jr. ("A Wink and a Smile" from "Sleepless in 
Seattle") and the duo of Dolly Parton and James Ingram ("The Day I Fall in 
Love" from "Beethoven's 2nd").

 Roberts 'Reprimanded': "ABC World News Tonight" correspondent Cokie Roberts 
and executive producer Rick Kaplan were "reprimanded" Monday for making it 
appear as if Roberts were reporting from Capitol Hill on Jan. 26 when in fact 
she was broadcasting from a nearby studio with a projection of the Capitol 
behind her. Roberts, a respected Washington journalist who recently received a 
lucrative new four-year contract from ABC News, on Monday said only that she 
had "made a mistake," but a memo from ABC News Vice President Richard Wald said 
the ruse was "serious because it misled our audience." The decision came about 
when Kaplan wanted Roberts to report live from Capitol Hill about reaction to 
President Clinton's State of the Union Address the night before. But Roberts 
apparently didn't have time for the location shoot since she was speaking at a 
National Press Foundation dinner later that evening. News executives have 
stressed that "World News Tonight" anchor Jennings was not involved in the 
decision in any way.

 Support for 'Against the Grain': More than 125,000 cards and letters have been 
sent to NBC and the producers of its canceled series "Against the Grain," 
producer Dave Johnson said, many from people who say they normally do not watch 
programming on the major broadcast networks. NBC announced the cancellation of 
the Friday night series about a Texas high school football coach (John Terry) 
and his family last month, but Johnson, who on Tuesday embarked on a media 
campaign to save the show, hopes to prompt the network to try reruns on a 
different night. In case that approach fails, Johnson is shopping his show to 
other networks. POP/ROCK

 Eagles Reunion Getting Closer: The long-discussed Eagles reunion tour moved 
one step closer to reality with sources close to the band saying that trial 
rehearsals for a possible summer concert tour could begin within a week. The 
speculation was boosted when Don Henley, Glenn Frey and Joe Walsh performed 
several Eagles songs together on Sunday in Aspen during a benefit for the 
Grassroots Aspen Experience, an organization that brings underprivileged urban 
children to the ski resort. The group broke up after a history of internal 
feuds in 1981. Giant Records chairman Irving Azoff, the former Eagles manager 
who would oversee a reunion, would not comment on the plans. QUICK TAKES

MOVIE REVIEW; A BITTERSWEET 'COMBINATION PLATTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With humor and poignancy, Tony Chan's "Combination Platter" (Music Hall) pulls 
us into the challenging and uncertain everyday life of an illegal immigrant. 
It's a gritty but warm low-budget film of deceptive simplicity. A first-time 
director, Chan hasn't much sense of rhythm, and sometimes a feeling of 
self-consciousness creeps into routine exchanges between people. These aspects 
of the film matter little, however, in the light of all that Chan accomplishes. 
Few films explore so thoroughly the role of cultural identity in creating 
unconscious racism -- and with such a subtle, light touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan's wistful hero, Robert (Jeff Lau, a formidably low-key actor), is a sort 
of Asian Lyle Lovett, a homely but earnest and likable young man working as a 
waiter in a Chinese restaurant in Flushing, Queens, which has become New York's 
second Chinatown. He works hard and unobtrusively, dutifully sending money to 
his parents in Hong Kong. His main concern is obtaining the all-important green 
card. His sympathetic employer (Thomas K. Hsiung) feels business is too slow 
for him to absorb the tax penalties of sponsoring Robert, and even if he were 
to do so, it would take Robert five years to get his card. Naturally, Robert 
would like to speed up the process, enabling him to bring his parents to 
America, but the only way to accomplish this is to marry an American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 When a glamorous Chinese American woman ups her price from $25,000 to $50,000 
to marry Robert for convenience, he eventually allows his friend Andy (Kenneth 
Lu) to set him up with a white woman, the plain but vivacious Claire (Colleen 
O'Brien). Robert and Claire seem to be a realistic match, but "Combination 
Platter" unexpectedly turns out not to be a contemporary "Marty" after all. 
Chan shows Robert and Claire's relationship to be but a part -- and a 
subsidiary one at that -- of Robert's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the film, in fact, takes place in the restaurant, which gives 
"Combination Platter" its broad perspective. In his choice of key locale, Chan, 
whose parents own the actual restaurant in the film, is able to break through 
the monolithic view whites so often have of Chinese people.  
</P>
<P>
 Within the restaurant's staff there is a language barrier between those 
Chinese who speak only Cantonese and those who speak only Mandarin. Then 
there's the owner's pretty American-born niece Jennie (Ellen Synn), the 
restaurant's cashier, who knows neither dialect -- and eats Chinese food with a 
fork instead of chopsticks; she complains good-naturedly that the "Chinese 
think of me as American, and the Americans think of me as Chinese." (Perhaps 
because it's a view from within, Chan is awfully hard on the restaurant's white 
patrons; didn't Chan's parents ever have any polite or pleasant white patrons?) 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Jennie's unfamiliarity with her ancestral language puts her in a 
situation similar to that of the restaurant's only white employee (Colin 
Mitchell), who's razzed by his friends for working in a Chinese restaurant in 
the first place. All these observations, which are alternately played comically 
and seriously, provide a crucial, invaluable context for Robert's revealing 
remark about his feelings for Claire: "If only she weren't American. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 At once Chan is able to create suspense -- will the relationship go anywhere? 
Will Claire be hurt? -- and to suggest how those so often the targets of racism 
can be susceptible to it themselves, albeit innocently. And in dealing with the 
plight of the illegal immigrant, Peter Weir's "Green Card" was a delightful 
romantic comedy but in comparison, "Combination Platter" comes across as the 
genuine article.

MOVIE REVIEW; GRAND 'FIORILE' ENCHANTS DESPITE LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's "Fiorile" (AMC Fine Arts) is as passionate, 
lyrical and ravishingly beautiful as any film they have ever made. It has 
moments of pure enchantment, of exquisitely expressed emotion, and it is often 
fairly absorbing, although drawn-out. It is also faintly silly, as grand 
romantic sagas can so easily seem, and it doesn't travel as well as such 
Taviani masterpieces as "Padre Padrone" and "The Night of the Shooting Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 As a tale of misbegotten gold that has cursed a family for two centuries, it 
is the kind of highly emotional material that might have made a great silent 
film -- by Italy's own Giovanni Pastrone ("Cabiria," 1913), for example, or 
even by Cecil B. De Mille. In any event, the Tavianis have brought to the 
screen a legend handed down over the generations in their native Tuscany, which 
provides the gorgeous settings for their film. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi Benedetti (Lino Capolicchio), a native Tuscan reared and based in Paris, 
decides to visit his father, Massimo (Renato Carpentieri), whom he hasn't seen 
in more than 10 years, to introduce him to his French wife (Constanze 
Engelbrecht) and their two small children (Athina Cenci, Giovanni Guidelli, 
both remarkable). As they travel through the countryside, Luigi starts telling 
his children the reason why the Benedettis are so often referred to as the 
"Maledettis." 
</P>
<P>
 With the gracefulness that characterizes the entire film, the Tavianis whisk 
us back to the late 18th Century, when Napoleon's soldiers, young men filled 
with idealistic revolutionary fervor, were invading Tuscany. One of them, Jean 
(Michael Vartan), handsome and blond, becomes swept away in a rapturous 
encounter with a pretty peasant girl, Elisabetta Benedetti (Galatea Ranzi), 
whom he nicknames "Fiorile," which is the name for the month of June in the 
Napoleonic calendar.  
</P>
<P>
 While the young couple are making love, Elisabetta's brother Corrado (Claudio 
Bigagli) steals Jean's donkey, which has a trunk strapped to its back. Much to 
his astonishment, Corrado discovers that he has made off with a regimental 
chest crammed with gold coins. When he lets Jean be executed rather than 
returning the stolen treasure, both the fortunes and misfortunes of the 
Benedettis are set in motion, as the Tavianis jump ahead to 1903 and finally to 
World War II for episodes illustrating the persistent curse that plagues the 
Benedettis through the generations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tavianis again reveal a profound grasp of human nature in all its 
sensuality and in its eternal conflict between good and evil, greed and 
generosity. Yet all their warmth, compassion and eloquence cannot disguise the 
fact that the curse exerts itself over the centuries in a decidedly schematic 
manner, an impression heightened by the fact that Bigagli, Ranzi and Vartan 
reappear to portray members of subsequent generations of Benedettis. (It must 
be said that at one point it is impossible to accept Carpentieri and Vartan as 
the same man, in old age and youth, respectively, since they do not resemble 
each other physically in the least.)  
</P>
<P>
 While the Tavianis create a sense of genuine ambiguity in the blurring of 
legend and reality over a vast period of time, they take the working out of a 
seemingly arbitrary fate awfully seriously. When the Benedettis -- none of 
whom, unfortunately, is very interesting -- speak dramatically of their family 
curse, you want to tell them to come off it and take responsibility for their 
own destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Fiorile" seems a bit much, like an overly rich Italian meal topped off 
with spumoni, it certainly has been made, in its leisurely way, with much care 
and artistry. More than anything it makes you wish you could see a really 
first-rate film -- there was a mediocre TV movie version -- on the dire fates 
meted out to the genuinely fascinating array of owners of the legendary Hope 
Diamond.

MUSIC REVIEW; AN UNEVEN CHAMBER CONCERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keeping your fingers crossed probably isn't such a bad idea when attending a 
concert of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Chamber Music Society. One never knows 
quite what to expect.Like supermarket tomatoes, the ad-hoc ensembles can range 
from good-for-nothing to great. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night that inconsistency was clearly exhibited, piece by piece. 
Fortunately, the Society's concert in the University Synagogue in Brentwood 
(substituting for a quake-damaged Gindi Auditorium), featuring music of 
Janacek, Mozart and Schumann, went on an upward curve. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the listener contemplating the wonders of Schumann's Piano Quintet, 
Opus 44, given a vigorous and knowing performance by guest pianist Peter Frankl 
and a crack string quartet of Philharmonic players: Mark Baranov and Suli Xue, 
violins, John Hayhurst, viola, and Barry Gold, cello. 
</P>
<P>
 The excellence of this reading ran from the players' minute involvement in 
dynamics, instrumental balance and moment-to-moment expression to a clear view 
of the grand plan. Tempos, perfectly gauged, settled into poised grooves. 
Frankl, who has recorded this work, seemed to energize his chamber partners and 
vice versa, with predictably engrossing results. 
</P>
<P>
 The same could not be said for the account of Mozart's Quintet for Piano and 
Winds, K. 452, where the musicians sounded as if they were on different plains, 
pianist Frankl all spirited inflection and intelligent nuance, the Philharmonic 
winds, apparently oblivious to his urgings, clocking in with a sort of generic 
lyricism and full tone. The thing, though solid, fairly plodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Which one would have gladly settled for in Janacek's folksy Suite for Strings 
(his earliest surviving work), which opened the program in a strikingly 
disheveled run-through. Someone should have stepped in and stopped the 
struggle. TIMOTHY MANGAN

TV REVIEW; A LOOK AT THE VITAL LIFE, ART OF CABALLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A diva in full sail" is host Melvyn Bragg's characterization of soprano 
Montserrat Caballe, subject of a "South Bank" show on Bravo cable tonight at 
6:30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spanish singer, who will be 61 in April, may not consistently live up to 
that description these days, but during this hourlong profile she does sing 
beautifully for a few minutes in a recent taped London performance of Rossini's 
"Il Viaggio a Reims." 
</P>
<P>
 The singing itself proves the most engaging feature of this presentation. In 
medium-length excerpts of operatic arias and duets and art-songs by Bellini, 
Richard Strauss, Mompou, Serrano and Turina (among others), the scope of 
Caballe's gifts and achievement over a four-decade career is indicated and 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly revelatory are a portion of "Casta diva," from "Norma" (filmed in 
Orange, France, in 1974), the very end of "Salome" and the Spanish-Catalan 
songs, the last performed specifically for this show in a private recital in 
London, with pianist Manuel Burgueras. Caballe is also shown in rehearsal, and 
while teaching; she reminisces, for the camera, briefly, and later visits her 
ranch outside Barcelona. In a gimmicky, eerie, yet impressive closer to the 
show, she sings an aria from Donizetti's "Anna Bolena" in the Tower of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkled through these glimpses of the diva's life and career are 
testimonials from four of the soprano's colleagues: tenors Placido Domingo and 
Jose Carreras, the retired Dame Joan Sutherland and American soprano Cheryl 
Studer. 
</P>
<P>
 Their comments are full of praise for Caballe the artist, but also indicate 
her human side. Sutherland, for instance, tells about the time Caballe played 
hooky from opera rehearsals in Chicago to visit her husband, tenor Bernabe 
Marti, then appearing in "Norma" with Sutherland, in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Also shown is the duet video Caballe made with her "new friend" (in 1987), the 
late rock singer Freddie Mercury.

TV RATINGS; OLYMPIC GAMES HELP CBS TAKE THE GOLD

 With record ratings for the first weekend of its Winter Olympics coverage, CBS 
soared to a gold medal in the prime-time ratings last week. Figures released 
Tuesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed CBS winning by its largest margin of the 
season, 3.8 points ahead of runner-up ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' coverage of the opening ceremonies on Saturday ranked No. 7 among the 
week's 85 prime-time network programs, while the first full day of competition 
on Sunday was No. 1, attracting viewers in nearly 28 million homes. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was more Olympics fallout for CBS as "Eye to Eye With Connie Chung" 
racked up its biggest ratings ever to place 11th with an interview with figure 
skater Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, meanwhile, said it got best-ever ratings for "Coach" and "NYPD Blue" last 
week. But its animated series "The Critic" lost another bunch of viewers in its 
third outing, attracting only 67% of the audience that had tuned in for the 
first installment. Southland Ratings

 * It's about time Los Angeles addressed the plight of foster kids who 
"graduate" from the foster care system ("Homelessness Antidote for Foster 
Kids," editorial, Jan. 31). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, our streets are crowded with homeless kids.Some of them 
"graduated" or left the foster care system, others fled abusive and dangerous 
home lives. Most kids do not have the wherewithal at 18 to make it on their 
own. We must help them help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its reputation for earthquakes, fires and mudslides, California 
holds the distinction of being the destination of choice for 25% of America's 
homeless children. Through public and private efforts, we can ensure this 
generation of children will have a chance at achieving the American dream.

 * So now the county is going to attempt to provide jobs for foster care 
"graduates." Wouldn't it be better to help get them adopted whenever possible 
before they reach 18? After 10 years of trying unsuccessfully to adopt an older 
child from Los Angeles County, we finally went out of state and, in less than 
two months adopted a 9-year-old boy. Furthermore, we were told we could have 
others.

TECHNOLOGICAL ORDER IN THE COURT; EARTHQUAKE MOVES LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT 
TO FURTHER INNOVATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the dust settles from the Northridge earthquake, a number of farsighted 
public officials, business leaders and ordinary citizens are looking around 
themselves and imagining new and better ways to do what they have done before. 
Leaders of the Los Angeles County Superior Court are among the visionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of that court's far-flung facilities were damaged severely in the Jan. 
17 quake. The San Fernando courthouse was closed for 10 days and the files at 
other courthouses, including one in Santa Monica, were inaccessible. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the quake the superior court -- the trial court of general 
jurisdiction for the county -- was struggling under a mammoth caseload. About 
301,000 cases were filed in the court's 12 branch courthouses in 1992, the last 
year for which data is available. 
</P>
<P>
 With new case management procedures in recent years, the court made strides, 
reducing delay particularly in the disposition of civil cases. However, the 
lack of state-of-the-art communications technology clearly hampers the effort. 
The court's enormous size and vast geographic reach have made the cost of 
comprehensive automation prohibitively high, leaving Los Angeles behind other 
California courts in some ways. For example, entries to the register of action, 
the master record of case activity, still must be made manually at the Central 
Division downtown.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has provided the impetus to move court technology into the 21st 
Century. When officials from the U.S. attorney general's office called 
Presiding Judge Robert M. Mallano after the quake to ask what help the court 
needed to ensure public access, he had an answer: $10 million in federal aid 
for updated computer software and document imaging capabilities to permit any 
file to be accessed at any courthouse in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The court already has taken other steps to help litigants and lawyers. Several 
branches now accept civil, probate and family law filings for any one of the 
branches, and litigants can now file lawsuits by fax in all branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Some good ideas are on the docket. We hope the court's wishes prevail.

COOLING OFF A WITCH HUNT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayors of Orange County's two largest cities have fashioned a pragmatic 
compromise that will keep a county representative on the board of the powerful 
South Coast Air Quality Management District. That's helpful to Orange County, 
and to the whole region. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly and Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. Young say that they have 
been consistent critics of Henry W. Wedaa because in their view he has been 
anti-business in his seven years at the AQMD, the last two as chairman. That's 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the mayors won't be appeased and propose that seven members from city 
councils throughout the county be chosen later to form an Air Quality Steering 
Committee to reach consensus positions. Those positions will be binding on 
Wedaa, who, under the agreement, is expected to serve out his term's final 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the accord, which Wedaa accepts, Orange County on March 1 would have 
lost its representative on the four-county AQMD board, which also represents 
L.A., Riverside and San Diego counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa has bruised some feelings over the years. But he also worked to get AQMD 
bureaucrats to show sensitivity in enforcing regulations and was instrumental 
in forming a commission to examine the impact of agency regulations -- like 
those mandating car-pool plans -- on job losses in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight by those more conservative than Wedaa to dump the moderate 
Republican has lasted too long and taken up too much of the energy of the 
county chapter of the League of Cities, which appoints the county's AQMD 
representative. 
</P>
<P>
 The witch hunt falsely labeled Wedaa as anti-business and hurt Orange County 
by diverting his attention from the important matters the agency handles. The 
compromise keeps Orange County's voice before the AQMD, but if the new 
committee hamstrings whoever succeeds Wedaa it will do nobody any good. A 
representative needs latitude when dealing with the AQMD and should not be 
expected to check in with seven individuals before every vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD will never win popularity contests among business people through 
car-pooling requirements and other rules of that sort. But the agency has a 
tough job figuring out how to clean up the region's foul air, and when its 
programs make sense it deserves its board's full support.

THE WAR THAT HAS NO WINNERS; HOW TO AVOID A WINGDING TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The truism to keep in mind as the United States and Japan square off in their 
latest crisis over export and import policies is that trade wars have no 
winners. A trade war is a mutually destructive game of economic chicken. 
Consumers are always the biggest losers because trade sanctions, like 
protectionism, invariably lead to higher prices. For that reason if for no 
other, Washington must move prudently in this confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other truths need repeating. The first is that Japan clearly restricts 
access to certain key markets, including in greater or lesser degree the four 
-- autos and auto parts, medical technology, telecommunications and insurance 
-- on which the United States last week failed to win market-opening 
concessions. The second is that even if Tokyo were to lift all the barriers to 
market access it now imposes, America's trade deficit with Japan would shrink 
by only 20% to 30%. Those are Clinton Administration figures. What they 
underscore is that, however Japan may rig the rules of the trade game, the 
biggest reason for the U.S. deficit now as in years past is that Americans 
simply continue to spend too much and save too little, to consume much more 
than they produce. The difference is made up with imports, with Japan -- 
because of the quality and sometimes price of many of its products -- a 
preferred supplier. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why it's absurd to look to Japan to unilaterally right the trade 
imbalance. At the same time it's proper to ask -- to insist -- that Japan live 
up to its earlier market-opening agreements while moving to ease other unfair 
restraints, such as those in the four areas noted. The Motorola cellular phone 
case is an example of how an earlier market-opening agreement, this one dating 
to 1989, was not kept. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, in a move that was coincidental with 
but is now inescapably linked with the market-opening talks that failed last 
Friday, has found that Japan has not kept its bargain to allow Motorola Inc., a 
recognized world leader in cellular technology, one-third to one-half of the 
cellular phone business in the lucrative Tokyo area. Undisclosed sanctions are 
likely to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the Motorola finding a warning shot, an earnest of U.S. intentions, 
with other steps -- ranging from complaints before the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade to a big boost in tariffs on Japanese minivans and 
sport-utility vehicles -- being threatened. But consider also the self-wounding 
effects that indiscriminate sanctions can have. The delicate task facing the 
Clinton Administration is to keep up legitimate market-opening pressures on 
Japan while avoiding the more extreme and ultimately debilitating measures that 
some domestic pressure groups are calling for in their self-interests.

VIETNAM TRADE EMBARGO ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "Wrong Time, Wrong Man to Lift the Embargo," by Susan 
Carpenter McMillan, Column Right, Feb. 8, about POW/MIAs: 
</P>
<P>
 McMillan included a quote by me about my father, Maj. Albro L. Lundy Jr., 
POW/MIA, Laos, Dec. 24, 1970. Unfortunately a typographical error made the last 
paragraph, which was clearly the author's opinion, appear to be my words. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish to correct the record and state my personal opinion. Whatever other 
motives President Clinton had in lifting the trade embargo against Vietnam, his 
actions prove that he held commercial and political interests above those of 
the servicemen and their families, contrary to his publicly stated position. 
His hollow reasoning that trading with Vietnam would further the POW/MIA cause 
is belied by the fact that at least 80 men were left as last known alive in 
Vietnam, according to Henry Kissinger, as well as another 350 in Laos, 
according to Lawrence Eagleburger. The Vietnamese now, and in the past, refuse 
to return or even account for these men. At the very least, these men last 
known alive should have been returned, or had their cases credibly resolved 
prior to lifting the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The POW/MIA situation is a microcosm of the war in Vietnam -- which was a lie 
from beginning to end. The conflict, fueled by corporate interests, was the 
external manifestation of the corruption that evolves in and revolves around 
Washington to this day.

 * How many American soldiers turned up missing out of how many who served 
combat duty in the American Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War? How 
many actually served abroad in Cuba, the Philippines and France (two wars) and 
how many are still missing? Of our younger family members, two went to Vietnam. 
One (his father was shot down and killed over Korea after flying in World War 
II) came back unwounded; we went to a West Point funeral for the other. Clinton 
was (is) correct that we never should have gotten suckered into fighting for 
French interests, even after France had given up. McMillan has so bludgeoned 
and belabored the point that I am now about to declare peace.

 * McMillan's column criticizing President Clinton's lifting the embargo 
against Vietnam uses two very tired and fallacious arguments. One, Clinton is a 
draft dodger. Excuse me, but didn't he use the rules made by the White House 
and Congress at the time? Those rules were available to everyone, and he didn't 
make them. Two, Clinton demonstrated on foreign soil against his country. Does 
McMillan mean that our constitutional rights end at our borders? Whether you 
agree with Clinton's anti-Vietnam War position or not, we all have a 
constitutional right to address our government.

 * I applaud President Clinton's normalization of trade with Vietnam. Certainly 
as an American presence in that country develops we should have a far better 
chance of ascertaining the status of the remaining POW/MIAs. And certainly if 
they develop a trade dependency on us, we can monitor and mitigate civil rights 
violations in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 I do wonder if it means it is necessary for a country to have to fight us to 
get normal trade relations -- what about Burma and Cambodia?

national organization, Sons and Daughters in Touch, I was surprised to hear of 
the return of 12 sets of remains four days after the U.S.-Vietnam trade embargo 
was lifted (Feb. 8). I applaud the healing motion of lifting the embargo. I 
feel that because the media made so little of the return of the remains, 
another opportunity for the healing of this nation's sorrow over Vietnam was 
lost. Let's please give any subsequent homecomings the respect and media 
attention those heroes deserve. After all, even Achilles showed respect for 
Hector by eating a ceremonial burial feast with Priam, Hector's mourning 
father.

FOOD STAMP FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * "Fraud by County Quake Aid Workers Probed" (Feb. 5) gives the impression 
that welfare workers are conspiring to pocket food stamps and other emergency 
funds meant for earthquake victims. As general manager of the union 
representing more than 40,000 county workers, I feel obligated to set the 
record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest relief effort ever administered within the United States wouldn't 
have stood a chance of success if not for the dedication of more than 5,000 
employees of the Department of Public Social Services. More than 1,600 DPSS 
workers have processed about 175,000 "emergency" applications for food stamps 
by working 12-hour shifts, outdoors, on weekends, through darkness, aftershocks 
and rain. Meanwhile, thousands of other eligibility workers continue to serve 
the "normal" victims of the recession, coping with their own caseloads and 
picking up the slack for absent volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the anonymous fraud charges, half of the 40 accused workers 
were cleared of any wrongdoing. Most likely, the others will also be cleared. 
But even if all 20 were eventually found guilty, they would represent fewer 
than half a percent of all DPSS employees. That is squeaky clean compared to 
bankers, lawyers, stockbrokers and others accused of white-collar crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of DPSS employees were also victims of the Jan. 17 quake. Many are 
single parents subsisting just above the poverty line. They deserve emergency 
assistance as much as any other county resident, yet management has blocked 
their claims. As a result, many dubious "victims" were given immediate relief, 
while families of the people who distribute the food stamps are going hungry.

 * Regarding your article of Feb. 7 on the abuse of the food stamp program: I 
found it interesting that the state of Maryland is using a "food debit card," 
called the Independence card. Shouldn't it rather be titled the "Dependence" 
card? Since when does living on welfare and receiving food stamps from the 
government give anyone independence?  
</P>
<P>
 I also found it interesting that "in response to public outcry" action is now 
being taken to catch the food stamp abusers and assure the public that their 
tax dollars will no longer be wasted on food stamps. Shouldn't the article have 
read, "and government officials responsible for this mess are now covering 
their rear ends"? Further, if it hadn't been for the big, bad earthquake, none 
of these "officials" would be in the hot seat in the first place.

SAN ONOFRE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am puzzled by your reporter's assertion that the nuclear energy industry 
is concerned that a victory for the plaintiff in a suit against owners of the 
San Onofre nuclear plant would lead to "an avalanche" of similar suits against 
other utilities (Feb. 9). As far as I can tell, no one in the industry supports 
that view. 
</P>
<P>
 Rung C. Tang's suit against San Onofre is not the first time a worker has 
claimed radiation-related damages, and regardless of the outcome of her second 
trial, we don't expect it will be the last such litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 What we in the industry have said is this: The strict safety precautions 
nuclear plants take against worker exposure to radiation are based on good 
science and good medicine. They protect our workers and keep exposure levels 
well below government standards -- on average, at about a third of the exposure 
an airline crew would receive after a year of flights between New York and 
Tokyo.

TOUGH ON CRIME, MURKY ON GENOCIDE; BOSNIA: THE LACK OF U.S. LEADERSHIP IS 
INCOMPREHENSIBLE; HOW MANY 'STRIKES' WILL CLINTON GIVE BEFORE THE SERBS ARE 
'OUT'? 
</P>

By ANNA HUSARSKA, Anna Husarska, a Polish journalist, is a New Yorker magazine 
staff writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps it is because I come from a country that benefited from so much 
international solidarity when our Solidarity movement was in trouble that I'm 
puzzled by the lack of support for the Bosnians. After all, our fight was 
merely for freedom and democracy; the Bosnians' fight is for life as well. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask myself why there is no mobilization of public opinion, why 
demonstrations in U.S. cities draw so few people to the streets, why there are 
no 800 numbers on TV networks indicating where blood donations and monetary 
contributions should go, why American hospitals do not rush with offers of free 
treatment for the wounded, why there is no plan for accepting Bosnian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that Americans are capable of showing compassion, so I am surprised at 
their passivity this time. Yes, it was easier to show solidarity with Poles who 
fought by nonviolent means, but Polish communism was relatively nonviolent, too 
(the death toll for the whole period of martial law was roughly equal to the 
daily toll in Sarajevo). Yes, the struggle between communism and democracy in 
Poland was easier to understand; but in Bosnia the choice is between a secular, 
multiethnic and multicultural state on the one side and an ethnically cleansed 
and mentally brainwashed totalitarian dictatorship on the other. The choice 
should be equally easy. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the American people are constantly misinformed, they see the issue 
as muddy. It is not the facts that are murky -- the media have done an 
excellent job in providing daily news from this hell -- it is the U.S. 
government's interpretation. Perhaps this is done on purpose? Perhaps it is 
meant to be muddy? 
</P>
<P>
 Why otherwise would the Administration continue to describe aggressors and 
victims alike as "warring sides" (recently the words civil war were introduced 
by the White House). Sadly, President Clinton, instead of correcting this 
misinterpretation, adds offense to injury. "Until those folks get tired of 
killing each other over there, bad things will continue to happen," he declared 
after the slaughter in Sarajevo's market. I guess if President Clinton had been 
around during the 1943 uprising in the Warsaw ghetto, he would also have called 
it "those folks out there killing each other" (some Jewish combatants, though 
crudely and sparsely armed, managed to inflict casualties on the Nazis). How 
would he describe the brief armed rebellion in the Treblinka concentration 
camp? 
</P>
<P>
 But President Clinton does know how to be tough. He has, for instance, 
supported a stern domestic stance against crime. But isn't genocide a crime? Is 
it merely a "bad thing"? He declared war on repeat felony offenders with "three 
strikes and you're out." How many strikes does he give the Bosnian Serbs and 
their recidivist leader, Radovan Karadzic? 
</P>
<P>
 True, there is not overwhelming public support for action in Bosnia. A CNN/USA 
Today poll conducted after the Sarajevo marketplace carnage shows 48% of 
Americans favoring air strikes and 43% opposing them. But considering that the 
Clinton Administration's main policy on Bosnia is to keep it out of the 
headlines as long as possible, 48% is a surprisingly high level of support. 
Bosnia was mentioned only once, in passing, in the State of the Union address; 
Clinton chose not to quote from any letter he got about the atrocities; he did 
not invite the editor of the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje (who was in Washington 
that day) to sit in the gallery, although that newspaper is certainly a perfect 
example of nonviolent resistance. The mortar attack on the market, which took 
68 lives, was downgraded in State Department descriptions from the worst 
atrocity of the war to "no more horrible or less horrible" than other attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of trying to galvanize public support for a tough stance, the 
President is desperately looking for excuses to do nothing. All forms of 
inaction have been tried, but action has not. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this time it will be. According to the same opinion poll, 65% of 
Americans would support Clinton if he did use air strikes. By acting, by 
keeping his word, he would also save some of his credibility abroad. It may 
come in handy when confronting other warlords and naughty boys of this world. 
North Korea's Kim Il Sung, Haiti's Raoul Cedras, Russia's Vladimir Zhirinovsky, 
Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Somalia's Mohammed Farah Aidid can all sit in front 
of their televisions and watch, live, President Clinton's handling of the 
Serbian warlord. So far, they've sighed with relief and proceeded with their 
plans. My own Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski watches too, wishing he had had it so 
easy.

 The present legalistic web was not spun by a single spider. It evolved by 
courts, legislatures and agencies writing regulations without regard to how 
schools would implement them. Piecemeal reforms try to make things better but 
often don't. The major reform legislation of the 1980s, Senate Bill 813, 
contained many good ideas -- mentor teachers, longer school days, grants for 
teacher innovation -- but it re-examined none of the basic structures of 
schooling and added 213 pages to the statute books. The result of this layering 
of good intentions is a "rule mindedness" that diverts educators' attention 
from teaching and learning. As one principal lamented, "My job is to enforce 
the rules; it has nothing to do with educating anyone." The web of rules 
creates an overemphasis on mandates and compliance and a great underemphasis on 
incentives and investments needed to build the capacity of California's 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the state that virtually created the information technology 
industry makes practically no investment in spreading its use in schools. 
Classrooms with phone lines are rare, much less classrooms with computers 
connected to external data sources. However, without substantial restructuring 
of how schools operate, we will never be able to redirect sufficient resources 
to make long-term investments that change the way people learn. 
</P>
<P>
 The current emphasis on rules and mandates creates a fiscal structure whose 
major incentive is to warehouse children. Schools are paid for getting students 
to show up. There is no incentive for good teaching and very few incentives for 
active learning. Some categorical programs actually penalize schools when 
achievement increases. Increases in productivity -- learning faster -- are not 
rewarded either. 
</P>
<P>
 Rule-boundedness has also made California education highly litigious and 
costly to administer. A recent study estimates that there have been more 
appellate and Supreme Court decisions regarding public education in the last 20 
years than in the previous 80. The work of school superintendents increasingly 
involves responding to lawsuits and trying to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
 If the legislators and educators assembled at this week's summit want real 
reform, let them look first at the statutes they and their forebears have 
enacted. Let them create a tough bipartisan commission of educators, 
legislators and civic leaders with a clear mandate to redesign schools with the 
child's mind at the center and with as few rules as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Let them inquire deeply into how money flows through the system and how much 
or little makes it into regular classrooms. Ask them to think about how schools 
and other social services can be integrated without creating crushing paperwork 
burdens. Require them to confront the possibility of substantial productivity 
gains by changing how precious human resources can be combined with new 
technologies. Demand that they examine the custody-based financial system and 
rethink the role of school boards, which have lost most of their traditional 
fiscal function. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging all the existing rules at once has a better chance than changing 
them piecemeal. Every small change brings forward an interest group whose tiny 
specialty is protected by that statute. Putting the entire system of education 
up for reconsideration brings forward the best chance for a combination of 
mutual gain and civil virtue.

THE MILLIONAIRES CLUB IS OFF AND RUNNING; POLITICS: WE'D BE BETTER OFF IF HALF 
OUR STATEWIDE OFFICES WERE APPOINTED RATHER THAN ELECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHERINE O'NEILL, Catherine O'Neill of Los Angeles is co-founder of the 
Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children. She was a candidate for 
secretary of state in 1974.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year will see the largest change in statewide officeholders since the 
1974 election that swept Jerry Brown and a raft of new faces to Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen people are considered serious candidates for the seven 
offices below the level of governor that will be on the June primary ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 While the candidates differ in many ways, coming from backgrounds that are 
humble and wealthy; of heritages that are Asian, African, Latino and European, 
and from professions ranging from dairy farmer to investment banker to 
professional politician, they all have one thing in common. Between now and 
June 7, they will have to think a lot about money. 
</P>
<P>
 They will spend most waking moments trying to raise the minimum $1 million 
said to be necessary to run a credible statewide campaign in California. They 
will use the money trying to get the attention of millions of voters who will 
have almost no other way of finding out who they are and what they think.  
</P>
<P>
 This is the first statewide election in which the reality of term limits 
ending a legislative career is a factor in deciding to run statewide. 
Candidates no longer have to trade off the danger of losing a "safe seat" to 
take a risk and run statewide. They are losing their seats anyway, so 11 -- 
almost 10% of the Legislature -- are running for statewide office.  
</P>
<P>
 Controller Gray Davis, who made his first statewide quest in 1974 with a run 
for treasurer, now wants to be lieutenant governor. In the minds of many, Davis 
served as "shadow" governor during his long tenure as Jerry Brown's chief of 
staff. Davis has spent 20 years courting major Democratic givers and has 
already stockpiled $1.8 million. This has driven potential opponents out of the 
Democratic field. 
</P>
<P>
 That opens up controller, and there are several candidates in both parties who 
want that office. Political strategists think that Bel-Air businesswoman and 
former Ross Perot enthusiast Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, might be hard to 
beat because she has said that she is prepared to put $1 million of her own 
into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 John Morris, a Republican candidate for controller, is a Los Angeles 
businessman and son of the founder of Mervyn's store chain. He is reported to 
be contributing $500,000 to his campaign -- enough money to get everyone else 
to take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The two join a list of millionaires who self-finance the bulk of their 
campaigns, including Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara), running for the 
U.S. Senate, and state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), running for governor.  
</P>
<P>
 What is all this effort for anyway? Three of the statewide offices -- 
secretary of state, treasurer and controller -- are essentially administrative 
functions. They should not be elected positions but appointments of the 
governor. The main things that would be lost are the steppingstone function of 
the jobs for those with higher aspirations and the parking-place aspect to keep 
legislators we are trying to send home on the Sacramento payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million money scramble would thus be somewhat diminished, and taxpayers 
might save a little money by doing away with some of the paid staff that go 
with the offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The positions of lieutenant governor and attorney general, which carry clear 
policy duties, should continue to be elected.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the two nonpartisan statewide offices, the post of insurance commissioner 
should remain elective -- California's unresolved insurance issues would 
benefit from high-visibility scrutiny. But the superintendent of public 
instruction should be appointed by the governor. The President appoints the 
secretary of education and takes responsibility for education standards 
nationwide. Here in California, we allocate more than 50% of the state budget 
to education. With the dire need for reform, the governor should not be able to 
sidestep the issue. Also, making the superintendent appointed might reduce the 
influence of teachers' unions and result in more school innovation.  
</P>
<P>
 This is all wishful thinking for the next go-round. This year, the starting 
bell has rung. Political junkies are evaluating the field; consultants and 
pollsters are trying to get hired by the candidates who will have the most 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 If history is a guide, the June winners will be those who are personally the 
wealthiest or who have been the most successful in pleasing big-money lobbyists 
or individual donors. Not a good way to pick the future leadership of the 
biggest, most important state in our land.

'FULL MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN'; THE ECHOES OF A CLASSIC POEM 
ABOUT THE DEMOCRACY OF DEATH STILL RESONATE IN OUR LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENIJOY La BELLE, Jenijoy La Belle is a professor of literature at Caltech 
and author of books and articles on poets and their traditions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Feb. 16, 1751, the English poet Thomas Gray published "Elegy Written in a 
Country Churchyard." You may wonder why I mention this anniversary, especially 
if you've never heard of Gray or his poem. Maybe you figure it's the sort of 
thing only crotchety old literature professors remember.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet the Elegy was once the most popular poem in the English language. Not only 
was it a triumph in its own time, but for 200 years it continued to be admired 
and loved. Throughout the English-speaking world, it was known as "our poem of 
poems." 
</P>
<P>
 The poem seemed to speak eloquently to many occasions. Samuel Johnson said it 
abounded "with images which find a mirror in every mind," with sentiments that 
each reader "persuades himself he has always felt." A century later, Alfred 
Lord Tennyson praised its "divine truisms that make us weep." Before fighting 
the decisive Battle of Quebec in 1759, British Gen. James Wolfe recited Gray's 
Elegy to his officers.  
</P>
<P>
 The poem begins with a meditative mood, as the poet wanders at dusk through a 
churchyard cemetery. He finds there the democracy of death. The rich and the 
poor, the celebrated and the obscure, share the same fate. Gray concludes that 
class distinctions among the living are of little importance in the greater 
scheme of things. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray's masterpiece has been imitated and illustrated, parodied and 
paraphrased, analyzed and anthologized. It has been translated into Armenian, 
Hebrew, Icelandic and Japanese. Generations of schoolchildren learned stanzas 
by heart. People quoted from it as they lay dying. 
</P>
<P>
 How is it that a poem once so famous is almost forgotten? Why is Gray's Elegy 
as neglected as those neglected graves about which he wrote so poignantly? 
</P>
<P>
 I could suggest that poetry in general is no longer popular. But that's not 
quite true. Millions listen to song and rap lyrics, although they might stop if 
they thought of them as poetry. Perhaps we don't read the Elegy because it is 
stately and slow-paced. Its calm, melancholic tone must seem alien to those 
addicted to MTV, Sega Genesis, THX sound.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's the language that is off-putting. Gray created a heightened diction 
based in part on classical poetry. Today, formality and artifice strike many as 
insincere, as though something that's not colloquial is necessarily suspect. 
We're still suffering under an ersatz Romanticism that gives value to the 
spontaneous and devalues the polished and restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I don't think language is the whole answer. After all, there are phrases 
from Gray's poem that are part of our common vocabulary -- even if they have 
drifted from their moorings and we know them only out of context. There are 
many "gems of purest ray serene" that, half unseen, still sparkle on the 
stretched forefinger of Time. When Thomas Hardy called his novel "Far From the 
Madding Crowd," he was sure that his audience would hear the echo of Gray's 
line, "far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife." To some, "paths of glory" 
may be just a cliche or the title of Stanley Kubrick's superb 1957 film 
(starring Kirk Douglas) about World War I. It was, however, Gray who wrote, 
"The paths of glory lead but to the grave." If you don't know the full line, 
you miss the point of Kubrick's title. The words and even the rhythms of this 
remarkable poem resonated through the minds of 20th-Century poets T.S. Eliot, 
Theodore Roethke and Philip Larkin as they pursued their own elegiac journeys. 
If we forget the Elegy, we also drain meaning from the works influenced by it. 
Allusion cannot function in a culture that has no memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray himself was inclined to attribute the success of his poem to its subject. 
Maybe we can trace its current lack of success to the same source. The Elegy is 
about death and how individuals and societies both must come to terms with the 
"inevitable hour." Our society often tries to ignore, or sweep into an 
anonymous corner, what Gray embraced as part of everyday life. Those buried in 
Gray's churchyard have been forgotten. We too run risks when we forget the dead 
-- and perhaps even when we let old poems die.

THEATER REVIEW; IRVINE'S 'PLAYBOY' GETS ITS IRISH LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When John Millington Synge's "The Playboy of the Western World" opened in 
Dublin in the early part of this century, there were riots. It was politically 
incorrect. Its subjects were what were then known as "stage Irish," besotted 
ne'er-do-wells with a rollicking sense of humor, an inflated pride in their 
depravity and a tricky glint in their eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The play is still politically incorrect, and that is exactly Synge's point, 
and his joke: Tell the truth and bedamned to the divvil. The point is mostly 
missed in director Lee Clark's staging at the Irvine Community Theater. Clark 
sees the habitues of Michael James Flaherty's "shebeen" (or grungy local pub) 
as nice people, and the joke is up. 
</P>
<P>
 The limited production capabilities aren't the problem. The group has done 
better productions with less dressing. Clark even has three actors who are 
almost on to the humor and style of Synge's writing, and they certainly get 
their laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of them are central to the action. Sarah Lang is Michael James' daughter, 
Pegeen Mike, and she's right on target throughout: feisty, verging on crude, 
volatile and desperate for a strong man to sweep her away. She knows the trick 
of Irish comedy and revels in it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the titular hero, or at least he begins to think himself as such, Jared 
Slater is a charmer of a Christy Mahon, the lad who thinks he's murdered his da 
and accepts the glory for the act from the locals, including Pegeen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Synge is probably still chuckling in his casket over this portrait of the 
Irish love of a good yarn, and Christy's is a good one. The only thing missing 
from Slater's performance is that sense of self-aggrandizement. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not until halfway through the action that he seems to realize that 
Christy is a cluck who lucked out, a blarney-born spinner of his own fame. When 
the gag dawns on Slater, he's excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 The third actor is Kevin O'Loane as Shawn Keogh, Pegeen's jellyfish of a 
suitor. O'Loane capers about his true love like a loony spaniel, and his 
performance has the right flavor and tone. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the cast members are at a complete loss. Jim Holway and Floyd G. 
Phillips, as Michael James' two drunken friends, appear to be a couple of 
blue-collar workers from Long Beach, with accents to match, and Tracy Godfrey 
as Michael James, Pegeen's disreputable rum-pot of a father, looks more like 
the president of the local country club. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters who play the local girls seem better suited to "Anne of Green 
Gables," and Arthur Wilson as Christy's animalistic, illiterate father acts and 
sounds as though he's playing King Lear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robin J. Hand is a better actress than she appears in the role of the Widow 
Quinn, a randy, aggressive type set on getting gullible, pretty Christy's 
trousers off, and who turns conniving when she's foiled. Hand tries hard, 
straddling chairs and waving a riding crop, but in her effort to make the Widow 
likable, the effect is more like Doris Day playing Lady Macbeth.

* WILBUR (BILL) HANSON; EDUCATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilbur Hale (Bill) Hanson, a teacher who spent more than three decades 
educating San Fernando Valley children and a founder of the West Valley YMCA, 
has died at his Tarzana home. He was 76. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tarzana resident for more than 40 years, Hanson died Saturday in his sleep 
after several months of declining health, said his son, film director Curtis 
Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Chicago, Hanson traveled with his family to California as a child to 
escape a flu epidemic. He attended Hollywood High School and Chapman College, 
graduating with a degree in fine arts in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1941, he joined the faculty of Harvard School for Boys in Studio City as 
the school's basketball coach. He later returned to college for his teaching 
credential and began his career as an educator at Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson transferred to the Los Angeles City School System in 1948, teaching at 
Reseda and Wilbur Avenue elementary schools during the 1950s and early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, he co-founded the West Valley branch of the YMCA, after hosting what 
became the West Valley's first Y clubs in his back yard for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to Portola Junior High School in Tarzana when it opened in 1967 and 
remained there for the rest of his teaching career. He was described as an 
"extraordinary teacher" by his son, who was a pupil in Hanson's 1957 
sixth-grade class at Reseda Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question was always, what do you call him? You don't raise your hand and 
say 'Dad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During his tenure at Portola, Hanson and his wife organized summer trips with 
his students to such far-flung locales as Greece, India and the former Soviet 
Union, travels his son described as a "living civics lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his retirement in 1977, Hanson was asked by a reporter how teachers could 
improve relations with their students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen to 'em!" he said. "Expect them to learn something. Expect them to 
study and to work hard, but also listen to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Curtis, Hanson is survived by his wife of 53 years, 
Beverly June Hanson, and son John Hanson of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 A funeral will be held at 1 p.m. today at Pierce Brothers Mortuary, 5959 Santa 
Monica Blvd., Hollywood. A graveside service will follow at Hollywood Park 
Memorial Cemetery, 6000 Santa Monica Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to a summer camp fund 
for underprivileged children in Hanson's name at the West Valley YMCA, 18810 
Vanowen St., Reseda 91335.

DOWN BY 31, KENTUCKY RALLIES, WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino knew it was the best comeback he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was even better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitino's 11th-ranked Wildcats pulled off the greatest comeback in college 
history, rallying from a 31-point deficit Tuesday night to beat Louisiana 
State, 99-95. 
</P>
<P>
 That broke a record set on Dec. 30, 1950, when Duke rallied from a 56-27 
halftime deficit to beat Tulane, 74-72. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter McCarty hit a three-pointer with 19 seconds to play and gave the 
Wildcats a 96-95 lead, their first since 1-0. McCarty had 23 points for 
Kentucky (19-5, 8-3 Southeastern Conference), which had lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Ronnie Henderson scored 36 points and Clarence Ceasar added 32 for 
the Tigers (11-10, 5-7). 
</P>
<P>
 LSU missed 11 free throws in the last 12 minutes (13 for 24) while Kentucky 
shot almost nothing but three-pointers, sinking 12 of 23 in the second half to 
rally from a 68-37 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it went to 30, we just wanted to make it respectable and not lose our 
confidence," Pitino said. "I told them during a timeout, 'It's not going well 
for us. Everything's going well for them. . . . All you can do is show your 
character.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't enough for Kentucky guard Travis Ford, who had 10 points, 12 
assists and one big motivational speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled everyone together and I said, 'We're down 31 and we're not leaving 
this building without a win,' " Ford said. " 'We're going to win this game no 
matter what. I'll stay here all night.' And everyone said, 'You're right,' and 
everyone stepped up their play." 
</P>
<P>
 LSU called a timeout after McCarty's shot, but Jamie Brandon missed a layup 
with less than five seconds to play. Tony Delk made one free throw and Ford 
added two more to give Kentucky its first victory in Baton Rouge in five tries 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU led, 48-32, at halftime and used an 18-0 run to take a 31-point lead 
before the second half was five minutes old, but Kentucky scored 24 of the next 
28 points. The Wildcats cut the lead to 82-74 on McCarty's steal underneath and 
dunk with 6:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford made it a six-point game with a scoop shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brassow cut it to 91-87 with a three-pointer with 2:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Brassow hit his fourth three-pointer, this one from 22 feet with a hand in his 
face, to make it 93-90. Ceasar hit two more free throws to make the lead five. 
</P>
<P>
 Delk's three-pointer made it 95-93 and set up McCarty's last-minute heroics 
and LSU's historic frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coached about 200 NBA games and I've coached about 16 years of college and 
I have never, ever seen a comeback on the road like that in my life," Pitino 
said. "Nothing has ever come close to this."

ANALYSIS; LABOR PROBLEM IS LOOMING FOR NBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAUN POWELL, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Basketball Association All-Star break is past and the playoffs 
are just a couple of months away. But at league headquarters, in owners' 
offices and in the backs of the minds of players exists a training-camp 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone's bracing for the long grind that lies ahead. Not basketball games, 
but basketball matters. 
</P>
<P>
 A new labor agreement must be devised and resolved. The league is on the verge 
of adding two Canadian teams as it prepares to go international. The Minnesota 
Timberwolves, citing financial problems with their arena, are threatening to 
move. Escalating player salaries have many owners squirming. Other issues, 
smaller in scale yet important just the same, dot the calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside its 27 arenas, the NBA continues to prosper. Attendance and TV ratings 
are on the ascent as the league tweaks the noses of those who questioned its 
staying power in the post-Jordan era. The players still have a hermetic grip on 
the country's young generation with their colorful style and culture. 
Professional baseball and football can only drool at the NBA's way of 
attracting both fans with MBAs and fans of MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to suggest the game doesn't show a few cracks. The league hopes the 
drop in scoring is a cycle, not a trend. Violence, though not the ugly threat 
it was last season, continues to be monitored with a careful eye. And the NBA 
could use a new marketable megastar, as evidenced by the ratings for Sunday's 
All-Star Game on NBC. They were down down 36 percent from last year's record 
number, Nielsen Media Research said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are minor concerns. At the moment, what commands the attention of 
Commissioner David Stern is the upcoming negotiations with the players 
association that begin next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it's going to be an interesting exhibition of sorts," Stern 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 During the just-completed All-Star weekend in Minneapolis, Stern and Charles 
Grantham, the executive director of the players' association, spent part of 
their time promoting their causes through the media. The battle lines were 
drawn long ago. The league wants to keep the salary cap and the draft; the 
union wants neither, but does demand a healthy slice of the billion-dollar 
merchandising pie. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, the old arguments remain. The league prefers the status quo. 
The players want change. The league says eliminating the cap and the draft may 
invite disaster. The players say the league is financially healthy enough to do 
away with those formulas they say are outdated. The league says the average 
player salary has increased many times over in recent years. The players 
respond that so has the value of franchises. The league wants to restrict free 
agency. The players want complete free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern and Grantham do agree on something. Both men, who have great respect for 
each other professionally and spend time together socially as well, say they'll 
do their part to keep the negotiations free of acrimony. Grantham says that's 
in the players' association's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not to suggest we're a compliance organization," Grantham added. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides have enjoyed a close working relationship. Unlike the NFL and 
major-league baseball, the NBA never has had a player strike or work stoppage. 
But in the past, that was something it couldn't afford. When the last labor 
agreement was signed in 1983, the league stood on fragile financial ground. Now 
there are many more millions at stake and the NBA has a firm popularity base. 
This time, a lockout or strike is not out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Between now and even during negotiations with the union, Stern will monitor 
the Timberwolves' plight. Faced with a $73 million bill for the Target Center 
that they can't pay and the city won't pay, the Wolves are plotting a move. 
They're being romanced by San Diego and Nashville, Tenn., but the NBA won't 
send for a U-Haul until all avenues are exhausted. The league wants the Wolves 
to stay in Minneapolis, where they are otherwise profitable and the fan support 
is strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The court battle between the NBA and Chicago's WGN is ongoing. Stern is 
testifying against Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, claiming superstations infringe 
on the league's exclusive TV rights. Reinsdorf is fighting to keep Bulls' games 
on the superstation. The legal decision could impact the league's 
billion-dollar national TV contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Perspective franchises in Toronto and Vancouver, British Columbia, have 
hurdled the gambling obstacles that threatened to delay or cancel their 
arrivals. They will bring a few hundred million in franchise fees to the 
league. But how much further will they dilute the talent pool? Critics say 
that, based on the dwindling number of great players, the league now is paying 
for expanding from 23 teams five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners everywhere are cringing at the stratospheric player salaries. 
Long-term, megabucks rookie contracts given to Anfernee Hardaway, Chris Webber 
and Shawn Bradley broke new ground. The Charlotte Hornets could give Larry 
Johnson an $84 million package because they draw nearly 24,000 fans a night. 
But owners in other, less-vibrant places, such as New Jersey, are being 
affected. Now the Nets are faced with what to do with Derrick Coleman and his 
grotesquely inflated salary demands. Breathlessly awaiting are free 
agents-to-be Danny Manning, Horace Grant and to a lesser extent, an aging yet 
still productive Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the times are a-changing for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more at stake for everybody," Stern said in Minneapolis.

 Seven players were awarded $1 million or more. Clark was awarded $800,000 each 
for the 1986 and 1987 seasons, and interest through Dec. 31, 1990, increased 
his award by more than $512,555.63.

MORNING BRIEFING: SHE WOULD HAND-CHECK TEAM IF SHE HANDED OVER A CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who's that girl? 
</P>
<P>
 It's Madonna, being spotted at NBA games these days, especially in New York 
and Miami and occasionally at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The former high school cheerleader from Michigan -- "I had a crush on all the 
players" -- got hooked on pro basketball last season and has followed it enough 
to have a handful of favorites: Dennis Rodman (preferably as a blond), John 
Starks, Horace Grant, Brian Shaw, Charles Barkley and the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of dancing," she told USA Today. "I love the action. In 
football, I can't see anything. The guys are all covered up and wearing helmets 
and all they do is run into each other. In basketball, though, you can see the 
guys' legs and arms and faces. They're so graceful. And it's so in-your-face, 
so intimate." 
</P>
<P>
 She has an interest in taking intimacy to greater lengths and buying an NBA 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, a big interest," she said. "It's definitely a fantasy. I can see it 
happening in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you be a hands-on owner?" she was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," she said. "My hands would be all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Madonna: She can only talk about pro basketball teams as a fan, but she 
can talk about the dance teams as an expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Her analysis: 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of room for improvement. They should get up to date with the 
styles and music. I look at them and think Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 And asked what she would change if she were NBA commissioner, Madonna said: 
"You know when they have the pregame introductions and they turn the lights 
down and the spotlight on? I'd have them play the whole game like that. It's 
theater. More dramatic. I'd also have the cameras turn only one way. When I go 
to a basketball game, I have to ask myself if I'm in the mood for the cameras. 
It's a bit annoying. Sometimes you're picking your nose." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which NBA team had three players who competed in the 1992 Olympic 
Games in basketball? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the time: If people thought Michigan basketball players Jimmy King, 
Ray Jackson and Chris Fields got off with a slap on the wrist after pleading 
no-contest to stealing beer from a convenience store, Michigan State students 
offered justice. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Wolverines traveled to East Lansing, the crowd turned the Breslin 
Center into a different kind of court. Among the sentences on signs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Move over Bud, the (Jimmy) King of beers goes to the U of M." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "More trouble in the Jackson family." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "0 points, 0 rebounds, 0 assists, 1 steal." 
</P>
<P>
 The students also compiled a David Letterman-type top-10 list: "Why the U of M 
thinks beer is better than basketball." Among the highlights: "Beer is easier 
to steal than the ball," and "Hangovers are bad, but choking in the Final Four 
is worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan's response? A 59-51 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You-know-who line of the day: Portland radio station KEX has run fake 
commercials for Shawn Eckardt's Professional Bodyguard School. Among the 
classes offered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Overnight Surveillance: How many Big Macs are enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: The Minnesota Timberwolves, with Christian Laettner of the 
United States, Gundars Vetra of the Unified Team and Luc Longley of Australia.

SANDERS VOWS TO QUIT FOOTBALL, CONCENTRATE ON BASEBALL CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deion Sanders has had enough of two-sport employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has told Sports Magazine that he is finished with pro football and 
that he will concentrate on playing baseball with the Atlanta Braves.His spare 
time, Sanders said, will be spent establishing himself as a rap or movie star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired," Sanders is quoted as saying. "I've been driving myself too much 
by playing baseball and football and trying to do other things I love, like 
music. I'm 26, going on 36, 37, 38." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders is the Braves' center fielder and leadoff hitter, but played 
cornerback well enough with the Atlanta Falcons to make the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcon season, which ended in a three-game losing streak after a 6-2 run 
that included victories over Dallas and San Francisco, is part of his reason 
for giving up football. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last game (a season-ending 27-10 loss to Phoenix) was the worst game I've 
ever played in football," said Sanders, who is a free agent but said he will 
accept no offer from the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Worst game of my life. I had no desire. No drive. No enthusiasm. I didn't 
want to be out there. I should've walked off the field, out of the stadium and 
said, 'Later. See ya when I get the feeling back.' "

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing wrong with the Marty McSorley trade is that the Kings didn't 
make it sooner. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Kings missed McSorley's spirit as much as his strength. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The greeting he will receive from the fans at the Forum on Friday probably 
will register on the Richter scale. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker is the best fighter, Mike Tyson the most rested, Michael 
Carbajal the most exciting, Oscar De La Hoya the most promising and Julio Cesar 
Chavez the biggest crybaby pound-for-pound. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most improved? Freddie Pendleton. Just ask him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton is the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion despite 
the fact that he was 1-5 as an amateur, lost four of his first six professional 
fights, was .500 after five years and has three times as many losses as any of 
the 48 other champions recognized by the IBF, WBC or WBA . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He used to let his words speak for him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now he lets his words and actions speak for him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to make a few dollars to knock out a stiff in what is a perfect 
fight for me," he said about his title defense against Rafael Ruelas Saturday 
night on the attractive Carbajal-Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez card at the 
Forum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, 31, had a 12-fight unbeaten streak that improved him to 35-17-4 
recently, but is coming off a bizarre defeat. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He was winning a non-title bout in Miami when, riled by the taunts of opponent 
Ed Pollard, he went berserk after the third round, refused to return to his 
stool, took swings at everyone in the ring, including his cornermen, and was 
disqualified. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I got mad," he explained. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 His problem used to be that he didn't take his work seriously enough. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never in shape," he said."I was also a victim of mismanagement. I'd 
take fights on one-day notice. If I got beat, I'd forget about it quickly and 
kept talking about how good I was.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A switch in managers to Miami policeman Al Bonanni helped to turn Pendleton 
into the winner that he always claimed to be. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Now you can't get him out of the gym," Bonanni said. "He's a role model. He 
works with youth groups and was very active in aiding hurricane victims. He's 
actually a very nice guy who doesn't like his image.". . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Friday is the 25th anniversary of Mando Ramos' 11th-round victory over Teo 
Cruz in a rematch that made the Kid Charisma from San Pedro the youngest 
lightweight champion in history at 20. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 More important, January was the 11th anniversary of his abstinence from 
alcohol. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, who is a longshoreman, will be at ringside in a special section of 
former Olympic Auditorium stars when the building is reopened for the De La 
Hoya-Jimmi Bredahl fight March 5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya was 19 when he won the United States' only gold medal in boxing at 
the 1992 Olympic Games. Ramos was 19 when he fought Cruz for the title the 
first time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NHL scoring, the lowest in years, might pick up now that referees have been 
told to call more hooking, holding, and interference penalties. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nick Nickson broadcast his 1,000th King game Monday night. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nicest success story this season is that of Boston Bruin wing Cam Neeley, who 
has come back from two knee operations to become the only player in the league 
with more goals than games played. . . .

EVEN SHORTHANDED, CLIPPERS COME BACK; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY RALLY TO DEFEAT 
LAKERS AT THE FORUM, 100-89, DESPITE DIVAC'S FIRST TRIPLE-DOUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Life without Danny Manning and Ron Harper, a very real full-time possibility 
for the Clippers in a few months, got an early test run Tuesday night, just as 
they were doing something about the past. 
</P>
<P>
 In danger of being swept at the Forum and of losing their fourth in a row 
against the Lakers this season, the Clippers turned it around. They went from 
an eight-point lead in the second quarter to a nine-point deficit in the third 
to shooting 61.9% in the fourth for a 100-89 victory without their two leading 
scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 The official count of 11,954 spectators didn't include Manning and Harper, but 
that was their role in the first game back from the All-Star break for both 
teams. They were in uniform and they were on the bench, but they stayed there 
as punishment for missing Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jackson took control in their absence, scoring 15 of his 21 points in the 
second half and also finishing with 12 assists. John Williams also had 21 
points, sparking a strong showing by the Clipper bench to offset the 16 
rebounds, 14 points and 12 assists from Vlade Divac, his first career 
triple-double and the first by a Laker since Sam Perkins on Jan. 24, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would go into supermarkets or wherever and people would say, 'When are you 
going to beat the Lakers?' " Jackson said. "We were all sick of that. We felt 
like we had to put a stop to it." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't hard to imagine how the Lakers felt. Not only was it a bad showing 
against a team they had beat at full strength, it was the second bad showing in 
a row dating back to last Thursday against Sacramento after a string of 
victories against the likes of Utah and Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did Nancy Kerrigan say after getting hit on the knee?" Coach Randy Pfund 
said. "Why? Why? That was a horrible effort, and I told the guys so after the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 The benching of Manning and Harper -- worth a combined 43 points -- meant no 
available Clipper came in averaging more than Loy Vaught's 12.8 points and made 
for a makeshift lineup. What it did not mean was overconfidence from the 
Lakers, or at least their coach, despite coming in with a 3-0 series lead with 
Harper having played all three games and Manning two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a more dangerous game," Pfund said beforehand. "Teams are always 
dangerous if they're missing a guy or two. Teams up their effort and guys see 
an opportunity to take advantage of their chance. Ask Utah about Reggie 
Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 The chance Tuesday belonged to rookie Terry Dehere, who replaced Harper at 
shooting guard for his first pro start, and Tom Tolbert, in the opening lineup 
at Manning's small forward. Vaught also started at power forward for the first 
time since Jan. 18, sending Williams to a reserve role. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers' big rally came in the third quarter -- a 13-1 run over the final 
3:21 to turn a 69-60 deficit into a 73-70 advantage at quarter's end. Jackson 
made a pair of three-pointers in that stretch, then opened the fourth quarter 
with a basket. When he drove the lane for a layup with 9:07 remaining, the lead 
was up to 81-74.

NBA ROUNDUP; EWING DERIDES KNICKS AFTER LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New Jersey Nets bring out the worst in the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks are 34-11 against the rest of the league, but 0-3 against the Nets, 
who dealt them their worst loss of the season, 103-83, Tuesday night at East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing took the Knicks to task after New Jersey continued its 
surprising domination that included a 60-42 rebounding edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get back to the way we were playing," he said. "We have to get our 
intensity back. We have to start putting bodies on people. We have to do it 
right away. We haven't played well in the last six games. We've been playing 
like wimps. There is no bumping and banging. We're letting teams go all over 
the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks have lost four of their last six games. New Jersey has won 10 of 
its last 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 106, Dallas 103 -- Clifford Robinson scored 24 points, including a 
critical off-balance jump shot with 26 seconds to play, sending the Trail 
Blazers to their 13th consecutive victory over the Mavericks at Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Drexler led Portland with 26 points. Jamal Mashburn scored 26 points for 
the Mavericks, who were seeking their first three-game winning streak since 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 103, Atlanta 99 -- Hakeem Olajuwon scored eight of his 28 points in 
the final minutes at Houston, which avenged a 133-111 loss to Atlanta on Dec. 3 
that snapped the Rockets' record-tying 15-game winning streak to start the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins led the Hawks with 26 points and Kevin Willis and Mookie 
Blaylock each scored 16 for the Hawks, who won eight of their previous 10 games 
against the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 97, Milwaukee 90 -- Christian Laettner had 23 points and 13 rebounds 
at Minneapolis as the Timberwolves snapped a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Person scored seven of his 16 points in the fourth quarter as the 
Timberwolves survived a 20-1 third-quarter run by the Bucks that erased a 
14-point Minnesota lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota outscored Milwaukee, 22-8, in the first nine minutes of the fourth 
quarter to take control. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 102, Boston 92 -- Shaquille O'Neal grabbed 24 rebounds and scored 10 
of his 36 points in the final 3:41 for the Magic at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic fell behind, 74-69, after missing 13 of 17 shots in the third 
quarter and trailed, 82-72, before putting together a 30-10 run to extend the 
Celtics' losing streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 111, Denver 99 -- Gerald Wilkins scored 15 of his 27 points in the 
first quarter and made four three-pointers for the Cavaliers at Richfield, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuggets lost their third game in a row. Cleveland, whose five starters all 
scored in double figures, has won three of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 100, Washington 93 -- Joe Dumars, despite a sore left hamstring, 
scored 25 points at Auburn Hills, Mich., as the Pistons extended the Bullets' 
losing streak to four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumars, who pulled his hamstring in a game against Houston last Thursday, 
didn't practice Monday. But he started against the Bullets and led the Pistons 
to only their fourth victory in 28 games. 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 109, Indiana 100 -- David Robinson had 34 points and 10 rebounds 
at San Antonio as the Spurs matched their franchise-record winning streak of 10 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, which tied the Spurs' record set in January, 1993, also was their 
12th in a row at the Alamodome and pushed their record to 21-3 since Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 133, Philadelphia 105 -- Shawn Kemp scored 24 points, half of them on 
six dunks, and grabbed 13 rebounds in three quarters at Seattle as the 
SuperSonics won their fifth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics are 20-3 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 123, Sacramento 113 -- Billy Owens scored a season-high 29 points 
at Oakland as the Warriors, after losing nearly all of a 19-point lead, 
recovered to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State has won six of eight games overall, and six in a row and 12 of 13 
against the Kings.

NHL ROUNDUP; PENGUINS COMPLETE A BUSY NIGHT BY BEATING JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the game, the Pittsburgh Penguins scratched star center Mario Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, they bolstered their forward line by acquiring center Shawn 
McEachern and right wing Tomas Sandstrom from the Kings for defensemen Marty 
McSorley and Jim Paek. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, the Penguins beat the Winnipeg Jets, 5-3, Tuesday night at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemieux did not play because of his sore back. He played twice over the 
weekend and had three goals and an assist in his first action since Nov. 7. He 
missed 38 games during that stretch with back-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Patrick, Penguin general manager, said the Penguins will adopt a new 
safety-first policy regarding Lemieux. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be very cautious the rest of the year," he said. "If there's 
any type of soreness, we're not going to have him play. Today he was a little 
sore and we don't want to take the risk." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's Tom Barrasso got his 253rd victory, making him the winningest 
U.S.-born goalie in NHL history. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 3, Vancouver 2 -- Brett Hull tied the game with his 40th goal and 
then got the game-winner with 5:44 to play at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull made it 2-2 at 4:38 of the third period with a 40-foot wrist shot. Jim 
Montgomery assisted on the winner, getting the puck to Hull above the right 
circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks have lost three of their last four games and fell to 28-28-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 5, Detroit 4 -- Wendel Clark's power-play goal at 2:55 of overtime 
lifted the Maple Leafs at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved Toronto two points ahead of Detroit and idle Dallas atop the 
Central Division. The Maple Leafs' 71 points is also tops in the Western 
Conference and second overall behind the New York Rangers (76). 
</P>
<P>
 With Steve Chaisson off for holding in overtime, Clark rifled a wrist shot 
from the high slot past Tim Cheveldae on a power play for his 27th goal of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit forced overtime when Ray Sheppard scored his 42nd goal of the season 
with eight seconds remaining in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 2, Tampa Bay 1 -- Mick Vukota and Steve Thomas scored 49 
seconds apart for the Islanders at Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lightning outshot the Islanders, 10-0, in the third period but couldn't 
tie the game. It was the first time since Jan. 17, 1979, that New York had been 
held without a shot for an entire period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hextall stopped 21 shots for the Islanders, who are 5-2-1 in their last 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lightning lost for only the third time in their last 12 road games 
(8-3-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton 2, Washington 2 -- Bill Ranford stopped 41 shots at Landover, Md., 
where the struggling Oilers snapped Washington's four-game winning streak and 
earned a rare point on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Zdeno Ciger and Shayne Corson scored power-play goals for the Oilers, who 
ended a four-game skid despite taking only 17 shots. Edmonton has an NHL-worst 
3-18-7 road record. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Hunter and Kelly Miller scored for the Captials, 7-1-1 in their last nine 
games. Goalie Don Beaupre, who faced only five shots in the final 25 minutes, 
had his five-game winning streak broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 6, San Jose 4 -- Rookie Mikael Renberg scored three goals in the 
third period to rally the Flyers at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Renberg's first hat trick in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored the go-ahead goal, slapping home a rebound with 10:41 to play. Five 
minutes later, Renberg scored again, slapping the puck into the net from the 
crease. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended San Jose's franchise-best four-game winning streak and pulled 
the Flyers out of a 1-8-1 tailspin.

TURN 13 UNLUCKY FOR U.S.; LUGE: WARREN AND MYLER BLOW MEDAL CHANCES WITH 
MISHAPS. ITALY'S WEISSENSTEINER LEADS WOMEN AFTER TWO RUNS.

<P>
 It's known as bokkerittet in Norwegian. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride of the billy goat or ram. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. sliders have their own descriptions for Turn 13 of the Winter Olympics 
luge course, none are printable. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same turn where Duncan Kennedy lost control Monday, Erin Warren and 
Cammy Myler blew their medal chances in the women's first two runs Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now you know why they don't put a 13 on elevators," said Dmitry Feld, media 
representative for U.S. Luge. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren experienced a frightening crash in the first heat, but suffered only 
bruises and ice burns. She was disqualified, however, for not finishing the 
run.  
</P>
<P>
 Myler, who won the last World Cup race of a season in which she finished fifth 
overall, banged both walls coming out of 13 in the second heat Tuesday and was 
a distant 11th before today's final two heats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not happy or excited about it, but I feel I did the best I 
could," she said, the pressure of the Olympics compounded by her brother Tim's 
battle with colon cancer in an Albany, N.Y., hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bethany Calcaterra-McMahon of the United States, in her first Olympics, had 
two clean runs and is 13th, the equivalent of another time zone when compared 
to the leader, Gerda Weissensteiner of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissensteiner, fourth in the 1992 Olympics, set a course record in the first 
heat and emerged from the second with a 25/100ths of a second lead over Susi 
Erdmann of Germany. Two Austrians, Andrea Tagwerker and Angelika Neuner, are 
third and fourth, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's first Olympics ended abruptly after only 40 seconds but the 
23-year-old St. Lawrence University student subscribed to Kennedy's 
let-it-all-out philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In '92, I didn't risk anything and didn't make the team," she said. "I've had 
a change of attitude. Sometimes it doesn't hurt to die in the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, it's a positive for me the way I drove the course. I was relaxed and 
aggressive. I'm disappointed, but I would be more disappointed if I had made a 
stupid error from being nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's consoling to know I was going fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's splits projected to a first-heat finish in the top five or six. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, watching her run on TV, said she did what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went in (to 13) too low and was pulled up (into the high bank of the 
curve) by the centrifugal force," he said. "At that point the sled is so light 
there's no way to control it, and she slammed down against the left side of the 
wall (coming out of the curve). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the highest-speed part of the course and very difficult. The 
straightaway between 12 and 13 is so short that even if you drive 12 properly, 
it tends to put you into 13 too low." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren crashed on the same curve in the Lillehammer Cup last fall but said she 
wasn't thinking of that or of Kennedy's crash 24 hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 She endorsed Kennedy's account of the accident but said, "I really don't think 
any part of this course is that difficult. I went into 13 too low is all, and 
that happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The sled tipped over as she slammed off the wall and rode on Warren's back as 
she slid face down through the long straightaway into 14, where the sled slid 
free as Warren lay motionless in the middle of the turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't fight it," she said of her long slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you can do is relax and wait to slow down. I was just stunned from 
hitting my head on the ice a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 And the sled? 
</P>
<P>
 "The sled is fine," she said. "I was the one on the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Myler's training runs were among the field's best until Monday, when she 
watched Kennedy crash, then hit the wall herself during a final training trip 
through 13. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't stay with her, she insisted, but she acknowledged being 
inexplicably tense in both heats, never matched her training or World Cup 
speeds and lost what she had in the second heat when she hit the walls leaving 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to do better tomorrow," Myler said disconsolately, the high of 
serving as U.S. flag bearer in opening ceremonies of her third Olympics having 
faded some. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra-McMahon, 19 and in her first year of senior luge competition, is 
likely to have many tomorrows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do well like everybody else, but I'm treating this like a learning 
experience for '98," she said, adding of her clean runs: 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone treats 13 differently. I held the line today, but it's easy to 
lose." 
</P>
<P>
 In three days of luge competition, however, only one non-American slider has 
crashed in 13. Greta Sebald of Greece lost it in the first heat Tuesday, but 
held onto her sled. 
</P>
<P>
 She crossed the finish line more off than on, but was eligible to continue. 
She trails Weissensteiner by 56 seconds, bitten by bokkerittet.

U.S. 'HIGH-WIRE' ACT SURVIVES AGAIN; HOCKEY: A 3-3 TIE WITH SLOVAKIA PREVENTS 
LIKELY OUSTER FROM MEDAL CONTENTION AS SHAKY AMERICANS RALLY AGAIN .

<P>
 If acrobatics were an Olympic sport, U.S. hockey players would have already 
clinched a place on the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they will win a medal in the hockey tournament is less certain. 
</P>
<P>
 Teetering toward a loss to Slovakia and likely elimination from medal 
contention Tuesday, the United States needed a series of contortions and two 
favorable calls to keep its balancing act aloft. Finally, John Lilley's goal 
from a sharp angle on the right wing eluded goaltender Eduard Hartmann with 
4:07 to play, forging a 3-3 tie that was eerily like Saturday's 4-4 draw with 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of its games, the sixth-seeded U.S. team faced a lesser opponent that 
rode emotion and a sound game plan to unexpected heights. And in each game, 
only a late and potentially stoppable goal kept the Americans undefeated. The 
ties leave the United States and Slovakia sharing third place in Group B, two 
points behind Canada (2-0) and one behind Sweden (1-0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "We must be somewhat of a high-wire act," said U.S. Coach Tim Taylor, smiling 
in relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of the way we've come back from two-goal deficits in two 
consecutive games. It shows we have a lot of heart. The thing we have to work 
on in general is not putting ourselves in that position. Youthful enthusiasm is 
one of our strengths and it has to be there the whole game. You can't just rely 
on it at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can they rely on the kinds of breaks they got Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia had two goals disallowed and was forced to play shorthanded for 
13:45, including a stretch in the third period when Peter Stastny was assessed 
a five-minute penalty for high-sticking Craig Johnson and two more minutes for 
punching Peter Ferraro. After going scoreless on seven power plays against 
France and five against Slovakia, the United States finally capitalized on its 
advantage and cut the deficit to 3-2 when Peter Ciavaglia parked himself by the 
right post and converted Mark Beaufait's pass at 14:23. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to be going down to the third period down one or two goals, 
but we can look at this as a positive experience," Ciavaglia said. "Everybody's 
upbeat because we know we haven't played our best hockey yet. Obviously, we 
don't want to keep putting ourselves in a hole, but if it does happen again, we 
know we can bounce back." 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia, playing with a passion the Americans have lacked, bounced back 
easily and often after U.S. left wing Jeff Lazaro blasted a slap shot through 
Hartmann's leg pads at 10:23 of the first period. Slovakia tied it at 13:55, 
when Lubomir Kolnik's wrist shot from the left side of the slot skipped past 
Garth Snow, and took an apparent lead at 16:37 of the second period when 
Lubomir Sekeras' shot from the top of the left circle flew over Snow's left 
shoulder. However, referee Valery Bokarev, a Russian, ruled that Robert Svehla 
had interfered with Snow and waved off the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Stastny gave Slovakia an unquestioned goal at 19:24, skating unchecked out of 
the right-wing corner after Ted Drury and Chris Imes collided, then slipping 
the puck past Snow's outstretched stick. A potential 3-1 lead for Slovakia was 
erased at 4:23 of the third when Bokarev ruled that Oscar Hascak had kicked a 
rebound past Snow, but Svehla's later conversion of a shot that had bounced off 
Drury's foot was above reproach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Slovakia is (as weak as) a 12th-seeded team," U.S. captain 
Peter Laviolette said. "They clogged up the neutral zone and made it very 
difficult for us to get our offense rolling. . . . I'd be lying if I didn't say 
I thought we were a little nervous, a little tense. But that's to be expected 
when you're down two goals halfway through the game. We had to work darn hard 
to get two points out of these games." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stastny, a six-time NHL All-Star with the Quebec Nordiques: "We spend 
half the game shorthanded, we have two goals disallowed and despite that I'm 
very proud of this team. If we end up like this, we'll win the gold medal." 
</P>
<P>
 Slovakia's players were not overly impressed with their U.S. counterparts. 
Tuesday's game was the second against the United States for defenseman Jergus 
Baca, who plays for the International Hockey League's Milwaukee Admirals and 
was on the winning side of a 5-1 rout of the U.S. team on Sept. 29 at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give them credit that they came back from 3-1 to tie, but I think the 
referee helped them," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who stopped 12 of 13 first-period shots, said he and his teammates are 
encouraged rather than discouraged by their first two performances. "We're 
pretty high right now," he said. "In the early going, all we have to worry 
about is accumulating some points, and we are. We haven't lost yet."

 Skier Shannon Nobis raised a lot of eyebrows with her 10th-place finish in the 
women's super-giant slalom.  
</P>
<P>
 Some were surprised that the 21-year-old from Park City even had made the U.S. 
Alpine team.She was supposed to be one of America's hopes for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was young, because I did so well, they always said, 'You always 
have next year, take it slow,' " Nobis said. "The thing is, people make it 
really young in skiing, too. Enough of that. You have to go out and say, 'I can 
do it.' You ski with those people every day, the top five in the world, you 
have to realize you can do it. It's not a matter of being older or 
experienced." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobis' brother, Jeremy, is on the U.S. men's team and will race in giant 
slalom next week.

 She was the 35th skier down the course and nearly snatched the gold from 
American Diann Roffe-Steinrotter, losing by .29 of a second.

 U.S. wing Craig Johnson nearly lost some teeth Tuesday -- and he did lose a 
hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who idolized Peter Stastny so avidly as a youngster that he taped a 
poster of Stastny to his bedroom wall and took "Peter" as his confirmation 
name, was struck in the mouth by Stastny Tuesday during the U.S. team's 3-3 tie 
with Slovakia.Stastny got a five-minute high-sticking penalty; Johnson got a 
mouthful of chipped teeth.

 "I guess I'll have to take a new name," Johnson said.

 After making his NHL debut a few months ago, U.S. goalie Garth Snow wasn't 
nervous in his Olympic debut Tuesday. Snow made 30 saves and was his usual 
aggressive self, frequently coming out of the net to move the puck up to his 
forwards. He's virtually certain to start Thursday's game against Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely had more butterflies in my first game with Quebec," said Snow, 
who was 3-2 in his call-up with the Nordiques. "That experience made me a 
better goaltender. . . . I was comfortable out there (Tuesday) and I had a 
steady diet of shots early, and that helped me get into the game."

RUSSIAN PAIRS ARE TWO GOOD; FIGURE SKATING: GOLD MEDALISTS IN 1988, EKATERINA 
GORDEEVA AND SERGEI GRINKOV, WIN AGAIN, WITH '92 WINNERS SECOND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Pairs figure skating might never have been performed at a higher level in the 
Winter Olympics than it was Tuesday night in the Olympic Amphitheatre, which 
was one reason it was so difficult to decide who deserved to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first meeting in the Olympics between past champions, eight of the nine 
judges voted for Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov, the 1988 gold 
medalists, in the freestyle program, while the crowd preferred Natalia 
Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev, the 1992 gold medalists, rewarding them with a 
standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the judges determine the winners, Gordeeva and Grinkov will take gold 
medals home to Moscow, or perhaps to Tampa, Fla., where they live when touring 
in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a superb night for other pairs, especially bronze medalists Isabelle 
Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada, fourth-place Evgenia Shishkova and Vadim 
Naumov of Russia and fifth-place Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were amateurs compared to the first two Russian pairs -- literally, 
because Gordeeva and Grinkov and Mishkutenok and Dmitriev embarked upon 
lucrative professional careers after winning their gold medals and before 
returning to the Olympics to challenge one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Moskvina, the rambunctious coach who handles Mishkutenok and Dmitriev, 
predicted the outcome after a practice Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm friendly with the judges, but I don't think their inclination is toward 
my couple," she said. "Some pairs get the marks, others get the renown." 
</P>
<P>
 With little argument from the rest of the world, Russians usually get both. 
They dominated pairs skating in the Soviet Union when that country dominated 
the event, winning eight consecutive Winter Olympic championships between 1964 
and '92 and finishing first and second in five competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 To find real competition, the Russians have had to look within, splitting into 
the Moscow and St. Petersburg schools. When Moscow took a 5-4 lead in Olympic 
gold medals Tuesday night, Moskvina feigned indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are from St. Petersburg, the capital of intelligence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She is smart enough to figure out that this could be the end of pairs 
superiority for the Russians, whose best figure skaters, now that they have 
more freedom to choose their disciplines, are deciding -- like the Americans -- 
to go into the higher-profile individual competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years, and one infant daughter, since they won in 1988 at Calgary, Canada, 
Gordeeva, 22, and Grinkov, 27, have seen the future and decided they are not 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordeeva said the Russians will always be strong, but she added that they will 
have to look over their shoulders at the Canadians and the Americans. She could 
be right in the case of Meno and Sand, whose coach, John Nicks, said: "I think 
this is a pair on the upward rise. They haven't been together that long." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, their first full season together, they finished fifth in the world. 
Their competition last year did not include Gordeeva and Grinkov or Mishkutenok 
and Dmitriev. If not for the rule allowing professionals to return, Meno and 
Sand might have won bronze medals in these Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicks might have found joy in that, but as the United States' most successful 
pairs coach, he seemed enthused about the return of the Russians. He prefers 
Gordeeva and Grinkov, but he believed that the perfect score of 6.0 that the 
Russian judge gave them for artistic impression was overdoing it. Nicks would 
not have argued if Mishkutenok and Dmitriev had won. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordeeva and Grinkov are what I would call a purist's pair," he said. "But 
those who prefer imaginative choreography, gimmicks and new ideas, they prefer 
the second Russians." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Nicks said, the skating was wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception was the nasty spill taken by Germany's Mandy Woetzel amid a 
relatively easy set of spirals, forcing her and partner Ingo Steuer to retire. 
She was taken to a hospital, where she required three stitches in her chin.

 Lyubov Egorova of Russia won the women's five-kilometer classical-style 
cross-country ski race Tuesday, beating Italian Manuela Di Centa by 19.5 
seconds. That reversed their positions of Sunday, when Di Centa defeated 
Egorova in the 15-kilometer freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Egorova, winner of three gold and two silver medals in the 1992 Winter Games, 
led most of the way and finished in 14 minutes 8.8 seconds. Marja-Liisa 
Kirvesniemi of Finland was third in 14:36.0. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirvesniemi, 38, is competing in her record-tying sixth Olympics. She was a 
triple champion at Sarajevo in 1984 as Marja-Liisa Hamalainen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Moen of Norway just missed a bronze before the home crowd, finishing 
fourth, and another Norwegian, Inger Helene Nybraaten, was fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Kemppel of Anchorage, Alaska, 28th in the 61-skier field, was the top 
American. Leslie Thompson of Stowe, Vt., was 40th; Ingrid Butts of Park City, 
Utah, 53rd, and Kerrin Petty of Townshend, Vt., 59th.

 The race was the first of the two-day pursuit that ends with the 10-kilometer 
freestyle Thursday.

SKATING THROUGH THE PAIN; PUNSALAN, SWALLOW CARRY THE WEIGHT OF RECENT TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Since their marriage less than six months ago, U.S. ice dancers Elizabeth 
Punsalan and Jerod Swallow have been told that they have never skated with more 
affection and commitment. As they glided across the ice in a practice Tuesday 
at the Olympic Amphitheatre here, their feelings for one another seemed even 
more vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 When that was mentioned to them later, their eyes met and locked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Punsalan said, "with what we've been through . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days earlier, they were having dinner with his parents in Northville, 
Mich., when she received a call from her family's home in Sheffield Lakes, 
Ohio. Her 57-year-old father, Ernesto, had been stabbed to death while sleeping 
in his bedroom, and her 20-year-old brother, Rickey, had been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before driving to Ohio the next morning, they released a statement 
through the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. saying that they would go to Norway to 
compete in the Winter Olympics because that is what her father would have 
wanted them to do. But she was not sure until much later that was what she 
wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made up a statement before we were sure," Punsalan said. "It happened so 
quickly. I don't think I was thinking straight at the time. Even on the plane 
to here, I wasn't sure how I'd feel, whether we'd be able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 They are handling it as well as could be expected, even agreeing to speak to 
reporters virtually whenever asked. They met with a small group after their 
practice Tuesday in the Olympic Amphitheatre, where the dance competition 
begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not among the contenders, Punsalan, 23, and Swallow, 27, seem to be as 
enthusiastic about sharing the same ice with Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and 
Christopher Dean, the 1984 gold medalists who are making a comeback, as they 
are about competing. A top-10 finish would be commendable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even being here is commendable. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first couple of days, we talked about it a lot with close friends," 
Punsalan said. "It helps to get your feelings sorted out. But this is just the 
beginning. I think it's going to take a long time. Some days are better than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a roller-coaster ride. I go from being very high to very low to 
very high. It's tough. I guess I expected it to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerod keeps talking to me, and (coach) Igor (Shpilband) keeps talking to me, 
and all I think about is my skating and what I need to do from minute to 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swallow: "Our marriage is still young, and we're still young people. At 
this age, you don't always know how to deal with death this close to your 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Although accommodations in the athletes' village don't mix men and women, the 
USFSA arranged for Swallow to move into a room by himself across the hall from 
the suite Punsalan shares with three other female figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a door knock away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan said she was looking forward to the arrival Tuesday night of her 
mother, two brothers, a sister and a brother-in-law. Swallow's parents and a 
brother also are coming. Another brother who lives in Studio City is still 
cleaning up from last month's earthquake, Swallow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just been a lot of craziness in our lives lately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with their wedding in Detroit on Sept. 4, the next few months could 
not have been more idyllic. Before leaving home for Norway, they spent hours 
looking at photo albums filled with family pictures from their wedding, 
Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual when she skated in major competitions, her father, a surgeon, could 
not get away from the hospital to travel to Detroit to attend last month's 
national championships, which Punsalan and Swallow won for the second time 
since 1991 to earn the United States' only Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was planning on taking time off to see them skate here. 
</P>
<P>
 When they went to Sheffield Lakes after the national championships, they found 
a large sign on the front lawn of her parents' home, congratulating them on 
their victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I always knew you'd make it,' " Punsalan said of her father. "He 
wasn't very surprised. He learned all about ice dancing, and he studied our 
tapes. This year, he said he could tell we had improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Swallow: "He was very modest. He'd never talk to the staff at the 
hospital about Liz. They'd see her on TV and ask him, 'Why didn't you tell us 
about your daughter?' He'd just smile. He was so proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 They said they are not sure what their future holds except that both plan to 
return to school to get their degrees, Swallow in art history and Punsalan in 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad always said ophthalmology was a good field, a 9-to-5 job," she said. 
"He worked around the clock, 24 hours a day, on call all the time. That's why 
he couldn't come to a lot of my skating events." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swallow: "He was as dedicated to his profession as Liz was to her 
skating. That's why he understood why she was doing what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan's voice cracked a couple of times while talking about her father, but 
she did not cry until asked about her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten hours after his release from a psychiatric unit of a nearby hospital, he 
allegedly killed his father with a kitchen knife. He pleaded not guilty to a 
charge of aggravated murder and is being held in Lorain, Ohio, without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has known that he was sick for a long time," Punsalan said. "He was 
battling substance abuse and mental illness along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 When she paused to compose herself, Swallow patted her on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," she continued, "he will be able to get the help that he needs."

MOGULS TAKE ODD TWISTS FOR THE U.S.; FREESTYLE SKIING: MCINTYRE FINISHES 
UNEXPECTED FIRST IN ELIMINATIONS. FAVORED WEINBRECHT IS SIXTH.

 Diann Roffe-Steinrotter wasn't the only U.S. surprise in women's skiing here 
Tuesday. There were two others. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Weinbrecht, the Olympic gold medalist in women's moguls two years ago at 
Albertville, France, and the heavy favorite here, bobbled a bit on her run in 
the moguls eliminations -- the medal runs are scheduled today -- and finished 
an unhappy sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liz McIntyre, her teammate, surprised the field by placing first.  
</P>
<P>
 They and fellow American Ann Battelle, who finished eighth, joined the field 
of 16 women who made the finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. men fared worse. Troy Benson and Sean Smith, finishing 13th and 16th, 
qualified, but Craig Rodman and Trace Worthington missed. Worthington, 
primarily an aerials specialist, said he was skiing the bumps just to keep from 
going stale. Aerial eliminations are scheduled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mogul skiing is relatively new to Olympic competition, having made its debut 
at Albertville. With rock music blaring and before a panel of seven judges, 
competitors race down a steep hill studded with hard little snow mounds and do 
aerial tricks off two built-in jumps. Technique counts for 50%, speed and 
jumping 25% each. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to ski fast but rhythmically, knees together, the lower legs 
pumping like pistons to absorb the bumps while the upper body is still. Except 
for the jumps, where significant height is necessary for cleanly executed 
aerials, skis are to be kept on the snow, the skier proceeding aggressively but 
in control. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinbrecht, who has won six of seven World Cup competitions this season, had a 
good time, 29.90 seconds, and scored well enough on her jumps, a twister-spread 
and a double twister, but her slight loss of rhythm between jumps cost her in 
technique and she finished with 23.96 points to 25.23 for McIntyre. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwegian Stine Lise Hattestad kept the crowd happy by placing second with 
24.91, and Russian Elizaveta Kojevnikova was third with 24.70. 
</P>
<P>
 A clearly disappointed Weinbrecht breezed past reporters, then later sent word 
through Deborah Engen Clouse, one of the U.S. press attaches here, that she 
needed to get focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not too pleased with her run," Clouse said. "She was not happy about 
her squibble. She said she had been really warm during her run and maybe too 
relaxed. She thought maybe she was too warm because she had trained too much 
this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no perfect scores in mogul skiing, but McIntyre's was an impressive 
run, and she didn't even do everything she had wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to do a daffy-twister," she said of her first jump. "But I could 
only get the daffy off. That will give me something to do tomorrow. But I'm 
very happy with my run." 
</P>
<P>
 A twister involves twisting from side to side from the waist down. A spread is 
a sideways leg split, and in a daffy the skier kicks one leg forward, the other 
back. Nobody was doing helicopters Tuesday but a helicopter is a 360-degree 
turn, and a 720 is two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Jean-Luc Brassard was the top men's qualifier, beating out Edgar 
Grospiron of France, the '92 gold medalist. Brassard totaled 26.78 points, 
Grospiron 26.65. Serguei Choupletsov of Russia was third with 26.64. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's scores do not carry over to today's finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to relax now and treat it as a whole new competition tomorrow," 
said Benson, a surprise among the American men. He had been only an alternate 
on the national team earlier this season but got his chance when Jim Moran was 
injured.

LOS ALAMITOS; YOUNG DRIVER HAS HIS SIGHTS SET ON EARNING A SPOT ON THE 'A' LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

 In the 30 seconds it took Mark P'Pool to guide Blues For Allah from a almost 
certain defeat to a nose victory in the Garden Grove Pacing Series on Friday, 
the 25-year-old driver might have earned the rookie-of-the-year title in 
California harness racing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blues For Allah comeback appeared to be impossible on the backstretch. 
P'Pool had the filly at the rear of the 10-horse field with only a quarter-mile 
remaining. As they moved around the final turn, a hole opened in front of Blues 
For Allah, and by the time the field hit the stretch, P'Pool had a clear path 
to the leaders. Blues For Allah passed Nicols Doll in the last few yards to 
give P'Pool his biggest victory at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little nervous about (the race)," P'Pool said. "I didn't get free 
until a quarter-mile from the finish. I was waiting on (Hutt Girl) to die, but 
she hung on longer than I thought. I had to pull seven-wide to get by them, but 
I got (Blues For Allah) loose. I thought I'd finish second, but she's got a 
good motor for her size." 
</P>
<P>
 P'Pool drove at Los Alamitos occasionally in 1992, and has also driven in 
Florida and Chicago. This year, he's had more driving opportunities. He and his 
father, Merl, lease four horses who race at Los Alamitos. They spend most 
weekdays in Nipton, near the Nevada border, running a garage and towing 
business in nearby Baker. Their weekends are spent at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Mark P'Pool, his wife, Jan, and his father arrived at Los Alamitos 
before the races Thursday and stayed until Saturday morning. Thursday, they 
qualified Sleep N Sealed for this week's final of the $8,000 Anaheim Pacing 
Series. Friday, in addition to winning with Blues For Allah, they were second 
with Rebel Lee in a conditioned race. Only Rust Never Sleeps, who has hit the 
board once in five starts at Los Alamitos, has been a disappointment during 
this meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The farm is 200 miles from Los Alamitos, but P'Pool said his horses don't mind 
the shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love it," P'Pool said. "I can't separate them. We loaded Sleep N Sealed 
last last week and he was scared he was going to be left (behind). It's comical 
because they go to yelling and screaming. They like it better (training at) the 
farm. In Chicago (last year), I raced at the track and then went to a farm, and 
they raced better from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Blues For Allah, a 4-year-old mare, has been the stable's star this year, 
winning two of six starts and earning $7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week, P'Pool and his father alternately work at the garage, but 
frequently work together with the horses. The animals have been part of Mark's 
life for almost two decades; his father was involved in harness racing, mainly 
in the Midwest but also on the California circuit in the late 1970s and early 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time P'Pool was in high school, he knew what he wanted to do. "If I 
wasn't going to school, I was going to the barn," he said. "I always wanted to 
be a driver." 
</P>
<P>
 He spent several years working with his father, who trained several state-bred 
champions in Illinois. A few years ago, they sold the horses and bought the 
business, but now are considering a jump back into racing . 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to be in racing full time," P'Pool said. "I'm about 85% into it 
now. I'm hoping they get California (harness) racing full time. I'd like to 
race here permanently. In a state as big as this, I can't believe they don't 
have more harness racing." 
</P>
<P>
 P'Pool is a provisional driver, which is harness racing's version of the 
apprentice jockey. To graduate to an A license, which will give him full 
privileges, he needs two more drives to reach the required 25. So far this 
season, he has won four races and is ranked among the top 20 drivers at Los 
Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Becoming an A driver) is kind of like getting your degree," said Peter 
Tommila, one of three stewards presiding over the Los Alamitos harness meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 P'Pool will relocate to Chicago after this meeting, taking three horses from 
his current stable and several others that haven't started yet this year. He 
also leases a farm in Ocala, Fla., that serves as a base when he races at 
Pompano Park, near Miami. Last March, P'Pool and his wife were staying in Ocala 
when a tornado ripped through the property, causing $60,000 in damage. The 
P'Pools were lucky; their horses escaped injury.

 Be Welcome and Maxanali won divisions of the Anaheim Pacing Series last 
Thursday and will square off in this Thursday's $8,000 final. 
</P>
<P>
 Be Welcome has overcome a series of injuries that stopped his career three 
times. This year, the 5-year-old gelding has won four times in six starts. In 
Thursday's elimination, Be Welcome, driven by D.R. Ackerman, took the lead at 
the start and won by 4 1/2 lengths, pacing the mile in 1:58 1/5. Be Welcome is 
owned by Richard Staley of Los Angeles, who paid $25,000 for him at a Kentucky 
yearling sale in 1990. Ackerman's father, Doug, is the trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2, Be Welcome was training for his first race when he was sidelined because 
of a broken splint bone. At 3, he suffered a broken right cannon bone, which 
needed two screws to heal. Last year, at 4, Be Welcome returned to training and 
won his only start, in March at Los Alamitos, before suffering a broken left 
cannon bone. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Be Welcome re-entered training at Del Mar, then finished eighth 
in his first start on Jan. 8. Since then he has won four of five races, 
gradually improving each week. On Feb. 5, he paced a mile in a career-best time 
of 1:56 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The elimination) was a good race," D.R. Ackerman said. "I thought I could 
handle them. He came off the (Feb. 5) race in good shape. He's in another 
series (in March). We'll keep racing him. There's some late-closers at Hazel 
Park (in Michigan) that we might enter him in." 
</P>
<P>
 Staley and the Ackermans also have Brilliant Colors, the top older pacing mare 
of the meeting, who won her third race in six starts in Friday's invitational.

COLLEGE BASEBALL / GARY KLEIN; PARISI HUNTS FOR BIG GAME AT FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bigger the game, the better Mike Parisi pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be the rule for the Cal State Fullerton right-hander, who is 
3-0 with a 0.72 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi, a junior from Arcadia, has beaten Stanford and pitched consecutive 
shutouts against Arizona and Texas. He has helped the third-ranked Titans 
compile a 10-1 record, their best start since 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi has a history of pitching well when it counts most. As a freshman, he 
defeated Louisiana State at Baton Rouge, La., in a NCAA regional game, then 
beat Florida State in the College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he beat San Jose State to give Coach Augie Garrido his 1,000th 
victory and beat Maine in the Central II regional at Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it, but when I look back on it, all of my best games -- even 
in high school -- were against the better teams," said Parisi, who is 18-4 at 
Fullerton. "I guess I'm more focused, but going into those games, I don't 
really do anything differently." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisi is one of several pitchers back from last season who are expected to 
help carry Fullerton to its second College World Series appearance in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into this year, I just wanted to be one of the top pitchers in the 
country," Parisi said. "My work ethic is a step above what it was last year in 
all areas, including lifting weights and eating right. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm starting to open up some eyes. I'm definitely starting to see 
more interest (from pro scouts). Hopefully, I'll handle it the right way." 
</P>

 Trivia time: What USC player was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1965 and 
by the Dodgers in 1966 and 1970, but never played professional baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken up: USC pitcher Ben Tucker's streak of bad luck continued last month 
when he broke his thumb when he fell down a spiral staircase during the 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker, a junior right-hander from Fresno who was slated to be a starter, 
probably will not play until April. Or he may become a redshirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I woke up during the earthquake and tried to get out of my (second floor) 
apartment," Tucker said. "The next thing I knew, I was at the bottom of the 
staircase. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the aftershocks, I've been gripping onto the bed and staying there." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Tucker was sidelined for six weeks because of a broken rib. He 
missed most of a summer league season in Kansas after breaking his hand in a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some teammates call me 'Bad Luck Tuck,' because of all the stuff that has 
happened to me," Tucker said. "Coach (Mike Gillespie) calls me 'Bubble Boy.' 
They think they need to put me in a plastic bubble to keep me ready for the 
last part of the season." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Demolition order: The cinder-block outfield wall at Cal State Northridge was 
damaged in several places during the quake. School officials, busy with more 
serious rebuilding concerns, are still deciding whether the wall will be 
repaired or replaced by a chain-link or wood fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestion: Tear it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall has been a disaster waiting to happen for many years. Several 
outfielders have suffered injuries by colliding with it, and the university has 
been lucky that no one has been killed or suffered a catastrophic head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 For a campus facing millions of dollars in quake-related repairs, an outfield 
wall obviously does not rank as a priority. But when the issue does receive 
consideration, replacing the cinder-block wall with a more forgiving material 
would be a wise investment. 
</P>

 Riptide: Pepperdine pitchers gave up 25 home runs in 58 games last season. In 
its first seven games this season, they surrendered 11 homers and issued 51 
walks in 62 innings. Not surprisingly, Pepperdine started this week with a 3-4 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves will try to get their pitching staff in order this weekend when they 
travel to Texas for a three-game series against the Longhorns.

 Hot water: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, scheduled to move to Division I next 
season, is off to a 6-0 start and ranked No. 1 in Division II by Collegiate 
Baseball magazine despite an internal investigation into the program's 
financing and Coach Steve McFarland. 
</P>
<P>
 McFarland, in his 10th season, admitted in January that he paid six current 
and former players $6,400. The money, McFarland said, was for registration 
fees. McFarland is on paid leave while a university committee conducts its 
probe. The committee's findings will be presented to university officials and 
the NCAA, both of which could levy penalties against the program.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: RECORD BASS WAS CAUGHT OUT OF NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From now through spring, as big bass move into the shallows to spawn, serious 
bass fishermen everywhere will be driven by one thing -- to set an all-tackle 
world record and reap the rewards that such a feat will bring. 
</P>
<P>
 For George Washington Perry, whose 22-pound 4-ounce catch 62 years ago is 
still the fish to beat, the motivation to land a giant bass was more a matter 
of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1912 in the backwoods of Georgia, Perry grew up a poor farm boy before 
the Great Depression, the oldest of six children whose father had died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking care of the family," Perry said during an interview with 
Bassmaster Magazine in the early 1970s. "We lived on a farm and raised lots of 
food. When we needed meat, we went to the woods and killed a deer or a squirrel 
or caught a fish." 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of June 2, 1932, during the Great Depression, Perry awoke to 
the sound of rain. Working the farm was out of the question. Catching a fish 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a friend, Jack Page, drove to nearby Montgomery Lake, which wasn't much 
of a lake then and is even less of one now, a disappearing oxbow on the 
Ocmulgee River. 
</P>
<P>
 They climbed into Perry's flat-bottom boat and shoved off, rowing Montgomery's 
banks and casting to no avail. They were about to call it quits when Perry 
noticed "an interesting ripple" near a cypress log, according to a 1934 account 
in Field & Stream Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry cast and the fish struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I was fast into a real bass," Perry said. "After playing him for about 
two minutes, I brought him close to the boat. Suddenly, he jumped almost clear 
of the water. I had a good look at him and it seemed as though he ought to 
weigh about 50 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite, but after Perry landed the fish, he brought it to a nearby grocery 
store, where it tipped the scale at 22 pounds 4 ounces. It was shaped more like 
a basketball than a fish, with a length of 32 inches and a girth of 28 inches.  
</P>
<P>
 The International Game Fish Assn., which recognizes world records, did not 
exist at the time. But Perry entered his fish in a Field & Stream contest and 
won $75 in prizes, which in itself was quite a catch considering the value of 
the dollar during those hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the fish, Perry proceeded according to plan and put it on the dinner 
table. 
</P>
<P>
 He went on to become an airplane mechanic and pilot, and died at 61 after 
crashing a plane he was flying to Birmingham into a fog-covered mountain.  
</P>
<P>
 Although others have come close to breaking it -- Bob Crupi was the closest 
with a 22.01-pound largemouth caught at Castaic Lake in 1991 -- Perry's record 
stands. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's no secret that mountain lions prey on deer, but state wildlife officials, 
in the second year of a six-year study, are concerned about the impact the 
animals appear to be having on mule deer in the Eastern Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 39 mule deer captured a year ago in the Round Valley area northwest of 
Bishop and fitted with radio collars, 18 didn't survive and 11 were killed by 
mountain lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Vern Bleich, Department of Fish and Game biologist, called the high mortality 
rate "surprising," but said it was too early to determine whether it was 
abnormal. He did say that the mountain lion population appears to be up in the 
Round Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting of mountain lions was banned in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleich said an additional 62 deer were captured and fitted with radio collars 
last month. So far this winter, only one collared deer has died, the victim of 
a bobcat attack.  
</P>
<P>
 The Round Valley herd numbers about 1,000, one-sixth its size before the 
recent drought. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- The striped marlin bite remains outstanding at the Golden Gate 
Banks off Cabo San Lucas, with multiple catches the rule. Tuna fishing is fair 
at best, and dorado are scattered. Some anglers are finding a worthwhile 
alternative fishing slightly beyond the surf along sandy beaches, where 
roosterfish to 35 pounds are providing some challenging action. 
</P>
<P>
 La Paz: There's not much action offshore, but giant pargo are still keeping 
fishermen busy at Cerralvo Island. Local fishermen with hand-lines and tourists 
with state-of-the-art equipment are battling the powerful snappers in the 20- 
to 50-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 HUNTING -- Only nine of the 11 Nelson bighorn sheep tags issued by the DFG 
last summer were filled in the 1993-94 season that ended earlier this month. 
Lee Anderson, a Minnesota banker, paid $100,000 to kill one sheep in the days 
preceding the regular hunt -- a state-record ram that scored 178 3/8 Boone and 
Crockett points. The largest ram killed during the regular hunt was a 177 
1/2-point animal shot by Art Bailey of Santa Ana Ynez in the Marble Mountains 
near Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSERVATION -- Volunteers are needed to help with the hand-restoration of 
vegetation along the banks of the Owens River Gorge. The March 5-6 project, a 
cooperative effort by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and 
California Trout, is aimed at rejuvenating the wild trout fishery in the gorge. 
Details: (310) 475-2195. . . . To help restore facilities at national parks 
around the country, six U.S. gold-mining companies have pledged $20,000 for 
each gold medal won by the U.S. Olympic team. Because of budget restraints, 
facilities at national parks have been steadily deteriorating. Alan. A. Rubin, 
president of the National Park Foundation, said the funds would be put to use 
upon receipt.  
</P>
<P>
 MISCELLANY -- The DFG is still hoping to acquire rubble from last month's 
earthquake to build artificial reefs off the Southland coast, but time is 
running out and the money isn't there. CalTrans is currently trucking the 
material to landfills at a cost of $7 a ton. The DFG's Dave Parker said: "To 
remove material from demolition sites and then barge it to reef sites would 
cost in the neighborhood of $12 a ton." Parker said the financially strapped 
DFG, as it has with past projects, would have to rely on private donations to 
undertake such a project. . . . Eagle Claw Fishing Schools is offering a 2 
1/2-day class to San Martin Island, leaving Friday night aboard the Holiday out 
of Point Loma Sportfishing. Yellowtail and calico bass are the targeted 
species. Cost is $325. Details: (714) 840-6555.

 Glendale High tried to dig its way out of a hole Tuesday night but had it cave 
in on the Dynamiters just as they were climbing over the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dynamiters came back from a horrendous first quarter, when they were 
outscored, 16-2, and had a chance to win in the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Long Beach Jordan forward Chris Sykes sank two free throws with four 
seconds left to give the Panthers a 49-47 victory in a Southern Section 
Division I-AA first-round playoff game at Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Sykes got his chance at the line when Glendale center James Fuller was called 
for a foul by going over the back of Sykes after a rebound of Dynamiter guard 
Manny Gonzalez's missed free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sykes made two free throws, Gonzalez had a desperation shot from 
midcourt bounce off the back of the rim as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was shame to me that a questionable call had to decide a game like this," 
Glendale Coach Bob Davidson said. "I can't imagine a game being decided on a 
call like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (20-7) was down, 47-41, with three minutes left when Gonzalez took 
over. He scored six of his 10 points to tie the score on two free throws with 
1:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the comeback only wound up setting the stage for Sykes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team just told me to take it easy, that it was no big deal," Sykes said. 
</P>
<P>
 That Glendale was even in the game in the fourth quarter was a shock. Jordan 
(11-12) started the game with a zone defense, inviting Glendale to shoot from 
the perimeter, but the Dynamiters missed all seven of their three-point shots 
in the first quarter.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was sheer desperation and willpower that we were able to keep it close and 
get back into it," Davidson said. "Two of our best shooters were obviously 
having off-nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Jose missed all six of his shots in the first quarter, including four 
three-pointers, and finished with eight points. Gonzalez missed all four of his 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Henrik Bandari scored eight of his 13 points in the second quarter as Glendale 
closed to within 23-19 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were shooting so bad in the first quarter," Bandari said. "We had to relax 
and still be confident, get some kind of offense going. I guess it just wasn't 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller had 14 points and eight rebounds. O.J. Jenkins didn't play in the first 
quarter because of disciplinary reasons, but scored 12 points for Jordan.

NOTHING SHAKY ABOUT CSUN'S RETURN HOME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: MATADORS CELEBRATE 
FIRST GAME IN THEIR GYM SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE BY DEFEATING GRAND CANYON, 95-84, 
BEFORE A PALTRY CROWD OF 301. 
</P>

<P>
 So much for basketball providing an entertainment release for students brave 
enough to attend Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Northridge gym Tuesday night, 301 fans gathered to watch the 
Matadors, playing their first home game in six weeks, defeat Grand Canyon 
(Ariz.), 95-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, crowds approaching that size watched with awe and 
amusement as the school's three-tiered parking structure -- without the aid of 
aftershocks -- continued to crumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, they were cheering louder for the building to fall than they were 
later for the Northridge basketball team to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the Matador cheerleaders showed for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who did were made uneasy by a public address announcement 
beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the crowd was told that the gym was safe and "free from any structural 
problems following the Jan. 17 earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the kicker: In the event of an aftershock, the man with the mike 
said, "You may wish to hold the hand or embrace the person next to you, but do 
not panic. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "I was like, 'Don't say that now. We came here to play,' " Grand Canyon Coach 
Leighton McCrary said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the quake-tested veterans on the Northridge side had to react to those 
supposedly reassuring words. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was funny," Matador guard Andre Chevalier said. "If an 
earthquake hit when I was on the floor I'd be out of the building. I'd dribble 
right out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there was no need for that. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Chevalier went dribbling around and through the Grand Canyon defense, 
then riddled it with holes, scoring 25 points. He also made four steals and 
tied career-highs with 11 assists and six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he a gem or what?" McCrary said. "He's the catalyst of that ballclub. He 
has that air about him that he can't be stopped and he can stop you." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end, he did exactly that. Chevalier scored six of Northridge's final 
eight points in the last one minute and five seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (6-16) led by as many as 15 points early in the second half. But 
with 7:18 left, Grand Canyon had trimmed its deficit to 72-70. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes still were in striking distance, down, 88-84, with less than a 
minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier responded by sinking three free throws, then swiping the ball from 
Grand Canyon guard Fredy Gutierrez and racing the length of the floor for a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "He took over," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn McLinn backed Chevalier with 23 points and six assists. Brent Lofton 
added 16 points in 20 minutes off the bench. Peter Micelli and Shawn Stone 
added 13 and 11 points, respectively, for the Matadors, who shot a season-best 
62.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Northridge's shooting success can be attributed to the penetrating and 
passing of Chevalier and McLinn, who routinely knifed through the Grand Canyon 
defense either to set up easy shots for their teammates or make acrobatic shots 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever notice how the shooting percentage goes up when you get inside like 
that?" Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Canyon also provided an example of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shuey, the Antelopes' bulky 6-foot-8 center, scored 20 points without 
making a shot from farther than five feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuey, who Cassidy described as a "big, strong, solid journeyman player," 
looked like Shaquille O'Neal against the defenseless Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge once recruited Shuey. Instead, he chose to attend Utah, then 
transfer to Grand Canyon, which is located near Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked him then," Cassidy said, "and I like him now." 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Pope looked even better. He led the Antelopes (10-13) with 24 points and 
also grabbed a game-high 12 rebounds. Nine of Pope's boards came on the 
offensive end. Grand Canyon had 20 offensive rebounds to Northridge's 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't get anything going on both ends of the floor at the same time," 
Cassidy lamented. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a sub-.500 Division II team, offense was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Northridge was lucky more fans didn't show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy diplomatically blamed the small turnout on parking problems and 
burnout caused by the usual confusion of the first few days of a semester. The 
Northridge campus, such as it is, reopened on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cassidy also admitted, "If we were ranked No. 1, they'd have been 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, who moved into second place on Northridge's career scoring list, 
said he was just happy to be home -- despite a gym left dirty and dusty as the 
result of the crumbling parking structure located only the length of a football 
field away.

 Two Cuban defectors officially joined the Mission College roster Tuesday and 
the impact was immediate. Mission (5-2) defeated Pasadena City, 7-3, in a 
nonconference game at Pasadena and one of the new players hit two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 First baseman Luis Alvarez was three for five with two homers in his Mission 
debut. Left-handed pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez will make his first start today at 
2 p.m. at Harbor in a Harbor-El Camino tournament game. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair, who played on various Cuban national teams, contacted Mission Coach 
John Klitsner and enrolled this semester, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are exceptional," Klitsner said. "They are just way better than 
the typical junior college ballplayer." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players live in Sylmar. Alvarez is a 6-4, 220-pounder who bats 
left-handed. Fernandez is 6 feet, 190. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez is 24 and Fernandez is 23, Klitsner said. They decided to compete this 
season in preparation for the June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission left fielder Dereck Ornelas, a sophomore from Sylmar High, was three 
for four with a homer and drove in two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Ray Rivera (3-0), a freshman from San Fernando High, allowed two 
earned runs and three hits over six innings. STEVE ELLING

CENTURY HOLDS ON FOR FIRST PLAYOFF VICTORY; DIVISION I-A: CENTURIONS TURN BACK 
UNIVERSITY, 63-61, DESPITE ZEIGLER'S 33 POINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Century absorbed a 33-point effort by Demitrius Zeigler and University's 
furious fourth-quarter rally before escaping with the school's first Southern 
Section boys' basketball playoff victory, a 63-61 triumph Tuesday at Century 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Harmon scored 25 points and Ronnie Aristondo added 20 to help Century 
build an 11-point fourth-quarter lead, but the Centurions needed two defensive 
stands in the final 12 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 Century (23-4) will play Friday at Edison, a 65-31 winner over Dana Hills, in 
the Division I-A second round. University finished 14-12. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made the playoffs all four years we've had a varsity team," Century 
Coach Greg Coombs said, "but this is the first victory." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler almost kept Century winless in the playoffs, scoring 14 fourth-quarter 
points, while making 12 of 20 from the field and eight of 10 at the free throw 
line in the game . . . all on a sprained ankle he suffered Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Demi did everything he could to keep us from losing," University Coach Mike 
Dinneen said. "I'm really proud of our kids because we came back and played 
really hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great game, but we came up two points short." 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 seconds remaining and University trailing, 63-61, Zeigler drove from 
the right wing. He drew three defenders when he went up for the shot, but 
Harmon blocked it out of bounds with two seconds remaining. Zeigler never saw 
the ball again and University did not get a shot off as the clock ran out on 
the final in-bounds play. 
</P>
<P>
 "On defense, Curtis Arrington stayed right with Zeigler down the stretch," 
Coombs said. "Zeigler didn't get a real good look at the basket in the final 
minutes, and he still made some of those . . . he's a heck of a player."  
</P>
<P>
 Harmon's blocked shot helped save the game in the end, but his third-quarter 
offensive outburst gave control to Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon scored 14 points in the third quarter, making seven of seven field 
goals in the quarter when Century took a 50-40 lead. The Centurions were 10 of 
12 from the field in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But University got back in the game with an 8-0 run to pull to 53-50 on a 
left-handed hook by Zeigler with five minutes left.

SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I-A BOYS' BASKETBALL; TRAVEL HELPS RELAXED EDISON GET 
THE BEST OF DANA HILLS 
</P>

<P>
 As a result of its 65-31 rout of Dana Hills Tuesday night, Edison has the 
luxury of playing host to Century on Friday in the second round of the Southern 
Section Division I-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it were up to the Chargers, they would probably prefer a trip to 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a joke, but we play better on the road," Edison Coach Larry Hirst said. 
"I don't know whether we're more relaxed or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the Dana Hills' pep band pre-game rendition of the Weather Report 
tune "Birdland" that got visiting Edison in the mood. Whatever it was, the 
Chargers came out groovin'. They scored the first nine points and led, 17-4, 
after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 As Edison showed patience on every possession, Dana Hills (14-12) committed 
nine turnovers and never really had a chance to win the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Edison (16-8) stretched its lead to 38-14 at halftime and played its reserves 
much of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Micah Kroeger, who led all scorers with 16 points, said the 
Chargers, who finished fourth in the Sunset League, might have finally found 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been struggling all year, but that win last week over Servite has 
brought us together," Kroeger said. "This is the best we've played as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were picked to contend for the league title. We have talented players, but 
we haven't played to our potential. But everybody is so unselfish now. If we 
keep playing this way, we have a good chance of beating Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger was joined in double figures by Ali Tofighi, who had 10 points and a 
game-high nine rebounds. Reserve Darrell Adams scored nine points, grabbed two 
rebounds and made four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hefty led Dana Hills with 14 points and four rebounds. No other Dolphin 
had more than four points. DAVE McKIBBEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kentucky Coach Rick Pitino knew it was the best comeback he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was even better than that. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitino's 11th-ranked Wildcats pulled off the greatest comeback in college 
history, rallying from a 31-point deficit Tuesday night to beat Louisiana 
State, 99-95, In Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 That broke a record set on Dec. 30, 1950, when Duke rallied from a 56-27 
halftime deficit to beat Tulane, 74-72. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Pitino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter McCarty hit a three-pointer with 19 seconds to play and gave the 
Wildcats a 96-95 lead, their first since 1-0. McCarty had 23 points for 
Kentucky (19-5, 8-3 Southeastern Conference), which had lost two in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Ronnie Henderson scored 36 points and Clarence Ceasar added 32 for 
the Tigers (11-10, 5-7). 
</P>
<P>
 LSU missed 11 free throws in the last 12 minutes (13 for 24) while Kentucky 
shot almost nothing but three-pointers, sinking 12 of 23 in the second half to 
rally from a 68-37 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it went to 30, we just wanted to make it respectable and not lose our 
confidence," Pitino said. "I told them during a timeout, 'It's not going well 
for us. Everything's going well for them. . . . All you can do is show your 
character.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't enough for Kentucky guard Travis Ford, who had 10 points, 12 
assists and one big motivational speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled everyone together and I said, 'We're down 31 and we're not leaving 
this building without a win,' " Ford said. " 'We're going to win this game no 
matter what. I'll stay here all night.' And everyone said, 'You're right,' and 
everyone stepped up their play." 
</P>
<P>
 LSU called a timeout after McCarty's shot, but Jamie Brandon missed a layup 
with less than five seconds to play. Tony Delk made one free throw and Ford 
added two more to give Kentucky its first victory in Baton Rouge in five tries 
since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 LSU led, 48-32, at halftime and used an 18-0 run to take a 31-point lead 
before the second half was five minutes old, but Kentucky scored 24 of the next 
28 points. The Wildcats cut the lead to 82-74 on McCarty's steal underneath and 
dunk with 6:25 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford made it a six-point game with a scoop shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Brassow cut it to 91-87 with a three-pointer with 2:22 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Brassow hit his fourth three-pointer, this one from 22 feet with a hand in his 
face, to make it 93-90. Ceasar hit two more free throws to make the lead five. 
</P>
<P>
 Delk's three-pointer made it 95-93 and set up McCarty's last-minute heroics 
and LSU's historic frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coached about 200 NBA games and I've coached about 16 years of college and 
I have never, ever seen a comeback on the road like that in my life," Pitino 
said. "Nothing has ever come close to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Villanova 64, No. 3 Connecticut 63 -- Tough defense kept Villanova in the 
game. A gamble at the end sealed the upset victory. 
</P>
<P>
 With two seconds to play and the Wildcats trailing by two points at Villanova, 
Pa., Eric Eberz stopped outside a clear lane and sank a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole game our defense was doing it," said Eberz, who had 12 points and 
was two for eight from three-point range. "But at the end, I was almost too 
open and the ball just came to me. Somehow it just happened." 
</P>
<P>
 UConn (21-3, 11-2 Big East) was the highest-ranked team the Wildcats (11-9, 
7-6) have beaten in their nine years at duPont Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 UConn had a 42-28 rebound advantage and shot 50% in the second half but 
committed 22 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were living on the edge," Coach Jim Calhoun said. "These things happen 
when you do that." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's 81, No. 10 Massachusetts 80 -- Kevin Connor's free throw with 0.2 
seconds to play at Philadelphia gave St. Joseph's an upset victory and UMass 
its first Atlantic 10 loss this season. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joseph's (11-11, 3-9) had lost seven in a row to Massachusetts (19-5, 
10-1) by an average of 16.7 points, the Hawks' last victory coming on Feb. 17, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin Warley, who injured his neck Sunday against Rhode Island, led St. 
Joseph's with 23 points. Lou Roe had 22 points for Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 14 Syracuse 79, Providence 74 -- Adrian Autry put back his own missed free 
throw with 55 seconds to play to cap a 14-point comeback for the Orangemen at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse (17-4, 9-4 Big East) added six consecutive free throws in the final 
33 seconds to lock up its 10th home victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Providence (12-8, 5-7) led, 52-38, with 16:41 to play before wilting. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Marquette 55, Virginia Tech 48 -- Jim McIlvaine had 18 points, nine 
rebounds and five blocks at Blacksburg, Va., as the Warriors (17-6) held 
Virginia Tech (13-8) without a field goal over the final 5:58.

<P>
 Market Overview * U.S. stocks rose as buyers returned, unfazed by worries 
about a U.S.-Japan trade war. Most foreign stock markets stabilized after 
Monday's slide. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar recovered some of its Monday plunge against the Japanese yen, as 
dealers took a breather and waited for the next phase in the U.S.-Japan trade 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields ended largely unchanged. California sold $3.2 billion 
in short-term notes. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Investors were encouraged to bargain hunt as bond and currency markets 
stabilized, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials rose 24.21 points to 3,928.27 in active trading, as 
winners topped losers by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks also advanced, rising 4.67 
points to 790.12. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market's quick recovery after its slump late last week 
illustrated a strong underlying level of confidence on the part of investors. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, with the U.S.-Japan trade dispute heating up, "The market had every 
excuse to get hurt," said Bruce Bittles, strategist at J.C. Bradford. Instead, 
the Dow gained 9 points Monday, setting the stage for Tuesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite fears of an all-out trade war, many investors believe the United 
States will eventually prevail in opening Japanese markets to outside goods, 
experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the meantime, a side effect of the current dispute -- a weak dollar -- 
is bullish for U.S. companies that export to Japan and other countries 
worldwide because it automatically cuts the prices of U.S. exports. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Japanese market appeared to be stabilizing early today. Tokyo's 
Nikkei stock index was up 159.51 points to 19,134.11 at midday, after plunging 
531.45 points on Monday and 484.65 points on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Asia early today, Singapore's Straits Times index was up 10.96 points 
to 2,340.49, and Bangkok's SET index gained 14.97 points to 1,428.94. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other foreign markets, London's FTSE-100 index rose 29.7 points to 
3,393.20 on Tuesday, while Frankfurt's DAX index eased 0.39 point to 2,115.62. 
</P>
<P>
 Among U.S. market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dow was pulled higher by AlliedSignal, up 1 3/4 to 79 3/4; Goodyear, up 
1 1/2 to 47 1/2; McDonald's, up 1 1/4 to 61 3/4, and 3M Co., up 2 5/8 to 108 
1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industrial issues continuing to gain on optimism about the economy 
included Dover, up 1 1/4 to 61 1/2; Ameron, up 1 to 41 1/2; Trinova, up 1 3/4 
to 38 3/4; ITT, up 4 to 100 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks also rallied. Intel gained 1 1/8 to 65, Motorola 
advanced 2 1/8 to 101 3/8 and Texas Instruments zoomed 2 7/8 to 76 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the takeover arena, United Healthcare fell 5/8 to 85 after agreeing to 
buy Ramsay-HMO in a stock swap. Ramsay jumped 9 3/8 to 55 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, industrial pump maker BWIP gained 1/4 to 18 1/2. An 
agency of the Singaporean government disclosed that it has taken an 8.4% stake 
in the firm, for investment purposes. BWIP said it was unaware of the stake 
until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, personal-planner maker Day Runner shot up 1 1/2 to 15 on a strong 
quarterly earnings report. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bargain hunters helped boost the U.S. dollar after its huge selloff Monday, 
when traders dumped dollars on concerns that the Clinton Administration may 
drive the American currency lower against the Japanese yen after last week's 
breakdown of trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar finished in New York at 103.85 yen, up from 102.65 on Monday, its 
lowest closing level since last Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 At midday today in Tokyo, the dollar was at 103.30 yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the dollar got an additional lift Tuesday after the government 
reported that industrial production rose in January, pointing to continuing 
economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, reports that Bank of Japan bought more than $1 billion worth of 
dollars for yen on Tuesday discouraged dollar sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 But many traders still believe the dollar is poised to test the 100-yen level, 
if trade friction with Japan isn't resolved soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields were mostly flat. The 30-year T-bond yield was 
unchanged at 6.45%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cash-strapped California sold a record $3.2 billion in short-term notes to 
help fund state operations through the end of the current fiscal year and to 
pay off part of its long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The state sold $1.2 billion in notes at an average interest rate of 3.02% and 
$2 billion at an average rate of 2.81%. The first series will mature on Dec. 
21, the second on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the Comex, near-term gold futures fell 10 cents to $383.80 an ounce. 
Silver lost 8.8 cents to $5.26. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil eased further. March light sweet crude futures fell 7 cents to $14.06 a 
barrel, following Monday's 59-cent drop.

 GETTING HUSTLED: Local transportation chief Stan Oftelie couldn't believe it: 
The March issue of Hustler magazine depicts a young au naturel couple kissing 
while riding on an Orange County bus. The name was gone, so it's not like the 
whole world is laughing about Orange County. But to locals, there was no 
mistaking the distinctive striping. . . . Oftelie's explanation: "Apparently 
this was a bus we gave last year to the Pacific West Bus Museum. It's 
disturbing. We're looking into how it happened. In the future, we probably 
won't let buses go like that unless they remove the striping." 
</P>
<P>
 GETTING KICKS: With the World Cup just months away, local soccer interest 
keeps growing. The new Garden Grove Arena Soccer Park, off Westminster Avenue, 
will be dedicated Wednesday night at 7, open to the public with free hot dogs 
and plenty of speeches. . . . It has two soccer fields -- lighted for night 
games -- one for youngsters and another for adults. They won't be idle often: 
Ninety teams have already signed up to play. 
</P>
<P>
 YOUTH MOVE: There's a new AIDS awareness symbol catching on among young people 
here. The dot in its circle represents the virus. And the slogan promoting it: 
"Where do you draw the line?" . . . It comes from the local group Art for 
Life's Sake. And some 250 paper-plate copies were on display at a Sunny Hills 
High assembly on Tuesday. Students had written AIDS-related suggestions on the 
back. One plate read: "Stay young, stay home, drink Pepsi, and stay a virgin." 
</P>
<P>
 SOUND DRIVING: Here's the latest in reducing freeway traffic noise: Caltrans 
has put up along the Santa Ana Freeway near the Grand Avenue exit 100 feet of 
its new, recycled-plastic sound wall. Environmentalists are happy, and it's 
supposed to absorb sound better than the usual freeway brick walls. . . . Also: 
Graffiti removal is easier, reducing hazardous duty time for Caltrans workers 
who have to scrape the stuff off.

STATE HIGH COURT REFUSES TO STOP MEDFLY SPRAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court cleared the way Tuesday for the aerial spraying of the 
Medfly-killing insecticide malathion over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and 
Norco later that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather conditions seemed ideal for the 3 1/2-hour flyovers, in which droplets 
of malathion-laced corn syrup were to be spewed over residential neighborhoods, 
businesses, parks and farms by three helicopters flying at 400 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Another desperate appeal by the city of Corona -- filed Tuesday in Riverside 
Superior Court and claiming that the state's public notification of the 
spraying was illegally broad -- failed to stop the spraying. Judge Victor 
Miceli immediately rejected the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 So Corona city officials, 0 for 4 in legal attempts to stop the aerial 
spraying and unable to win a last-minute reprieve from Gov. Pete Wilson, said 
they are preparing to sue the state for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will cost us $100,000 or better to send crews out to hose down the parks 
and schools," complained Corona Councilman Jeff Bennett. "I'm advising every 
resident to file a damage claim against the state. This is . . . wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 State agricultural officials said the unpopular aerial spraying is necessary 
to stop the insidious march of the Medfly into rich farmlands, jeopardizing the 
state's $18-billion agricultural industry. Japan and other export markets have 
threatened to boycott California citrus and other vulnerable crops if the 
infestation spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Tuesday, Corona officials had lost two lower court battles to stop the 
spraying, unsuccessfully claiming that the state failed to abide by its own 
environmental laws by not studying the long-term health effects of the garden 
variety insecticide, and that Wilson technically erred in declaring a state 
emergency because of the pest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson refused to ground the helicopters. The Superior Court judge said he 
would not challenge the governor's decision and ruled that malathion was safe. 
</P>
<P>
 An appellate court agreed, and added that the need for the eradication is 
obvious. The state Supreme Court on Tuesday, without comment, refused to 
consider the city's appeal. Finally on Tuesday, the same Riverside Superior 
Court judge rejected the final argument that the spray-notification process was 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 So despite three false starts -- caused by court delays and inclement weather 
-- the three helicopters were prepped for flights Tuesday at March Air Force 
Base near Riverside, where they were under military guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters had threatened to release helium-filled balloons to thwart the 
helicopters but decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of malathion to be released amounted to 1.2 fluid ounces per acre 
-- a weaker dose than would likely be used by back yard gardeners and 
commercial growers if they were to battle the Medfly on their own, state 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentration is half that used in 1989-90 when more than 500 square miles 
of Southern California were sprayed by air, and officials believed the effort 
had gotten rid of the pests. But the Medfly reappeared in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the current infestation in the Los Angeles Basin, about 500 million 
sterile Medflies will be released weekly in a 1,500-square-mile area 
encompassing parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials said some of those flies should have been reserved for use in 
western Riverside County as well. But the state said there were not enough 
sterile Medflies to blanket Corona as well, so the aerial spraying was a 
necessary last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with the public outcry against the spraying, state officials said 
the droplets are not dangerous on contact -- although they may stain car paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly is killed after eating the bait, but the malathion is too weak to 
affect horses and other livestock, state pesticide experts say. At worst, 
people exposed to the insecticide-bait mixture may experience a short-lived 
rash, medical experts have said. Critics have contended that malathion 
exacerbates chronic fatigue syndrome and other maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of an estimated 15,000 horses in the region have complained that their 
animals might be spooked by the low-flying helicopters, and the state 
recommended that the horses be hobbled or otherwise restrained. 
</P>
<P>
 Between eight and 10 aerial applications are scheduled in the next four months 
in an effort by the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project to rid the 
Mediterranean fruit fly from Corona and Norco. A mated female Medfly was 
discovered in a trap there in December.

SORRELL BOOKE; TV, STAGE AND MOVIE ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sorrell Booke, stage, film and television actor best known for his role as the 
corn-pone Jefferson Davis (Boss) Hogg on the long-running series "The Dukes of 
Hazzard," has died. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Booke died Friday at his home in Sherman Oaks of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the corpulent, white-suited mayor of Hazzard, Booke proved a durable 
favorite on the CBS series that ran from 1979 to 1985. Adept with languages and 
dialects, the Buffalo-born Booke said he copied Hogg's Southern drawl from U.S. 
Sens. Sam Erwin and Strom Thurmond. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was educated at Columbia and the Yale School of Drama and had 
appeared in such tony Broadway productions as "King Lear" and "Caligula," Booke 
never looked down on his role as the laughable nemesis of the Duke boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acting is acting," he said, "whether you are doing Hazzard or Hamlet." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Buffalo, Booke entertained patients in the waiting room of his 
father, a doctor. By age 9, he was on local radio. He performed in summer stock 
and student plays throughout his years at Columbia and Yale. 
</P>
<P>
 Booke was known throughout his career for his ability to use makeup, padding 
and disguises to portray characters of various ages and sizes. 
</P>
<P>
 After military service, Booke worked in off-Broadway plays including "The 
White Devil." In 1956, he made his Broadway debut in Michael Redgrave's 
production of "The Sleeping Prince." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 100 plays and musicals in which he had major roles were 
"Fiorello!", "Purlie Victorious," "Finian's Rainbow," "Heartbreak House," 
"Annie Get Your Gun," "An Enemy of the People" and "Morning, Noon and Night." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and '70s, Booke was in several films, including "Gone Are the 
Days," "Fail Safe," "Black Like Me," "Up the Down Staircase," "What's Up Doc?," 
"The Iceman Cometh" and "The Other Side of Midnight." 
</P>
<P>
 He first appeared on television in the respected 1950s series "Omnibus" and 
over three decades amassed credits in about 200 shows, including "Dr. Kildare," 
"M.A.S.H.," "Columbo," "The Rockford Files," "Gunsmoke," "Mission: Impossible," 
and as Archie Bunker's boss in "All in the Family." 
</P>
<P>
 Booke's hobby was redecorating old houses, and he had spent the last decade 
redesigning and renovating his Sherman Oaks home. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by a daughter, Alexandra, of Los Angeles; a son, Nicholas, of 
Irvington, N.Y.; a brother, Frederick, of Los Angeles, and one grandson.

EMPLOYEE OPENS FIRE IN TULSA RESTAURANT, WOUNDING 6 PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fast-food restaurant employee, apparently angry that a manager asked him to 
start work early, opened fire Tuesday, wounding the boss and five other people, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Muriel Thompson, 26, who fired about a dozen shots, walked out of 
Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers as the first police cruisers arrived and 
surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a back table and didn't get to get out," said high school student 
Jenny Edwards. "He started shooting all my friends. And then he came to me and 
held the gun right in my face. And he said, 'You better be awful lucky.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, who had a .380-caliber handgun, asked Edwards if she believed in 
God. "I said yes. He said, 'The clip is out,' " she told radio station KVOO. 
"And then he started running toward the front." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Edwards' fellow students at East Central High School were among the 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson went to the restaurant before his shift was to begin and was asked to 
start working immediately because of the lunch-hour rush, Sgt. Steve Emmons 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had some kind of disagreement with the manager first, in the office area," 
Emmons said. "Then he came out in the seating area and had everybody lie down. 
He hesitated a bit, then just started firing." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-worker Krystal Shaw, who was not in the restaurant during the shooting, 
said Thompson argued frequently with one shift manager, but it was not clear 
whether that manager was among those wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Kimbrough, another manager at the restaurant, said he was not aware of 
any problems between the 20 employees and management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the one who makes out the schedules and the one who makes out the raises 
and stuff like that," he said. "We didn't have any problems." 
</P>

 But a police spokeswoman added: "What we're hearing is he (Thompson) came in 
early and was expecting a pay raise and didn't get it."

 One of the wounded was shot five times in the stomach and was in listed in 
stable condition. Another victim was in serious condition with a gunshot wound 
to the head, three people were in fair condition, and one person was treated at 
a hospital and released.

NUNS PRESS CONCERNS OVER LANDFILL; OXNARD: THEY HIRE ATTORNEY AND SAY COUNTY 
HASN'T ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED COMPLAINTS. THEY WANT TO BE RELOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Convinced that their interests have been ignored, a group of Catholic nuns who 
live in a convent next to the Bailard Landfill in Oxnard have hired an attorney 
to force the county to pay for their relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The convent, which has housed the Servants of Mary order for 33 years, sits 
only about 500 feet away from the dump. Earlier this month the Ventura County 
Planning Commission voted to extend the life of the landfill for three more 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commission assured the nuns that their concerns would be 
addressed, the nuns said Tuesday they have had enough of the noise, odor and 
dust that come from the dump. They want to move and they want the county to pay 
for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has offered to buy an air filter for the convent to control the 
odors and dust, install insulation to muffle the noise, and pay the nuns 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, instead of going along with the county's decisions as they have 
in the past, the nuns say the offer is not acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't complain," said Sister Mary Purificacion. "We haven't complained for 
30 years. But you have to fight for yourselves sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns left the decision about renewing the permit up to the commission, 
saying they trusted the commission's fairness and integrity. After the 
commission's 3-2 vote, however, the nuns decided they made a mistake in not 
speaking up for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was naive of us to expect someone to look out for our interests," said 
Jodi Rupp, an administrator at a convalescent hospital run by the sisters in 
Newbury Park. "The nuns are being victimized possibly because they're 
unsophisticated at this sort of thing. Their role in life is to care for the 
sick, not read all the literature about the dangers of this dump." 
</P>
<P>
 On a medallion that each of the nuns wears are the Latin words for "Heal the 
sick." Women who enter the 140-year-old Catholic order pledge to care for the 
ill and infirm. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 nuns who live at the Oxnard convent work for free in the homes of 
people dying of cancer or bedridden at home. In Newbury Park, the Servants of 
Mary run a convalescent hospital for about 60 elderly Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard convent is special, the nuns say, because it is the only one of the 
order's six convents in the United States that trains new nuns, giving them a 
three-year religious education that provides the foundation for their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a peaceful environment for prayer and contemplation," said Sister 
Bernadette, who lives at the convent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Bernadette said the smell and noise from the dump have become nearly 
intolerable as the mountain of trash at the landfill has risen to nearly 120 
feet high. Each day the county dumps as much as 1,000 tons of trash at Bailard. 
The permit to operate the facility was set to expire in December, but with the 
defeat last June of a proposal to open a new landfill at Weldon Canyon near 
Ojai, the county extended it, saying it has few other choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is no other option outside of trucking the trash to the Simi 
Valley Landfill or to one near the L. A. County line," said John Conaway, an 
administrator with the Ventura Regional Sanitation District. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaway said the nuns' concerns can be addressed adequately without the 
convent moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's happening is that they don't know who to trust," Conaway said. 
"They've come into this process kind of late, and they're not sure about our 
mitigation proposals. What we need to do is sit down and discuss how we can 
address their concerns. I think they'll be making a mistake if they move. 
They'll never duplicate the environment and beautiful grounds they have there. 
It won't be the same, and really there's no reason for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns argue that while the air filter and sound insulation would protect 
them indoors, nothing will protect them when they head outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't go outside, it's like being in jail," said Sister Bernadette as 
she watched some of the younger nuns playing badminton and Frisbee on the 
grounds of the convent.  
</P>
<P>
 "The younger nuns need to be able to go outside and be active," she added. 
"You can't do that if you have to cover your nose all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns said they are also concerned about long-term health effects from the 
dump. Rupp said their concern grew after they read the final environmental 
report on the extension of the landfill's permit, which outlined some potential 
health risks. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we read the reports and realized all the potential health concerns, we 
became very depressed," Rupp said. "These sisters have a right to health and a 
clean and safe environment. These sisters give up their families, friends and 
their independence to take care of everyone they come in contact with. They 
deserve to be taken care of too."

SUPERVISORS GET TOUGHER WITH SOLO DRIVERS; AIR POLLUTION: UNDER DIRECTIVE FOR 
COUNTY WORKERS, MEASURES SUCH AS CAR-POOLING ARE LINKED TO EMPLOYMENT 
CONDITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday decided to take a tougher 
approach to getting county employees out of their cars in order to curb air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous decision, the supervisors voted to make it a condition of 
employment that, at least one day a week, county workers must car-pool, ride a 
bus or find another way to work other than driving solo. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, however, has not decided how to implement its new directive or what 
penalties to levy against those who don't car-pool. The panel is expected to 
take up the issue again next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you set it up as a condition of employment, that final step could be 
termination," said Alan Bandoli, Ventura County employee transportation 
coordinator. "It will be up to the board." 
</P>
<P>
 In related actions, board members decided not to renew a cash-incentive 
program and to encourage more telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although about 1,500 of the county's 6,700 employees car-pool at least once a 
week, Supervisor Maggie Kildee said, "We need to get the cars off the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Rule 210 -- the county's strict trip-reduction ordinance adopted to help 
reduce air pollution -- businesses and agencies employing 100 or more people 
must provide incentives to reduce the number of people driving alone to work. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the supervisors said they are frustrated that the law puts 
pressure on the employers rather than the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The onus has to be shifted from the employer to the employees," Supervisor 
Maria VanderKolk said. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk advocated financial penalties for employees who do not find an 
alternate mode of transportation to work at least once a week. The board also 
voted unanimously to make department managers responsible for coming up with 
ideas to implement the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials on Tuesday said they are dubious about the success of such a 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Hammitt, executive director of the Service Employees International 
Union, Local 998, said, "Without incentives, I don't hold out a lot of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Hammitt said some employees might have a difficult time complying with the new 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole lot of problems," he said. "What do you do with people who 
have physical disabilities, or who live in areas where there is no public 
transportation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chief County Counsel James McBride said the board has the authority to impose 
such a condition of employment, though union contracts might have to be 
renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors had earlier asked Bandoli to devise alternatives to the 
cash-incentive plan as a means of saving money. From 1990 to November, 1993, 
the county paid workers $250 to $300 annually to car-pool, ride a bus, bicycle 
or walk to work an average of three days a week for 48 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The county spent about $330,000 annually on the program, Bandoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandoli had recommended that the board approve a series of programs aimed at 
reaching a higher ride-share goal but said he did not expect the board to take 
a more stringent position. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandoli said he will look at ideas such as making employees pay higher parking 
fees if they drive to work alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You make people make an economic choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is in compliance with the current mandate at 1.38 people per car. 
Under state law, if the average ridership does not reach 1.5 people per car by 
1997, the county could be fined up to $25,000 daily, Bandoli said.

ARGUMENTS IN DEATH PENALTY CASE CONCLUDED; TRIAL: OXNARD MAN IS CHARGED WITH 
KIDNAPING, RAPE AND MURDER. HE COULD GET GAS CHAMBER OR 25 YEARS TO LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers in the first Ventura County death penalty case in more than two years 
wrapped up their closing arguments Tuesday and left the jury to grapple with 
two questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Was Genoveva Gonzales shot to death after a drugs-for-sex deal turned violent? 
Or was she killed to cover up the fact that she had been kidnaped and raped? 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury finds the latter to be true, 24-year-old Christopher James 
Sattiewhite of Oxnard will face a second trial that could send him to the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, Sattiewhite could face no more than 25 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sattiewhite is charged with murder, kidnaping and rape in connection with the 
Jan. 26, 1992, slaying of Gonzales, the mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have admitted that Sattiewhite killed Gonzales. But they 
deny that the slaying was during the commission of either a rape or kidnaping, 
which the prosecution has to prove in order for him to face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Willard P. Wiksell told the jury of four men and eight women 
that the prosecution failed to prove during Sattiewhite's three-week trial that 
the defendant is guilty of anything more than killing Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of testimony, a lot of witnesses," Wiksell said. "But there is 
no evidence of a rape or kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said the only reason Sattiewhite put a pistol to Gonzales' head and 
squeezed the trigger three times was to conceal the fact that the woman had 
been raped by Sattiewhite's accomplice, Fred Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Christopher Sattiewhite executed the only witness who could tie them to the 
rape," Glynn said. "This was an execution to remove a witness." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Judge Lawrence Storch's courtroom will begin deliberating on the 
issue this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn told the jury that prosecutors had proved that the victim indeed had 
been kidnaped and raped before her death.  
</P>
<P>
 Glynn told jurors that prosecutors only needed to link Sattiewhite to the rape 
and kidnap and not to prove that he was the one who executed them. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the defendant and Jackson, who has not yet been charged but is in 
prison on another rape case, abducted Gonzales at an unknown location in 
Oxnard. At some point, Jackson raped the struggling woman in the back seat of a 
Cadillac while Sattiewhite stood close by, Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not consensual sex," Glynn told the jury. "This was rape, and 
Christopher Sattiewhite aided and abetted. He facilitated the rape." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has said that Sattiewhite killed Gonzales only after being ordered 
to do so by Jackson, whom they say Sattiewhite feared. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glynn described Sattiewhite as a callous killer who murdered the woman on 
his own accord after dragging her from the back seat of the car and to the 
ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Glynn said that after lowering the unconscious woman to the ground, 
Sattiewhite "has to bend down on his knees, and he fires once, twice, three 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not an impulsive act. This was not an act triggered by the heat of 
the moment," Glynn said. "He did a cold-blooded act that was nothing less than 
first-degree murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Wiksell, however, said that on the night of her death, 
Gonzales left the house looking for men with whom to trade sex for money or 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Mr. Glynn stands up here and says she was not a prostitute, that's utter 
nonsense," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said she voluntarily got into the car because she knew Jackson. "Why did 
she go with Mr. Jackson?" Wiksell said. "Because she had no money and went to 
get dope." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell said Gonzales and Jackson engaged in voluntary sex in the rear of the 
car and that the woman spat on Jackson when he refused to give her dope 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 That is when Jackson knocked the woman unconscious, then ordered Sattiewhite 
to shoot her, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a prostitute spits on you, you get real mad," Wiksell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell also tried to discredit Bobby Rollins, Sattiewhite's former roommate, 
who was the only prosecution witness to testify to seeing the murder. Rollins 
said that he saw Jackson rape the woman and that Sattiewhite was aware of the 
rape as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wiksell noted that Rollins was not charged in the case, although he 
acknowledged going with the defendants after the killing. He also told the jury 
that Rollins was not credible because prosecutors have promised to shave 30 
years off a possible 50-year sentence in an unrelated rape case for his 
testimony in the Sattiewhite murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy didn't hit a home run. He hit a grand slam," Wiksell said of 
Rollins. "He got free on this case. He got 30 years lopped off in another one, 
and he's going to be out and walking the streets among us in eight years, 
thanks to the generosity of the district attorney's office."

FATE OF POSSIBLE CHUMASH ARTIFACTS TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Native Americans, archeologists and Ventura County officials will meet today 
to determine what to do with a new find of possible Chumash artifacts 
discovered recently at the site of a road improvement project near Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The find, a series of smooth, rounded stones in a semi-circular pattern, marks 
the second major discovery at the site on Santa Rosa Road since a human tooth 
and bone fragments were unearthed Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The stones were found about two weeks ago during construction of a trench to 
be used by archeologists and officials from Native American groups to further 
study the sacred and historical significance of the location. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to meet to formulate a plan as to what to do with this site," said 
Larry Myer, executive secretary of the California Native American Heritage 
Commission. "From what we have been told, this could very well be a very 
important find." 
</P>
<P>
 W. Butch Britt, the county's deputy director of public works, said county-paid 
archeologists are digging a 200-foot-long trench at the site to allow officials 
a chance to examine the area more fully. Work on the two- to three-foot-deep 
trench is about three-quarters complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are attempting to be as thorough with this as we can be," Britt said. "But 
the problem is that we are more than two months behind in this project and that 
it has cost us more than $20,000 to find out what's there. That figure is 
growing each day." 
</P>
<P>
 Road improvements are continuing at another location and the archeological dig 
has not resulted in any construction delays, Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tooth and human bone fragments found at the site may have been among 
remains in a burial urn, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces have been carefully reburied in Chumash tribal custom under the 
direction of an Ojai woman deemed by the commission as the most likely to be a 
descendant of the deceased person, Myer said. The commission made that 
determination based on interviews, a genealogy search and the location of the 
burial site, commission officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the woman and the location of the new burial site were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one archeologist who studied the Santa Rosa Road site in December 
and January, evidence appears to be mounting that it is a former Chumash burial 
ground and may be the site of a long-lost Chumash village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a graveyard and we have tried to tell that to the county," said Renee C. 
Fraser, a Simi Valley-based archeologist. "Present work on the site indicates 
that there may be the remains of as many as eight people there, probably more. 
This is something that the county clearly doesn't want to hear about." 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser said the discovery of the stones and their placement in the ground 
indicates the location may have been a cremation site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't seen the new find, but it sounds from the description of the stones 
that they found another cremation chamber," Fraser said. "I'd have to see it to 
be sure, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Britt, however, said the county remains willing to continue working with the 
commission and other state and local Native American groups to resolve the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do what's right," Britt said. "But we also want to fix a road that 
a lot of people use that isn't really safe. We have a responsibility to the 
people who use that road." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10,000 motorists a day use the hilly, two-lane road, according to 
county estimates. The construction work, being completed in three phases, is 
designed to smooth out many of the road's blind hills and curves and to widen 
its lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the 11-mile-long road started in 1990 and is scheduled to be completed 
sometime next year at a cost of about $5 million.

 An inadvertent kick in the buns: Let's begin by apologizing to the 
Weinermobile. (What a way to start the day.) As you might recall, we reported 
that one of Oscar Mayer's motorized frankfurters had been spotted on the Harbor 
Freeway, receiving a ticket from a Highway Patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinermobile pilot Denise Schroeck phoned to say the officer was only 
giving her a warning. "We didn't have our front license plate on," she 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 And was she relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were in a real. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 No, Schroeck, don't say it. . . .

 Up to no good: Former state Sen. Paul Carpenter's apparent flight from the 
country to avoid a jail sentence prompted Thomas Pleasure to recall the 
colorful story of a Venice city official who went on the lam. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Venice was once a city. The fugitive was City Treasurer James Peasgood, 
whose downfall began when an independent audit of the city's near-bankrupt 
government was ordered in 1923.  
</P>
<P>
 Peasgood was soon reported "overdue on a fishing vacation to Oxnard," 
historian Jeffrey Stanton wrote. Suspicious authorities "opened his safe 
deposit box and found $28,500 in securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Peasgood surrendered and confessed to embezzling "to supplement his 
$135-per-month salary and pay his gambling losses," Stanton wrote. An audit 
found $19,000 missing and he was sent away to San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 Peasgood is memorialized in Pleasure's 1994 Venice of America historical 
calendar. And why not? Dissatisfied with officials such as him, Venetians voted 
in 1925 to become a part of L.A., skateboard paths and all.

 Chimney heap: "What better way to rebound from the quake than through humor?" 
writes Peggy Edwards of Valencia, who lost the front wall of her house, 
including the chimney. 
</P>

 Edwards has been carrying around two cheery items in her briefcase. One was an 
Only in L.A. photo of a sign outside a flattened home that said, "We Should 
Have Used Lego!"  
</P>
<P>
 The other, which she sent to us, was a flyer left on her doorstep the day of 
the quake. It said: "$39 Special for a Chimney Sweep . . . Joseph Perez's Top 
Hat Chimney Service." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards phoned the company and found out that it also performs chimney 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them if they inspected a little closer," she said, "they'd find there 
was no chimney."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JUDGE WON'T RELEASE 2 HELD IN PARK 
BRAWL

<P>
 A Ventura County judge on Tuesday refused to release into the custody of their 
parents two out-of-county juveniles charged in connection with a brawl near 
Westlake High School that wounded three students. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Steven Z. Perren ordered the two 16-year-olds to remain 
locked up pending further proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the teen-agers is from Brea in Orange County and the other lives in 
Rowland Heights in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teen-agers, as well as two other juveniles from Ventura County, were 
charged after the Feb. 3 brawl in which the suspects and others jumped out of 
cars at North Ranch Park in Westlake and attacked a crowd of students, 
authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the defendants and a Westlake High football player were to meet at the 
park for a fistfight. Instead, authorities and witnesses said, the defendants 
emerged from their car and announced, "We're the Asian Mafia." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants -- all Asian -- then attacked a crowd of students with bats, 
lumber and gunfire, investigators said. All the injured students have been 
released from local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignments for the four defendants are scheduled for Thursday morning before 
Perren. Prosecutors have asked that all be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Perren has ordered probation officials to investigate the background of each 
defendant to help him determine whether they should be tried in the adult 
system. Hearings on that issue will be held later. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney for one of the teen-agers has said his client participated in the 
incident because he had been a victim of racial and physical harassment by the 
football player.  
</P>
<P>
 The player's father denied that allegation. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CLUB OWNER ATTACKS CITY'S ANTI-GAY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old policy on live entertainment that discriminates against gays and 
lesbians should be stricken from city regulations, a Ventura club owner 
contends. 
</P>
<P>
 City Resolution No. 6593, adopted June 3, 1968, states that owners of clubs 
"shall not permit any person to dance with another person of the same sex" or 
hire entertainers "whose conduct encourages, promotes or condones the 
congregating of homosexuals, lesbians or persons pretending to be such." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the eight-page resolution also forbids shows featuring female 
impersonators, unless a special permit is obtained from the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Gaffaney, who recently opened the bar Lipstix, catering to lesbians, said 
he discovered the wording Friday after requesting an entertainment permit. 
Along with the permit application, the city routinely sent him a copy of the 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably never come out of the closet," he said. "But it should be 
stricken nonetheless. It's discriminatory in its language and in its intent." 
</P>
<P>
 After being asked about the resolution, City Clerk Barbara Kam said the city 
attorney will review it and recommend changes. It would be up to the City 
Council to adopt a revised resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said the policy has not been changed previously because no one has 
challenged it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old, old regulation," she said. "Social standards have changed 
significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the wording on same-sex couples, the resolution also forbids 
performers from singing obscene words or from performing skits that would 
discredit religious groups or law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kam said the resolution would not stop the city from issuing an entertainment 
permit to Lipstix, at 577 E. Main St., in the space of the old Bermuda Triangle 
bar. A resolution is a city policy, rather than an ordinance, which carries the 
power of a law. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our goal to inhibit people's ability to do those things they're 
constitutionally allowed to do," she said. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SENIORS REVEL IN NEIGHBORHOOD MARDI 
GRAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Marguerite Kasson watched the floats and listened to the music of Mardi 
Gras in Thousand Oaks on Tuesday, she recalled the time she was invited to New 
Orleans for the real festival in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bought my dresses and I was all excited, but the war got in the way and I 
couldn't make it," Kasson said. "I'm 81 years old and this is my first Mardi 
Gras." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasson was one of about 200 senior citizens and their friends who celebrated 
the age-old festival of excess at the Castle Hill Retirement Village in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration, while on a smaller scale than its New Orleans counterpart, 
was quite close to authentic, according to its organizer, Donna Pierson. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierson, a native of New Orleans and an administrator at the senior village, 
began throwing the festival four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knew what it was all about," Pierson recalled. "I had to explain 
everything, but these folks caught on quick." 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's event, the participants waved traditional Mardi Gras signs, threw 
beads in the street and danced to Cajun music, Pierson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We even had a resident who was a Hollywood costume designer help people with 
their outfits," she said. "It's really a wonderful reproduction." 
</P>
<P>
 Those familiar with the event seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Tina Kuehl, a Calabasas resident who traveled to 
Thousand Oaks so her two children could get a taste of the carnival. "I'm from 
south of New Orleans and it's great to have something like this to remind me of 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who knew little about Mardi Gras enjoyed the event, which is 
planned and run by the 80-person staff of the senior village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to spend a sunny afternoon," said Bobbie Palmer, 70, who 
moved into the neighborhood in December. "It gives these folks a chance to 
laugh and be silly." Added Kasson: "It's a wonderful time, although the music 
is a little loud." MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY OKS $70,000 FOR SECURITY STUDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisors on Tuesday approved spending nearly $70,000 for a 
study on how to make county employees more secure in their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials requested the report after a deadly rampage that began at the 
Oxnard unemployment office in December left five people dead, including gunman 
Alan Winterbourne and Oxnard Police Detective James O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had requests from every major department to increase security at their 
work," said Peter Pedroff, director of the General Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract will be awarded to Tomasi-Dubois & Associates, a Northern 
California firm that will conduct a three-month study of the county's 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn, who cast the lone dissenting vote, said increased 
security measures are unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're overreacting to this," said Flynn, who represents the district 
where the Dec. 2 shooting began. "I do not want an armed camp here." PEGGY Y.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL APPROVES ANTI-GOUGING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to discourage merchants from boosting prices during disasters, the Simi 
Valley City Council has approved an anti-gouging law that prohibits raising 
prices more than 25% in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no reports of price gouging were verified in Simi Valley after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake, council members on Monday agreed to pass the ordinance to 
discourage the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, merchants would not be allowed to increase prices more than 
25% when a local emergency has been declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Items covered by the ordinance include food, water, flashlights, batteries, 
radios, candles, blankets, soap, diapers, drugs and bandages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point in having a 25% limit rather than something lower is so that you 
can go to court and definitely convict somebody who is doing this," Mayor Greg 
Stratton said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This way it is absolutely clear," she said. SARA CATANIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD SHORES; FIRM OFFERS TO DO $10-MILLION CLEANUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County development firm said Tuesday it is willing to spend as much 
as $10 million to clean up a former oil field waste dump near Oxnard Shores in 
exchange for permission to build a 411-unit waterfront housing subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 But the proposal by North Shore Properties of Newport Beach must first clear 
numerous hurdles, including an ongoing investigation by the U. S. Environmental 
Protection Agency of possible toxic contamination at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, located north of 5th Street between Harbor Boulevard and the 
Edison Canal, was the site of the former JNJ Oil Field Waste Disposal Facility. 
From 1954 to 1982, when the facility closed, 8.1 million barrels of watery oil, 
drilling mud and other oil field waste were deposited on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 During a preliminary application review by the Oxnard City Council, company 
officials said two rounds of testing on the 80-acre site in the last three 
years have turned up no contamination that cannot be cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very little contamination is left now," said Richard Kelly, a consultant with 
the Ventura firm of Earth Systems. "Testing we conducted last fall confirmed 
that we are dealing with oil field wastes and not with toxic constituents." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the EPA said the site is on a list of 
possible toxic waste sites that the agency is studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is being actively pursued by staff and will be reviewed by 
higher management," said spokeswoman Paula Bruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron A. Smith of North Shore Properties said after Tuesday's meeting that the 
EPA investigation should not hinder the company's plans to develop the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will never be designated a hazardous waste site," Smith asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council gave the developer conditional support, clearing the 
way for the firm to file an application and seek permission from the many 
agencies that have regulatory power over the project.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; OFFICIALS TO MONITOR TOWER'S EMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 National Weather Service officials said they plan to monitor emissions from a 
radar station on Sulphur Mountain today to prove to frightened residents that 
the system is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this whole readings thing is to eliminate an undue fear," 
National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Morris said."We are going to prove 
that the emissions from the radar tower are not what these homeowners are 
making it out to be. We are going to put this thing to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 The radar station, which will track storms and wind conditions for the 
government, has panicked Upper Ojai residents who fear exposure to low-level 
radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month a federal judge refused to delay switching on the tower after 
residents filed a lawsuit against the government. The property owners have 
vowed to appeal but have not yet done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's readings, which will be taken from several locations near the tower, 
will show there are no dangerous emissions, Morris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll set up the equipment and show them what is coming on the meters, the 
levels of energy coming out of the radar," said Jerry McDuffie, who runs the 
Oxnard office of the National Weather Service. "All we want to do is get 
positions to measure energy coming out at various locations and show what those 
measures are." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the National Weather Service and Unisys, the information 
services company that is building 165 Doppler radar systems across the nation, 
will conduct the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners were invited to attend the demonstrations but declined, Morris 
said. Residents said they don't believe the tests will make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel we have any reason to trust them," said Gail Light, who lives 
near the radar tower. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CITY MOVES TOWARD DEAL WITH DEVELOPER

 The Ventura City Council has taken the first step toward allowing a park to be 
built in a greenbelt on the city's east end in exchange for a developer 
constructing more than 400 single-family residences on city-owned agricultural 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura-based developer Ron Hertel is proposing to swap his 92 acres in the 
greenbelt for 87 acres of city land at Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue.Hertel 
hopes to build single-family houses on the land and give the city $2 million to 
build a park on the land he owns at Telephone and Kimball roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite opposition from residents who live near the city-owned parcel, the 
council on Monday voted 4 to 1 to allow Hertel's proposal to go forward. 
Councilman Steve Bennett dissented, and Councilmen Gary Tuttle and Gregory L. 
Carson abstained because of possible conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said Hertel's land is in a better location for a park than the 
city's parcel. They said the developer's offer of $2 million for a park is an 
unusual offer that the city should seriously consider. 
</P>
<P>
 After city staff members finish negotiations with the developer, Hertel's 
project will come up for final approval later this year. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PANEL TO CONSIDER OKING MARINE STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission will consider Thursday whether to approve a 
three-year study on the state of the marine environment off the coast of 
Ventura and Los Angeles counties and the Channel Islands National Marine 
Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 The $600,000 study would be funded by Chevron Corp. and its Point Arguello 
corporate partners in compliance with a condition of approval for a 1993 permit 
to ship oil by tanker. 
</P>
<P>
 The study would be done under the auspices of the UCLA environmental science 
and engineering department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the first systematic and comprehensive study of our coastline," 
said Richard Ambrose, a UCLA associate professor of environmental science and 
engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose said with the study, scientists and others will know which areas in 
the region are particularly vulnerable to damage from an oil spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron's shipping permit was recently suspended after the company failed to 
meet a Feb. 1 deadline to have established an agreement with an overland 
pipeline company. 
</P>
<P>
 In related matters, the commission will also be asked to approve the annual 
discharge of about 49,000 barrels of drilling muds and about 29,000 barrels of 
drill cuttings off Chevron's Platform Gail, situated about 11 miles southwest 
of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil platform, which was built in 1987, produces about 4,500 barrels of oil 
and 20,000 cubic feet of natural gas every day. Chevron's discharge plan, which 
also includes other industrial fluids in addition to sanitary and domestic 
wastes, has already been approved by the federal Environmental Protection 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff members have also recommended approval for the discharge 
plan, arguing that it produces a smaller threat to the environment than 
shipping the wastes off the platform on barges or other forms of surface 
transportation. Both items will be before the commission during its meeting 
Thursday in San Diego. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; CONSULTANT TO TARGET STUDENT CONFLICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to recent racial conflicts at Ventura High School, the Ventura 
school district decided Tuesday to hire a consultant to launch a student 
mediation program at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt.Joseph Spirito said conflict-resolution specialist Judith Rubenstein of 
Santa Barbara will go to the high school next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first task, Spirito said, will be to meet with certain white students who 
align themselves with white supremacist causes and some black and Latino 
students to try to assess how best to ease racial tensions at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflicts between white and black students sparked clashes at two recent 
basketball games that led to four arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 After these meetings, Rubenstein will train students who belong to the 
school's multicultural Rainbow Coalition to act as mediators between classmates 
who have disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will use the student mediators to help resolve all types of student 
conflicts, not just racial problems, Spirito said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We also have problems where kids fight over the way they look at each other," 
he said. "It's not all racial." 
</P>
<P>
 As Spirito met in his office Tuesday morning with Rubenstein, a small group 
assembled outside to protest any hiring of the Anti-Defamation League to offer 
its brand of anti-prejudice training at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 A parent of a Ventura High student called the ADL after the recent racial 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spirito said he has no plans at this point to contract for the ADL's 
services. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WATER HOOKUP FOR SCHOOL TO BE DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Local Agency Formation Commission will consider today whether to reverse 
its earlier decision and allow the new Oxnard High School located outside city 
limits to be connected to municipal water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 9 a.m. hearing at the Ventura County Government Center, the agency's five 
commissioners will hear Oxnard Union High School District officials argue in 
favor of annexing the new school site to the Calleguas Municipal Water 
District, which supplies high-quality water to the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 If the new school is not allowed to hook up to city water, the district would 
have to drill a well and pump water from underground, which district officials 
say is a less reliable and poorer-quality source. 
</P>
<P>
 LAFCO, a state-sponsored panel that regulates changes in boundaries for cities 
and other agencies, voted 3 to 2 in November against allowing the annexation to 
Calleguas. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, LAFCO commissioners argued that the school district had flouted 
county efforts to preserve farmland by locating the new school in an 
agricultural area between Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing city water to flow to the area may encourage further development on 
these agricultural lands, commissioners said. 
</P>

 But school officials hope that a recent letter from a county ground water 
management agency to LAFCO will persuade the commission to reverse its earlier 
decision.

 In a letter dated Feb. 3, the Fox Canyon Groundwater Management Agency 
recommended that LAFCO allow the high school to get its water from Calleguas in 
order to preserve local ground water supplies.

ELECTIONS / 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT; SYBERT BEGINS DRIVE, DENOUNCES 
BEILENSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican Richard Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, kicked off his 
campaign Tuesday to unseat U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), 
denouncing the incumbent as a "tired and ineffective" liberal, while urging the 
use of the National Guard to bolster local police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, 41, announced his candidacy in separate news conferences in front of 
two earthquake-damaged buildings -- the Thousand Oaks Library and a store on 
Ventura Boulevard in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to recent violence at schools in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks, 
Sybert said fear of worsening crime binds the disparate communities of the 24th 
Congressional District together. Three-quarters of the district is in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are faced with an epidemic of crime, of violent crime, in areas that we 
thought were oases of tranquillity," Sybert said at the Thousand Oaks 
conference. "Places like the Conejo Valley are not immune . . . We're starting 
to see gang activity in the Conejo Valley. We're seeing juvenile crime on 
middle-class campuses. It can happen here unless we do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert was surrounded by local backers, including Ventura County Dist. Atty. 
Michael D. Bradbury. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he supports Sybert because he has made crime-fighting a top 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public safety is the first and paramount duty of responsible government," 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert criticized Beilenson at the news conference in the San Fernando Valley, 
where he was introduced by former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Bob 
Philibosian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's be candid," Sybert said. "Tony Beilenson is a Westside liberal -- he's 
not from the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Sybert accused fellow Republican Robert Hammer, who is also running 
for the Beilenson seat, of being unfit to serve in the Congress because Hammer 
has been an infrequent voter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he moved to California in 1985, Robert Hammer has almost never voted 
and I think he will have to explain that to the people who do vote," Sybert 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney, was director of Wilson's Office of Planning and Research 
from 1990 to 1993 and is currently the president of Lanard Toys of California. 
He has a $430,000 campaign war chest and a long list of endorsements from GOP 
elected officials.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Whittier and a Harvard Law School graduate who has been with a 
downtown Los Angeles law firm for 12 years, Sybert lives in Calabasas with his 
wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said Tuesday it was time to rebuild the state's economy and a sense of 
public safety. "When you ask my opponent (Beilenson) about crime, he throws up 
his hands and says it's a local problem," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of such despair, he said he would offer solutions -- including making 
the National Guard and military police units available to patrol crime-plagued 
cities. Such resources are already being paid for and there should be no 
reluctance to use them, Sybert said, especially in the fight against gang 
activity.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the economy, Beilenson has "never seen a tax hike he didn't 
like," Sybert contended, referring to the incumbent's vote for President 
Clinton's five-year economic package and a federal income tax increase to 
implement it. Citing recent news reports, Sybert noted that Beilenson's 24th 
District constituents will be hit harder by the tax increase than the 
constituents of all but eight other congressional districts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson spokesman Craig Miller said that Beilenson's votes to raise taxes 
have served "to reduce the deficit by historic proportions, and if that means 
the nation's wealthiest are called upon to pay their fair share, then so be it 
-- middle Americans will greatly benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also noted that Beilenson has frequently enjoyed the endorsement of 
rank-and-file police groups, has backed the death penalty for drug kingpins and 
terrorists and currently supports the President's crime bill, which would 
provide 100,000 additional police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hammer admitted that he had not been -- as Sybert charged -- a 
diligent voter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose you could fault me for that," Hammer said. "But during this time, I 
was working 16-hour days making acquisitions for my company that produced jobs 
here locally and traveling around the country." Hammer said absentee voting was 
established to help meet such contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, a banking consultant, in the late 1980s was a top executive with First 
Interstate Bank. Hammer has boasted that his work of acquiring credit card 
assets for First Interstate created or preserved more than 100 jobs in Southern 
California.

PIROLI ADMITS THAT HE DRAINED HIS BANK ACCOUNTS OF $29,000; TRIAL: CLERGYMAN 
SAYS HE USED THE MONEY FOR LIVING EXPENSES. ACCOUNTANT SAYS CHURCH'S CASH 
DEPOSITS SHRANK DURING PRIEST'S TENURE.

<P>
 Father David Dean Piroli admitted Tuesday that he drained his bank accounts of 
$29,000 in eight weeks while authorities were hunting him for the suspected 
embezzlement of $60,000 from two Ventura County churches. 
</P>
<P>
 In other testimony Tuesday at Piroli's grand theft trial, an accountant said 
Piroli's bank accounts had swelled by $16,263 during his two-year tenure at St. 
Peter Claver Church in Simi Valley, while the church's cash deposits shrank 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest was using diversionary banking tactics such as putting his money 
into nine bank accounts, which "makes following the money more difficult" for 
investigators, testified Daniel McCarthy, a forensic accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood police arrested Piroli on May 29, 1992, after finding him in a 
church-owned car with a Mexican citizen named Israel Palacios, $10,000 in cash 
and traces of cocaine. Employees found another $50,000 in cash and donation 
checks in his bedroom and office at St. Peter Claver on June 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli, 37, is on trial in Ventura County Superior Court on two counts of 
grand theft. He is accused of stealing money from collections at St. Peter 
Claver and Sacred Heart Church in Saticoy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his second day of cross-examination, Piroli testified Tuesday that he fled 
his Simi Valley post in the church car because he feared for his life after 
hearing a church employee say the car had been tampered with. 
</P>
<P>
 But Piroli abandoned the church car in Burbank and bought another car from his 
mother for $7,000, he testified. The priest then picked up Palacios in 
Hollywood and drove to Mexico City to return the man to his family in hopes of 
breaking Palacios' cocaine addiction, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli flew back to the United States, bought another car and stayed in the 
San Fernando Valley from June 30 to July 21, 1992, before returning to Mexico, 
he said. He had hoped to bring Palacios back to the United States to help 
explain the arrest to his superior, Bishop G. Patrick Ziemann, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 During his eight-week flight, Piroli testified, he pulled cash out of his bank 
accounts through ATM machines in Mexico and the San Fernando Valley, sometimes 
twice a day, for what he called living expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I told you your withdrawals totaled about $29,000, would you still say 
that was for living expenses?" Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Peace asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Piroli answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, Peace asked, did the priest write two checks to pay his mother for the 
car -- the first dated June 2, 1992, which remained uncashed, and the second 
dated June 2, 1991, which was cashed? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because on that afternoon, I'd left St. Peter Claver fearing for my life, and 
I was very confused, and I really do not remember writing the second check at 
all," Piroli testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it true you were concerned about the $7,000 being traced and you put 
the check aside and wrote another backdating it?" asked Peace.  
</P>
<P>
 "No, that is not true," Piroli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, under questioning by defense attorney Richard Beada, Piroli testified 
that he had trouble keeping track of his ATM withdrawals because it was 
difficult for him to convert the amounts shown on Mexican bank machines from 
pesos to dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Piroli also explained some of his larger expenses. He spent $450 on a bed so 
he would have a place to sleep at Palacios' home in Mexico, he said. He bought 
airplane tickets for himself and Palacios, and he often bought American goods 
that cost even more in Mexico, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his sudden disappearance following his Hollywood arrest, Piroli 
testified that he had additional reasons to fear staying at St. Peter Claver. 
He had heard of one previous assistant pastor being beaten by a parishioner, 
and of another who died in the wreck of a parish car, he testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Beada asked Piroli about a meeting at which the priest was accused of 
wrongdoing by Msgr. Timothy J. Dyer, vicar for clergy at the Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were accusations about me that I felt were untrue," Piroli testified. 
Piroli said that he blamed Father James McKeon, the pastor of St. Peter Claver, 
for the activities that church officials attributed to Piroli. 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning ended there. But the remark hinted at a defense that Judge 
Allan L. Steele had forbidden Beada to use last week: Piroli's assertion that 
McKeon had actually embezzled the money and then framed Piroli. McKeon has 
declined to comment on that allegation, and the archdiocese has heatedly denied 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 After a total of 2 1/2 hours on the stand Tuesday, Piroli stepped down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then McCarthy, the accountant, took the stand for the prosecution to testify 
about 10 boxes full of bank records from the bank accounts of Piroli and St. 
Peter Claver Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the year Piroli was ordained and assigned to Sacred Heart Church, the 
priest kept $16,533 in four bank accounts, McCarthy testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By July, 1990, when he transferred to St. Peter Claver, Piroli had six bank 
accounts holding $38,427, and on the day of his arrest, he had nine accounts 
containing $54,691, McCarthy told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy then showed jurors two graphs: one showed a steadily rising jagged 
line marking the increase in Piroli's bank balance. The other showed a steep 
drop in cash deposits from St. Peter Claver after Piroli began working there, 
then a steep increase after his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would not expect to see nine bank accounts" with Piroli earning no more 
than about $600 from salary and parishioners' gifts, McCarthy testified. "It 
would be an indication there could be something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy is expected to continue testifying today at 10 a.m. to questions by 
Peace, and then by attorney Douglas Levinson, who Beada brought in especially 
to cross-examine the accountant.

SOKA UNIVERSITY LOSES A KEY ROUND IN LEGAL FIGHT OVER ITS LAND; CALABASAS: 
APPEALS JUDGE RULES THE SCHOOL CANNOT RAISE A SEPARATE CHALLENGE, BUT MUST 
ADDRESS FORMAL EMINENT DOMAIN PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court in Ventura on Tuesday cleared the way for the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy to proceed with its legal fight to seize Soka 
University's scenic Calabasas campus for use as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Overturning a Ventura County judge's decision, the 2nd District Court of 
Appeal ruled that Soka's objections to the conservancy's legal attack should be 
raised in formal condemnation proceedings -- not in separate court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers had sought to avoid condemnation proceedings altogether by 
arguing that the conservancy did not have proper authority to start those 
proceedings -- known formally as eminent domain -- in the first place. Ventura 
County Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane agreed with the school in late 
1992, but her decision was reversed by justices Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a waste of judicial and other public resources if a property 
owner could challenge each step of the taking process by writ brought separate 
and apart from the eminent domain action," Associate Justice Arthur Gilbert 
wrote in the court's unanimous decision, filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle called the ruling a "major victory. 
We're extremely happy to have a unanimous court decide, as we have said all 
along, that the case should be down in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 She added later: "I think Soka has to view this as a major body blow." 
</P>
<P>
 But Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan characterized the decision as "not unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservancy won on a legal technicality this time," he said. "It's far 
from a winning run. It's more like they squeezed out a single in the bottom of 
the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan said Soka administrators and lawyers are discussing whether to appeal 
the decision to the California Supreme Court or to argue their case in 
condemnation proceedings, which could begin later this year in Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a long and tortuous fight between the school and some of 
its neighbors. Soka wants to expand its 580-acre campus at the corner of 
Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road into a liberal arts college, but state 
and federal parks officials want a large chunk of the land to be used as a 
visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka administrators have offered to share the site with parks officials but 
have rejected offers to sell the property outright. So, late in 1992, the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- an arm of the conservancy -- 
launched condemnation proceedings to seize 245 acres through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 The way that action began formed the basis for Soka's Ventura County suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority has a joint powers 
agreement with park agencies in Ventura County, conservancy officials sought 
approval to launch condemnation proceedings from the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors -- even though Soka's property is entirely within Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argued that Ventura County officials had overstepped their bounds 
and, on those grounds, sought to have the approval overturned. A Ventura County 
judge agreed and the conservancy appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tuesday's ruling overturns the Ventura County judge's decision, it 
does not address the question of whether the conservancy acted properly. 
Instead, it simply tells Soka lawyers that the proper forum for their 
objections is condemnation proceedings in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as well and good as we could expect," said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive 
director of the conservancy. "We argued the case on procedural grounds, so in 
terms of this lawsuit it was a complete victory." 
</P>
<P>
 During condemnation proceedings, a judge will decide whether the conservancy 
has the right to take Soka's land against the school's will. If the judge 
decides in favor of the conservancy, a jury will determine how much Soka should 
be paid for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The process can take several years and it is likely that any judgments will be 
appealed.

AMGEN EXPANSION PLAN QUESTIONED BY THOUSAND OAKS PLANNERS; GROWTH: PANEL FEARS 
SOME BUILDINGS IN PROPOSED BUSINESS CAMPUS WOULD BE TOO TALL. BIOTECHNOLOGY 
FIRM WILL NOW ASK CITY COUNCIL TO REVIVE PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amgen officials left City Hall shaking their heads early Tuesday after the 
Thousand Oaks Planning Commission picked apart their expansion plan, chiefly 
because commissioners feared that some of the buildings on the proposed 
business campus would be too tall. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology giant, which has worked for two years with city staff 
members to design a long-term plan for growth at the company's 100-acre world 
headquarters in Thousand Oaks, will now turn to the City Council to revive the 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that we can work with the council at this point," said Amgen's 
project manager, Ed Bjurstrom, after the Planning Commission vote. "The 
Planning Commission has made their recommendations, but that's all they are -- 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 After twice failing to reach a consensus, commissioners finally agreed at 2:30 
a.m. Tuesday on a revised expansion plan for Amgen's property, which borders 
Rancho Conejo Boulevard and Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The version scheduled to be sent to the City Council for approval March 1 
includes strict limits on building heights and reduces the company's freedom to 
build future projects without public response. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the eight-hour meeting, commissioners hammered at city 
staff members and Amgen officials, asking them to explain how the plan would 
solve problems created by increased traffic, noise and the closure of a portion 
of Camino Dos Rios, among other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Because all future growth on the property will be guided by the expansion 
proposal, commissioners said they did not want to adopt it without thorough 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is not the most important decision to come up in the city's history, 
it's got to be among the top three," Planning Commission Chairman Irving 
Wasserman said. "It's extremely important and we have to treat it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end of the lengthy session, commissioners had resolved all but two 
major sticking points. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners denounced the height elements of the proposal, which allows 
Amgen to build several 70-foot-tall buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan outlined three height districts: On the perimeter the company can 
build up to 35 feet, and farther inside the property it can build up to 55 feet 
and in some places up to 70 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials told the commissioners, however, that some of the buildings in 
the 35-foot zone would actually be built as high as 54 feet because the 35-foot 
measurement is only an average height. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes the structures nearly twice as high," Commissioner Forrest Frields 
said. "I think it's outrageous for the public to expect a 35-foot building and 
then have it end up 54 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Frields proposed that the city place an absolute cap on building height so 
there would be no misunderstandings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Amgen officials argued the point, saying the city commonly measures 
structure height by taking an average of the heights of the building faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arbitrary height cap is totally unacceptable to Amgen," a frustrated 
Bjurstrom told the commission. "To have to go back and redesign these buildings 
because of an arbitrary limit isn't anything but arbitrary." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman agreed with Bjurstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we change the height limits, we change the entire Specific Plan," he said. 
"I'm afraid I can't support doing that, and I don't think the City Council will 
support it either." 
</P>
<P>
 But other commissioners -- Frields, Linda Parks and Marilyn Carpenter -- 
refused to budge on the issue, and the cap was included in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, I think it will be good to bring the (height) issue to the 
attention of the council," Wasserman said after the meeting. "They can do what 
they want, but at least they know our sense of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The other issue that generated heated debate was the element of the plan that 
allowed Amgen to build without a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, new construction on the perimeter of Amgen's property would 
require either a special use permit or an administrative review -- both of 
which require a public hearing. But inside the property, the approval to build 
could come without public review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eliminating the participation of the public is a very, very serious issue," 
Wasserman said, "It's something we've never done before and we found it very 
troublesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen had requested the freedom to build inside its property without the need 
for public review, and the City Council had endorsed that idea on the basis 
that a company with such a strong commitment to the city should be trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners amended the plan to require Amgen to undergo administrative 
review, which includes a public hearing, for future construction within the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's baffling to me," Bjurstrom said. "The council debated that subject for 
hours. I don't know why (the Planning Commission) would reach a different 
conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Wasserman said that at points during the hearing he feared the two major 
changes to the plan would prompt Amgen to pull out of the project, but he said 
he is confident that the city and the company can still reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amgen is a business and they have certain goals, and the process of making a 
profit sometimes collides with the environmental requirements of a city," 
Wasserman said. "But I really do think that Amgen is trying very hard to make 
those two things work together. We all want this thing to work out." NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council is scheduled to vote on the Amgen Specific 
Plan, as it was revised by the Planning Commission, at the March 1 meeting. The 
Planning Commission still needs to vote on three other Amgen projects, for 
which discussion was postponed because of the lengthy debate over the Specific 
Plan. That vote was rescheduled for 7:30 p.m. Thursday.

PHILMAN PLAYING WITH CONFIDENCE NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cheers erupted around an exhausted Marie Philman as she slumped in a chair and 
hung her head. This was not the way things were supposed to end, she thought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Edison forward had played her final game as a freshman and the visiting 
Chargers had lost to Hemet, 78-51, in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 
Division II-AA playoffs last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman overcame a knee injury, surgery and self-doubts to help the Chargers 
during their playoff run. She figured the best was ahead and that nothing could 
stop Edison -- or her -- en route to a section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came more pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just sat there, moping," Philman said. "I was having so much fun (in the 
playoffs), so it was just depressing to have everything end like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I gained a lot of confidence and that's what I'm bringing into (the 
playoffs) this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by her development late last season, Philman, 15, has become one of the 
county's dominant players. The sophomore forward leads Edison against Chino, 
which plays host to the Chargers tonight in the opening round of the Division 
I-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really determined (to win a championship)," Philman said. "I wasn't 
thinking that way going into the playoffs last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I just wanted to prove to everybody what I could really do because 
I had a lot of problems early on (in the season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Philman's left knee was the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 She missed the Chargers' first nine games last season after undergoing surgery 
to repair cartilage damage. But the surgery did not repair the damage to her 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually aggressive on the court, Philman was timid when she returned to the 
team. She acted less like a budding standout and more like a perfect child: 
seen and not heard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had missed a lot of time and I was afraid of making mistakes," Philman 
said. "I wasn't sure if I'd be able to do everything I used to do (before the 
surgery) and I was scared of losing my starting position." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the whole freshman thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman had five senior teammates and she did not want to overstep her bounds 
-- in the game plan or with her mouth. That, added to the other concerns, could 
create enough emotional baggage to weigh down the sagest individual let alone a 
cherub-cheeked newcomer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Philman eventually carved her niche. And she used the playoffs as a coming 
out party. 
</P>
<P>
 She averaged almost 15 points and 15 rebounds in the Chargers' three playoff 
games, which increased her season totals to 11 and 12, respectively. Philman 
had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt renewed in the playoffs," she said. "I finally felt like I was doing 
the things I thought I could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Charger Coach Philip Abraham noticed, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "She blossomed during the playoffs," Abraham said. "Once when she was having 
some problems early in the season, she told me she was better than she was 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what we had in her, but it wasn't until the playoffs that she really 
started to get going. That's when she really started dominating." 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman averaged 27 points and 14.3 rebounds during the regular season, 
finishing second and third, respectively, among county girls. She also made 53% 
of her field goals and 80% of her free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 She has scored 30 points 10 times and 40 points four times. What's more, she 
set seven school records for rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Philman, 5 feet 10, is too quick for most centers and too physical for most 
forwards. She moves with ease from all front-court positions and is one of the 
Chargers' best players running the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's more . 
</P>
<P>
 "She does so many things well, but the thing she's probably best at is 
understanding the game situation," Abraham said. "She really understands 
exactly what we need from her and she gives it to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Philman now hopes to help bring the Chargers a title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be satisfied with us making it far," she said. "I want us to 
go all the way." Division I-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Lynwood (25-1), Palos Verdes Peninsula (21-3), Long Beach 
Poly (20-4), Fontana (20-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Long Beach Millikan (16-8). The Rams finished second in the Moore 
League behind Poly but have one of the most talented teams in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Keisha Allison (Fontana A.B. Miller), Staci Andrews (Arroyo 
Grande), Alecia Balich (Chino Hills Ayala), Tawnee Cooper (Simi Valley Royal), 
Nina Hawkins (Victor Valley), Amy Heaton (Lakewood), Angela Holt (Nogales), 
Kristy Kierulff (Esperanza), Timicha Kirby (Lynwood), Blanca Loza (Millikan), 
Mimi McKinney (Peninsula), Kelly Morris (Diamond Bar), Sharmayne Murphy 
(Fontana), Kristina Silva (Central Union), Nicole Strange (Fountain Valley), 
Felicity Willis (Apple Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Peninsula (21-3). The second-seeded Panthers should cruise into the 
championship game and a probable matchup with top-seeded Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Santa Monica (9-13), which plays Lynwood in the first round. Few 
teams in the state can compete with Lynwood, and Santa Monica is not one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Lynwood defeated Capistrano Valley in the championship game last 
season, 58-41. Capistrano Valley is in Division I-A this year. Lynwood also won 
the State Division I title and finished 30-0. . . . Peninsula won the division 
and State titles in 1992. . . . Arroyo Grande's Andrews, a guard, has 
team-leading averages in scoring (20.1), rebounding (10.1) and assists (5.4). 
Division I-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Ventura Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Buena (20-2), Oxnard Channel Islands (22-3), Mater Dei 
(20-3), San Clemente (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Marina (19-6). The Vikings might advance deep in the playoffs if 
they can get past a talented Dana Hills (17-7) team in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Nina Alexander (Century), La Cresha Clark (Newhall Hart), 
Michelle Giordano (Buena), Doveal Goins (Moreno Valley Canyon Springs), Karun 
Grossman (Dana Hills), Michelle Macintyre (San Clemente), Leticia Oseguera 
(Mater Dei), Shannon Perry (Cerritos), Melody Peterson (Mater Dei), Marie 
Philman (Edison), Shandy Robbins (Marina), Sara Samimi (Thousand Oaks), Susan 
Scott (Capistrano Valley), Kori Sebek (Buena), Rhonda Smith (Downey), Jennifer 
Stanley (University), Michelle Stremel (Montclair), Lisa Tamamasui 
(Westminster), Maribel Uribe (Arroyo), Karen Villafuerte (Rialto), Laura Zepeda 
(Century), Nicolle Zuniga (Dana Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Mater Dei. Being seeded third keeps the Monarchs out of Buena's 
half of the bracket. A Mater Dei-Buena final? Could be. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Westminster (10-15). The Lions face Mater Dei in the first round, 
which should lead to an early exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Perennial powerhouse Buena, which won its 17th league title in 18 
seasons, defeated Ventura County-rival Thousand Oaks in the division 
championship game last season, 44-43. Thousand Oaks was seeded first and 
entered the game undefeated (29-0) . . . Marina, which won its fourth 
consecutive Sunset League title, was the county's lone representative among the 
final four teams. The Vikings were defeated by Thousand Oaks, 65-49 . . . Dana 
Hills tied a school single-season record for victories. Grossman set Dolphin 
single-season records for (549 points) and rebounding (252), and all-time 
scoring (1,061).

SHINE IS GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE SPOTLIGHT FOR EL MODENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who haven't seen the commercial -- it was broadcast during the Super 
Bowl, somewhere between Johnny Kilroy and Cindy Crawford -- El Modena's Jamie 
Shine is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Shine, in the commercial for a health maintenance organization, recalls her 
close call with death. In fact, it was only 10 months ago that doctors gave her 
little chance to live. She contracted the most aggressive strain of bacterial 
meningitis, was in a coma for 30 hours and came perilously close to dying. 
</P>
<P>
 But she came out of the coma, has regained her memory skills -- she suffered 
from short-term memory deficit -- and recently completed another successful 
season for El Modena's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when the Vanguards tip off against Cypress on Saturday in the first 
round of the Southern Section Division II-A playoffs, Shine will be jumping 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely the Vanguards will go all the way in a division that features 
the Centurions and Mission Hills Alemany, but the fact they're here is notable. 
</P>
<P>
 Shine had the impact season most players who haven't had her struggles can 
appreciate: She averaged a team-high 15.1 points and 13.4 rebounds one year 
after averaging 16.5 points and 12.6 rebounds. The Vanguards (11-10) tied for 
second in the Century League and upset league champion Villa Park behind 
Shine's 19 points and 14 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, John Cahill, sent out a recruiting sheet and Arizona State, 
Washington State and San Jose State have shown interest. Some colleges also 
have expressed interest in her as a volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tell them she didn't play in the AAU leagues so she didn't get any 
exposure," Cahill said. "She had planned on going to some of the summer camps 
but couldn't -- it's not like she didn't want to, she just couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them have already heard her story and they'll ask if she's OK, and I 
tell them she's completely recovered and she's one of the top players in the 
county. But a lot of them probably don't know to what extent it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Shine has bounced back from last summer, when she had trouble hitting the rim 
on free throws. Now, she's El Modena's leader on and off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "She came back and said she was going to be one of the top players around," 
Cahill said. "I know she was scared over the summer -- the free throws really 
embarrassed her. It would have been easy for her to rest, but it just goes to 
show she's not the type to give up and lay down." 
</P>
<P>
 In returning to basketball and trying to regain her skills and coordination, 
after being off her feet for about a month after her hospitalization in April, 
Shine said she felt like someone who hasn't spoken a foreign language in a 
couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started off with my strength, and then it went to my head," Shine said. 
"Free throws are just a matter of concentration, and I started to get 
frustrated with myself. I would actually try not to get fouled so I wouldn't 
have to shoot free throws, and that's unlike me." 
</P>
<P>
 But she's now over that. Shine is a better shooter this year, but she knows 
she still has room for improvement. And the only remnants of her illness? 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally," Shine said, "I think I'm not playing with the same instincts." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least she's still playing. Division II-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Brea-Olinda (now in Division III-AA). 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Woodbridge (25-0), Riverside J.W. North (23-2), Inglewood 
(10-11), Ocean View (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Cerritos Gahr (11-15). The Knights were in last year's final, and 
forfeited 10 victories this season for using an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Wynette Allen (North), Barbara Argent (Glendora), Angela Burgess 
(Woodbridge), Yanick Clay (Inglewood), Angela Darnell (Hemet), Elizabeth Edmond 
(North), Shontey Edwards (Moreno Valley), Becky Fraser (Ocean View), Shannon 
Gale (Gahr), Elena Gomez (Moreno Valley), Dyanna Hatch (Trabuco Hills), Briana 
Kanongata (Oxnard Rio Mesa), Farrah Magee (Ocean View), Michelle Marshall 
(Hemet), Michelle Miyake (Villa Park), Michol Murray (Garden Grove), Jamie 
Oenning (Woodbridge), Melanie Pearson (Woodbridge), Summer Peterson (Oxnard Rio 
Mesa), Maureen Skehan (Villa Park), Jennifer Tuiolosega (Ocean View), Valencia 
Suggs (Gahr). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Gahr. Beat first-round opponent Inglewood, 53-24, and beat 
fourth-seeded Ocean View, 55-37. They're sitting pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Riverside Norte Vista (9-12). The Braves are in trouble. They have 
a qualifying game against Moreno Valley (18-5), then would have to play 
second-seeded North. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: The probable first-round matchup between Moreno Valley and North could 
easily pass for a semifinal-caliber meeting . . . Woodbridge has never begun 
the playoffs with the No. 1 seeding . . . Although unseeded, Villa Park (21-3) 
has the third-best record in the division . . . Woodbridge, for the first time, 
had three players with more than 100 assists in a season -- Oenning (113), Tami 
Weaver (111) and Pearson (103) . . . Four of Moreno Valley's five losses were 
to one team, Perris. Moreno Valley defeated Woodbridge over the summer. 
Division II-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Hacienda Heights Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Mission Hills Alemany (23-0), Cypress (23-3), La Puente 
Bishop Amat (21-1), Ventura (18-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Compton Dominguez (19-9). The Dons are in the same league as 
Cerritos Gahr, which has a good chance to reach the II-AA final, and the 
bracket favors them; they open with Freeway League champion Troy on the road. 
Dominguez plays wall-to-wall pressure defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Julie Adams (Cypress), LaQuinta Alexander (Valencia), Ember Brown 
(Ventura), Heather Carll (La Mirada), Chris Carrillo (Katella), Sarah Davis 
(Tustin), Jessica Eggleston (Cypress), Susan Flaming (Cypress), Jennie Gadd 
(Troy), Karin Kitagawa (Kennedy), Robynn Kuhlmann (Canyon), Katie Scheuerman 
(Tustin), Dinah Shah (Troy), Jamie Shine (El Modena), Lacey Sollie (Whittier La 
Serna), Kiana Webb (Bishop Amat). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Bishop Amat. The Lancers have the division's second-best record, 
and the only league champions they could play before the semifinals come from 
outposts like Brawley (13-5) and San Bernardino (21-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: La Mirada. The Matadores (12-11) open against Valencia (12-9), 
which has already beaten them, 57-48. Should they win, they will likely face 
top-seeded Alemany. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Alemany beat Division I power Mater Dei this season by 20 points, which 
should put the Indians' talent into perspective; Brea-Olinda beat Mater Dei by 
16. . . . Valencia Coach Kelly Stephenson and La Mirada Coach Sharon Wada, 
facing each other in the first round, were best friends while at Occidental 
College. . . . Cypress has a height advantage over most of its opponents, but 
first-round foe El Modena won't be intimidated; the Vanguards' front line 
averages 6-1.

LA QUINTA UPDATES ITS IMAGE TO REFLECT THIS DECADE, COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM Q. BERKSHIRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was welcomed with a delicate mix of enthusiasm and skepticism. In the heady 
1980s, La Quinta girls' basketball was as sassy and successful as a booming 
economy. But the heydays were short-lived, for the GNP and for the Aztecs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could probably call us the team of the '80s," second-year Coach Tony 
Tubbs said. "They won the Southern Section (4-A) championship in 1990, and they 
had a 55-game winning streak." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning streaks -- the 55-game run from the 1984-85 season to the end of the 
1989-90 year; league championships -- nine in a row from 1982 to 1990; a 
section title and a section runner-up -- in 1985. That all came to a screeching 
halt when Kevin Kiernan left, after the 1989-90 season, to coach the Savanna 
boys' team. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kiernan's departure, continuity wasn't an Aztec strength. La Quinta 
coaches came and went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a feeling-out process for the players and the coach," Tubbs 
said. "For some of the fourth-year girls, I was their third coach in four 
years. So when I came in and told them I wanted to rebuild the program, their 
response was, 'Yeah, yeah. We've heard it all before.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Rodriguez was one senior doing a lot of listening. She said Tubbs was 
only partially right. Including summer programs, she and the rest of La 
Quinta's seniors have played for five coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did sort of think, oh gosh, here's another coach," Rodriguez said. "But I 
didn't think about if he'd be leaving or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Now would certainly be an inopportune time. Having recently won their first 
Garden Grove League championship in four years, the Aztecs are playoff bound 
and on a roll. La Quinta won 15 consecutive games before Rancho Alamitos, the 
1993 Division III-A finalist, halted the streak last week and created 
co-champions. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the long run, the loss may have helped the Aztecs, who open Division 
III-AA play Saturday with a first-round game against No. 2 Empire League entry 
El Dorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough loss, but in a way, I think it helped us," said Rodriguez, a 
5-foot-7 guard who is averaging 21.3 points, 7.1 rebounds, 4.1 assists and 
shoots 33.2% from three-point range. "It made us realize we aren't too good, 
people can beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not many have. La Quinta (19-5) came within one game of its goal of 
an undefeated league season, an aspiration Tubbs believed was too lofty at the 
beginning of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had our meeting to go over team goals, we talked about working hard, 
winning league, going to (the playoffs)," he said. "Then, some of the girls 
started talking about 14-0. That surprised me because I believed it, but I 
didn't know they believed it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, no one believed much of anything positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, we had a good team, but we just couldn't find a way to get it 
together, to play as a team," said Rodriguez. "We were all a bunch of 
individuals. We always fought. This year, we decided we wanted to work hard and 
play together. If we did those things, we'd be on a winning team. We just won't 
accept losing." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a learning process for everyone. Rodriguez admitted Tubbs lacked the 
varsity experience he needed to pull the Aztecs together. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know that much," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he became self-taught. He watched what the best teams were doing, and he 
borrowed their ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came in I wanted to build a successful program," Tubbs said. "But I 
didn't know what a successful program was all about until I saw the Breas, the 
winning programs." 
</P>
<P>
 He set up a feeder program, a summer camp, and he encouraged the girls to 
coach on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after last season's record of 13-9, 6-8 on the heels of a 6-14, 4-10 
mark the year before, Tubbs felt his team start to sense his commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they started reacting to that," he said. "Fall workouts went well. There 
was a lot of transition, but now there's a sense of stability. I have a passion 
for it, I'm committed to building a program, and I think the girls know that." 
Division III-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Inglewood Morningside. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Brea-Olinda (25-0), Morningside (19-5), South Pasadena 
(16-3), South Torrance (17-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: La Quinta (19-5). La Quinta faces El Dorado in the first round and 
could do some damage in subsequent rounds if the Aztecs are playing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Sarah Beckley (Brea-Olinda), Cheryl Dickson (Morningside), 
Michelle de Bruijn (El Dorado), Shelley Dungo (Torrance Bishop Montgomery), 
Nicole Erickson (Brea-Olinda), Genevieve Evarts (Newport Harbor), Rhonda 
Gondringer (La Quinta), Gina Heads (Newport Harbor), Colleen Hudson 
(Brea-Olinda), Nadia Hoerner (Fullerton), Ashley Jones (Fullerton), Brooke 
Koehler (La Habra), Lee Moulin (Brea-Olinda), Shanna Renken (El Dorado), Linda 
Rodriguez (La Quinta), Jamie Sweet (El Dorado), Whitney Torregano (Magnolia). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Newport Harbor (19-6). Not being on Brea's side of the draw is a 
blessing to begin with. The Sea View League's second-place team could go to the 
semifinals, where a rematch of last year's semifinal against Morningside might 
go Newport Harbor's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Fullerton (14-9). More putty for first-round opponent Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Brea this week moved up to No. 2 in the USA Today national rankings. . 
. . Perennial powerhouse Morningside graduated four of last year's starters but 
always manages to field a championship team. . . . La Quinta was riding high on 
a 15-game winning streak before Garden Grove League rival Rancho Alamitos burst 
the Aztecs' bubble with two regular-season games left. Division III-A at a 
Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Costa Mesa (now in Division IV-AA). 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Lompoc (19-4), Ojai Nordhoff (19-4), Rancho Alamitos (19-6), 
Covina (17-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: La Canada (11-11). Last year, as the No. 1 team from the Rio Hondo 
League, La Canada lost to Rancho Alamitos in the semifinals. Not much expected 
of the third-place Spartans in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Maria Camacho (Whittier Pioneer), Laura Czingula (Estancia), 
Adrienne Davis (Lompoc Cabrillo), Michelle Frank (Rancho Alamitos), Avion 
Harris (Bellflower), Christen King (San Dimas), Tara Knesel (Bellflower), Julie 
Littman (Rancho Alamitos), Nicole Lynch (Cabrillo), Rachel McSorley (Nordhoff), 
Colleen Mitchell (Lompoc), Angie Payne (San Luis Obispo), Akilah Rodgers 
(Rancho Alamitos), Susan Stitt (San Dimas), Gretchen Wachter (Nordhoff), 
Jessica Waltz (Estancia), Dawn Wood (Pioneer), Kimberly Wuest (Lompoc). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Rancho Alamitos. First-round opponent is a third-place team and the 
Vaqueros match up better against Bellflower or Estancia, their second-round 
foe. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Cabrillo (13-12). Conquistadores have three times as many losses 
as Lompoc, their cross-town rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Have to wonder about the strength of a division where top-seeded Lompoc 
lost to Westminster, the fifth-place team in the Sunset League, 42-35, early in 
the season, and where second-seeded Nordhoff lost to Mater Dei by 41 points. . 
. . Although only two county teams were in this division last year, both were 
finalists. This year, Rancho Alamitos and Estancia are in the bottom half of 
the draw but there's no county representation in the top half. . . . Rancho 
Alamitos should be spurred by healthy Michelle Frank and Julie Littman, who 
were injured during different parts of the season.

ST. MARGARET'S UP FROM THE DEPTHS

<P>
 St. Margaret's faces its personal measuring stick tonight in the first round 
of the Southern Section Division V-AA girls' basketball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Capistrano Valley Christian Eagles, and to the five seniors on St. 
Margaret's squad, the Eagles are a symbol of how far the Tartans' program has 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's senior players, who helped the Tartans post a 16-1 record this 
season, remember when they struggled, and Capistrano Valley Christian rolled 
over them with little resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our freshman year, we lost to them by about 60 points, and every year it has 
gotten progressively better," point guard Susan Heydenrych said. "I think we 
see now that we can compete with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Heydenrych, along with fellow seniors Nina Asgari, Jamie Futheree, Gabi Keil 
and Masy Moatazedi, easily recall their freshman year, when the Tartans 
finished 4-10. They say they expected improvement, but not this much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming in, we heard we had a few new players, but to go 16-1. . . . I don't 
think we ever thought of that," Heydenrych said. "We've been pleased and quite 
surprised. None of us expected this or thought of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The new players, among them transfers Jenny Freeman from Ohio and Kelly Dane 
from Belgium, give St. Margaret's Coach Brady Lock the depth to run an 
attacking, relentless defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually substitute all five players at once," Lock said. "It's a 
full-system platoon, and I've always wanted to do it to keep the pressure on 
(opposing teams). We're deep enough to be able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The continual substitution and pressure defense mentally demoralizes the 
opposition, the Tartan players say, while boosting their morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It intimidates the other team a lot, because when five girls come in, it 
really scares them because they're already tired," Asgari said. "I think it's 
also fair to (our) other players, because they know they will get in. They know 
they won't be bench warmers." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's, which advanced to the Division V-AA quarterfinals last year, 
where it lost to Hesperia Christian, faces a forgiving draw in the upper 
bracket this year. That is, if it can get by Capistrano Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles handed St. Margaret's its only loss this year, a 57-40 decision at 
St. Margaret's Dec. 16. St. Margaret's trailed, 28-27, entering the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can beat them, and if we lose, it will be because we don't play 
our best," Asgari said. "In (the playoffs), I know there are really good teams, 
but I think we'll go far if we play hard all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Postseason results aside, Heydenrych said she is grateful the Tartans' 
fortunes have turned since she entered the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bunch of seniors here, and when we were freshmen we won only four 
games, so it's really been fun to do well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had fun as freshmen, too, but it's a lot more fun when you're winning." 
Division V-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: San Luis Obispo Mission Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Pasadena Poly (18-4), San Luis Obispo Mission Prep (14-6), 
Hesperia Christian (18-6), Cambria Coast Union (16-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Encino Holy Martyrs Armenian. The Armens (16-5) went undefeated in 
Liberty League play and open with Claremont Vivian Webb (9-11). 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Andrea Alary (Templeton), Aline Altibarmakian (Holy Martyrs 
Armenian), Renee Blodgett (San Bernardino Aquinas), Susan Heydenrych (St. 
Margaret's), Courtney Kanegae (Pasadena Poly), Nicole Jenkins (Redlands 
Arrowhead Christian), Sarah Mauety (Coast Union), Carrie McNutt (Burbank 
Providence), Carrie Musolff (Coast Union), Andrea Shaffner (Capistrano Valley 
Christian), Kari Sytsma (Ontario Christian), Shay Trette (St. Margaret's). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: St. Margaret's (16-1). If the Tartans can get by perennial nemesis 
Capistrano Valley Christian (11-11) in the first round, it should be smooth 
sailing to at least the quarterfinals., where Coast Union could make trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Templeton. The Eagles (11-9) finished third in the Tri-County 
League, probably the toughest league in the division. But Templeton must make 
the 3 1/2-hour trip to North Hollywood Oakwood (11-6) in the first round, and 
if the Eagles survive, top-seeded Poly awaits in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Coast Union's Mauety and Musolff are the division's most formidable 
scoring and passing duo. Musolff is averaging 20.9 points and five assists, and 
Mauety is averaging 16.3 points and 10.4 assists . . . . . . Capistrano Valley 
Christian Coach Tim Shelton won the 100th game of his coaching career when the 
Eagles beat Whitney, 34-26, on Dec. 9. Division V-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Lancaster Bethel Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: San Bernardino Christian (17-7), Lancaster Bethel Christian 
(16-6), Arcadia Rio Hondo Prep (16-5), L.A. Ribet Academy (16-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Pico Rivera Mesrobian. The Bulldogs (12-1) were undefeated in 
Valley League play and enter the playoffs with a nine-game winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Chayya Bhakta (Corona Christian), Virginia Boghossian 
(Mesrobian), Shawn Dennis (Canoga Park Faith Baptist), Stephanie Dondero (Lee 
Vining), Erica Fearn (Simi Valley Grace Brethren), Deanna Fulton (Bermuda Dunes 
Desert Christian), Alisia Keau (L.A. Ribet Academy), Andrea Keehne (La Verne 
Calvary Baptist), Kelly McMurry (San Bernardino Christian), Alicia Preston 
(Ribet Academy), Krista Stark (Sylmar First Lutheran), Lynlee Vaccaro (Liberty 
Christian). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Bethel Christian. The defending champions were seeded into the 
weaker bracket and can sleepwalk to the semifinals, where Rio Hondo should give 
them a decent run.  
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Big Pine (13-4). The Warriors get rewarded for winning five of 
their last six with a second-round matchup against top-seeded San Bernardino 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Bethel Christian defeated Lone Pine in last year's final, 40-36. Lone 
Pine has since moved to Division V-AA. . . . Corona Christian's Bhakta is the 
division's leading scorer, averaging 29.6 points. She also is averaging 9.3 
rebounds. . . . Two of Orange County's three representatives in the division 
meet in the first round. Liberty Christian (14-9), the No. 2 team from the 
Academy League, plays host to Heritage Christian (13-7), which finished third 
in the Express League.

DESPITE GRADUATION LOSSES, COSTA MESA HAS ROLLED RIGHT ALONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heading into the first round of the Division IV-AA playoffs Saturday, Costa 
Mesa girls' basketball Coach Lisa McNamee says there's no pressure being a 
defending Southern Section champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "All along people have picked us as underdogs," McNamee said. "We lost Olivia 
DiCamilli, who was the leading scorer in the county last season and was the 
Division III player of the year. We've taken advantage of (the underdog 
status). We knew all along we were a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 A good team indeed. The Mustangs finished the regular season 16-7 and won the 
Pacific Coast League championship with a 10-0 record. 
</P>
<P>
 All this despite losing six seniors, including four starters from last 
season's section III-A and Southern California Division III championship team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs dropped one division in the off-season because of a drop in 
enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winning league proved everybody wrong," McNamee said. "Our goal all year was 
to go undefeated in league and make the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 And though only four regulars return from last year's team, seven will have 
playoff experience entering Saturday's game against La Puente Bassett (16-7), 
the third-place team from the Montview League. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Cotten, Debbie Brown and starter Corri Lurmann were called up from the 
junior varsity to compete in the playoffs last year and saw substantial time in 
each of the Mustangs' 10 postseason games. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee plans to do the same thing this year, and to that end, she has called 
up Betty Fukumoto, Song Kim, Katy Grogan and Jenny Curtis to add depth to the 
Mustangs' bench. McNamee expects them to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The frosh-soph and JV teams lost fewer games combined than the varsity team," 
McNamee said. "We have had such tremendous success in the lower levels that the 
girls are already winners when they get (to the varsity)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs' leading scorer, Heather Robinson, is coming back from a stress 
fracture in her ankle that kept her out five games. Robinson, the only 
returning starter, averaged 14.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to produce are freshman Koo Kim, senior Doan Do and sophomore 
Lurmann. 
</P>
<P>
 McNamee said the Mustangs should be considered contenders for the division 
title, and expects the two top-seeded teams to challenge as well. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard (20-4), the defending Division IV-AA champion, is seeded No. 1, 
and Santa Ynez (21-4), last year's Division IV-AA runner-up, is No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa earned the third seeding, and Los Angeles Notre Dame Academy (15-3) 
is No. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a good shot," McNamee said, "if we play hard and get a little 
lucky." Division IV-AA at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Playa Del Rey St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: St. Bernard (20-4), Santa Ynez (21-4), Costa Mesa (16-7), 
Los Angeles Notre Dame Academy (15-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Inglewood St. Mary's Academy. The Belles have the second-highest 
victory total in the division and open against Santa Fe Springs St. Paul 
(13-11). They could sneak into the semifinals and surprise the seeded teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Asa Axelsson (Blythe Palo Verde Valley), Grace Bae (Cerritos 
Whitney), Sherry Bjorklund (Santa Ynez), Kim Carter (Los Angeles Marlborough), 
Shannon Colby (Banning), Luz Maria (Palo Verde Valley), Taryn Reynolds (Notre 
Dame Academy), Melissa Ridge (St. Paul), Heather Robinson (Costa Mesa), Kristi 
Rohr (Santa Ynez), Olympia Scott (St. Bernard), Deborah Sternlight 
(Marlborough), Judy Vera (La Puente Bassett). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Notre Dame Academy. The Regals (15-3), the fourth-seeded team in 
the division, play host to Los Angeles Sacred Heart of Jesus (10-7) in the 
first round and would play an 11- or 13-game winner in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Alhambra Ramona Convent. The Tigers (15-5) are the first-place 
team from the Horizon League and, after a first-round game against a wild-card 
winner, would have to face top-seeded St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Santa Ynez has been to a division final in each of the past five years, 
and appears to be a strong candidate to end up there again this year. The 
Pirates' only section title came in 1990, when they won the Division II-AA 
championship. . . . The lower half of the bracket could find four league 
winners battling each other in the quarterfinals. Costa Mesa (Pacific Coast), 
Flintridge Sacred Heart (Sunshine), St. Mary's (Camino Real) and Santa Ynez 
(Los Padres) could square off in the second round. Division IV-A at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion: Cerritos Valley Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded teams: Valley Christian (22-2), Sun Valley Village Christian 
(21-1), Burbank Bellarmine-Jefferson (20-5), Rosamond (20-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Dark horse: Santa Monica Crossroads. The Roadrunners (18-3), winners of the 
Delphic League, should breeze through the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Top players: Veronica Cortez (Huntington Park St. Matthias), Ebony Davis 
(Rosamond), Alisa Doran (Ventura St. Bonaventure), Krissy Duperron (Riverside 
Notre Dame), Julie Flentie (Sierra Madre Maranatha), Cathy Flores 
(Bellarmine-Jefferson), April Godfrey (St. Bonaventure), Lindy James (Village 
Christian), Lindsey Kelly (Riverside Notre Dame), Alana Kempton (Whittier 
Christian), Shirley Lalicker (Montebello Cantwell Sacred Heart of Mary), Blythe 
Linsey (Calvary Chapel), Lori Neville (Los Angeles Baptist), Jodi Parriott 
(Valley Christian), Veronica Quezada (Cantwell Sacred Heart of Mary), Jamie 
Smith (Bishop Union), Sherrise Smith (Crossroads), Christina Ticsay 
(Bellarmine-Jefferson), Maxine Unverferth (Lancaster Paraclete), Aisha Veasley 
(Valley Christian), Kristin Weddick (Orange Lutheran), Yasmeen Yamini-Benjamin 
(Crossroads). 
</P>
<P>
 Best draw: Crossroads. The Roadrunners (18-3) face a wild-card winner in the 
opening round before facing fourth-seeded Rosamond. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst draw: Los Angeles Baptist (12-6). They're the second-place team from the 
Alpha League, yet only earned a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes: Valley Christian is the two-time defending division champion and should 
meet second-seeded Bellarmine-Jefferson in the final. It's the same Bell-Jeff 
team the Lions beat last year, 66-52, for the title . . . Doubtful, but it 
could work out that two Olympic League teams could square off in the 
semifinals. The two wild-card teams, Orange Lutheran and Whittier Christian, 
would meet in the quarterfinals, with the winner possibly facing top-seeded 
Valley Christian.

DIGEST: RESEDA'S CROSS OUT WITH A BROKEN FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reseda High point guard Trenton Cross, an All-City Section 3-A Division 
selection last season, will miss the rest of the season because of a broken 
bone in his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross (5-foot-10) suffered the injury in the first half of last Friday's 80-67 
victory over San Fernando when he landed awkwardly after taking a shot. X-rays 
taken Tuesday revealed a break in a metatarsal bone. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss will hurt Reseda's chances of winning the 3-A championship. Cross, 
who has signed a letter of intent to play next season at Cal State Northridge, 
is considered one of the area's best point guards. Cross, a Times All-Valley 
selection as a junior, was averaging 18.5 points and 3.4 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents are 17-1.

60-54 loss to Marshall Fundamental last week was ruled a forfeit because 
Marshall Fundamental used an ineligible player.

HIGH SCHOOL NOTEBOOK: MONTCLAIR PREP PLAYERS AGAIN DENIED ENTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montclair Prep basketball player Jack Pollon envisioned a version of Mr. Smith 
Goes to Washington when he traveled to the Southern Section office in Cerritos 
on Monday to talk to Commissioner Dean Crowley about the Mounties' exclusion 
from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reality of the situation was Mr. Pollon Gets Stonewalled. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pollon learned Monday that Montclair Prep (15-6) did not receive a 
playoff berth, he and teammate Aaron Mintz drove to Cerritos to plead their 
case to Crowley, who didn't exactly welcome the distraught players with open 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Crowley) said, 'Get off the property. I'll have you arrested for 
trespassing,' " Pollon said. "He did not listen one bit. You know, I'm just a 
kid trying to get some answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep did not receive a berth because none were allotted to 
free-lance teams in Division IV-A. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Monday was not the day for round-table discussion at the Southern 
Section office. Section administrators were busy drawing playoff brackets for 
10 divisions of girls' basketball and four divisions each of boys' and girls' 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came down to plead their case and I don't blame them at all," Crowley 
said. "In all honesty, I would have loved to talk to them. There just wasn't 
any time." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the circumstances, Crowley could understand the players' motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were doing what they had to do," Crowley said. "They were fighting for 
their program. But yesterday was not the day." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollon, a senior reserve who has played basketball at Montclair Prep since the 
seventh grade, was overwhelmed with disappointment over the Mounties' 
unexpected omission from postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do anything wrong," Pollon said. "We went out and won 15 games. 
Emotionally it just tears me apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're punishing the kids, which is totally wrong. They've got too much 
power and they are abusing it." FOOTHILL LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Paradise Is Pebble Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the courses, Jack Nicklaus has played, he calls Pebble Beach Golf Links 
his favorite. The Monterey course is considered among the world's greatest

 Hart's golf team plays a match at Pebble Beach in April, making the Indians 
the envy of high school golfers everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The match came about two years ago when Hart assistant golf coaches Rick and 
Dean Herrington went to Carmel Valley High to teach the school's football staff 
the intricacies of the run-and-shoot offense. The Herringtons also are 
assistants for the Hart football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out that Carmel Valley football Coach Craig Johnson also handles the 
school's golf team. Carmel Valley plays its home golf matches at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal was struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This match has been about two years in the making," Hart golf Coach Dennis 
Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The match will last nine holes, but Ford predicted the Hart coaches and 
players might stick around a little bit longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nine-hole match," Ford said, "after that we'll finish with 
flashlights." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, perhaps the region's best team, opens its season March 3 at Vista 
Valencia Golf Course against Westlake and Littlerock. Westlake also is one of 
the area's best. NORTHWEST VALLEY

 Bad Timing 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it seems the Cleveland boys' basketball team just isn't ready for 
prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in a game that decided the West Valley League championship, 
Cleveland was beaten by Chatsworth, 67-55, continuing a dismal pattern in big 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers made only 26 of 70 shots from the field (37%), which didn't come 
as a huge surprise to Coach Kevin Crider. 
</P>
<P>
 Crider said Cleveland (13-7) shot less than 20% in losses to Inglewood and St. 
Francis in holiday tournament finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a little bit is that we're satisfied to be there (in the final)," 
Crider said. "And a little is that there just isn't enough intensity." 
</P>

<P>
 Kennedy (7-11) likely won't qualify for the City 4-A Division playoffs, but it 
isn't because swingman Jelani Janisse didn't give it his all. 
</P>
<P>
 Janisse, a 6-foot-1 junior, topped the 20-point plateau in the Golden Cougars' 
final five regular-season games and averaged 24.4 points over that stretch. He 
averaged a team-high 15.3 points overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Janisse started the season as a swingman, but was moved to forward at 
midseason. On a team with no obvious go-to player -- All-City guard Joe Wyatt 
averaged 30 points last season as a senior -- Janisse made the most of his 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a great shooter, but we kept getting him shots he could make," Coach 
Yutaka Shimizu said. "It's funny, he's not a real focal point of the offense, 
but we got him the ball at the right time and the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 players on the Kennedy roster, Janisse is one of eight who return 
next season. Then again, things might not be as easy in 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be sneaking up on anybody," Shimizu said. MISSION LEAGUE

<P>
 Viva Zapata 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing: Tom Zapata. 
</P>
<P>
 The Notre Dame senior forward had been averaging more than 20 points and 10 
rebounds in relative obscurity because of the Knights' mediocre record and the 
fact that he hardly played until this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, in three must-win games, Zapata averaged 23.7 points and 10 
rebounds. He scored 22 points in the second half against St. Bernard last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's on fire," Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He sees the court and understands 
the game so well, and the rest of the players are just seeing him. It's not 
just his offense, it's his rebounding, steals, passing." PACIFIC LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Oops 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale Coach Bob Davidson thought the Southern Section had informed him the 
Dynamiters' first-round playoff game would be Friday, so after his players 
clinched a share of the league title last Friday, he told them they could take 
off Monday, a school holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson was shocked Sunday to see his team scheduled to play Tuesday night 
against Long Beach Jordan in the first round of the Division I-AA playoffs. He 
hastily organized a practice for Monday afternoon, but he wasn't able to reach 
all his players. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating matters for Davidson, Jordan coaches did not complete the 
information sheet that coaches submit to their opponents for scouting purposes, 
Davidson said. To get a scouting report, he had to get a tape from a friend in 
Orange County. MARMONTE LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Moving On? 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo wrestlers Ronnie and Rick Peterson each must feel a little like the 
Lone Ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore twins moved from Sacramento to Camarillo before the school year 
and were inserted into the varsity lineup at 112 and 119 pounds. The Petersons 
were instrumental in helping the Scorpions sweep through the Marmonte League 
undefeated and both claimed Marmonte League individual titles. 
</P>
<P>
 But this season will likely be the only one the Petersons spend at Camarillo. 
The twins come from a military family and expect to be on the move again once 
their house is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 If the twins had a choice, they'd stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've made lots of friends in just a year," Rick Peterson said. "The 
wrestling program is great here and we're happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Ronnie (31-7) and Rick (29-8) are concerned about heading back to 
Northern California, at least temporarily. Next month's state championships are 
in Stockton. FRONTIER LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Streak Talk 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most amazing aspect of Santa Clara's 84-game league winning streak 
is that the Saints didn't set a school record until they hit 83. From 1956-65, 
Santa Clara won 82 league games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints finished the regular season 8-0 in league play and will enter next 
season with the unbeaten string at 84, which is the second longest in Southern 
Section history to Banning's 98-game streak that ended in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints haven't lost in league play since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints' 15-7 record doesn't suggest dominance, but it does provide a clue 
as to why Lou Cvijanovich's teams keep winning in the Frontier League. Tough 
nonleague opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara's defeats include losses to Long Beach Wilson (by five points), 
Thousand Oaks (by three) and Santa Barbara (by five), which beat Hart (21-1), 
the Times' No. 1 Valley team, by 10 points. Santa Clara also defeated Palmdale, 
Littlerock, Agoura and San Francisco Riordan in nonleague play. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cvijanovich: "It's no coincidence why we keep winning. I tell the young 
coaches to load up (on tough nonleague competition). Whether or not they listen 
is another story." TRI-VALLEY LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 Rising to the Occasion 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park senior Jason Kezelman picked an opportune night to have his biggest 
game. After the forward handed a bouquet of flowers to his parents on seniors 
night, Kezelman was given a rare start and responded with a game-high 19 
points. He added seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he continues to play like that, we could use him in the playoffs," said 
Coach Rob Hall after the Eagles (21-2) beat Bishop Diego, 68-50. "He's a 
shooter, a good guy to have around." 
</P>
<P>
 Kezelman hit five three-point shots in the game. His scoring average entering 
the game was 2.5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Oak Park's two defeats this season came against Frontier League 
champion Santa Clara, 58-48. If the Eagles are longing for a rematch, it could 
come in the final of the Division IV-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints (15-7) are the third-seeded team and Oak Park (21-2) is No. 4. EAST

 When Grant shut down North Hollywood center Damon Ollie last week in a game to 
determine the league's top team, the Huskies responded the best way they knew 
how. Can't go inside, have to go out. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Arthur Lee and Fantasia Johnson, who usually dish to Ollie underneath, 
changed gears and became point leaders. Lee and Johnson combined for 49 points 
as the Huskies won by two in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabulous three actually combined for 62 of the Huskies' 65 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cream rises to the top and those are three of the best players in the

</P>
<P>
 Rematch? 
</P>
<P>
 City Section girls' soccer powers Chatsworth and Grant met in the City final 
last season and are on track to do so again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say there's a good chance (of a rematch)," Grant Coach John Robb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth defeated the Lancers, 2-1, in last year's final to win its fifth 
consecutive championship. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Chancellor team (16-0-1, 7-0 in West Valley League play), has 
outscored opponents, 85-10, and has upheld the program's tradition of never 
having lost a regular-season match in the five seasons since the inception of 
City girls' soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (10-3-2, 5-1-2 in East Valley League play) has not been quite as 
dominant, but has played well. The Lancers narrowly lost to Chatsworth, 2-1, on 
Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancer forward Nicole Bucciarelli has scored 39 goals this season, including 
six in one match, and dished out 10 assists. 
</P>

 Chatsworth's sister trio -- junior Melinda George, sophomore Debbie and 
freshman Pam -- have combined for 32 goals. CHANNEL LEAGUE

 Last season, All-Southern Section Division II senior striker Juan Melgoza 
suffered cartilage damage in his knee at the end of the season, though he 
gamely tried to play his way through the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Early this season, his younger brother, Jose, suffered cartilage and ligament 
damage in his knee, and the senior striker has been sidelined since December. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a very sad loss for us," Coach Sean Roche said. "It was the same 
injury his brother had." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulldogs have endured and had a fine season, thanks to a stingy 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by goalie Mark Thompson and defenders Brian Kretschmer, Josh Merman and 
Jeff Ando, Buena (14-4-3, 10-2-2) allowed only 15 goals in 21 matches -- the 
fewest in Division II this season and a school record. Around the Leagues . . .

 The Cal State Northridge football team has added some of the defensive help it 
desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Venturine, a former starter at Oregon State, and three others have 
enrolled at Northridge, the school announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Venturine, 5-foot-11, 180 pounds, was a starting cornerback for Oregon State 
his freshman and junior seasons. The senior from Burbank is expected to earn a 
spot in Northridge's lineup as a defensive back and a kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (4-6 last season) also have added three junior college transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebackers Michael Greslie II and Joseph Pierro are attending classes at 
Northridge. Alberto Contreras, another linebacker, said last week he was 
joining the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Greslie (6-3, 225) and Contreras (6-0, 233) played for Valley College last 
season. Pierro (6-1, 215) played for Fresno City College. MIKE HISERMAN

VENTURA COUNTY INDUSTRY ASSAILS EPA SMOG PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The broad-based smog remedies recommended Tuesday by federal environmental 
officials were met with alarm and skepticism by Ventura County industry 
leaders, who said the weighty regulations could drive them out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Ventura County business executives promised to challenge portions of 
the proposal at every step of the public process before the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency recommendations become final next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complained that such stringent air quality efforts would have severe 
impacts on production and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the federal recommendations prompting special concern in Ventura County 
affects companies that emit more than four tons of hydrocarbons or four tons of 
oxides of nitrogen annually. Under the proposal, those firms would have to 
lower emissions by 6% a year for four years, beginning in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're talking a 24% reduction over four years, that's an extraordinary 
reduction," said Robert Paulger, an engineer for Procter & Gamble, which 
produces paper products at its Oxnard facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would have substantial negative implications," he said. "I don't 
know that we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The draft EPA plan covers virtually every source of air pollution in Ventura 
County and two other jurisdictions -- greater Los Angeles and Sacramento -- 
that have perennially failed to meet federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations were ordered by a federal court after Citizens to Preserve 
the Ojai and other Southern California environmental groups sued the EPA for 
failing to require local governments to observe federal laws requiring 
compliance with clean-air standards by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be comprehensive to achieve the deadlines," said Neil Levine, an 
attorney with the Environmental Defense Center of Santa Barbara, which 
represented the Ojai group in its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to affect everybody's lives because they can't afford to leave 
anybody out," Levine said of the EPA plan. "Hopefully, with the public comment 
period, we can get something effective in reducing the ozone in the air without 
causing too much grief to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County air quality officials said Tuesday that the federal plan would 
give teeth to local regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to provide substantial emission reductions that we need and can't 
attain on our own because we don't have the authority," said Richard H. 
Baldwin, director of the county Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these things are things that were out of our grasp before that will be 
beneficial to our attainment strategies," he said. "The district has no 
authority on mobile sources (of air pollution), and a lot of the reductions 
will come from mobile sources." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the reductions called for in local industry, motor vehicles 
would be required to pass a smog-check system three times tougher than the 
existing program. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly half of the ozone produced in Ventura County is the result of vehicle 
traffic, the air pollution district said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the county's major employers, including Southern California Gas 
Co., Southern California Edison and the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station, 
said they could not yet tell what impact the proposal would have on their 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison has already been targeted by Rule 59 -- a county ordinance approved in 
June, 1991, that requires power plants to reduce smog-causing emissions by 88% 
before 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural leaders said the EPA proposals would have broad impact on the 
county's billion-dollar farming industry. For example, they said, proposals to 
more closely regulate use of pesticides could threaten citrus and avocado 
growers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they were to restrict the amount we use or the days we could use them, it 
might force us to use non-selective materials," said Dave Machlitt, a Ventura 
County Farm Bureau board member. Using less effective pesticides "can cause 
other pests to become problems." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would raise costs and lead to insect resistance," Machlitt said. "It 
gets you on a treadmill where you use more and more pesticides." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, delivery trucks from outside the area that do not comply 
with local rules would be allowed only one stop in the county per visit -- 
which could have a severe impact on agriculture by raising transportation 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety-nine percent of the trucks in this county don't meet certain emission 
standards," county Agricultural Commissioner W. Earl McPhail said. "If they go 
into non-attainment, they can only make one stop in the county, and that has us 
very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 McPhail said county officials have overestimated the contribution that 
pesticides make to air pollution. But he expressed hope that the proposal can 
be amended to suit farming interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Other industries complained Tuesday that they too would be hard-pressed to 
comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's going to chase us out of here sooner or later," said Jon Cronk, 
director of health and safety for Union Oil, which has several operations 
targeted by the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Rubey, plant manager for 3M's computer tape production facility in 
Camarillo, said the plan seems to penalize companies that have already cleaned 
up emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have put in place today is the most technologically advanced system 
that's available in the world," Rubey said. "For us to reduce from this point 
can't be done." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the plaintiffs in the Ojai group's lawsuit said tough new laws are long 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be other methods (to reduce air pollution) that are less difficult 
to deal with economically," said Stan Greene, president of Citizens to Preserve 
the Ojai. "That's why there is a lengthy public comment process." 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said the benefits of cleaner air far outweigh its costs to industry and 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real cost in air pollution is what it costs in lower farm production, 
poor crops, health-care costs and lost working days," he said. "That's what we 
have to weigh it against, and people don't always look at that."

Allen Wittman, a Pierce College teacher, who helped Hunter with hand signs 
(B3). . . . Wittman has also translated live performances of "Hamlet" for deaf 
people at Cal State Northridge. She loved that work "because I got to do all of 
the roles. And how often does a woman get a role like Hamlet?" 
</P>
<P>
 LUCKY COURT: The Cal State Northridge Matadors returned to their home floor 
Tuesday (C10), which, unlike many campus structures affected by the quake, 
didn't fare that poorly. A few dozen light fixtures were replaced, and the 
basketball goals, which had moved 18 inches, were reset. . . . "The gym was one 
of the luckier ones," a CSUN official said. 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST DIBS: The renter has discovered an important ally -- the Los Angeles 
City Council. On Tuesday, the council voted to require landlords to give 
tenants of earthquake-damaged apartments the first right to return to their 
units. . . . But the ordinance may face a legal challenge from disgruntled 
owners. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 ON THE AIR: Things could be worse for KCSN-FM (88.5), the Cal State Northridge 
radio station. In fact, they were just a few weeks ago. The station had to 
operate from a campus tent with very little equipment. Soon, however, other Los 
Angeles stations came to the rescue, lending sound boards, mobile units and 
antennas. . . . Now, KCSN broadcasts from a student dormitory and has returned 
to full programming. Michael Arkush

 ASHES TO ASHES: Christians in Ventura County today will mark Ash Wednesday, 
the start of more than a month of sacrifice leading to Easter. . . . "It is a 
time to remember that our life here on Earth is short, that we do turn to ashes 
and that we need to turn to God," explained Father Norman Supancheck of St. 
Francis of Assisi Church in Fillmore. . . . Supancheck said last month's 
earthquake has spurred people to re-examine their faith: "A lot of people want 
to get right with God." 
</P>
<P>
 NO MORE DUST: Fed up with odor and dust, a group of nuns who live in a convent 
near the Bailard Landfill want to move (B1). And they want the county to pay 
the relocation costs. . . . The nuns are unhappy with tentative plans to keep 
the dump open and have hired a lawyer to press their demands. . . . "We don't 
complain. We haven't complained for 30 years," Sister Mary Purificacion said. 
"But you have to fight for yourselves sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 ROYAL TREATMENT: Forget about the recognition that comes with being one of the 
safest cities in the nation. Simi Valley has something new to brag about: 
award-winning sewage treatment. . . . The city beat out all comers in a contest 
to determine who runs the best sewage treatment plant in Ventura, Santa Barbara 
and San Luis Obispo counties. . . . "It's not one of those things everybody 
likes to talk about," said Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who accepted a 
trophy Monday on behalf of the city. "But if it doesn't work we get calls real 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE RELIEF: Members of the California Conservation Corps -- including about 
100 people from the Camarillo office -- have contributed 100,000 hours of 
earthquake recovery assistance to Ventura and Los Angeles counties. . . . And 
that's just the latest effort. The corps has been busy since October responding 
to fires, oil spills and other disasters. . . . "We've been doing this for so 
long, I've forgotten what normal is," said conservation supervisor Paul Magie 
in Camarillo. Places of Worship

GRIEGO AND COOK TAKE RLA HELM ; RIOT RECOVERY: THEIR ELECTION IS PART OF AN 
EFFORT TO STREAMLINE THE AGENCY'S OPERATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vowing to breath new life into riot recovery efforts by focusing on small 
business development in impoverished neighborhoods, RLA's new leadership team 
of Arco Chief Executive Officer Lodwrick M. Cook and former Deputy Mayor Linda 
Griego was officially elected Tuesday by the organization's 96-member Board of 
Directors.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great city for most of us, but it isn't for a lot of us," said Cook, 
who will serve as volunteer chairman of the oft-criticized private agency, 
which was created as the city's chief response to the 1992 civil unrest. "If we 
can create jobs and services in these communities, it will be beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Although further acknowledging that no agency is "going to solve all the 
problems of our community overnight," Cook said he believes that community and 
corporate goodwill can make a difference in poor neighborhoods with high 
unemployment. "The city has had a lot of hard knocks in the past year or two," 
he said. "People want to see positive things coming out of our area." 
</P>
<P>
 Griego, who will run the day-to-day operations of the agency, said she plans 
to serve foremost as an advocate for the 115,000 small business owners in 
riot-scarred neighborhoods who could expand their businesses and provide new 
jobs if they had better access to capital, a more streamlined governmental 
permitting process and an increased ability to tap into new markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "RLA needs a bottom-up economic development strategy," said the Downtown 
restaurateur, who finished fifth among 24 candidates in last year's mayoral 
primary. "Businesses are going to tell us what they need. The community is 
going to tell us what it needs." 
</P>
<P>
 One focus, she said, will be to link businesses in neglected areas with more 
successful ones elsewhere for the purpose of joint ventures. Another focus, she 
said, will be to encourage major businesses to create after-school and summer 
apprenticeship programs for inner-city high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of the two well-known community leaders solves the most 
immediate threat to the nonprofit agency's continued existence. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three months ago, RLA decided to reorganize by abandoning its 
cumbersome four co-chair leadership in favor of a single unpaid head. At the 
time, Cook, 65, was asked about taking the post by Mayor Richard Riordan but 
declined, saying he did not have the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, five other top corporate leaders whose names were floated by the 
Riordan Administration as candidates all said they were too busy with other 
commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said Tuesday that he finally decided to accept the chairmanship after 
RLA's executive committee -- on which both he and Griego serve -- agreed to 
again restructure the top post so that the pair could split the leadership 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Griego, 46, will earn $150,000 a year as the full-time chief executive 
officer. Cook plans to devote less than a day a week to his volunteer duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's office issued no comment Tuesday on the unanimous selection of Cook 
and Griego, who served as deputy mayor for economic development under former 
Mayor Tom Bradley. But Cook said that Riordan has informed him in recent days 
that he is "all for" the new leadership team. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA, which has long defined its mission as revitalizing neglected areas of Los 
Angeles County through "the creation of new jobs, economic opportunity and 
pride," has struggled to meet its goals since being formed in the wake of the 
riots by 1984 Olympics czar Peter V. Ueberroth at the request of Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA's early estimate was that an investment of about $6 billion and the 
creation of 75,000 to 94,000 jobs would be needed to turn inner-city 
neighborhoods around, but the group says it has attracted roughly one-tenth of 
that sum in private investment. 
</P>
<P>
 With the city's attention now focused on earthquake rebuilding, RLA faces a 
daunting task in regaining momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook acknowledged as much Tuesday, telling reporters that "as dramatic events 
happen, over time they fade from people's memories -- but the problems and the 
issues are still out there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our job is to try to . . . continue to work on those things that help out," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they do so, the new leaders said, RLA will significantly reduce its goals, 
concentrating on small business expansion and development rather than a panoply 
of social, housing and economic issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to reorganize," Griego said. "We're going to downsize. We've got 
limited resources, and we have a lot to do with those limited resources." 
</P>
<P>
 In coming days, she said, the 25-member paid staff will be trimmed in order to 
conserve the $2 million in funds that RLA -- which is chartered to stay in 
operation until 1997 -- has remaining. Although Griego began work immediately 
Tuesday, two of the agency's paid co-chairs, Bernard Kinsey and Linda Wong, 
will continue on the payroll for several weeks, an RLA spokeswoman said. The 
only other paid co-chair, Tony Salazar, will resign in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 RLA will also scrap task forces composed of board members that have 
concentrated on such issues as affordable housing, racial harmony and urban 
planning, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members at Tuesday's meeting expressed enthusiasm at the appointments of 
Griego and Cook, saying the two leaders can help renew flagging interest in 
rebuilding efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems of the inner city are more long standing than ones created by an 
earthquake," said attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. "With the new leadership we 
have, this will return the focus (to RLA)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ueberroth, who has remained on RLA's executive committee since stepping down 
as co-chair last year, said Cook and Griego will provide the agency with "a 
major jump-start."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; COUNCIL ARGUES OVER COLISEUM CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Awarding a Coliseum repair contract to the Tutor-Saliba construction company 
without bids or a precise price tag ignited heated controversy Tuesday in the 
Los Angeles City Council, but an effort to get an immediate hearing on the 
issue fell one vote short. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they've done is issue a blank check to a company which knows how to use 
blank checks," Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. "If it turns out it's a 
$300-million job, the commissioners' ideas on what to do may change." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden wrote the resolution urging the Coliseum Commission to 
reconsider its position and put the project out to a 10-day bidding process. At 
one point, he had secured 13 signatures for the resolution among the 15 council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum is owned by the city, county and state. The City Council has no 
authority to override decisions by the Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden and colleague Joel Wachs said Tutor-Saliba has a reputation for cost 
overruns, and they noted that its performance in building Metro Rail has become 
a subject of investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Holden resolution came up for consideration, City Council 
President John Ferraro, who had been one of six Coliseum commissioners to vote 
to give the job to Tutor-Saliba on Monday, opposed bringing up the subject. He 
said Holden had been discourteous by not telling him what he intended to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraro called a vote on whether to hear the matter, and Holden fell one vote 
short of the 10 votes necessary to bring it up off the regular agenda. Two 
members who had signed the Holden resolution, Laura Chick and Mike Hernandez, 
had left the meeting by that time, and two others, Marvin Braude and Ruth 
Galanter, switched positions to join Ferraro in blocking discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude said he had signed the Holden resolution without "really reading it." 
He added, "I thought it was 'Motherhood,' and it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Holden, an alternate on the Coliseum Commission, said later that he had asked 
officials with the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of 
Emergency Services to tell the commission they would not give repair money 
without further assurances of the extent of the damage and the validity of 
repair contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor-Saliba has drawn scrutiny for its construction of portions of the Metro 
Rail subway Downtown. Over the last five months, federal authorities and a 
panel of three appointees of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have 
examined the company's construction of 1.8 miles of twin tunnels linking Union 
Station and Pershing Square. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations followed a Times article in August reporting that numerous 
sections of those tunnels were built with concrete thinner than the 
design-specified thickness of 12 inches. The MTA panel is expected to report 
its findings sometime this month. Tutor-Saliba executives have said that any 
deficiencies resulted from construction mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 As planning for the Coliseum repair project on a 24-hour-a-day emergency basis 
got under way Tuesday, the commission president and the only member to vote 
against awarding the repair contract without bid, Los Angeles County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said she found the no-bid decision "very strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said that she was "under no illusion that the outcome of a bidding 
process would have been any different" in light of the Coliseum Commission's 
long, cordial relationship with Tutor-Saliba and the fact that most 
commissioners wanted the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she added, she had felt that a bidding process of seven days, similar to 
the emergency procedures Caltrans has used in hiring contractors for freeway 
repairs, would have at least brought the commission much useful information as 
to what various parties thought about the repair job, and might have given the 
commission more leverage over costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, she hopes that a four-member earthquake construction committee 
she has appointed to monitor the work will deal with the firm on an 
"arms-length basis," or, she warned: "We could end up with obligations that are 
just ill-defined." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Sloan, one of the commissioners who voted to proceed without a bid, 
defended the decision Tuesday as the best solution under circumstances of 
having to get the stadium ready for the next football season in less than 200 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sloan said any kind of bidding process would have delayed the work by three to 
four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor-Saliba, Sloan said, completed a $15-million renovation at the Coliseum 
last summer. "They came in on time or early," he said. "They came in under 
budget and they did better than the minimal compliance with the contract terms 
. . . and they know the building backward and forward." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Nabib Youssef, the principal structural engineer who 
has been retained to assess the Coliseum damage, said he believes that by the 
end of the first week in March all the quake damage will be fully assessed, 
including the condition of the earth berm on which the stadium is built. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to the season opening," Youssef said. "With the start we 
have, we are very comfortable with that."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; ALL IN THE FAMILY; HOME CAN BE HARD TO TAKE AS 
DISPLACED RETURN TO NEST 
</P>

 Kristi Skinner left home at age 18 after years of rebellious warfare with a 
protective mother. Now, five years later, she's back -- an earthquake refugee 
forced by necessity to give mom another try. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Glen, Barbara Soll's home was invaded by an army of grandchildren 
and a mother-in-law who snored so loudly that her family claimed she could stir 
the coyotes in the bushes outside. 
</P>
<P>
 After yet another long day of unclogging drains and plunging toilets, plumber 
Charlie Scott can't even smoke a cigarette while zoning out in front of the 
boob tube. For now, he's living with the in-laws, who can't stand smoke and go 
to bed so early that Scott and his wife have to watch TV programs with closed 
captions, as though they were highfalutin foreign films. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie raises his eyebrows a lot around here because my parents are 
particular about things we're not used to," said his wife, Cathy. "Like, they 
don't smoke and we do. So we end up lighting up outside in the back yard. It's 
kind of cold but there we are, huddled like a couple of teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California has been filled with bizarre bedfellows since last month's 
temblor as countless displaced residents have taken advantage of something far 
more traumatic than the no-strings-attached kindness of strangers: 
</P>
<P>
 Grandmothers. In-laws. Kooky co-workers. Estranged siblings. Ex-spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under many roofs, it has been a replay of "All in the Family." The Meathead 
arguing with grouchy father-in-law Archie Bunker. It's cranky Uncle Charlie 
moved back in to feed the boys in "My Three Sons." "Melrose Place" meets the 
"Golden Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Grown children have endured the saccharine nicknames they had as infants. 
Obsessive mothers have forced chicken soup and brown-bag lunches on their 
white-collar sons. Even among friends, there have been fights over first-shower 
rights, angry looks at the breakfast table over the teething baby's cries the 
night before. And, of course, there's the opinionated grandmother poking her 
nose into family arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, your mother loves you -- she loves you too much," said a 22-year-old 
North Hollywood nurse forced to move back in with her mom. "It's really like 
some nightmare you have about going back to your childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has affected about 55,000 homes and apartments in 
the Los Angeles area. And although statistics are hard to come by, Red Cross 
officials estimate that thousands of residents continue to seek temporary and 
long-term shelter with friends, family and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Cosley has been keeping an eye on such informal arrangements. He is a 
domestic violence detective for the Los Angeles Police Department's West San 
Fernando Valley office who has been looking for signs that such family reunions 
lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the instances have been few. But as time goes on and family guests 
reluctantly overstay their welcome, Cosley says, even the calmest nerves can 
become frayed. People lash out. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dust clears, 22-year-old Kristi Skinner has realized that being back 
home in Glendale isn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if her mother, Sharon Saye, and her 6-year-old sister call her Sissy? 
And what if mom, as she did years ago, once again waits up for Skinner if she 
goes out? 
</P>
<P>
 Five years away from home can change a young woman, she says. She and mom are 
friends now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we've resumed some of our old roles now that she's back home," said 
Saye, an Encino dentist. "But there have been the surprises, like coming home 
to find the house clean and the dishes done. That didn't happen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights, Charlie and Cathy Scott hold their breath at her parents' Canoga 
Park home, tiptoeing around to avoid waking them. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was the time Charlie parked his truck too close to the security 
night light switch in the front yard. "My dad made him move his truck about six 
inches," Cathy said. "After they went to bed, Charlie said, 'Why didn't he just 
turn the dumb light off?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bill and Fern Burch say that, despite some minor disagreements, everyone has 
made the best of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, Bill is hard of hearing and I just blank everything out," Fern said. 
"We just close our door at night. The kids are just trying to be considerate." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Glen, while playing host to her stepdaughter, three grandchildren 
and 83-year-old mother-in-law, Barbara Soll has wiped kiddie fingerprints from 
furniture and played referee. 
</P>
<P>
 "My stepdaughter woke us up in the middle of the night, nearly in tears -- she 
said she couldn't take it anymore, with the neighbor's half-dog, half-wolf 
howling and my mother-in-law's snoring," said the legal assistant who works 
with her husband, an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The next night was no better. "We finally had to get her a pair of earplugs," 
Soll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Cassese defines a new breed of post-earthquake victim: middle-class 
homeless. You name the place, she's stayed there. Couches of co-workers and 
pesky older brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was The Ex. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the quake, he came driving up to her Woodland Hills apartment 
with friends and drove her to the safety of his home -- the one that used to be 
theirs. She stayed only one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of weird, kind of tense," said the 31-year-old accountant. "He 
didn't want the divorce. We're not enemies, but it was hard because there are 
still lots of feelings there. His parents called and thought it was strange 
that I answered the phone. It was strange." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the quake, new friendships have been forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Country residents Dave and Kathy Baldwin opened their home to a single 
mother whose apartment was devastated by the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin and her guest, Ronnalee Evert, are both in their late 30s. Baldwin has 
twin 7-year-old girls and Evert a 6-year-old daughter, all of whom have become 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna Evert has even taken to calling Dave Baldwin "Papa Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like 'The Brady Bunch' in some ways," Evert said. Evert helps with the 
bills. She helps cook and clean, and the twins obey her like a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," Evert said. "I would have never in a million years wished for 
this earthquake. But now, every night, I say my prayers knowing that I am 
blessed to have met a family like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're all one family now."

BERNSTEIN REELECTED AS TEACHERS UNION CHIEF; LABOR: L.A. DISTRICT PRESIDENT 
GETS 61% OF VOTES EVEN AFTER EDUCATORS TOOK AN UNPRECEDENTED 10% PAY CUT LAST 
YEAR. HER GOALS INCLUDE RESTORING SOME OF THAT SALARY LOSS.

 As the Los Angeles Unified School District prepares to grapple with the 
post-quake issue of pushing ahead with a massive reform effort without 
additional money, the powerful teachers union made a key decision Tuesday and 
relected its outspoken president, Helen Bernstein. Bernstein, the first United 
Teachers-Los Angeles president forced to deliver a pay cut for teachers, faced 
four challengers as she bid for reelection to a two-year term. She was 
reelected with 61% of the vote in a move likely to affect the upcoming 
wrangling over school reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein's challengers presented a diverse slate of options for the 28,000 
union members, including promises to stop bashing the district administration, 
turn over teacher salary decisions to the State Board of Education, make peace 
with the district's other labor unions and use UTLA's influence to push for 
higher corporate taxes to fund education. 
</P>
<P>
 But the results seem to show that teachers had confidence in her leadership 
and did not blame her for the unprecedented 10% pay cut they took last year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,000, or 30%, of union members cast ballots. Joshua Pechthalt, a Manual 
Arts High School social science teacher who publishes a newsletter critical of 
union leadership, came in second with 14% of the vote. Despite Bernstein's 
victory, Pechthalt said, many teachers are deeply demoralized and have little 
hope that working conditions will improve under her leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Education leaders, parents and school board members agreed on one key labor 
issue: A repeat of last year's protracted, divisive salary negotiations, which 
held parents and students captive to a strike threat for six months, will not 
be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely critical that we do not repeat past patterns in terms of 
contract negotiations," school board President Leticia Quezada said. "We will 
not be able to implement the reform initiatives that the board wants . . . if 
we are doing negotiations in the same manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The labor strife -- which included court battles, name-calling and a teacher 
camp-out at district headquarters when talks stalled -- deeply eroded public 
confidence in Los Angeles public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than concentrating on reforming the nation's second-largest school 
district, the school board and superintendent focused for months on averting a 
strike. Teachers endured an anxiety-ridden year with four strike votes. Other 
employees were fearful that their jobs would be sacrificed to make more money 
available for teacher salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein said she would aim for a short, sweet deal in which the district 
"starts to give back the stuff they took away" from teacher salaries last year. 
"There is no way to hold the district together otherwise," she said. If 
teachers do vote to strike, the walkout would take place before classes resume 
in the fall, she said. 'The membership is not going to put up with a long 
process . . . and I don't believe the public will take another year of it," 
Bernstein said. "If it's not a good enough offer the first time, they don't 
come back to work. And they do it before school opens in the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways the tenor of labor relations in the coming months will be a 
litmus test of the school district's ability to make good on public promises 
that it is committed to improving student achievement rather than fighting for 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring and summer, the district and its union leaders campaigned against 
the unsuccessful school voucher initiative and the breakup of the district 
promoted by disgruntled parents and some politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of Los Angeles, there is a perception on the part of elected 
officials and even in the foundation community that (the Los Angeles district) 
is ungovernable," said Virgil Roberts, president of Solar Records Inc. and a 
board member of the LEARN reform organization. "Any sort of disharmony will 
lend credence to that belief and justify saying it makes sense to break it up 
and have a voucher plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Union negotiations, however, are only one issue on the district's critical 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Sid Thompson has promised to radically restructure the district by June, 
dismantling the massive system into self-governing clusters of high schools and 
their feeder campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-touted LEARN reform plan -- a blueprint for empowering principals, 
teacher and parents to make their own decisions -- will launch its second phase 
within two months. A task force has been formed to figure out how the district 
should allocate money to LEARN schools, which will have authority to determine 
their own budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has been advised that its $3.9-billion budget will remain flat 
next year, with no more state money for new programs or enrollment growth. As a 
result, the Board of Education will be confronted with tough choices over 
funding priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake damage estimated to be as high as $700 million is still being 
assessed and could cost less. But while federal and state aid will cover most 
repairs, it is not known how much money the district will have to chip in. Even 
a small percentage could deal a severe blow to budget planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are on the eve of the proof of the pudding, and so it's a scary time," 
Quezada said. "Clearly we are not going to have enough money for all the 
priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 There appears to be consensus that promoting LEARN, restructuring and 
attempting to restore employee salaries are at the top of most board members' 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 However, school board member Victoria Castro said she wants to see the school 
police force bolstered and more janitors and gardeners hired. Member Mark 
Slavkin said streamlining the administration is important. Several others said 
earthquake preparedness will need attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, too, are clamoring to be heard throughout the process and their 
patience may be wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the district to show us that parents are going to be more involved in 
schools," said Harriet Sculley, president of the San Fernando Valley branch of 
the PTA. "We have to be involved in both the planning and implementing of new 
programs to have a true voice."

KEEPING A SECRET; FLORISTS' TACT TESTED IN FIELDING QUERIES ABOUT ANONYMOUS 
GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the morning after Valentine's Day, and the man on the phone was beside 
himself. He had received tulips from Los Feliz Florists that were for all 
practical purposes anonymous. Their only tag of identity was an old yellowing 
1985 Valentine's Day card that said Happy Valentine's Day to Bette From Mick. 
It was a mistake, he insisted. His name wasn't Bette or Mick -- it was Mike. 
No, explained the florist, that card came with that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was going nuts trying to find out who sent them," said Vince Crisboi, 
the manager of the flower shop who dispatched them to the radio station where 
Mike worked. 
</P>
<P>
 When confronted with the ticklish question of who was behind the mystery 
flowers, Crisboi fell back on his profession's unwritten code: "I said, 'We 
have hundreds of people come in the store and I can't remember who the person 
was,' " Crisboi recounted innocently. 
</P>
<P>
 Right. Like he could forget her. For one thing, she got a parking ticket 
outside his shop. "She said, 'These flowers are really costing me a lot of 
money, you better not tell him who they're from.' " She knew exactly what she 
wanted and she had her own strange card to go with the order. She didn't even 
want to be described. "She said, 'If he calls and asks what I look like, you 
won't tell him anything about me, will you?' " Crisboi, ever the gallant 
florist, promised: "I said, 'No, it's not a problem.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who could be more caught in the crosscurrents of love and lust on Valentine's 
Day than a florist? But no matter how the recipient coaxes and clamors on the 
morning-after, mum's the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the sender) asked us not to, I never would. Never," said Arlene Copeland, 
manager of Secret Garden in Beverly Hills, which sent four or five anonymous 
deliveries, one of them a silver pitcher resplendent with lilacs, amaryllis and 
blushingly peach roses (for a cool $140.) "The recipient basically isn't our 
customer. We really try to service our customer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's less a matter of the florist being priest-like than businesslike. But 
that doesn't stop the florist from trying to let the perplexed down easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Woods in Brentwood, saleswoman Wendy Camras spent one post-Valentine's 
call soothing a recipient of an anonymous arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'If I told you, he would probably never send anything anonymously 
through us again,' " said Camras. "She understood I couldn't tell her but she 
was definitely frustrated that she couldn't find out who sent her flowers. I 
think they were from her husband. He had the same last name. I don't know who 
she thought her secret admirer was. I said, 'I'm sure you'll find out soon 
enough.' She said, 'Yeah, I guess so.' People aren't very patient." 
</P>
<P>
 They are, however, overly confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who calls says, 'Don't give out my name, they know who it is,"' 
said Copeland the day after Valentine's Day in a shop surrounded by orchids and 
amaryllis and serenaded softly by finches in a bird cage (which are for hire 
with topiary arrangements.) "I'd say 80% of the people call and ask who sent 
the flowers. So they don't know who they're from. But the customer thinks 
they're the only special person in someone's life." 
</P>
<P>
 Crisboi said: "It's very arrogant. They think, 'Oh, I'm the love of their 
life. They'll know.' And they always call." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigative fervor knows no bounds. "They'll try everything," said 
Robert Alvarado, owner of Aida's Flowers in Hollywood. "They'll say they're not 
going to tell anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland sees a gender difference. When women call, they tend to inquire 
softly. Men, however, are "usually more blunt: 'Well, I don't know who this 
is.' Because some men have a lot of girlfriends," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the person the customer wants to tantalize isn't even getting the 
flowers: "One woman had flowers sent to herself and the card read, 'From the 
guy at the gym,' " Crisboi said. "She did it to piss off her husband."

AFTER THE QUAKE ; NEWS IN BRIEF; LAW GIVES PRIORITY TO TENANTS OF DAMAGED 
BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to require landlords to give 
tenants of quake-damaged apartments first priority to reoccupy them after 
repairs, despite a warning from the city attorney that the law may be flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was supported by an alliance of apartment owners, tenant 
representatives and community activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was designed to prevent landlords from using quake damage to evict the 
thousands of tenants forced out of about 18,000 apartment units citywide so 
they can be replaced by new tenants paying higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows a displaced tenant five days after the completion of repairs to 
inspect the unit and decide whether to reoccupy it at the same rent. The 
landlord cannot raise the rent to recoup repair costs without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senior Assistant City Atty. Claudia McGee Henry said the law may be 
vulnerable to legal challenges by landlords, who may complain because, in most 
cases, tenants who have found other lodgings they must cancel will not actually 
move back until the beginning of the next month. That could tie up the unit 
with no rent coming in for up to 30 days. She said the law also is vague about 
when the landlord must give the former tenant a chance to inspect a unit.

AFTER THE QUAKE ; NEWS IN BRIEF; STATE ASKS FEMA TO EXTEND DEADLINE FOR AID 
REQUESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deadline for nonprofit organizations that sustained earthquake damage to 
apply for disaster assistance is Thursday. However, the state has asked the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency to extend the deadline for another 30 days, 
and FEMA officials said they will probably grant the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Under FEMA guidelines, those eligible are private nonprofit educational, 
utility, emergency, medical or custodial care facilities, including those for 
senior citizens and the disabled and any other facility providing essential 
health and safety services to the general public. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples are museums, libraries, zoos, homeless shelters and community 
centers. Essential health and safety services can include such things as 
low-income housing, alcohol and drug rehabilitation, battered spouse programs, 
food programs and transportation to medical facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit public interest law firm Public Counsel is offering free legal 
assistance to eligible organizations. For information call Peter Manzo at (213) 
385-2977, Ext. 122. 
</P>
<P>
 To register potential claims with FEMA, call (800) 462-9029. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to file for federal unemployment disaster assistance has been 
extended from Friday to March 31. People whose employment was interrupted by 
the Northridge earthquake and who do not qualify for regular unemployment 
insurance may file for up to 26 weeks of disaster benefits. Claims can be filed 
at any Employment Development Department office.

AFTER THE QUAKE ; NEWS IN BRIEF; CITY COUNCIL ORDERS AUDIT OF SEISMIC SAFETY 
PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday ordered an audit of a 3 1/2-year-old 
seismic safety program that has strengthened only a handful of about 200 
buildings and bridges in need of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to hire a full-time analyst in the controller's office 
to oversee progress on the $376-million program and two other public works bond 
projects that have proceeded slowly.If work is not expedited, the analyst will 
inform the mayor and the council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported last month that less than $30 million of the seismic safety 
money had been spent since the bond was approved in 1990 and that progress was 
also slow on separate projects to remodel libraries and police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's actions followed half an hour of scathing comments, directed at 
Department of Public Works officials who are directing the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceding that the work has gone slowly, the bureaucrats said that 
improvements have been made since last year, when City Controller Rick Tuttle 
and then-Mayor Tom Bradley urged speeding up of the work. Tuttle and Bradley 
got the council to agree to put 50 public works employees on a special detail 
to draw plans, solicit bids and oversee construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the Public Works Department showed that seismic improvements 
have been completed at just five of 51 buildings, with a $92-million 
rehabilitation of City Hall the biggest uncompleted project. Nine bridges have 
been strengthened and 163 are yet to be done.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES AIRPORT; 
AIRLINES' SUIT TO OVERTURN LANDING FEES IS DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a suit by more than 70 airlines to 
overturn landing fees for Los Angeles International Airport that were tripled 
by the city last year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima ruled that the airlines that object to 
the higher fees should appeal to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena 
or the Federal Aviation Administration, not the federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Air Transport Assn. said it is more likely that they will turn 
to Congress to get legislation that makes it easier for them to challenge fees 
in court or some other forum. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials praised the ruling and said it will help them recover the cost 
of operating LAX. They said the charges -- which jumped to about $900 for an 
average-weight Boeing 747 -- represent only a tiny fraction of expenses for 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry officials said the higher fees will force them to raise ticket 
prices and will hamper their already unhealthy companies. An appeal is 
unlikely, particularly because the U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to 
throw out airport fees in a similar case from Michigan, the airline officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airlines for the past three months have been paying the higher landing fees 
under protest.

AFTER THE QUAKE ; NEWS IN BRIEF; SAFETY CONCERNS SPUR EVACUATION OF 150 USC 
STUDENTS IN DORMITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC officials on Tuesday began evacuating 150 students from a Downtown 
dormitory because of concerns that some of the masonry walls inside the 
historic 1914 building could fall and trap residents during another major 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said that the auditorium at Embassy Residential College, at 
851 S. Grand Ave., has been closed since last month's earthquake because of 
structural damage, but that engineers had said apartments in the 10-story 
structure were safe for occupancy.Further investigation completed last week, 
however, found potential problems with residential corridor walls during an 
earthquake near or centered in Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, USC officials hired a moving firm to pack up the students, 
who pay $518 a month for a single room. Their relocation should be complete by 
next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 68 students and faculty adviser Kevin Starr, professor of urban and 
regional planning, will be housed on two floors of the University Hilton, 
across from the campus. The rest will be sent to the Sierra Apartments, 
university-owned housing off Portland Avenue. The relocation, which will last 
through the end of classes in May, will cost USC at least $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 USC bought the historic building -- it is the original concert hall of the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic and a place where evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson held 
services -- in 1987. School officials said they do not know how much it will 
cost to reinforce the walls or when the work will be done.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; CITY COUNCIL 
VOTES CURFEW FOR TEEN-AGERS UNDER 18 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to stem crimes committed by and against juveniles, Inglewood city 
officials have approved a plan for a citywide curfew for youths under 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved the curfew, which is to take effect March 18.Mayor 
Edward Vincent, a retired probation officer, said a curfew would keep many gang 
members off the streets and force parents to take responsibility for their 
children.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Inglewood is committed to doing something, because the 
excuse-making is over," he said. "I'm just saying you can get shot anywhere, 
but I'm going to do something about it."  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a teen-age girl, a toddler and three other people were killed in 
two nights of bloodshed that one Inglewood police veteran characterized as the 
worst spate of violence in the city's history. City Councilman Jose Fernandez 
said the curfew would go into effect at 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 11 
p.m. Friday through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are exceptions to and from the rule, such as if a young person is with 
an adult, is coming and going to a movie theater or going to and from work," he 
said. "If a youth violates (the curfew), they will be brought to a detention 
center at the Inglewood Police Department," the councilman said. "Parents will 
be contacted. They will have to pick up the young person. A citation will be 
issued if the parents do not pick up the young person, and we will hold them 
until 4 a.m. and then transport them to Westlake Juvenile Hall."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
TRANSIT AGENCY REPORTS SAVINGS OF $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said Tuesday that the 
cash-strapped county agency has cut its costs in outside professional services 
by nearly two-thirds over two years, saving an estimated $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings are in large part a result of streamlining after the MTA was 
created last year by merging the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
and the Southern California Rapid Transit District.Officials of the new agency 
credit an aggressive campaign to get rid of duplicate services and to perform 
more tasks in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of contracts awarded to outside agencies for such services as 
printing and accounting dropped from a combined 675 by the two agencies in 
fiscal year 1992 to a projected 340 at the end of this fiscal year. During that 
same time period, costs for these services dipped from $146 million to $46 
million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our budget is tight, (so) we're being much more careful" about securing 
outside services, MTA chief Franklin White said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, White said, the savings have already been accounted for in this 
year's budget and will have no impact on the $126-million deficit the MTA 
expects to incur next year. Also, he said, other outside costs, such as design 
contracts, are expected to increase.

RAPIST HELD BY INS IS FREED AFTER 16 MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Soviet immigrant Alexander Okner, jailed by the Immigration and Naturalization 
Service for 16 months because the agency believed he posed a threat to society, 
has been released on bond in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Okner, who served eight years in California state prison for the kidnaping and 
repeated rape of a Santa Monica woman, had been imprisoned at the federal 
detention center at Terminal Island since October, 1992. Although he has been 
ordered deported from the United States, no country will take him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea why they let me out," Okner said of his release last week. "I 
honestly do not know." 
</P>
<P>
 The INS could not be reached for comment Monday. Earlier, however, 
representatives of the INS district office in Los Angeles said they had no 
intention of releasing Okner for any reason except deportation because they 
felt he was a threat to society. 
</P>
<P>
 Okner, 39, was featured in a Los Angeles Times article earlier this month 
about the indefinite detention of illegal immigrants who have committed serious 
crimes in this country and cannot be deported. 
</P>
<P>
 Okner was allowed into the United States from the Soviet Union with his 
parents and grandmothers 17 years ago. But unlike his relatives, he did not 
complete his legal immigration process and had been ordered excluded under U.S. 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia, however, has refused to take him, as has Ukraine, where he was born. 
Israel, which Okner petitioned because of his Jewish heritage, also declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Okner said he was released from Terminal Island after his parents -- both 
naturalized U.S. citizens -- posted a $5,000 bond. They and others, including a 
psychiatrist who was treating Okner at the Terminal Island facility, had argued 
that he had been rehabilitated and was no longer dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no driver's license, no money, no job, but I am happy to be out," 
Okner said. "Whatever happened was a long time ago and it is not going to 
happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Okner, described by his probation officer as a career criminal, has 
convictions for assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon, extortion, 
kidnaping and rape, and he has admitted using drugs. "People grow up and 
change," Okner said.

PAYOUTS DROP IN LITIGATION AGAINST POLICE; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SPECIAL UNIT 
ESTABLISHED BY CITY ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS BETTER PREPARED TO COUNTER LEGAL 
ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS AND THE DEPARTMENT, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A special unit set up by the Los Angeles city attorney's office to handle 
lawsuits against police apparently has reversed years of spiraling litigation 
losses, cutting payouts to plaintiffs in its first full year of operation 
almost in half, city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first year, the city attorney's Police Litigation Unit handled cases 
against individual police officers and the department that resulted in $10.7 
million in judgments and awards in calendar year 1993 -- down from $19.7 
million in 1992 and $14.7 million in 1991, according to City Atty. James K. 
Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 City attorneys within the unit went to trial in police cases 36 times during 
1993, winning 27 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cases was a high-profile lawsuit filed by the manager of a 
McDonald's in Sunland, who accused the Los Angeles Police Department's 
controversial Special Investigation Section of watching as robbers broke into 
her restaurant at closing time and terrorized her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move -- even though the SIS officers acknowledged they allowed 
the robbery to take place -- the judge took the case away from a jury and ruled 
that the police should not be held liable for damages sought by the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn attributed much of the success in that case and other lawsuits to the 
creation of the unit, which has given city lawyers more time to work on cases 
and more resources, including police detectives who are handling the often 
time-consuming investigative work necessary to rebut claims. Many of the cases 
involved excessive use of force by officers, or negligence in protecting 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time we've ever been able to bring a team approach to these 
high exposure cases," Hahn said in an interview. "Our feeling now is that we 
are prepared on all our cases. We are not afraid to go to trial anymore for 
fear we are not prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to Hahn, Senior Assistant City Atty. Thomas C. Hokinson noted that 
judgments to plaintiffs dropped sharply, but said he was concerned that the 
number of claims received involving police incidents rose from 585 in 1992 to 
726 last year. Lawsuits ultimately filed against the city rose only slightly, 
from 226 to 246.

THE $160,000 DOG; SETTLEMENT ENDS LAWSUIT OVER THE CUSTODY OF CHAMPION BULL 
TERRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A case that began with the dog-naping of Shavin-Kingsmere Notty Nada ended 
quietly with the negotiated settlement of a lawsuit Monday, almost four years 
after anyone involved had seen the champion bull terrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Five people have agreed to pay $160,000 to settle the suit filed in Van Nuys 
Superior Court by a Northridge physician who contended they stole the dog from 
her back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 Nada, the same breed as the beer-promoting Spuds McKenzie of TV commercials, 
now lives with a mysterious couple known only as Helen and Jim. The pooch will 
stay with the couple, according to the five defendants, who gained control of 
the animal as part of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog's got to have a life too," said Major Alan Langer, an attorney who 
represented Patricia Walters, the doctor who filed the suit. The defendants 
wanted a trial but were forced into the settlement by insurance companies 
paying their legal expenses, attorneys said. One lawyer involved in the case 
since it began estimated that legal expenses on all sides have topped $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, a podiatrist who paid $600 for Nada as a puppy, filed the suit April 
5, 1990, about a month after the dog was removed from her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a shared ownership agreement between Walters and 
Shavin-Kingsmere -- the breeding partnership that sold the dog to her. That 
agreement called for Shavin-Kingsmere trainers to present the animal at dog 
shows across North America, and to supervise her breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters contended in her lawsuit that the trainers used unethical methods to 
show the dog, while Shavin-Kingsmere contended in a reply that Walters was 
improperly training the animal and had plans to breed Nada without the 
partnership's consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters "in effect stole the dog by refusing to give up possession to the 
other owners," said attorney Robert Armstrong, who initially represented all 
the defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One defendant, William Edwards of Glendale, admittedly climbed over a block 
wall into Walters' back yard, grabbed the dog and handed it over the wall to 
Robert Bollong, an off-duty Orange County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw this dog was distressed," said attorney Nathan B. Hoffman, who 
represented Linda Lethin-Martin and her husband, Terry Martin, of Anaheim, 
participants in the Shavin-Kingsmere partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the partnership said in court documents that while attending a dog 
show, they met a couple they will identify only as Helen and Jim whose bull 
terrier had recently died. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave them the championship dog as a replacement, the defendants said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bollong, a 12-year veteran of his department, maintained that he did nothing 
wrong because he was merely helping a friend retrieve property held hostage in 
a business dispute. Nevertheless, the holders of his homeowners' insurance 
policy will pay Walters $30,000 under personal liability provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards and his wife, Patricia, are responsible for $100,000 of the total 
settlement. Insurance covering Lethin-Martin will pay the final $30,000.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; PRIVATE FIRM TO OPEN SHOOTING RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After four years of opposition and delays, the Simi Valley City Council has 
agreed to allow a private company to open a shooting range that could save the 
Police Department up to $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also agreed to change its development code to permit the shooting 
gallery to operate in a warehouse on Easy Street on the city's west end. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooter's Paradise, an Oxnard-based company, will operate the range, which is 
scheduled to open in about six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Company President George Rice said he plans to equip the range with a 
classroom, gun shop and nine shooting lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to pay the range about $100,000 a year to provide shooting 
facilities for the Police Department. Shooter's Paradise will also be open to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The range will save the city an estimated $25,000 a year in overtime and 
travel costs that it pays to the department's 110 officers to drive to ranges 
in Camarillo and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials began trying to open a range in 1990, after the city's range at 
the former Corriganville Ranch was shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 After several proposals for outdoor sites were opposed by residents who did 
not want a shooting range in their neighborhoods, the city began seeking a 
contractor who would open an indoor range. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb, an avid shooter and member of the National Rifle 
Assn., said she is eager to try out her 22-Ruger at the range. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been waiting for this for a long time," Webb said. "I'd like to be the 
first one to shoot." SARA CATANIA

MORTGAGE CEILING RAISED IN U.S. QUAKE RELIEF PACKAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A little-noticed provision of the $8.6-billion earthquake aid bill signed last 
week raised the limit for FHA-insured mortgages for earthquake-damaged homes 
from $151,725 to $203,150 -- a move that could benefit numerous homeowners and 
first-time home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing the loan ceiling will make the mortgage program available to more 
middle-class quake victims. It is the first time the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, which administers the program, has raised the limit as the 
result of a natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans will be available to homeowners to repair damaged residences as well 
as to renters who buy a home if their domicile was damaged or destroyed by the 
Northridge quake. Renters who qualify for loans will be able to purchase a home 
with no down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very significant because of the cost of housing in the Valley," where 
the Jan. 17 quake was centered, said Joe Hirsch, director of housing for HUD's 
Los Angeles office. "A large volume of homes out there (cost) between $150,000 
and $200,000. I think that this is going to make those homes accessible" to 
many first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 26,000 dwellings were seriously damaged by the pre-dawn temblor, 
which inflicted as much as $20 billion in destruction. The median price of a 
home in Los Angeles is $195,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage brokers and officials say that the higher loan ceiling may permit 
some homeowners to retain their damaged homes rather than walk away from them. 
Others will be able to complete repairs more readily by simultaneously 
refinancing their homes and receiving a construction loan through a single 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest thing since sliced bread," said Dick Richards, vice 
president and Los Angeles regional operator of Malone Mortgage, which is 
authorized to make loans under the HUD programs. "The greatest limit we have in 
California with FHAs is the loan limits. For the vast majority of people, 
they're just too low." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip and Terry Pina, renters in Northridge for six years, agreed. Upon 
learning of the new loan limits they decided to buy their quake-battered house 
from their landlord and fix it up themselves. The cost is estimated at 
$190,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our best chance," Pina said. "We were never able to afford it before." 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the law, which will be in effect for 18 months, was tucked into 
the massive emergency spending measure by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) at 
the request of HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros.  
</P>
<P>
 The increased limits apply to two kinds of loans. The 203(h) program allows 
the owner or renter of a damaged or destroyed property to qualify for 100% 
financing to purchase a single-family residence. The building to be acquired 
does not have to be quake-damaged or even located in the disaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 203(k) program provides mortgage insurance for an individual to buy or 
refinance a residence or investment property and rehabilitate it 
simultaneously.  
</P>
<P>
 Multi-unit buildings are not eligible for the 203(h) loans; buildings with as 
many as four units can receive loans under the 203(k) program.  
</P>
<P>
 Before government-approved private lenders can begin making loans, regulations 
must be adopted in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 Some quake victims may still find that more attractive loan terms are 
available from other government agencies, including the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. 
</P>

Chatsworth.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; PACK LIGHT, DRINK WATER, WALK LOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There is nothing worse than feeling under par while traveling. It is hard 
enough to manage time zone changes, navigate unfamiliar territory and eat well 
on a steady diet of hotel and banquet fare without also feeling sick and tired. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some things you can do to stay fit when you travel. Here are 
some suggestions from doctors, chiropractors and physical therapists, as well 
as some exercises from the book, "The Business Traveler's Guide to Good Health 
on the Road," edited by Karl Neumann, M.D., and Maury Rosenbaum (Chronimed: 
1994). Before Boarding 
</P>
<P>
 Always pack as lightly as possible and try to avoid carrying anything onto the 
plane, especially if you have back problems, said Santa Monica-based 
chiropractor Shelly Roth, whose patients include numerous business travelers. 
Lifting a carry-on bag into the overhead bin can aggravate an existing back 
condition, or give you a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you carry things on, you're asking for problems," she said. "Injuries 
can last forever. It's just not worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Use porters at the airport whenever possible, or rent a baggage cart. And 
always buy suitcases with built-in wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also better to carry two smaller bags for balance than to try to cram 
everything into one heavy bag, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Roth's patients are business travelers in their 40s who have been 
traveling and hauling luggage around extensively for 10 years, she said. 
Shoulder, neck and back pain have forced them to revise their travel habits, 
she said. They don't take as much with them anymore. On The Plane 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing you should do when you get on a plane is grab as many pillows 
as you can," Roth said. Use the pillows to "customize" the seat to your body. 
Put one pillow behind your lower back for support, and use the others to prop 
and stabilize yourself in a comfortable position. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to pillows, some travelers like to use an inflatable cervical 
pillow that wraps around the back of the neck to support the head, said Dr. 
Myron Shapero, a former competitive marathon runner who practices family 
medicine in Los Angeles. Also, try sitting with your knees higher than your 
hips by propping your legs on something, he said. This takes pressure off your 
lower back. 
</P>
<P>
 And always wear comfortable, non-binding clothing that allows you to move and 
stretch. Taking your shoes off while sitting will also help keep your 
circulation moving. When seated, don't cross your legs, which can cut off your 
circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important factor in feeling better on a plane trip, however, is to 
not sit for prolonged periods, Shapero said. "Get up and walk as often as 
possible, at least every 30 minutes if you can." Walk to the back of the plane, 
if possible, and do some standing stretches. The longer you are on the plane, 
the more frequently you should get up and walk around. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting for long periods can cause swelling in your lower extremities and 
tension in other parts of your body, said Donna Beaver, physical therapist at 
Glendale Adventist Medical Center. To counter these effects, try some of these 
stretches while sitting: 
</P>
<P>
 * Raise your arms over your head with your fingers laced together, palms up, 
and hold for 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Raise the elbow of one arm so your hand falls behind your head. Grasp the 
elbow with your other hand and pull down. Hold 10 seconds on each side. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rotate your head five times in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shrug your shoulders up and down several times to release tension, then 
rotate them backward and forward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do trunk twists, turning to face the back of the seat with your hips squared 
and facing front. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rotate your wrists 10 times clockwise and counterclockwise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shake out your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rotate your ankles 10 times in each direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Point and flex your feet. When you flex your foot, spread your toes. 
</P>
<P>
 * With your feet on the floor, pull up your heels, then lower them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Suck in your stomach and hold a few seconds, then release. Repeat as many 
times as you can. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exercise gluteal muscles and quadriceps by pressing your feet into the floor 
(with knees bent so legs are perpendicular to the floor) while tightening 
buttock muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to stretching and moving, make sure you drink plenty of water to 
counteract the fatiguing effects of dehydration. Also, eat lightly and avoid 
alcohol and caffeine, Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some travelers now routinely order vegetarian meals in advance, which are 
typically lighter fare. Another trick is to eat yogurt to keep the digestive 
track healthy and head off potential travel-related stomach upsets. At Your 
Destination 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure you exercise. If the place where you are staying doesn't have a 
fitness center, break out your sneakers and walk. For information on walking 
for exercise, write the Walkers Club of America, 445 E. 86th St., New York, NY 
10128.  
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer to jog, the American Running and Fitness Assn. in Bethesda, Md., 
has a list of running and exercise trails in cities around the country. (For 
information, or a trail map of your destination, call (800) 776-2732.) 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best all-around exercises while traveling is swimming. Water has a 
very restorative effect on the body, Roth said. Some swear that a bath or 
swimming session helps reset their biological clocks.

 Hey, who's that guy with his arm around Richard Riordan? Didn't I see him with 
Springsteen the other week? Come to think of it, it's the same guy who had his 
arm around Axl Rose, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Billy Joel, Bette Midler, Tony 
Bennett, Bruce Willis, Whitney Houston, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Rod Stewart, not 
to mention Gary Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Michael Minutoli! Boy, this guy must have some juice, to be hanging out 
with the stars like that! Listen to the sort of nights he and his son, Anthony, 
have: 
</P>
<P>
 "We went backstage during Madonna's 1989 'Blonde Ambition' tour at the L.A. 
Sports Arena. We hung around and we socialized amongst the celebrities and 
other people back there, and as the place was closing down, everybody was 
leaving and Madonna came walking out hand in hand with Warren Beatty.  
</P>
<P>
 "I introduced myself as Michael Minutoli, as I do with everyone. She said, 
'Hi, how are you?' and shook my hand, then she said, 'Oh, you have a cute son 
there,' and gave him a kiss. And then we just chit-chatted about the show. I 
introduced myself to Warren Beatty, then said, 'Anthony, meet Dick Tracy,' and 
Warren Beatty in his Dick Tracy voice said, 'Hi Anthony, how are you?' Then, 
Lionel Richie was amongst us also, and I went over and said hi to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutoli, 34, spends a lot of his time amongst celebrity types. He's not 
exactly an entertainment industry bigwig, though. Rather, the Anaheim resident 
said he's "in filtration," selling industrial filters for air, liquids and 
other things that get mucky. When it comes to his affiliation with the stars, 
though, he might better have said infiltration . 
</P>
<P>
 While others backstage at the aforementioned Madonna show did have some 
status-laden pretext for being there, Minutoli and son instead "saw an open 
spot when the security was busy in other areas. Sometimes it's being in the 
right spot at the right time like that, where there isn't a security person and 
you can just walk in.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be negative when I say I sneak in. Let's say I sneak amongst 
. I don't force myself on them. But if nobody is there, I will just mosey on 
through."  
</P>
<P>
 I might be disinclined to believe Minutoli's tales of security gaps and 
all-access passes found on the ground, had I not experienced similar fortuitous 
instances back when I gave a hoot about meeting certain rock stars. It can be 
eerie how chance affords a way when the will is there. And Minutoli definitely 
has the will, saying, "I'm addicted to show business." He also has a camera and 
can document most of his stories of meeting the rich and petulant. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was growing up in Attleboro, Mass., Minutoli recalls buying a magazine 
with a free record by the Supremes in it. He fell in love with the record, and 
said his life has revolved around music since. He said he can't sing or dance, 
but he can certainly hang out with the best of them.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Just the night before he talked to us last week, he and Anthony, 7, had gone 
up to, and gotten into, the American Music Awards ceremony. After fruitlessly 
hanging around the credentials window, he and Anthony moved to where the limos 
were parked and got a couple leaving early to give them their passes.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes even getting in can be a celebrity event, such as the time they ran 
into Henry Winkler in an elevator and he gave them his pass to a Simon and 
Garfunkel charity bash.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were amongst many, many celebrities there: Jack Nicholson, Neil Young, 
Steve Martin," Minutoli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he went to the Grammys.  
</P>
<P>
 "My wife laughed at me, 'You're not going to get into the Grammys, Michael.' I 
got to the show and walked around the building three times and couldn't get in. 
I found a guy with a ticket for $300, but he wouldn't sell it to me for the $20 
I had. I was about to go home when I saw this (he held up a tattered pass) 
lying right next to a CHP officer's foot. I picked it up, it was an all-access 
pass, and I went right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his entrances aren't so dignified: He crashed a Guns N' Roses bash by 
sneaking in through the kitchen, and he often gets into Universal Amphitheatre 
via an employee entrance in the adjoining theme park.  
</P>
<P>
 And some of his accesses are just weird. He showed up in a tux at an Elton 
John-sponsored AIDS fund-raiser, and, "Honest to God, it was like they were 
expecting me. They said, 'Good evening sir,' handed me a glass of champagne and 
said, 'Enjoy yourself.' Nobody ever asked me for a ticket. I found an empty 
seat and sat down, enjoyed the food and enjoyed the show." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the New Year's Eve Barbra Streisand show in Vegas. First, 
he got into the $1,000-a-pop show by borrowing the ticket of someone who had 
already been in and had a hand stamped.  
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed the show, bumped into Bill Clinton's brother Roger afterward and 
started talking to him, and we were walking along. The security must have 
thought I knew the guy because I was talking with him, so they just let me keep 
on walking with him. So suddenly I'm in there at the New Year's Eve bash, 
partying with Streisand's orchestra and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't it ever tug at his conscience that sometimes he's enjoying a 
$3,000-a-plate charity event for free? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm there for the love of the music. If I had the funds, I would put a lot of 
it to any good charity. But because I don't have the funds, I don't," he said. 
"Someone at one of these once asked me what I contribute. Well, I bought a 
beverage. I contribute whatever I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony accompanies him to many events and said he's enjoyed them, 
particularly meeting Houston, Stewart and Joel. He's a handsome kid, even with 
no hair on his head. He has a non-life-threatening condition that he can't 
pronounce and I can't spell that has caused his hair to fall out.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they think I have cancer, though I don't," he said, and his dad 
stressed that they don't play on celebrities' sympathies, always explaining the 
non-tragic nature of Anthony's condition. Minutoli did say it's sometimes 
easier to talk to celebrities when his son is present, but insisted that isn't 
the reason he brings him.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Beatles are one of my favorite groups in the world. My family could have 
taken me to see a Beatles concert, and I know it would have been great. When I 
had my son I said I wanted to get him involved in the culture of life. So I've 
been bringing him to shows since he was 1. It's only in the last couple of 
years he lost his hair." 
</P>
<P>
 One such occasion was a Rod Stewart concert at the Pacific Amphitheatre in 
1989, when the singer plucked the 2 1/2-year-old Anthony out of his dad's arms 
to join him onstage on "Forever Young," only to find that Anthony knew all the 
words.  
</P>
<P>
 While Minutoli and Anthony are out among the stars, his wife, Debbie, stays 
home with their daughter at the apartment complex they manage.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's a homebody and likes her movies on TV," Minutoli said. "When there's a 
movie she wants to watch -- she knows I can't sit still for them -- she asks, 
'What's going on tonight? Go.' I had it arranged once for her to meet Whitney 
Houston, and another time for Rod Stewart, and she didn't want to come along. 
She's not as outgoing as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony had a slightly different take on it: "Mom doesn't like to go with us 
because she thinks we're going to get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 Minutoli does sometimes get booted out of events, and sometimes the stars 
aren't so nice. The first two times he tried to get Elton John's autograph, the 
singer just kept walking, though he did relent on a third occasion.  
</P>
<P>
 He once approached Bob Dylan for an autograph at a hotel and was rebuffed: 
"No, go away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I said, 'Mr. Dylan, I'm not just a fan, I'm a big music fan. It's my 
life.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "Go away," reiterated the poet laureate of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutoli said most stars have been very nice, and some know him now. He said, 
"Whitney Houston would recognize me in a heartbeat, and Rod Stewart knows me by 
name." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, when Minutoli approached Stewart and his wife in a restaurant one 
Valentine's Day to hit him up for tickets to a show, he recalled, "Stewart 
said, 'No, Michael . I can't help you.' He called me by my first name." 
</P>
<P>
 He has sometimes tried to view things from the star's perspective: 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably they feel, 'Oh, here's one more hounding me for an autograph or 
picture.' My feelings are, when they're at a concert, movie set or out there 
promoting their stuff, that's their job and they're in the public eye to make 
money. I realize it's stressful and a pain in the neck for them sometimes, and 
one more fan is a pain in the ass, but I just feel that if they're going to be 
in this business, they should accept their fan."  
</P>
<P>
 He estimates he's met 150 celebrities by now. I have to admit I don't get the 
attraction. Sure, it may be fun to be able to tell others you were backstage 
with such and such, but the reality is usually you're waiting around in a 
concrete backstage prison with a bunch of other people who are irked that 
you're no more famous than they are. Then, maybe , the star flows past, in an 
orbit nearly unchecked by the shallow pleasantries being dispensed like 
cocktail franks to all and sundry. Then they're out the door to their real 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when you get some serious one-on-one time with a star, as we journalists 
do, it can often be just the merest illusion of real communication. Day in and 
out they meet people who feel they know them or own them just because they've 
seen their craft amplified by a movie screen or stereo, and it makes them just 
a little bit weird, not to say guarded.  
</P>
<P>
 I once interviewed a country singer who hadn't even recorded her first note in 
the studio, yet her label had already sent her through courses on what to say 
during interviews. With situations like that, it's a lot more fun and real 
doing this column, and getting to talk to normal people, not that Fixations 
subjects with 350 G.I. Joes or miles of train track running through their home 
are especially normal. 
</P>
<P>
 For Minutoli, though, the sparks he gets from rubbing up against the famous is 
his sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I've been emotionally involved in the music of some of these people 
for 15 or 20 years, to go up to them and tell them how much you like their 
music or ask what's going on in the business or how's their family, it makes me 
feel very good and like I'm being acknowledged.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be successful in life, and being next to successful people, it 
makes me feel successful. I would like to have been a performer of some kind. 
It's a pipe dream of mine. I probably do this from me wanting to be that status 
of a performer, and it makes me feel wanted or acknowledged when I acknowledge 
them. Not that they're going to remember me, but for those few seconds that we 
say hi greeting each other, it's being acknowledged."

BAD HABITS; TESTAMENT TO THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL OF DRUGS AND TEEN ANGST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They needed so badly to fit in, feel better or rebel that hardly anything 
could have dissuaded them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not drug education programs. David Kelley, 17, of Westminster, said he and his 
junior high cronies laughed through the school presentations; they were loaded 
at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Not private schools or student activities. April Alegria, 15, of Los Alamitos, 
said she went to Claremont High School, a private school in Huntington Beach. 
"It was the biggest druggie school in the world. We would smoke pot in the 
bathrooms," she said. April was also a cheerleader. "That's where the drugs are 
really at. Cheerleading and football players." 
</P>
<P>
 Not middle-class homes with "family values." Holly Oehlman, 17, of Long Beach, 
once told her mother that she would get extra credit if she brought cookies to 
school. "So we baked cookies," said her mother, Pam, a school librarian and 
former Girl Scout leader. "I found out later she hadn't been to class in 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, unlike their partying peers, the students are recovering in a live-in 
high school for teen-agers with drug problems, the Phoenix Academy in Santa 
Ana. Not much older, they feel far wiser now than their drug-using former 
schoolmates. 
</P>
<P>
 These students said they had perceived drugs as the key to popularity. "The 
only people at my school who were popular and who everybody knew were people 
who were using," said Tyrisha Adams, 14, about Buena Park Junior High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from marijuana to LSD was affordable and laughably easy to obtain, 
the students said. 
</P>
<P>
 One girl said she got drugs from her mother. "At first she didn't want me to. 
But then, it became a relationship for me and her. I never understood her. She 
never understood me. But once we started using drugs together, it was like a 
relationship for us, you know? That was the only thing we had in common." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What their friends don't understand, the students said, is how much they can 
lose, and how quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said they had attempted suicide. David said he and some friends once 
went looking to kill some people who had threatened them. "We didn't find them. 
Then the next weekend, we were going to go kill the guys on a Friday night and 
Thursday night I tried to kill myself so I never (did it). 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose all your judgment and stuff. You go crazy. You don't realize it when 
you're on the drugs and then afterward, when you realize what you did when you 
were on the drugs, you realize how stupid it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Perez, 16, of Walnut, the daughter of a Los Angeles policeman, said: 
"I lost my mom, my dad. I had one sober friend. I lost her. I didn't have a 
house. Finally I didn't have anything except myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd do the things I had to do to survive on the street. I had 
to steal from old ladies and I had to do things with males that I didn't want 
to do to have someplace to stay. I had to sleep in places I didn't want to 
sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrisha said: "It all happens so fast. Within a year and a half, I'd lost like 
40 pounds. You don't realize how much you're doing. You can't see it." 
</P>
<P>
 When it became unbearably clear that their children were out of control, 
parents tried psychiatrists, counselors, drug treatment programs and 
hospitalization. The students said they paid lip service to the counselors 
until they could get out and use again. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly went to four programs, three counselors. "I hated the psychiatrists," 
she said. "It's like I would use them just to get trust back with my parents, 
to make them think we're actually moving on. Really, it was just an act. It was 
like a blanket to cover everything up." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, they found the Phoenix Academy, a residential high school run in 
cooperation with the local school district by Phoenix House, a 27-year-old drug 
treatment program whose rigidly structured methods resemble a military boot 
camp with intensive psychotherapy. The Orange County facility, one of five 
nationwide, treats 50 volunteer and court-appointed youths. It costs about 
$24,000 per year per student, paid for mostly with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, their days begin at 6 a.m. with making beds -- hospital corners required 
-- and doing chores. Their parents visit for family therapy and a weekly 
evening tea. They confront one another in intensive encounter groups; elsewhere 
they appear calm, serious and polite. Good behavior earns such privileges as 
music, TV and outside visits. Sometimes they tour local schools to lecture 
students on the pitfalls of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who use drugs, adolescents especially, are all about doing what feels 
good to them, what they want to do and disregard everybody else. It's very 
important to them to have structure," said William Smith, director of clinical 
services for Phoenix House programs in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you talk to our kids, they'll tell you they didn't realize it, but they 
wanted structure in their life. They wanted adults to be responsible, not to 
tell a 14-year-old, 'It's your life, you decide what to do with it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said it remains unclear why one teen-ager can be devastated by drug use, 
while another, sometimes even a sibling, can take it or leave it.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, he attributed the recent increase in teen drug use partly to "the 
permissiveness of society and parents." (Many parents don't realize, he said, 
that "the marijuana that people smoked in '60s and '70s is not the marijuana 
that kids are smoking today. They don't have an appreciation of how that can 
impact growth or retention. They're dealing with information that's antiquated 
and doesn't apply today.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since they started living at the academy, the students have been regularly 
drilled in honest emotional expression and group responsibility, and been 
taught to move beyond feeling victimized by their backgrounds: The majority 
have been sexually molested and nearly half come from homes where parents are 
addicted to drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy. Staffers say at least 40% drop out in the first three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single night I (have) to talk about my feelings and I hate it, too," 
David said. "It's hard to get into. It hurts so bad to start getting into it 
and you start crying and I don't like crying in front of people. I feel like a 
wuss or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who complete the average 14-month program, 85% will be drug- and 
crime-free, employed or studying full time after three to five years, Smith 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 After 15 months, Holly is nervous about re-entering the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to go back to the same high school I came from. I have a 
reputation there. I know so much about it there. I know a lot of the tricks and 
things. I know how they smoke in school. And I know all the drug addicts, the 
dealers, like where they go for lunch. That stuff gives me a back door. Say I 
go out for lunch one day, and I'm not having the greatest day. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The students said that, in general, they feel safer behind the academy's 
stucco walls. Tyrisha said wistfully: "In some ways, I wish the whole, like, 
world could be in here, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 She is afraid to return to school because she still wants to be popular. "My 
counselors and my family tell me there is cool and popular people who are sober 
and I'm sure there is, but I'm scared. I looked down on people before who 
weren't, like, using. I don't want people to look down on me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the students offered few solutions for parents, teachers or 
government bureaucrats, other than making available more long-term therapy 
programs like the one they're in. Some suggested banning gangsta rap music with 
violent street talk. Others disagreed. None wanted drugs legalized.  
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are going to have to figure it out for themselves," Jennifer said. "I 
think they're going to do what they're going to do and experiment and just 
figure out the hard way that it's just not worth it."

BAD HABITS; MARIJUANA IS BACK AS THE DRUG OF CHOICE FOR SOME KIDS, WHO THINK 
IT'S SAFE. BUT EXPERTS WARN IT'S MORE POTENT THAN EVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every Monday morning at Santa Monica High School, 15-year-old Becky chats up 
her friends about the weekend. Repeatedly, the conversation turns to the same 
topic: smoking-out at a razeparty, getting lifted on blunts and chronic. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: getting high on marijuana at a friend's house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marijuana is the drug to do. It's cheap. It's easy to get. It's everywhere," 
says the freshman, whose name has been changed along with those of other 
teen-agers in this story. "People smoke-out in the restrooms, during lunch. 
They ditch to smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Across Los Angeles, some students are taking a fast, drug-laden trip fueled by 
an attitude that it's cool to smoke marijuana, not viewing the drug as 
addictive, harmful or a great risk, even though researchers warn that it is 20 
times more potent today than in the 1960s and '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude is in line with the findings of a University of Michigan study 
announced earlier this month that illicit drug use -- with marijuana heading 
the list -- among American teen-agers has increased in the last two years, 
reversing a trend of generally declining use that began in the late '70s and 
early '80s.  
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers who use pot say they are merely experimenting or smoking to fit in 
or to cope with the stress of problems at home and school. Most say they smoke 
marijuana -- which currently also goes by names like "bud," "endo," "lovelies," 
"primos" and "frios" -- when they're bored at school and simply because it's 
fun to do at parties. 
</P>
<P>
 At HPs (home parties) and DPs (ditching parties), teen-agers mix marijuana -- 
ranging in price from $5 for a joint to $40 and more for a half-filled sandwich 
bag of the stuff -- with crushed rock cocaine for a stronger high. They dip 
joints in solvents and insecticides and lace them with PCP, a powerful 
psychedelic drug that can cause mental or emotional disorders or death. Also 
popular are $5 LSD tabs -- paper the size of a contact lens that has been 
blotted with a drop of the hallucinogen, which students suck on or place under 
an eyelid for a faster rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe, a 10th-grader at a Los Angeles high school, says he has smoked 
marijuana daily for the past two years. "I am probably addicted to marijuana. I 
got plants at my home. I've gone to school crazy high. I get high 'cause my 
friends do it. It's fun, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 50,000 junior and high school students, conducted for the 19th 
consecutive year for the National Institute on Drug Abuse, found that marijuana 
and LSD, along with inhalants and stimulants, were being used by more 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, widely regarded as one of the government's chief benchmarks for 
measuring progress in the drug war, found that cocaine use held steady at low 
levels, alcohol use generally declined, but cigarette use was on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, the percentage of high school seniors who reported 
using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 40.7% in 1992 
to 42.9% in 1993, but still remained below the peak of 65.6% reported in a 
comparable study in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also found that the proportion of eighth-graders using marijuana 
increased three percentage points in the last two years, to 9.2%. Among 
10th-graders, the share using marijuana went from 15.2% in 1992 to 19.2% in 
1993. The percentage of 12th-graders smoking the drug increased from 21.9% to 
26% between 1992 and 1993, researchers reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers, parents, educators, law enforcement officials and drug treatment 
experts agree that the findings are troublesome. Most officials attribute the 
results to a growing complacency about the problems of drug abuse, peer 
pressure, a lack of attention to the issue by both government and the media, 
and too much freedom allowed by parents, especially those who came of age 
during an era when drug use was widely glamorized. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Rich, director of substance abuse programs for the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, confirmed that more students are seeking and being referred to 
support groups for the use of marijuana and LSD. "The reason is they're getting 
a lot of propaganda that using drugs is OK," she says, citing U.S. Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders and other public officials who have advocated 
legalization, or the study of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is slight, however, and Los Angeles school district rates, which 
tend to mirror those nationally, have not returned to their 1978 peak, when 65% 
of high school students said they had tried an illegal substance at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Moran, a sergeant with the Los Angeles Police Department's DARE (Drug 
Abuse Resistance Education) program, says some of the biggest obstacles 
officers face are peer pressure and parental denial that "their little darling 
could be doing something wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he says, "We used to tell children, 'If you use drugs, bad things 
will happen to you.' It's not true. A lot of casual users go on for years and 
function in what we think is a normal life. Until they are no longer here, we 
are going to have a large number of people buying drugs and they will have a 
major impact on our youth." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite official concern, the kids who are using pot say it is a pervasive and 
harmless pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marijuana is not like crack. That messes you up bad," says Lorenzo, who has 
smoked marijuana for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo, a Los Angeles high school student, says he has managed to keep his 
secret from his parents. Ironically, his father is an alcohol and drug abuse 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my dad knew, he'd probably throw me in rehab," he says. "My parents never 
told me about drugs, so I had to experiment with them myself. But when you 
experiment too much, you like it and then you get hooked." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he gets high because it's the social thing to do. Marijuana, he says, 
expands his imagination, relaxes him and helps him cope with problems at home. 
He realizes that smoking pot has had an adverse effect on him; his grade-point 
average has gone from a high C to a low D and he no longer plays 
interscholastic sports because he has become lethargic. Now he ditches classes 
to smoke and is out every weeknight, sometimes just kicking back with his 
friends or out clubbing. That usually includes getting high because "I can't 
have fun without bud (marijuana)." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia, a 17-year-old senior at Ramona Opportunity School, says that since age 
12, she has experimented with "everything except for heroin." At 14, she was to 
selling rock cocaine to her friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lately, I've been smoking primos -- weed mixed with rock cocaine," she says, 
sitting at a picnic table. "I want some type of enjoyment. I kick it with my 
friends" at house parties, where she can select from a wide choice of drugs to 
use and buy. "We just walk into the house and ask them for a dime ($10) bag." 
If she buys from a friend, a dime bag usually goes for $2 or $3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is so used to marijuana in their system that they don't even get 
buzzed off of it no more. They just don't think it's dangerous," she says, 
adding that her friends are mixing marijuana with other drugs to sustain their 
highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday, a girl was smoked out on a frio (marijuana laced with PCP). Her 
eyes were drooping. The teachers sense it. They don't even say nothing. What 
can they do? Right now my friends are into smoking dust, marijuana with 
chemicals in it. It's a weird drug. One time my friend smoked it and he started 
to pretend he was a bird." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia says adults have told her and her friends that drugs are bad, but the 
attitude among her classmates is that "nobody cares to hear 'Just Say No.' 
Drugs are just part of society." 
</P>
<P>

 Although the findings from the University of Michigan's study are disturbing, 
researchers point out that the numbers still are below the levels of the 1970s. 
They also report that the 42% of high school seniors who said they had used an 
illicit drug at least once in their lives is still a minority. And many kids 
say they have been influenced by warnings from parents and experts and have 
chosen to stay away from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew, 16, a 10th-grader at George Washington Preparatory High School, tried 
marijuana once, didn't like it and vows never to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to get high cause I had problems at home. Bud doesn't make you do 
bad things, it makes you lazy and later you fall asleep. I don't think it's a 
major big drug like crack, but I also know that it's bad. It's illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, like Maggie, 15, learned the hard way. Four months ago, she thought 
she was going to die after she smoked $200 worth of primos and took three LSD 
tabs in the span of two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie, who began taking drugs when she was 12 because "I just wanted to see 
how it felt to get high," entered a hospital drug-rehab program after the 
incident and has remained drug-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do drugs because you want to, not because anybody makes you," Maggie 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks that marijuana is not a bad drug. But I tripped out on it, 
almost died. You hear from kids that 'it will never happen to me.' I used to 
think like that. My friends say that I'm going to go back to drugs. I'm not 
going to sit here and say that I'm going to stay drug-free the rest of my life 
because I don't know the future. But I do want to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis, 15, a 10th-grader at John Marshall High School, says he knows 
marijuana is "dangerous stuff" because his parents have told him so. He says 
his friends who smoke pot and take other illicit drugs know that "it's bad for 
them, but they don't care about the consequences until it's too late. They 
don't listen to anybody. I'm tired that everyone is doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 So is Melissa, 17, a senior at Garfield High School, who says that kids smoke 
in the restrooms and at a nearby fast-food restaurant during lunchtime, and 
that they ditch class to get high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never experimented with drugs," she says. "My friends who do drugs 
don't act the same way. They were nicer before drugs. You could have a normal 
conversation with them, and now the only thing they talk about is acid and 
marijuana. Even the people you'd never imagine doing it are doing it -- student 
leaders, students involved in school activities and sports. A lot of them do it 
because they are too stressed out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some "good" kids, the temptation is hard to resist.  
</P>
<P>
 Jesse, a 17-year-old college-bound senior, athlete and straight-A student at 
an Eastside high school, says he drinks beer and smokes weed just about every 
weekend because it's the social thing and "it makes you less shy. It's a way to 
unwind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the weekend comes, I don't want to think about my homework. I don't want 
to think about football practice. I wanna party." 
</P>
<P>
 And partying almost always includes excessive beer guzzling and drinking a 
mixture of punch with whiskey and vodka -- and smoking bud. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are smart and everything," he says, "but they think that we are 
just going to a party to talk. If there's a party and there's no weed and no 
beer, no one goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think that it's just low-life and troubled kids who drink and 
do weed. But it is not," Jesse says. "Us, the ones who are college bound, we 
know that we're not going to be smoking pot all our lives and drinking. It's a 
sign of the times. Everyone is doing it. It's fun. It's the '90s."

A DYNASTY OF GLAMOROUS FASHION; HUNDREDS PAY TRIBUTE TO HOLLYWOOD AND COUTURE 
DESIGNER NOLAN MILLER AT AN AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY BENEFIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 400 women, many dressed like the glamorous characters on the 
"Dynasty" TV series, paid tribute to the show's costume designer, Nolan Miller, 
at "A Taste of Fashion" benefit for the American Cancer Society/Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Staged by the South Coast Cancer League, the recent fashion show and luncheon 
featured a nostalgic look at some of the opulent gowns Miller has created for 
Hollywood's leading ladies, as well as his new couture collection and spring 
styles from Saks Fifth Avenue. Guests paid $55 each to attend the show at the 
Irvine Marriott, raising about $8,000 for the cancer society. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing the Stars 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the show, Miller took to the stage to comment on his colorful 
career while models showed off his original costumes on the runway. Film clips 
from movies, TV shows and Academy Awards ceremonies showed how the stars looked 
in his creations. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Bette Davis in a red satin gown, singing Miller's praises to Johnny 
Carson on the "Tonight Show": "Thank you for my beautiful dress," she said on 
national television. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoopi Goldberg wore Miller's black sequin sheath to the 1991 Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vogue asked me what my greatest accomplishment was. I told them it was 
getting Whoopi Goldberg in a bra and high heels," Miller said. "But I wasn't 
able to get her to do anything with her hair." 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Taylor wore Miller's regal-looking purple satin gown in ads to 
promote her Passion perfume. "Violet is her favorite color. You can't believe 
how difficult it is to do a wardrobe all in violet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller showed several designs from his "Dynasty" days, including a red velvet 
gown worn by Alexis (Joan Collins). He recalled producer Aaron Spelling telling 
him: "I never want to see (the characters) in the same dress twice, and you can 
never overdress them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Plates 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that glamour isn't just a thing of the past, guests put on a fashion 
show of their own -- many sporting hats with their elegant suits and dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Nolan, 'Just wait until you come to Orange County. You will not 
believe how beautiful the women are,' " said Mary Dell Barkouras, event 
chairwoman, who wore white -- a sheer chiffon skirt topped with an embroidered 
jacket and wide-brimmed hat. Barkouras is a longtime Miller fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's one of the finest designers in the world. His things have 
classic elegance, excitement and pizazz," she said. "He has the intent to make 
a woman look beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Event co-chairwoman Cerise Feeley, who wore a dramatic snow-white suit with 
fur cuffs and a matching fur hat, was quickly dubbed "Alexis" by Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the "Hats Off to Nolan Miller" theme, organizers decorated the 
tables with straw hats adorned with pink and purple flowers. Guests enjoyed a 
lunch of grilled chicken, wild mushroom soup en croute and a dessert of 
chocolate mousse topped with a miniature chapeau of white chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the event will be used to underwrite the South Coast Cancer 
League's "A Taste for Life" gala at the Robert Mondavi Wine and Food Center in 
Costa Mesa on May 15. The $125-per-person fund-raiser will feature wine and 
gourmet food from Orange County restaurants and international wineries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the fashion show were: event co-chairwomen Stephanie 
Argyros and Sharon Huta; Judie Argyros, who will co-chair "A Taste for Life" 
with her husband, George, as well as Zee Allred, Ronnie Allumbaugh, Gayle 
Anderson, Donna Blue, Dori de Kruif, Patricia Edwards, Patricia Groth, Mary Lou 
Hornsby, Tita Loza, Mona Lee Nesseth, Gail Robson, Linda Sherman, Mary Jean 
Simpkins, June Wian and Nancy Wynne. KATHRYN BOLD

Q&A WITH ALLEN GINSBERG; 'OUR GOAL WAS TO SAVE THE PLANET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINE McKENNA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a big year for Allen Ginsberg. Arguably America's best-known living 
poet, Ginsberg, now 67, is the subject of a documentary film, "The Life and 
Times of Allen Ginsberg," opening Thursday at the Nuart for a one-week run. 
Directed by Jerry Aronson, the film chronicles the sparks that flew when 
Ginsberg met up with Jack Kerouac, Neal Cassady and William Burroughs in the 
early '50s. That spontaneous combustion came to be known as the Beat 
Generation, and from it Ginsberg emerged as a poet of prophetic power, giving 
eloquent voice to the anxiety of a people witnessing their country devolve into 
a heavily armed superpower. His approach to poetry has left an irrevocable mark 
on 20th-Century literature.  
</P>
<P>
 Due this June is Ginsberg's "Holy Soul Jelly Roll: Poems and Songs 1949-1993," 
a four-disc box set produced by Hal Wilner on Rhino Records. On May 18, 
HarperCollins will publish "Cosmopolitan Greetings: 1985-1992," a new book of 
poems; later this year, it will publish his "Journals 1954-1958." He took some 
time from his schedule during a visit to Los Angeles to offer some perspective 
on his work and his life.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What's the most widely held misconception about the Beat Generation? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: That we weren't literate. We were more educated than most of the 
academic critics who dismissed our interest in Eastern thought as irrationality 
simply because it was non-linear. It required cultivation and a good deal more 
discipline than Western logical simplifications. Still, they dismissed us as 
unruly beatniks with wiggy hair, bongo drums and cockroaches on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you explain the recent explosion of interest in your work? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a reappraisal of the literary value of the Beats in general I 
think. People are starting to realize that we weren't just a star that exploded 
long ago, and that we've continued to write all these years -- aside from 
Kerouac and Cassady, very few of us fell by the wayside. We have a good 
longevity record compared with most of the academic poets who killed themselves 
by drinking -- we just smoked a little grass instead of totally knocking out 
our livers with booze, and the ones of us who died young were the alcoholics. 
The notorious dope-fiend business turned out to be a better bet than 
all-American suicide on alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Aside from not killing you, what else did drugs do for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: They reinforced certain individualistic and visionary tendencies I had that 
have been useful to me as a citizen and a poet. I once asked Dr. (Albert) 
Hoffman, who invented LSD, what philosophic principle he derived from it, and 
he answered that it showed there are many different universes possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a poet, you use words as the raw material for your art; what is language 
good for? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It unites heaven and earth. The heaven of the mind -- the impalpable and 
the infinite -- wants to communicate with the physical body and the earth, and 
language can be a vehicle for that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does language trip us up? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It trips us up when we confuse words with things -- take "Macedonia," for 
instance. The Greeks and the Yugoslavian Macedonians are arguing about who owns 
the word Macedonia and think Macedonian is a word with an intrinsic essence 
that must be monopolized by one side or another. Historically, the word god has 
always functioned in a similar way. People are willing to kill for their word 
image of god, and use the word as an excuse for mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that word mean to you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Old no-bo daddy on high -- nobody's daddy on high. That's William Blake's 
phrase. He said that for centuries man has been asleep under the guidance of 
old no-bo daddy, trying to substitute some abstract concept of a god who's 
outside everything rather than develop his own awareness. Man refuses 
responsibility for his own creation of the nuclear bomb, and acts as if it was 
something given from above. "I didn't do it, I swear -- it crawled into my 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's been the great achievement of the American counterculture in the 
20th Century? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It altered mainstream culture completely and introduced several bodies of 
thought that have never lost their relevance. Beginning in the '40s, Kerouac, 
Burroughs and myself became interested in the operation of consciousness and 
began experimenting with psychotherapy, psychedelics, Eastern philosophy, art 
and ideas about the alchemy of the word that were first introduced by Rimbaud.  
</P>
<P>
 We think in terms of montage, collage, discontinuity and jump cut, and the 
great monuments of writing -- Pounds' "Cantos," Kerouac's "Mexico City Blues," 
William Carlos Williams' "Paterson" -- have that quality of montage. I remember 
Bob Dylan telling me that Kerouac's "Mexico City Blues" inspired him to become 
a poet, and when I asked him why, he said because it was the first book that 
spoke to him in his own language -- American. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was the great failure of the counterculture? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Once when Kerouac was high on psychedelics with Timothy Leary, he looked 
out the window and said, "Walking on water wasn't built in a day." Our goal was 
to save the planet and alter human consciousness. That will take a long time, 
if it happens at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Looking back on Kerouac's life, do you consider it a tragic one? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No -- he did more in one lifetime than most people do in 10. And remember, 
he had alcoholism, which is an illness, and that contributed to the sadness 
that came toward the end of his life. I think everybody gets unhappy in the 
final 10 years of their life, though, and the unhappiness runs deep because you 
realize you're gonna die. I have diabetes and high blood pressure, I can't eat 
meat and I can hardly get it up -- despite that, erotic desire never fades. 
Having crushes, seeing some brilliant face in the crowd, your heart melting -- 
that's always there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The essential theme of all your poetry has been love. Why does love die? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think love dies -- it just gets buried under bad experience and 
incommunicability, or people go mad, suffer money woes, get caught up in a war. 
But if you look to your dreams, you'll find the original love tears, throbs and 
grief remain completely intact. The emotions remain in the body, the mind and 
the heart, and they often come out in dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why can't we live those dreams more fully? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Fear of the rejection that might come if we show our sensitivity, 
vulnerability and funkiness. Walt Whitman addressed this when he said, "I 
celebrate myself and sing myself" -- that's a song of self-acceptance, and 
there aren't many models of self-acceptance around. As far as the flaws we see 
in ourselves that we struggle to hide from others, I believe in letting your 
neurosis be your style, which is a Buddhist notion of turning waste into 
treasure.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How would you explain the concept of reality? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you stub your foot against the desk, it hurts -- that's reality. At the 
same time, the hurt is impermanent -- in 100 years your body and the desk will 
be gone and ultimately it's all a dream, so reality has no hell to pay nor 
heaven to reward. Therefore you're completely free, as in a dream.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: CBS IN LILLEHAMMER: LET THE SELF-PROMOTION BEGIN!; 
TELEVISION: AND THAT'S NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE NETWORK'S OLYMPIC 
COVERAGE. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CONTINUITY AND FOCUS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The banner headline emerging from the Winter Olympics this week is not about 
Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan or even the surprise gold medal of U.S. Alpine 
skier Tommy Moe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's that Connie Chung is nice. Really, sincerely, honest-to-goodness, 
syrupy-sweet nice. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the word from her co-anchor, Dan Rather, who reports with a straight 
face, in one of those gaudily pretentious "CBS Evening News" promo spots that 
the network has been slipping into its daily coverage from Lillehammer, Norway, 
that a man in a pickup asked him the following question: "Is Connie Chung 
really as nice as she seems?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rather's reply: "Yup." 
</P>
<P>
 During a separate spot, Rather announces that, yup, Chung is also a pretty 
terrific reporter: "Good instinct for a story . . . real journalistic 
credentials . . . smiles easily . . . a real tough competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Olympics commercials, however, these spots are a mere drop in 
the fiord. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, CBS has never advertised itself as the Sisters of Mercy. 
Understandably, its mission in Lillehammer is to help its stockholders, its 
purpose in acquiring telecast rights for the Winter Games being to earn an 
Olympian profit. Fair enough. But c'mon, this is becoming ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Nice production values, nice photography, nice music, nice people, nice snow, 
nice Norway. Yet during its three hours of prime-time coverage Monday night, 
CBS aired only 25 minutes of actual competition, compared to 47 minutes of 
commercials. In other words, the commercials-to-medal-event ratio was nearly 
2-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone was set when CBS began its men's luge coverage that evening by going 
to a break after the first sledder. No wonder David Letterman got a big laugh 
when he quipped Monday night: "I guess if I had one complaint about the CBS 
coverage -- not enough commercials." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of that night's bloc was bloated with chatter and features -- a 
minute of luge, 4 1/2 minutes of human interest, and so on and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 All right, your heart may not beat wildly for the luge. Plus, it's obvious 
that CBS has the burden of freshening events that are hours old, while also 
seeking to broaden its audience by offering sports coverage for viewers who may 
not care all that much for sports. But as long as you're watching all of these 
events, you'd enjoy some continuity, seeing things from start to finish, 
instead of the jumping-bean tactics that CBS has been employing. 
</P>
<P>
 There on the screen Monday was U.S. Alpine skier Donna Weinbrecht, not 
competing in Lillehammer -- she wouldn't ski until Tuesday -- but in a feature 
about her battle back ("The weather worsens and the day grows darker. . . .") 
from serious injury. A 10-minute feature. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has also been guilty of TV's old bait and switch. Before a commercial 
break late in its first hour Monday, it advertised ("coming up . . . ") another 
down-hill run by the newly crowned hero Moe. Yet after the break, it was not 
Moe but two Canadian skiers who viewers saw. They were followed by another 
commercial. Moe did not show up until the start of the second hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon it was also time for some tricky moves regarding another designated 
poster Olympian, U.S. speedskater Dan Jansen. So halfway through the hour, 
bring on the five-minute feature, replete with oozy, sentimental music -- an 
apparent prelude to CBS showing his taped 500-meter race at Hamar. Except. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see Dan Jansen skate here just a little later," said studio host Greg 
Gumbel. But first hockey results, a Tonya Harding update, a commercial break, a 
return to the luge. More yadda yadda yadda. 
</P>
<P>
 Then finally, after CBS has stretched this out like a marathon taffy pull, 
Jansen skated. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, surely everyone who cares even a whit knows that Jansen -- the 
500-meter world record-holder who had failed to capture a medal in three 
previous Olympics -- suffered a slip on Monday that dropped him to eighth, 
costing him a medal. That was a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet talk about your overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
 From that night's coverage -- CBS adding groaning funereal music to the 
replays and hounding Jansen, his coach and family for explanations -- you'd 
have thought he let down the entire United States by briefly slipping on the 
ice. Prior to Lillehammer, relatively few Americans knew of Jansen. Now the 
nation was being implored to wear a black armband and begin a period of 
national mourning.  
</P>
<P>
 With so many things in the United States and around the world to get depressed 
about, however, it's hard to find room for a skater who didn't get his medal. 
So get a life here. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what Charles Kuralt seemed to be saying in a sweet feature that evening 
celebrating Olympians who hadn't lived up to expectations. "Don't feel so bad," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the advice category, David Letterman had some later that evening for his 
white-haired mom, who was on "assignment" in Lillehammer for his show. "Don't 
let those CBS goons push you around," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In an incredible coup, Letterman's mom even scored an interview in Lillehammer 
with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. She followed the script by asking the 
First Lady if she or the President could do something about the speed limit in 
Connecticut, where Letterman lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Letterman got his own scoop when breaking the news that "the U.S. 
Olympic Committee worked out a deal so the Menendez brothers can compete in the 
bobsled." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were true, CBS would spritz the event with commercials and drag it out 
for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the coverage really that frustrating? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup.

A CHANCE TO SEE BARBRA'S OTHER HITS; AUCTION: A FREE EXHIBITION OF SOME OF HER 
ART NOUVEAU AND ART DECO COLLECTION, SET FOR A MARCH 3-4 SALE AT CHRISTIE'S NEW 
YORK, OPENS TODAY AT THE ST. JAMES CLUB IN HOLLYWOOD.

 Barbra Streisand's fame is such that everything she touches seems desirable. 
Had she become a collector of corset stays or toothpick holders, she probably 
would have started a market trend. The fact that she developed a passion for 
decorative and fine arts in Art Nouveau and Art Deco styles -- for which prices 
already run to six and seven figures -- ensures that an upcoming New York 
auction of her collection and a Los Angeles preview of the sale will be hot 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day auction of more than 400 objects -- valued at a total of about $4 
million -- will be held on March 3-4 at Christie's New York. The best of 
Streisand's 20th-Century decorative and fine arts will be offered on March 3 at 
the auction house's Park Avenue establish ment. Lower-priced decorative arts 
and memorabilia will go on the block the next day at Christie's East, an Upper 
East Side outpost where collectibles are sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Californians can sample the auction's highlights in a free exhibition 
of 40 prime objects today through Friday at the St. James Club in Hollywood. 
Streisand will host a $250-per-ticket benefit reception for the UCLA Breast 
Center tonight at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The multifaceted star is known as an obsessive collector who has designed 
entire rooms around single objects and decorated her homes in Beverly Hills and 
Malibu with the same attention to detail as she devotes to film productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Streisand was unavailable for interviews on the upcoming auction, but a 
Christie's newsletter quotes her as saying she wants to simplify her life and 
notes that she has donated her $15-million Malibu estate (which was furnished 
in Art Deco style) to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to spend so much time being preoccupied with objects, and I 
don't want so many anymore," Streisand says in the publication. "That's all. I 
just want less." I don't want to have things in storage anymore. I don't want 
to have them in boxes in the basement. I want other people to enjoy them if I 
don't have room for them anymore. It's a good feeling to use these things for a 
while and pass them on during your lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the priciest attractions in the preview of furniture, decorative 
objects, paintings and sculptures are two Art Nouveau lamps by Louis Comfort 
Tiffany. A leaded glass "Cobweb" lamp with a mosaic base of white cobwebs and 
cherry blossoms is expected to bring the auction's highest price, $800,000 to 
$1 million. Streisand purchased the lamp in 1979 for $55,000, but a less 
elaborate version set an auction record for a Tiffany lamp in 1992, when it was 
sold for $770,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A red Tiffany "Peony" lamp ($250,000 to $350,000), which has been the 
centerpiece of an Art Nouveau-style living room in Streisand's Beverly Hills 
home, also will be exhibited, along with an elephant-motif vase ($80,000 to 
$100,000) and a "Dragon Fly" table ($25,000 to $35,000), both designed by Emile 
Galle. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of Streisand's taste for Art Deco will include "Adam and Eve," Tamara 
de Lempicka's 1932 stylized painting of a nude couple ($600,000 to $800,000), 
Jacques Lipchitz's "Woman and Gazelles" sculpture ($150,000 to $200,000), a 
Cartier clock in the form of a Shinto temple gate ($100,000 to $150,000) and 
Lalique glass works. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Streisand's classic cars -- a 1926 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost Springfield 
($50,000 to $60,000) and a 1933 customized Dodge Roadster ($15,000 to $20,000) 
-- also are for sale, but they will be represented by large photographs at the 
preview.

LAWRENCE TO APPEAL MPAA RATING OF 'YOU SO CRAZY'; MOVIES: THE FILM GETS SLAPPED 
WITH AN NC-17. 'THE POWERS THAT BE HAVE TO LIVE UP TO THE AMERICAN DREAM, WHICH 
IS FREEDOM OF SPEECH,' THE COMEDIAN ARGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Martin Lawrence has titled his first film "You So Crazy," after the 
name of his national stand-up comedy tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Motion Picture Assn. of America ratings board, which has slapped the 
film with an NC-17 rating, thinks it's more like "You So Nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence held a press conference Tuesday at Manhattan's Omni Berkshire Hotel 
to announce his appeal of the rating. The appeal is scheduled to be heard Feb. 
23, nine days before the film opens in New York and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, a sometimes raunchy stand-up show that satirizes male-female 
relationships, was filmed at Brooklyn Academy of Music's Majestic Theater last 
April. It had originally been scheduled for release on Feb. 25, but is being 
pushed back to March 4 because of the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The powers that be have to live up to the American dream, which is freedom of 
speech," Lawrence told reporters. "I'm just trying to figure this out." 
</P>
<P>
 The board's ruling, which came on Feb. 10, represents the first time the NC-17 
rating -- usually based on graphic violence and sex -- "has been given solely 
on the basis of words," said attorney Martin Garbus, in an affidavit in support 
of the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Barnes, a spokesperson for the MPAA, said, "It is our policy not to 
comment on the specific ratings of specific films. The appeals process is part 
of the rating process." 
</P>
<P>
 An NC-17 rating, equivalent to the old "X," bars anyone under the age of 17 
from seeing the film, with or without parental consent. Such a rating could 
limit the number and type of theaters presenting the film and bar advertising 
in certain newspapers as well as limit the number of video rental stores that 
will carry it. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of such potential restrictions, Lawrence, attorneys and 
representatives for the distributor, Miramax Films, cast their appeal as a 
First Amendment issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board is out of touch with the culture that Martin Lawrence speaks 
about," said Garbus. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Davis, a partner in the Manhattan-based Frankfort, Garbus, Klein and 
Selz, said she did not think the rating was a black-white issue. "I don't know 
if it's a black versus majority culture thing," said Davis, who is African 
American. "It's about the youth culture and the board being out of touch with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The brouhaha over the rating is not a scheme to generate publicity, said David 
Dinerstein, vice president for marketing at Miramax, which has scored recent 
public relations successes for "Farewell My Concubine" and "The Crying Game." 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for films on the cutting edge," Dinerstein said. "We just want to 
make sure people can see the films." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence said the film's rating comes as a surprise because he does not 
consider it any racier than segments of films made by his idols, including 
Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor: "I've tried to keep my stuff in line with 
theirs," he said. "I know I haven't gone farther than they did."

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; QUAKE SHATTERS CONCRETE AND SHAKES CONFIDENCE 
IN OUR FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles and its 500 miles of freeways are intertwined in life and lore. 
The eight-lane expressways and swooping interchanges are engineering marvels, 
icons for a region that grew to the horizon and kept on going.For millions, 
they are conduits for commerce, as much a part of the day's routine as eating 
and sleeping. But then the earth shook on Jan. 17, ripping some of these 
lifelines of concrete and steel. Confidence in the freeways was shaken. Even as 
rebuilding begins, questions linger: How safe are they in a a major earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 This special section examines the political and engineering decisions that 
determined how strongly our freeways were built. It gauges how swiftly our most 
vulnerable and heavily travelled roads are being safeguarded. It looks inside 
the state contracting used to expedite repairs on damaged roadways. It charts 
the pace of retrofitting on hundreds of vital city and county bridges. And it 
compares the seismic features of California's vaunted freeway system to 
Japan's.

 Earthquakes have shown that the weak links in California's freeway system are 
its overpasses and bridges. Out of a statewide total of 12,000 freeway bridges, 
Caltrans officials have decided that 1,313 should be strengthened, and work on 
251 of them has been completed. In Los Angeles County, there are 2,523 freeway 
bridges, with 716 scheduled for retrofitting and 115 completed. The map shows 
the status of remedial work on major Southland routes.

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE QUESTIONS; SHAKY BRIDGES, SHAKEN THEORIES; 
WHEN THE VIOLENT SHAKING STARTED, JOHN FAUST WAS ALREADY ON THE FREEWAY, 
DRIVING METROPOLITAN TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY BUS NO. 3466 THROUGH THE CRISP 
MORNING DARKNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Powerless to prevent his 14-ton vehicle from jerking half a lane to the right, 
Faust braked to a heart-pounding stop. Then he swung the 40-foot bus sideways 
-- blocking oncoming drivers from what only he and a handful of others could 
see: 
</P>
<P>
 A gaping chasm in the eight-lane Simi Valley Freeway, where it once crossed 
San Fernando Mission Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like looking down into a pit, a void," said Faust, whose bus was not 
carrying passengers. "My thought was: 'Am I going to get out of here safely?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He and the others did make it out, aided by providence of the Northridge 
earthquake's 4:31 arrival. Had the temblor hit two hours later, this and the 
region's other freeways would have been loaded with traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the failure on the Simi Valley Freeway is larger than just the loss of one 
important traffic artery. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six major roadway collapses caused by the Jan. 17 earthquake -- of the 
157 other overpasses damaged -- the Simi bridge's failure remains perhaps the 
most unnerving: It defied some of the most modern engineering assumptions used 
to safeguard California's freeways from earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The bridge) contains a lot of the details that we like to see in designs -- 
and yet it still performed poorly," said UC San Diego's M.J. Nigel Priestly, 
the research leader for the state's program to fortify freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation officials decided earlier this decade 
that the structure was not at risk. Overruling two junior engineers, they 
removed the bridge from the list of structures scheduled to be "retrofitted" 
with jackets of steel reinforcements, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the collapse has called into question the standards Caltrans has used to 
determine which bridges get retrofitted and when. As a consequence, the safety 
of hundreds of similar bridges excluded from the list is being re-evaluated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news from this earthquake is that retrofitting worked," Priestly 
said, noting that not a single retrofitted bridge suffered serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the performance of the Simi Freeway and the collapse of other roadways, 
which caused about $1.5 billion in damage and left a motorcycle patrolman dead, 
shook confidence in the safety of the nation's most intricate network of 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 It also raises this question: Four years and four months after another 
earthquake crushed to death 43 motorists on two San Francisco-area freeways, 
with what urgency have California's engineers and political leaders sought to 
strengthen hundreds of other bridges identified as being seismically unsafe? 
</P>
<P>
 A Times examination found that the pace of a state program to retrofit freeway 
bridges and overpasses has been slowed in part by cost concerns, competing 
transit projects, Caltrans' cumbersome bureaucracy and a public employee 
union's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Records and interviews also show: 
</P>
<P>
 * About 80% of the state's 1,313 bridges identified as being vulnerable to 
earthquakes have not been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Los Angeles County, 84% of 716 bridges designated for retrofitting remain 
unrepaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only four of the 10 most vulnerable overpasses in the county have been fixed 
-- and the unrepaired spans are at some of the busiest freeway junctures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Caltrans has spent less than a third of the $300 million per year that 
officials estimated would be used for shoring up unsafe bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 * A small share of the billions of dollars from a new gasoline tax has been 
spent on bridge repairs, although voters were told that seismic retrofitting 
would be a major beneficiary of the new revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * And, just three days before the Northridge quake, the director of Caltrans 
halted the hiring of outside engineering consultants who have performed nearly 
half the design work for the bridge retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say they have moved as swiftly as possible, considering the 
complexities of the work. Although more retrofitting needs to be done, they 
said the state's bridges are generally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're very safe, but we have some work to do, to get a few bridges 
up to the standard of the rest of them," said James W. van Loben Sels, who was 
appointed to head Caltrans by Gov. Pete Wilson. "We're going to do it as 
rapidly as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Caltrans bridge engineer James E. Roberts said the retrofitting program 
has moved cautiously to ensure that the costly repair procedures would work in 
the real world, not only in a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said he wants the same emergency powers for retrofitting that the 
governor has given the agency to rebuild the damaged freeways. However, Van 
Loben Sels said he does not believe emergency powers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Jan. 14 to halt outside contracting for design engineering work 
will not slow the retrofitting program, according to Caltrans spokesman Jim 
Drago. He said the decision was made for cost reasons and that the department's 
in-house staff of engineers can shoulder the extra workload. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our highest priority and other projects may feel delays because of 
that," Drago said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Caltrans completed an analysis of the state's 12,000 bridges, 
concluding that 4,000 posed varying seismic hazards. Since then, the 
retrofitting list has been whittled down to 1,313.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials take 17 factors into account when ranking bridges, 
including the proximity of earthquake faults, traffic volume and age. 
Structures built before 1950 or after 1980 are considered the most sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Work has not been completed on some of the most unsafe bridges, officials 
said, because many are supported by clusters of columns -- and a higher 
priority has been given to fixing single-column bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans had assumed that the single pillars were the most vulnerable. But the 
Northridge quake crumpled both types of columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The multicolumn (bridges) have to be a higher priority than they were 
before," said Ronald Mayes, a consultant to the National Center for Earthquake 
Engineering Research in Buffalo, N.Y. "Some of them are very vulnerable." A 
Race Against Time 
</P>
<P>
 To appreciate how far California has come, or not come, in building bridges to 
survive quakes, it is helpful to recall how fortunate the state has been until 
recent years.  
</P>
<P>
 "Before 1971, California only lost $100,000 -- total, in history -- to bridge 
damage from earthquakes," said Brian Maroney, senior bridge engineer for 
Caltrans' Office of Earthquake Engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 That year the 6.4 Sylmar earthquake toppled parts of two interchanges, killing 
two men in a pickup truck. They died less than two miles from where LAPD 
Officer Clarence Wayne Dean would plunge to his death from a freeway bridge on 
Jan. 17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sylmar, Caltrans set about rebuilding the interchanges and fixing 58 
damaged overpasses. As a precaution, they outfitted about 1,200 overpasses with 
cable restrainers to keep segments of roadway from separating and collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that scores of bridges passed the test of the Sylmar quake, Caltrans 
officials may have been "lulled into a false sense of security," said James H. 
Gates, head of structural mechanics engineering for Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 16 years, the significant quakes that struck the state were 
either in rural regions or did not inflict damage to major roadways. It was not 
until October, 1987 -- when the 5.9 Whittier quake stunned engineers by nearly 
toppling the two-level interchange of the Santa Ana and San Gabriel River 
freeways -- that an intensive research effort was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineers began seeking to identify vulnerable bridges and studying 
what repairs could be made, short of tearing down and rebuilding thousands of 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Oct. 17, 1989. The World Series game in San Francisco that wasn't. 
The grisly footage of the collapsed, double-deck Nimitz Freeway that killed 42 
people -- an inadequate design made lethal by the Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of California's reinforced concrete bridges were designed and built 
before the 1970s and their seismic performance is suspect," warned a governor's 
Board of Inquiry into the Loma Prieta quake. But has government's response come 
close to matching the dangers highlighted by the Board of Inquiry's May, 1990, 
report, "Competing Against Time"? 
</P>
<P>
 "There is pretty strong evidence that this retrofitting program is working," 
said Jack P. Moehle, a UC Berkeley professor and director of the nearby 
Earthquake Engineering Research Institute. "Unfortunately, nature has just 
moved a little more rapidly than Caltrans." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Katz, a San Fernando Valley legislator who chairs the Assembly 
Transportation Committee, said: "Caltrans has an inherent problem, internally, 
of (not) being able to do anything quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Caltrans' pace of retrofitting has not matched either the department's 
estimates or the promises made to voters by an array of leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the bipartisan promoters of a sweeping transportation ballot 
initiative, Proposition 111, told voters that if they would agree to double the 
state gasoline tax, the earthquake-retrofitting program would be a major 
beneficiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax has doubled -- from 9 cents a gallon in 1990 to 18 cents a gallon 
today -- raising about $1.4 billion more a year for overall transportation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But records show that from mid-1989 to July of this year, Caltrans will have 
spent $432 million to retrofit 251 bridges -- amounting to an average of 3% of 
the agency's overall annual budgets. The spending for retrofitting is less than 
a third of the $300 million a year that then-Caltrans Director Robert K. Best 
told the Legislature in 1991 he hoped to spend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack McDowell, a consultant who managed the Proposition 111 campaign, said, 
"If somebody broke their promise (afterward), we had no inkling during the 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why the department has spent only $86.5 million a year on retrofitting, 
Caltrans' Roberts said the repair procedures had to be adequately researched 
and soil conditions sometimes required years-long analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 Building can also be difficult, he added, because some jobs require lane 
closures, night work and approvals from other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Litigation also has delayed some work. Eight private engineers said in 
interviews they were ordered by Caltrans to stop retrofit designing because of 
a lawsuit brought by the union for the department's engineers. The stoppage for 
several months last year came after a judge's ruling in favor of the union, 
which has sought to block the hiring of outside engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger bottleneck, according to a former Caltrans official, is the agency's 
contracting procedures. It has taken as long as a year to get approval to 
retain outside engineers. "We had to go through the same process as purchasing 
toilet paper for state toilets," said Herbert K. Jensen, who until late 1992 
administered the contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last month's quake, the department had planned to spend $1.1 billion 
more to repair about 1,000 bridges that remained on the state's retrofitting 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as expected, dozens more bridges are identified for retrofitting in the 
coming weeks, Caltrans spokesman Drago said these projects would also "get 
first crack" at Caltrans' pool of money. At least $615 million more will be 
needed for seven of the nine toll bridges maintained by Caltrans and additional 
funds will be necessary for the 13,000 overpasses and toll bridges controlled 
by local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last four years, the administrations of two governors and state 
legislators of both parties have said with voices and votes that retrofitting 
should receive top priority. In practice, state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa 
Monica) said, it has not worked out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always developers and politicians lobbying for a new off-ramp, or 
some other project," Hayden said. "(Caltrans) can't move forward faster with 
retrofitting without cutting into those projects."  
</P>
<P>
 Dean R. Dunphy, Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary of business, transportation and 
housing, acknowledged the intense competition for Caltrans funding. 
"Retrofitting has been a priority from the beginning," Dunphy said. "But not 
the only priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Nestande, a past chairman of the California Transportation Commission, 
said safety also has been at stake when Caltrans spent money for items 
unrelated to retrofitting, such as widening freeway on-ramps. "A decision was 
made not to shut everything else down for the motoring public," he said. 
Assumptions Crumble 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most encouraging lessons that engineers say they have learned from 
the Northridge earthquake is that retrofitting works: 
</P>
<P>
 Field investigators have confirmed that the 115 retrofitted overpasses in Los 
Angeles County were unscathed or had minor damage. None had to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But interviews and records show that at least four of the quake's six major 
bridge collapses challenge the engineering assumptions and policy decisions 
dictating whether or when bridges get fixed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Simi Valley Freeway overpass, at San Fernando Mission Boulevard/Gothic 
Street: When Caltrans re-evaluated the list of bridges planned for retrofitting 
three years ago, engineers overruled recommendations of two subordinates and 
decided that the Simi Valley structure was safe. The bridge was removed from 
the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the decision is open to doubt. Subjected to 12 seconds of some of the 
most intense ground shaking inflicted on any structure during the Northridge 
quake, the 566-foot-long bridge failed. Engineers said the 10 concrete support 
columns turned out to be too stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts of Caltrans defended the decision to remove the bridge from the 
retrofit list, saying it was based on the best information available at that 
time. "I think that was a good judgment, personally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge was removed from the list in part because it was designed in 1973, 
with the benefit of lessons learned from the 1971 Sylmar earthquake, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers who have studied the collapse have found a clue that may help 
prevent others. They believe that the failure of the steel-reinforced, concrete 
columns was hastened by what was once an award-winning architectural feature: 
The tops of each of the columns had a gradual Y-shape, called a flare. 
</P>
<P>
 These flares, according to the engineers, decreased the flexibility of the 
columns. Designers had assumed that the top edges of the flares would merely 
crack and crumble during a strong earthquake -- without doing harm to the 
overall integrity of the column. Instead, the Simi Valley Freeway overpass 
flares remained intact, placing more strain on the columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were conceived to be primarily aesthetic," said Priestly of UC San 
Diego. "In the early days, they would say (that anything which) increases the 
strength of the structure can only be good." 
</P>
<P>
 But Priestly said the lesson of the collapse is that the influence of the 
flares "can be very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials said they now are re-evaluating the hundreds of bridge 
columns elsewhere that also were built with flares. Structural engineering 
professor Frieder Seible of UC San Diego said some flared columns are safe, 
while others can be made safe with jackets of extra steel reinforcing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the biggest flared columns in California are being used on expansion 
of the Harbor Freeway near Downtown. Caltrans engineers said the columns 
survived the quake with no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans has decided to exclude flares when rebuilding the collapsed 
interchange of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. "There's 
something going on here," said Maroney, the Caltrans bridge engineer. "We need 
to evaluate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers also are studying other aspects of the bridge's design, including 
the angle of the columns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange: This site 21 miles north 
of Downtown had partially collapsed during the Sylmar quake while under 
construction. It is vital to commuters from the Antelope Valley. Among them on 
the morning of Jan. 17 was motorcycle officer Dean, who plunged to his death 
from the collapsed ramp linking the westbound Antelope Valley Freeway to the 
southbound lanes of the Golden State Freeway. The connecting ramp from the 
Antelope Valley to the northbound Golden State also fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers believe the culprits were columns that proved too stiff, along with 
expansion joints that were too narrow. Again, retrofitting probably would have 
saved both elevated ramps, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1971 quake, Caltrans installed devices to strengthen the bridge 
decks at the interchange. But records show that of all the single-column 
bridges identified statewide for retrofitting, this interchange was the only 
one where repairs were not under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that retrofitting design work began in 1992. But two obstacles 
emerged: The range of hard and soft soils at the interchange required extensive 
analysis. And Caltrans had to decide whether it would be more cost effective to 
erect a new structure that would be better suited to the soil conditions than 
to spend $11.7 million for retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be imprudent to retrofit if you are going to rebuild everything else 
in there," said Roberts of Caltrans. "And I think they were in the process of 
coming to that conclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts acknowledged that the site was not ideal for a major interchange. "If 
you had all of the knowledge of foundation conditions then that you have today, 
you would try and get out of there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuilding the interchange will cost an estimated $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Golden State Freeway at Gavin Canyon bridge: Located 23 miles north of 
Downtown, this 80-foot-high bridge had been placed low on the list of 
structures to be retrofitted with steel jackets. Top Caltrans engineers cite 
two reasons for their belief that this bridge was relatively safe: 
</P>
<P>
 The structure had survived the powerful 1971 Sylmar earthquake, centered 
nearby, with virtually no damage. And in 1974, it was outfitted with cable 
restrainers to keep the bridge decks together at their expansion joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, said Gates of Caltrans, "bridges that were successful in 1971 got a 
good grade" for seismic safety and were placed lower on the retrofitting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts had a hand in designing the Gavin Canyon bridge, which was built in 
1967, and he inspected it and found it sound after the '71 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials and other experts said this and all other collapsed bridges 
would have survived if retrofitted. But records show that Gavin Canyon was so 
low on the retrofitting list that no design work had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have cost an estimated $2.2 million to retrofit -- and it now will 
cost $14.8 million to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the cluster-column bridge had not been fitted with steel jackets, 
Roberts said, was that Caltrans had decided that spans supported by single 
columns were more at risk. The clustered columns were considered more complex 
and more expensive to retrofit. 
</P>
<P>
 Seible of UC San Diego said Caltrans engineers acted prudently in 1974 when 
they placed the cable restrainers in the Gavin Canyon bridge. But the structure 
failed largely because the support columns were too brittle and the bridge's 
expansion joints still had less than twice the capacity demanded by the 
Northridge quake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly (retrofitting) was not adequate," Seible said. "Otherwise the 
structure would not have collapsed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Monica Freeway overpasses at Fairfax Avenue and La Cienega Boulevard: 
Engineers are confident that if the Northridge earthquake had struck just a few 
months later, this part of the nation's most heavily traveled freeway would not 
now be a demolition site. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting of the clustered columns for the two overpasses was to begin this 
month. Those columns, like so many others, failed. Engineers have found that 
the clustered columns were too brittle -- but would have performed adequately 
if retrofitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof is that just a few hundred yards away, a freeway overpass at 
Cadillac Avenue suffered no visible damage, they said. Those columns had been 
outfitted with full-length steel jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 The failures along the Santa Monica Freeway point out the vulnerability of 
columns constructed without enough horizontal steel reinforcing bars. For most 
of the state's bridges in need of retrofitting, engineers said that 8 to 10 
times more horizontal reinforcing steel is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 These spiral-like hoops of steel provide strength and flexibility to columns. 
By retrofitting the columns with steel jackets, engineers can compensate for 
the inadequate construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, said Caltrans' Maroney, "it's like the difference between what 
happens if you pour a glass of water onto a table, or into a glass. Without the 
horizontal steel to contain it, the concrete just explodes outward." 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting of the two Santa Monica Freeway overpasses would have cost a 
total of $4 million, records show. The estimated cost to rebuild the Santa 
Monica Freeway: $15 million to $21 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Santa Monica Freeway collapses were precisely the kind of failures 
that engineers feared when they examined the damage to the Santa Ana-San 
Gabriel River freeway interchange, which barely withstood the 5.9 Whittier 
earthquake of October, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two failures are almost identical to what happened to the 605/5 
interchange," said John F. Hall, a Caltech engineering professor who is 
studying the Northridge quake for the Earthquake Engineering Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, seven years after the Whittier wake-up call, were these two overpasses 
not retrofitted? 
</P>
<P>
 The overpasses were supported with clustered columns, so they had a lower 
priority. The design work for the retrofitting started 2 1/2 years ago and 
construction was to begin this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the failure to quickly retrofit bridges on the nation's busiest 
freeway points out the fallibility of Caltrans' priorities. "They have the 
money," he said. "It's a question of what they spend it for." 
</P>
<P>
 Setting priorities for repairs remains the challenge for the engineers and 
politicians entrusted with making bridges and overpasses as safe as possible. 
But as the Sylmar, Whittier, Loma Prieta and Northridge earthquakes have shown, 
even the best-informed engineering assumptions can tumble like so many guesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As for bus driver Faust, he has won a commendation for his efforts the morning 
of Jan. 17. He is hoping that the earthquake professionals get it right before 
the next one. But when he makes his afternoon run these days and comes upon one 
overpass, "I'm looking up for cracks -- and keeping my foot to the floor."

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; LIFE IN THE FAST LANES: A LOOK AT MILESTONES IN 
FREEWAY HISTORY 
</P>

<P>
 After billions of dollars in construction costs spent over decades, Los 
Angeles now struggles to rebuild quake-mangled freeways. Here are some 
milestones in the life and lore of Los Angeles County's 528-mile freeway 
system.  
</P>
<P>
 * 1940: The state's first freeway is built in the San Gabriel Valley. The 
opening of the Arroyo Seco Parkway, later called the Pasadena Freeway 
(Interstate 110), ushers in an era of great highway construction for the West 
Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1943: State lawmakers pass a bill renaming the portion of U.S. Highway 6 
from San Pedro to the Nevada border as the Grand Army of the Republic Highway, 
which was an organization formed in 1866 to assist wounded and sick Civil War 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1947: Construction of the Los Angeles freeway system begins in earnest, 
including the key Downtown interchange uniting individual freeways into one 
system. State legislators pass a bill 73 to 1 banning smog. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1949: At Aliso Street in Downtown Los Angeles, the state Transportation 
Department begins constructing the western end of a new six-lane Ramona 
Freeway. Six years later, state officials would change its name to the San 
Bernardino Freeway. They thought naming the freeway after its destination made 
more sense than naming it for a fictional character in a novel and play by 
Helen Hunt Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1955: Socialite Evelyn Throsby Scott disappears from her North Bentley 
Avenue estate, a few blocks from the Sunset Boulevard off-ramp of the 
northbound San Diego Freeway, which was under construction. Some people believe 
her body is entombed here. Although her body was never found, her husband, L. 
Ewing Scott, a paint salesman, was convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1956: President Dwight D. Eisenhower signs the Interstate Highway Bill, 
providing 41,000 superhighway miles to crisscross the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1966: Final section of the Santa Monica Freeway, linking Downtown Los 
Angeles with the coast, opens after 12 years of construction, costing about 
$210 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1971: A magnitude 6.4 earthquake sends parts of the Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways crashing to the ground, causing $15 million in damage 
to the freeways and interchanges in the Sylmar area. 
</P>
<P>
 * California 90, which runs from the San Diego Freeway to Marina del Rey, is 
named the Richard M. Nixon Freeway. Five years later -- after Watergate -- it 
is renamed the Marina Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 * 1972: Ventura Freeway is immortalized in a song called "Ventura Highway" 
written by Lee Bunnell and performed by the group America.  
</P>
<P>
 * A section of bridge on the Foothill Freeway over the Arroyo Seco in Pasadena 
collapses, killing six workers and injuring six others. Improper bracing of 
scaffolding is blamed for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1973: The nation's first station built for commuters using the busway lane 
from El Monte to Los Angeles opens in El Monte on the San Bernardino Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 * Songwriter Guy Clark, fed up with Los Angeles, moves to Nashville, taking 
with him the idea for "L.A. Freeway," a glad-to-be-leaving song that became a 
modest pop hit for Jerry Jeff Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1974: Terminal Island Freeway opens. When scheduling permits it is used for 
the shooting of chase scenes for such movies as "To Live and Die in L.A.," 
"Terminator II" and "Air America."  
</P>
<P>
 * 1976: A lane on the Santa Monica Freeway is removed from general traffic, 
painted with white diamonds and used exclusively for vehicles carrying at least 
three people. But after five months of turmoil, confusion and adverse 
reactions, the diamond lane is pronounced dead by a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 * During the oil crisis, one of the first electronic puns appears along the 
Santa Monica Freeway: lighted message signs warning motorists "Don't Be 
Fuelish, Be Car-Poolish." Then there was "Take the Train," which provoked this 
universal response: "What train?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 1978: A stretch of the Glendale Freeway between the Ventura and Foothill 
freeways is renamed for Frank Lanterman, a state assemblyman who died in 1981.  
</P>
<P>
 * 1980: Songwriters Sandy Pinkard and Larry Collins give fame to the Santa 
Monica Freeway with their country-Western song "You're the Reason God Made 
Oklahoma," because it contains the lyric "Santa Monica Freeway sometimes makes 
a country girl blue-ooh-ooh-ooh." The next year, singer David Frizzel makes it 
a No. 1 on the country charts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1981: The final stretch of the 48.5-mile Foothill Freeway opens, connecting 
the Golden State Freeway near Sylmar with the San Bernardino Freeway. The cost 
of the 14-year project amounted to $231 million. Many episodes of the "CHiPS" 
TV series, featuring Eric Estrada and Larry Wilcox as officers Ponch and Jon, 
were filmed between Pacoima and the Glendale Freeway from 1977-1981. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1990: A crane loading a 12,000-pound concrete freeway barrier onto a flatbed 
truck topples, crushing the truck driver on the Century Freeway project in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993: Motorists begin using the Glenn M. Anderson Freeway, (also known as 
the Century Freeway) named for the retired congressman who pushed for its 
construction. Transportation officials say they believe that the $2-billion 
freeway, 17.3 miles between Norwalk and El Segundo, will probably be Southern 
California's last new freeway because of costs and environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994: Portions of four Los Angeles County freeways are crippled in a 
magnitude 6.8 earthquake. Among the hardest hit are two of the region's busiest 
routes: the Santa Monica Freeway near La Cienega Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue, 
where an elevated portion of roadway toppled onto the street below, and the 
junction of the Antelope Valley (California 14) and Golden State Freeway (I-5) 
overpass. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE BRIDGES; STREET BRIDGES LIKELY TO NEED 
SEISMIC WORK; GOOD NEWS IS REINFORCED SPANS SURVIVED THE TEMBLOR. NOT-SO-GOOD 
NEWS IS THAT 25% OF CITY'S AND 33% OF COUNTY'S BRIDGES WILL REQUIRE 
RETROFITTING, OFFICIALS SAY.

<P>
 They cross rivers and roads, linking neighborhoods and connecting homes with 
workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they do not get the attention of eight-lane freeways or towering 
interchanges, the 2,300 bridges crisscrossing the region are as vital to 
traffic flow and mobility as gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 So since the Northridge quake, traffic engineers with the city and county of 
Los Angeles have been surveying bridges from San Pedro to Santa Clarita to see 
how they fared, especially those that have been reinforced in recent years to 
meet new earthquake safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The result? The good news is that the reinforced bridges survived the quake. 
And the vast majority of unreinforced older bridges that were deemed most at 
risk did not suffer serious damage, perhaps because of their locations at least 
20 miles from the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The not-so-good news, officials say, is that as many as a quarter of the 
city's bridges and a third of the county's will need some seismic strengthening 
to ensure that they can withstand a quake that might hit them with the same 
intensity of the Northridge temblor. The retrofitting is expected to cost more 
than $250 million and take years to complete.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our bridges held up pretty well," said Robert Barsam, a supervising 
structural engineer for the county Department of Public Works. The department, 
he said, reported $1.6 million in damage to bridges and serious problems with 
only four of 1,500 spans countywide.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city has been pretty lucky in terms of bridges," said Clark Robins, a 
division engineer for the city of Los Angeles. Of 800 bridges, only two were 
damaged so severely that they were closed, he said. Overall, there was $2 
million in damage to 62 spans, Robins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the performance of the bridges during the Northridge quake, engineers 
acknowledge the potential for serious damage in a future one -- especially if 
it is centered closer to Downtown Los Angeles. That possibility alone, they 
say, creates a sense of urgency to complete the renovation of hundreds of 
bridges that, if severely damaged or lost, could cripple transportation 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the county bridges are safe and that they can withstand a large 
magnitude earthquake," said Barsam. By his reckoning, up to 95% of the bridges 
-- because of their strength, size, distance from faults and other factors -- 
would not incur any major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, since the epicenters are very unpredictable, I think it warrants us 
looking at all the bridges as though they were going to be at the epicenter," 
he said. "And (we should) retrofit those that are vulnerable to collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the recent quake reminded city and county officials of the need to 
accelerate earthquake safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city of Los Angeles, that means pushing forward with a nearly 
$400-million seismic safety program that voters approved as a bond issue after 
the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in Northern California. The retrofitting program for 
bridges and buildings got a slow start but was given a burst of urgency last 
year when city lawmakers -- hoping to spur the local economy -- called for 
advancing the timetable of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, $12.9 million has been spent retrofitting city bridges. Now, 
officials say, $20 million in contracts are to be awarded by April. The entire 
$97-million program to repair 187 bridges is expected to be completed by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the highest priority bridges in the coming year, Robins said, are those 
spanning the Los Angeles River. In all, 44 of the 46 bridges will be reinforced 
at a cost of at least $20 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for their high priority is age. "Most of them were built in the 
'20s . . . (when) there was not much in the way of steel reinforcing," Robins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bridges over the river are taller and longer than many others 
in the city and more vulnerable to ground vibrations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final reason has to do with how important the spans would be after a 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are our transportation links across the river and are important for 
rescue work, evacuations and police and fire emergencies," Robins said. "So it 
is important that they be maintained in service. . . . If some were down it 
would tie up traffic in a major way." 
</P>
<P>
 For the county, ensuring the safety of bridges is a larger task, both in terms 
of numbers and the area to be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 540 bridges under county jurisdiction, from remote unincorporated areas 
to mid- size cities, will be carefully analyzed, Barsam said. About 216 could 
require "serious work" to ensure their safety in an earthquake, he said, while 
the remainder may require less extensive repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the county has identified 19 bridges that are high priority for 
repairs -- six have been retrofitted, four are being bid on, and the remainder 
will go to contract before May. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next two years, he said, the county is looking at another 216 
bridges to be reinforced through a federal highway bridge replacement and 
rehabilitation program. The preliminary cost estimate for that program is at 
least $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 200-plus bridges will be strengthened, as funds are available, 
in three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the high-priority bridges are in the Long Beach area, including the 
Long Beach Freeway overpass of the Los Angeles River, Barsam said. In that 
$2.1-million project, workers will strengthen the bridge by, among other 
things, retrofitting its columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-priority area will be the Antelope Valley, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Los Angeles, the county also will focus on bridges that span the Los 
Angeles, Rio Hondo and San Gabriel rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bridges are slated for strengthening, Barsam said, he believes 
many have proven their durability by surviving quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 So as they ready for the worst, city and county bridge engineers voice 
confidence that the most vulnerable bridges have been -- or will soon be -- 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been around here 30 years now and I have been through Sylmar and 
Whittier and now Northridge. And we did well in all of those," Robins said. "So 
based on that, I feel pretty comfortable about the city's bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean the retrofit program is any less urgent than it would be if 
we had more damage. . . . We have probably been lucky that we have not had an 
epicenter near our major bridges Downtown." Local Bridge Damage 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 2,300 bridges owned by Los Angeles County and the City of Los Angeles, 
several suffered major damage. The worst damage to county bridges occurred in 
or near Santa Clarita, while in the Los Angeles, the two bridges in the San 
Fernando Valley were damaged enough to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
 * Damage to columns and abutments on Sierra Highway bridge over railroad 
tracks, $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Damage to abutments on McBean Parkway, also over the Santa Clara River, 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Buckled girders and other damage along The Old Road over Santa Clara River, 
$350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Damage to approaches to The Old Road bridge above Southern Pacific railroad, 
$150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY 
</P>
<P>
 * A 70-foot pedestrian span over Wilbur Avenue at Collins Street in Tarzana 
suffered some $100,000 in damage to its columns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Approach roads on both ends of a six-lane highway that takes Nordoff Street 
over the Southern Pacific rail line in Northridge incurred some $500,000 in 
damage.

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; VIEWPOINTS; MOST FEAR DRIVING ON FREEWAYS 
DURING THE BIG ONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four of every five residents in Los Angeles County believe that they would be 
unsafe driving on area freeways if the Big One struck, and a majority consider 
freeway damage after the Northridge temblor as unacceptably severe. 
</P>
<P>
 A third of county residents blame the collapse of key roadway sections on 
budget cutbacks and wrong priorities by state transportation officials, 
according to a Los Angeles Times poll. But government agencies garner high 
marks for their efforts to restore the freeways and commutes that define the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide survey, based on interviews with 1,116 adults in the week after 
the magnitude 6.8 quake, found widespread unease over the safety of the area's 
major arteries in the event of another intense temblor. Stark images of 
crumbled concrete and asphalt have become indelible markers of fear for many 
motorists, although hundreds more miles of freeway in Los Angeles survived 
intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to think about the Big One," said poll participant Leonor 
Gonzalez, 55, a secretary who now limits herself to short hops on the freeway 
from her Woodland Hills home. "I just hope that God will protect me." 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, only 14% said they would feel secure if a major earthquake hit as 
they traveled somewhere on the county's freeway network. For some, that 
confidence springs more from fatalism than faith in transportation technology 
and design. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing you can do about it. You could get hit by a truck tomorrow. 
I'm hopeful at some point that all the freeways will be retrofitted and brought 
up to standard," said Claudio Sanchez, 29, a civil engineer from Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chances are that even if you are on the freeway that you're not going to be 
one of the statistics," said Charlotte Vrooman, 44, a Southern California 
native who lives on the Westside, close to the collapsed portion of the Santa 
Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm just playing statistics rather than feeling totally confident in 
the engineering. If it's a big enough (earthquake), then it won't really matter 
where you are." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though 34% of poll respondents regard the damage to freeways as being 
unavoidable given the strength of the Jan. 17 temblor, 1 in 10 cited poor 
engineering and construction as the primary causes of the roadway collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting is a good idea but should have been done more quickly, said San 
Fernando Valley homemaker Debbie Tomasi, 32, who also suggested that California 
tap Japanese expertise in designing seismically sound roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody's living through earthquakes every day, like they do in Japan, 
they've got to have a lot more knowledge and hindsight than we do," Tomasi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles freeways may be more aesthetically pleasing than their Japanese 
counterparts, but "function over form would be the best way to go," Tomasi 
said. "So what if the freeway's beautifully sculpted? There are other ways you 
can spruce it up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll -- which has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points 
-- 19% of county residents attributed the quake damage to misdirected 
priorities by transportation officials, and another 16% blamed cutbacks in the 
public works budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Drago, a spokesman for Caltrans, said the department hopes to accelerate 
its retrofitting program. 
</P>
<P>
 "These things take time," he said "Each one is done individually. You want to 
make sure that the techniques are proven." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 51% of county residents say the damage sustained by freeways in last 
month's quake is unacceptably severe, Drago said the damage must be kept in 
perspective. "Any failure of a structure is unacceptable," he said. "But . . . 
we had eight locations (damaged) out of 2,000 bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 In a spot of good news for transportation officials, 84% of those polled rate 
the government's post-quake repair efforts as good or excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing more optimism, nearly 60% of the county's commuters did not believe 
that their traffic time would increase by much after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the number was significantly lower -- 44% -- in the San Fernando and Santa 
Clarita valleys, which were hit hard by the collapse of the Golden State and 
Antelope Valley freeways. Indeed, eight days after the temblor, the evening 
delay on the northbound Golden State soared to more than two hours. By last 
week, it had been whittled down to 21 minutes, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 For traffic relief, thousands of north county motorists have flocked to the 
Metrolink trains, finding standing room only in many of the carriages and 
setting ridership records. The Santa Clarita/Antelope Valley line peaked at 
21,952 passengers Jan. 25. The figures have tailed off since, but ridership 
still far outstrips pre-quake levels. 
</P>
<P>
 However, only 6% of Times poll participants who drive alone said they would 
turn to buses or trains to get to work because of the damage suffered by the 
freeways. Nine percent would try car-pooling, while 83% said they would 
continue to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised at that. It's unfortunate," Metrolink Executive Director 
Richard Stanger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not married to their cars -- they're married to convenience. They 
believe the only option for convenience is their private car," he said. "Once 
they take it, they realize that Metrolink can be convenient. It's getting them 
to try that's difficult." THE TIMES POLL: Freeway Safety 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge quake, 1,116 Los Angeles County residents were asked a 
variety of questions about their confidence in the freeway system and their 
assessment of the failures experienced by a number of major freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 * How safe do you think you would be driving on the freeway in your area if 
the "big" earthquake struck? Safe: 14% Unsafe: 80% Don't know: 6% 
</P>
<P>
 * How would you rate the efforts by government agencies to repair damage to 
the area's freeways? Good: 84% Not good: 10% Don't know: 6% 
</P>
<P>
 * Given the size of the Northridge earthquake, would you say the damage 
suffered by area freeways and roads was to be expected? Was to be expected: 29% 
Unacceptably severe: 51% Remarkably light: 13% Don't know: 7% 
</P>
<P>
 * To what do you primarily attribute the collapse of several portions of Los 
Angeles' freeway system after the earthquake? Excessive cutbacks: 16% Wrong 
priorities: 19% Unavoidable: 34% Poor engineering/construction (volunteered): 
11% Other: 3% None of those factors: 2% Don't know: 15% 
</P>
<P>
 Note: The poll, conducted Jan. 22-23, has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 
percentage points.

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE BRIDGES; FUNDING FOR VINCENT THOMAS SPAN 
WORK SPARKS FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With twin shimmering green towers thrusting 365 feet into the sky over Los 
Angeles Harbor, the Vincent Thomas Bridge is by far the tallest structure in 
the South Bay. Now that the destructive Northridge earthquake has focused 
renewed attention on elevated roadways, the busy bridge linking San Pedro to 
Terminal Island also looms large in the worries of motorists, engineers and 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge sustained no apparent damage though it was bent, plucked, twisted 
and shaken by forces far more powerful than had been expected. At some points 
along the 6,060-foot welded-steel suspension bridge those forces were four 
times as great as in the 1987 Whittier quake. 
</P>
<P>
 With forces such as those, experts do not take great comfort in the lack of 
damage to the Vincent Thomas. It is the largest bridge in Southern California, 
and state officials consider its approaches vulnerable in even a moderate 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to hurry up and do our strengthening before the known Big One" occurs 
on the nearby Newport-Inglewood Fault, said Ahmed M. Abdel-Ghaffar, a professor 
of structural engineering at USC who has studied the Vincent Thomas for years. 
"It could be tomorrow, it could be a long time. Nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for that work, which Caltrans figures will cost $32 million, is shaping 
up as a north-south legislative battle. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, the Legislature ordered a statewide survey 
of all bridges, including freeway overpasses, local bridges and toll bridges, 
to determine their vulnerability in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 With retrofitting funds in the state's recession-racked budget running short, 
Gov. Pete Wilson last year proposed using toll revenues to cover the 
$615-million cost of upgrading seven of the state's nine toll spans. But 
legislators objected, particularly those in the San Francisco Bay Area, where 
all but two of the state-maintained toll bridges are located. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), who chairs the Senate 
Transportation Committee, said gas taxes should be used to pay for earthquake 
retrofitting for all roadways, including toll bridges. He is proposing raising 
gas taxes by 2 cents per gallon for 42 months to pay for the strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 Using tolls alone to pay for the work on toll bridges "would be terribly 
unfair to people who are already paying for these structures' maintenance with 
their gas taxes," he said. "The toll bridges are part of the state highway 
system. They are not some independent entities." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who chairs the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, disagrees with Kopp. "Toll bridges were created and paid for by the 
tolls and the tolls are the appropriate way to pay for any seismic work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolls pay for maintenance of the bridge structures, but the gas tax-supported 
highway fund pays for work on the roadway itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz acknowledged that a regional bias accounts for at least part of his 
thinking on the issue. Bay Area bridges need the bulk of the retrofitting work 
Caltrans is recommending and, if the money for it comes out of general highway 
funds, Southern Californians would end up paying for bridges they do not use 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said he might support raising money for retrofitting of all types 
of structures by issuing bonds or raising the statewide sales tax by a 
quarter-cent. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel-Ghaffar, who wrote his doctoral dissertation at Caltech on the 
vibrational characteristics of the Vincent Thomas, said the bridge approaches 
are the most vulnerable part of the structure. The main span of the bridge is 
"very strong" and is supported by 990 piles sunk to bedrock, but the approaches 
could fail or become detached. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 report issued by the federal General Accounting Office warned that a 
7.0-magnitude quake in the Newport-Inglewood Fault zone could cause soil 
liquefaction on Terminal Island that would destabilize and damage three of the 
island's bridge approaches. Soft soils intensify quake damage because shaking 
essentially turns them to liquid, undermining columns or foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has recognized seismic hazards at the approaches to the Vincent 
Thomas Bridge but considers them less severe than at some other locations in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bridge's approaches failed, it would throw the main span "out of 
function" and could endanger or seriously damage the bridge, Abdel-Ghaffar 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Caltrans should install cables to tie the approaches to the bridge 
structure. The superstructure could be strengthened substantially, he said, if 
shock-absorbing lead-rubber composite bearings were installed to connect the 
roadbed to the main columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the data from 26 accelerographs installed on the bridge to measure the 
forces it is subjected to in an earthquake, Abdel-Ghaffar said the two towers 
were "really taking a great deal of force from all the way at the top to the 
deck and down to the base." 
</P>
<P>
 The east tower at the deck, for example, was jolted in the direction the 
roadbed runs with a force equal to 55% of the force of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accelerations are far, far higher than we had anticipated," Abdel-Ghaffar 
said. "This is maybe a good kind of push" to make the bridge stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you lose just one part of it," the vital link to the Los Angeles Harbor 
that carries more than 27,000 cars a day would be useless, he said.

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE REBUILDING; CALTRANS CHOPS DOWN RED TAPE TO 
PUT UP CONCRETE; AGENCY USED INNOVATIVE BIDDING PROCEDURE AND WORKED SO FAST 
THAT SOME CONTRACTORS WORRY IF THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GET ENOUGH MATERIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To get Southern California roads and freeways back up to speed quickly after 
the Northridge quake -- a job that will require $800 million in rebuilding and 
repairs -- Caltrans officials did not just trim back on bureaucratic red tape. 
</P>
<P>
 They sliced through it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of the quake, working at times by flashlight in a Downtown office 
that lost its power, supervisors began approving emergency no-bid contracts to 
remove damaged bridges and shore up shaky ones. 
</P>
<P>
 And in less than three weeks, they issued the first contracts for major 
reconstruction of the Santa Monica Freeway and fallen stretches of the Golden 
State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Using innovative bidding procedures never tested on such a scale, Caltrans is 
moving ahead so quickly that some contractors worry whether they will be able 
to get enough of the steel reinforcing bars and other materials needed to 
complete the jobs on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors who get their work done early will earn bonuses of up to $200,000 
a day, giving them every incentive to move as quickly as possible. Every day 
beyond the deadline will cost them $200,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike less urgent contracts, the quake-related ones make no allowance for 
time lost because of weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of high-speed bidding and the incentive-disincentive contracts 
have brought an unusual level of anxiety and risk to the firms invited to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of the time constraints and not allowing for bad weather days, you're 
really playing a game of roulette with the weather," said Kenneth L. Gibson, 
executive vice president of the Associated General Contractors of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The joke among contractors, Gibson said, is that after bid awards the losers 
say: "The bad news is I didn't get the bid," while the winner responds: "The 
bad news is I won the bid. Now it's, oh my God, what do I do now?" 
</P>
<P>
 State highway officials say that while accelerating the bureaucratic 
machinery, they are still insisting on the same standards of workmanship, 
worker safety and minority hiring that are required under state and federal law 
for all construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing plans for new bridges built to the latest earthquake standards and 
getting construction started in the shortest time possible has been a 
remarkable achievement, said Caltrans office engineer P. Kay Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a group of people here who thrive working under pressure," said 
Griffin, who coordinated the bidding procedures for repairing the earthquake 
damage.  
</P>
<P>
 Planning and bidding procedures that usually would have taken six months or 
longer are being completed in days, she said. Instead of listing and 
advertising these large jobs to encourage broad competition, Caltrans is 
inviting small numbers of selected contractors to bid on each. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of giving bidders up to four months to bid a large job, Caltrans gave 
them only a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting as long as a month between bid openings and the execution 
of a contract, state officials are opening bids and approving contracts on the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of allowing up to 15 days for contractors to start the job after the 
bid is awarded, they are expected to begin within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major contracts require the bid winners to have crews working around 
the clock, seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 And on dozens of smaller jobs -- to remove debris, bring down damaged bridges 
and shore up shaky structures -- Caltrans has dispensed with competitive 
bidding entirely. Department officials are picking contractors to do the work 
on a standard pay schedule. Some of these no-bid jobs are worth more than $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the short-circuiting of normal bidding procedures, there has been 
relatively little grousing among contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 That is partly because Caltrans officials have tried to spread the work around 
among companies that have track records on Caltrans highway projects. They have 
favored companies that have done extensive work in the Los Angeles area. And 
they have insisted that prime contractors hire more than the usual number of 
"disadvantaged business"' subcontractors -- firms run by minorities, women and 
disabled veterans. Caltrans usually asks that 20% of a job be done by such 
disadvantaged businesses, but they are asking prime contractors to aim for 40% 
on the quake jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still get criticized," said Caltrans' chief bridge engineer, James E. 
Roberts. "One contractor called because we didn't invite him to bid on the 
Santa Monica Freeway. But I told him, we had him down for Gavin Canyon 
(replacing a fallen section of I-5)." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts outlined the criteria used for the bid invitations. "They had to be 
large companies doing things in Los Angeles. We had to know they could do 
things of this size. . . . There are only so many bridge construction people in 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation 
Committee, said that he has heard no complaints about the fairness of bidding. 
He said he was impressed by Caltrans' efforts to speed up bidding and still 
ensure that women- and minority-run businesses get their share of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz promises to watch the results closely. "It's fine as long as they're 
monitoring the quality of work done and as long as there aren't lots of 
switches and change orders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they had done it this way in the Bay Area (four years ago)," said Sen. 
Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), chairman of the Senate Transportation 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the responsibility to keep the state's highways open to traffic, Caltrans 
officials are experienced in dealing with emergencies -- although usually not 
on the scale of last month's 6.8 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Kermode, who runs the state highway maintenance operation for the Los 
Angeles region, was asleep at his Glendale home when the quake hit. "As soon as 
the earthquake hit, I knew it was a large quake with a lot of potential damage 
to our structures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, he was at the transportation communications center in Downtown 
Los Angeles. Without power, they worked by flashlight gathering information on 
highway damage from employees in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our maintenance structure employees have assigned freeways to patrol," 
Kermode said. Acting under emergency procedures, without orders from their 
supervisors, the workers "fanned out and made inspections." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly determined the damage to major structures. Almost as quickly, by 
about 8 a.m., Kermode began to get calls from experienced contractors ready to 
begin clearing away rubble and demolishing badly damaged structures. Some were 
already at the sites of fallen bridges, assessing the damage, when they called 
in for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10:30 a.m., just six hours after the quake, he had approval from Caltrans 
Director James W. van Loben Sels to authorize the demolition work to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the biggest of the non-bid jobs -- the removal of a fallen bridge and 
demolition of weakened structures at the intersection of Interstate 5 and 
California 14 -- were awarded to Granite Construction Co. Caltrans estimated 
the cost of the two jobs at $2.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bypassing the usual bidding requirements is frequently done in emergency 
situations, said W. T. (Doc) Maloney, chief of business management for 
Caltrans' Los Angeles district. "We get the full range of problems from 
earthquakes to slides on the Coast Highway," Maloney said. "So everything you 
can think of happening to a road has happened to a road." 
</P>
<P>
 Tearing down a badly damaged highway bridge is a formidable task. Caltrans 
spokesman Jim Drago described the difficulty of taking down a damaged section 
of the Golden State Freeway in Gavin Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you detonate one of these (highway bridges), it doesn't flutter down 
like a feather," Drago said. At Gavin Canyon, Caltrans was worried about 
damaging a buried gas pipeline and a communications line that carried 
transmissions between area airports. To prevent damage, the contractor had to 
place 25,000 cubic yards of dirt as a blanket to soften the bridge's fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition jobs require no bidding and present no risk to the contractors. 
They are paid for time, materials and overhead according to standard Caltrans 
schedules.  
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans is using a relatively new bidding system for the major earthquake 
work -- requiring contractors to bid both total cost and completion time to 
determine the low bidder. But the method, which includes penalties for firms 
that fail to get the job done on time, creates great pressures on the 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course it's nerve-racking," said Doug Aadland, chief engineer for the E. 
L. Yeager Co., which won a $14-million contract late last month to replace the 
damaged bridges on the Golden State at Gavin Canyon in 130 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has a lengthy track record building freeway bridges and 
interchanges, including the interchange of California 15 and 91 near Corona. 
"Normally a job of this magnitude takes at least a month or so to bid," he 
said. "We did it in less than a week. We hope they don't make a habit of this. 
It's not an easy process." 
</P>
<P>
 C. C. Meyers Co. won the other big earthquake reconstruction job -- rebuilding 
the Santa Monica Freeway. The company bid $14.9 million to complete the job in 
just 140 days. The firm's resume includes work on the Century Freeway and the 
new upper deck on the Harbor Freeway. Before winning the bid, company Vice 
President Carl Bauer praised Caltrans' efforts to speed up the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very impressed with Caltrans' ability to move forward on this," he said. 
"The public, and certainly the politicians, are unaware of the effort that goes 
into this."

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; CRISIS GIVES BRIDGE EXPERT STARRING ROLE; WITH 
A CAREER SPANNING FOUR DECADES, JIM ROBERTS IS DUBBED THE FATHER OF THE STATE'S 
SEISMIC RETROFITTING PROGRAM. 'HE'S A STRAIGHT SHOOTER AND HE'S UNFLAPPABLE,' 
SAYS ONE CONSULTANT.

<P>
 For one fleeting moment after the Northridge earthquake, the state's chief 
bridge engineer allowed himself to indulge in regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish," Jim Roberts confided to a colleague, "that I had retired before 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The next moment the pathos was gone and the brief window into any inner 
feelings was shut. Roberts, the engineer, was back in his familiar role, 
barking orders to bridge designers, setting up meetings with legislators and 
preparing for interviews with the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the early morning temblor in Los Angeles shook apart six of the state's 
prized bridges, James E. Roberts has been a man in constant motion. On his 
shoulders fall the responsibility for overseeing the rebuilding effort as well 
as explaining to lawmakers and the news media why the structures fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Much praised as the father of California's highway seismic retrofitting 
program, Roberts is now the man who must answer for its failure to prevent the 
collapses in the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions are often hostile; the answers patient and unemotional. If the 
bridges had been retrofitted, he insists, they probably would not have failed. 
Five of the six structures, he adds, had been slated for retrofitting but the 
program had not gotten to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were one earthquake behind," he likes to say. 
</P>
<P>
 A television reporter at one media briefing shoves a microphone close to his 
face. Doesn't he feel some responsibility for the death of the Los Angeles 
policeman who plunged off a collapsed ramp of the Golden State-Antelope Valley 
interchange, she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he replies calmly. "I sleep well at night. I think we've done the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes have placed Roberts in the most unlikely of roles. They have made 
him, if not a television star, at least a familiar figure on the evening news. 
After each event -- first Loma Prieta and then Northridge -- his was one of the 
first visages on the television screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the face nor the voice lend themselves to the tube. The face is lined 
-- a testament perhaps to his 63 years of age -- and the hair is styled in an 
old-fashioned crew cut. The voice has little inflection as he talks of the 
complexity of earthquake forces and the stresses they place on bridges.  
</P>
<P>
 But his willingness to answer an endless stream of questions conveys a 
sincerity that causes reporters and lawmakers to turn to him repeatedly for 
explanations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a straight shooter and he's unflappable," said Arthur Bauer, a 
transportation consultant who once sat on a board that oversaw Roberts' 
engineering of a light rail project. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is in many ways tailor-made to represent the California Department of 
Transportation's bridge program. His 41-year tenure with Caltrans encompasses 
the great freeway road-building years of the 1950s and 1960s, and he worked in 
the department when most of the state's highway bridges -- about 8,000 of the 
12,000 -- were constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim Roberts is the quintessential bridge engineer," said Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar), chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee. "If you were 
going to look in the dictionary under bridge engineer, you'd find a picture of 
Roberts." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Jameson, Mo., a small town near the Oklahoma border, Roberts came 
to California in the mid-1930s. His family, like thousands of others, had lost 
their farm in the great Dust Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 A summer job at Caltrans near the end of his college years at UC Berkeley 
convinced him that bridges would be his life's pursuit. To hone his skills as a 
bridge designer, he got a master's degree from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts' love of bridges is legendary. After attending a conference in New 
Zealand, he was asked if he had taken time out to see the sights. "Oh yes," he 
told a colleague, "I visited most of the bridges." 
</P>
<P>
 In California there are only a few bridges Roberts cannot describe from 
memory, and when he speaks of some structures, it is with a reverence and awe 
that others might use to describe a fine painting. "The Golden Gate Bridge is 
one of my favorites," he says. "It was built in the 1930s, and it's still one 
of the wonders of the world. It's an architectural masterpiece." 
</P>
<P>
 His own masterpiece that he helped design is a half-mile bridge over the New 
Melones Reservoir between Sonora and Angels Camp that sits on 400-foot-high 
piers dug into what was once a deep canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridge design was completed just a few months before the Sylmar earthquake 
that would dramatically change the way California bridges were designed and 
send Roberts' career in a new direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1971 temblor damaged many state bridges and for the first time 
demonstrated that highway structures were vulnerable to earthquake forces. It 
spawned a seismic retrofitting program and extensive changes in the designs of 
bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts worked on the retrofitting in its early years, then left that division 
of the department and did not return until 1985. When he came back he found the 
program was barely limping along. It had been underfunded and had yet to tackle 
one of the most serious bridge vulnerabilities -- the weakness of columns. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts began writing memos, demanding more money for research and 
retrofitting and warning that the death toll could be heavy if the bridges were 
not strengthened. It took several years but funding was increased and column 
retrofitting got under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 turned Roberts' early memos into a 
prophecy. This time when roadways went down they took 43 people to their 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, as the department's chief authority on bridges, has taken heat for 
the slowness of the retrofitting program. He used the heightened interest in 
retrofitting to push for more funding, winning assurances that $750 million 
would be put aside for the program and it would become one of the department's 
top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the accelerated program did not move fast enough to get all the 
bridges retrofitted in time for the Northridge quake. Those that were 
retrofitted stayed up. Six that were not fell down. And once again Roberts is 
before the cameras, explaining why bridges failed. 
</P>
<P>
 In private he admits to a few frustrations. "Does it bother me? Sure it does," 
he says. "Because a lot of people that make comments about the program don't 
have any concept of how complicated this is. Earthquakes are random. You don't 
know what one is going to do from one second to the next and they're all 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he really want to retire? "No, not really," he admits. "What I would like 
is to have the retrofit program finished when I retire. It would be nice to 
know that when I leave that somebody else is not going to get hit with this."

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE INSPECTORS; SOUTHLAND'S NIGHTMARE IS AN 
ENGINEER'S DREAM; EXPERTS CAME RUNNING TO SEE WHAT STRUCTURES WERE SAFE -- AND 
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE THAT WEREN'T. LESSONS FROM THE REAL-LIFE LABORATORY WILL 
SHAPE FUTURE CONSTRUCTION.

<P>
 Although for many a horrific tragedy, the largest earthquake ever recorded in 
the Los Angeles Basin was also a marvelous opportunity, "a full-scale 
laboratory," in the words of a New Zealand structural engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as volcanologists consider getting a close-up look at the cone of a 
boiling mountain the scientific thrill of a lifetime, the world's foremost 
structural, seismic and civil engineers swarm to earthquakes for the rare 
opportunity to see in the rubble the intersection of theory and practice, of a 
computer's calculations and the sudden, undeniable force of a heaving fault 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Other engineers and technicians by the hundreds have a more immediate concern: 
determining as quickly as possible which structures are safe. But all have to 
work hurriedly, because some of the best evidence is cleared away quickly in 
the rush to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 From their initial battle-scene observations come rapid conclusions about why 
buildings or freeway bridges buckled or fell, as well as the seeds of change. 
If the tale told by failed structures is heeded, it can affect future designs 
and save lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's so much terrible damage that we have to turn this into something to 
work with," said Susan Tubbesing, executive director of the Earthquake 
Engineering Research Institute. "Otherwise, it's just a greater loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the Northridge quake, the EERI, an Oakland-based professional 
organization partially funded by the National Science Foundation, dispatched a 
reconnaissance team that eventually included about 100 experts in buildings, 
freeways, geology, utilities and emergency response. 
</P>
<P>
 They and hundreds of engineers and scientists from universities, governmental 
agencies and nations including Mexico, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, 
videotaped, photographed, measured and analyzed all aspects of the quake. Japan 
alone sent more than a dozen delegations, some with as many as 50 members. 
</P>
<P>
 So many sought to view the highest-profile destruction, such as the 
interchange of the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeways, that engineers 
sometimes outnumbered cleanup workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn something from every earthquake, because no two spots on the 
earth's surface are completely alike," said J. David Rogers, a geotechnical 
engineer from Pleasant Hill who was in Los Angeles when the earthquake 
occurred. Rogers studied the collapse of the Cypress roadway structure in 
Oakland in the 1989 Loma Prieta quake and prepared a report on it for the state 
Assembly Transportation Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The aspect of the Northridge quake getting the greatest attention from 
engineers and seismologists is the strength of the shaking, in some cases at 
locations far from the epicenter. That movement was captured on hundreds of 
sensitive but relatively simple recording devices known as accelerographs, 
installed by the state and federal governments and property owners at more than 
500 buildings and open sites around the Los Angeles Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of those readings, which included a vertical ground movement in 
Tarzana that was measured at nearly twice the strength of gravity and was among 
the most violent such forces ever recorded, stunned the experts and will be 
studied for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Any vertical force in excess of gravity is sufficient to simply toss 
structures into the air, were they not anchored. Because they are, however, 
structures resist, magnifying the destruction. With each such cycle of 
movement, walls and columns and roadbeds weaken and, eventually, fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The records of that motion could lead to tougher requirements for the 
construction of freeways, bridges, apartment buildings, dams and utility lines, 
Rogers said. The Antelope Valley-Golden State freeway interchange that 
collapsed was designed to withstand a shake of 15% of gravity, or 2 1/2 times 
as powerful as the jolt recorded in the 1971 Sylmar earthquake in the San 
Fernando Valley. Today, all new Los Angeles County freeways and bridges are 
designed to withstand jolts 70% as strong as gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Hall, an associate professor of civil engineering at Caltech and an 
expert in concrete dams, said an accelerograph at the Pacoima Dam in the San 
Gabriel Mountains, several miles southeast of that interchange, registered a 
sideways jolt that was more than twice as strong as gravity and opened up a gap 
of several inches between the dam and the rock abutment. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of the movement was "higher than we would usually assume when we 
do design and safety assessments," said Hall, who headed the EERI 
reconnaissance team for the quake. "It's an important event and it will change 
the way we do things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lessons are learned in every earthquake. After the Sylmar quake, the state 
began retrofitting freeway overpasses with massive cables to hold overpass 
sections together. Then, after the 1987 Whittier quake, Caltrans began 
jacketing the most vulnerable single-column freeway structures in steel to make 
them stronger. No retrofitted columns failed in the Northridge quake. The 1989 
Loma Prieta quake focused attention on multicolumned structures, on freeway 
overpasses in areas of unstable soil and on the weakness of double-deck 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Caltrans personnel into the field after any major quake are area 
maintenance supervisors assigned to check certain stretches of freeway and 
radio damage reports to the department's emergency operations center. On their 
heels are bridge experts and other engineers heading to the most badly damaged 
areas. Because of the severity of the Northridge quake, 24 additional engineers 
were dispatched from Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bridges still standing were inspected with an $18,000 bore scope, 
a much larger version of the devices that doctors use to look inside the human 
body. Caltrans had one scope, and two more were purchased the day after the 
quake for inspecting roadbeds and connection joints. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also sent from Northern California two "snooper" trucks 
equipped with buckets that can be raised to get a close look at overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dispatching structural engineers, the department sent teams of 
seismic experts to document the forces that struck bridges and determine how 
the structures performed, Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago said. Those experts 
compile "the official engineering record of the event" that will then be 
reviewed and studied for years to come, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers "like to do fancy math . . . to calculate" what would happen to 
structures subjected to great stress, said Hall, of the EERI. But, he said, 
"most of what we learn comes from experience. We build something, an earthquake 
comes along and shakes it and we correct it the next time we build." 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Sharpe, a consulting structural engineer based in Cupertino, said, 
however, that it sometimes takes several years before knowledge gained about 
how structures performed in an earthquake is put into practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe, who headed an effort by the engineering profession to develop seismic 
design guidelines for highway bridges, said the pressure to quickly reopen 
downed overpasses often means that new knowledge does not get incorporated into 
the rebuilt structures. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he cited the reconstruction of the Antelope Valley-Golden State 
freeway interchange after it was damaged in the Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly improved the design but it certainly wasn't up to what we knew 
could have been done two or three years later," he said.EARTHQUAKE SAFETY

EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A.; THE FAULT LINE; TUG OF WAR CENTERED ON CALTRANS 
SEISMIC MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY L. RABIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the immediate aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, the chief bridge 
engineer of Caltrans would blame an unmapped fault for the violent shaking that 
brought down key links in the area's freeway network. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer James E. Roberts would say later that he based that assessment on 
early information from seismologists who were studying where the earth moved 
before dawn on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the precise fault line may have been a mystery, the potential for a 
severe quake and intense ground motion centered in the northern San Fernando 
Valley was not a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 To assess the seismic hazard to the state's freeways, Caltrans for years has 
been using the most comprehensive map ever prepared by the state detailing the 
maximum earthquake possible along 225 fault lines and zones in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it was finished, the wall-sized map and an accompanying report 
sparked a behind-the-scenes controversy among geologists and seismologists. 
Some feared that the information would be misinterpreted by engineers and 
consultants in designing buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Caltrans embraced the map's conservative approach, some experts 
expressed concern that it does not indicate a key factor -- the probability of 
a temblor occurring during a specified time period. 
</P>
<P>
 In stark black lines, the map shows that the Los Angeles region is riddled 
with faults capable of generating a quake of the same magnitude as the 
Northridge temblor or greater. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four fault zones believed to be capable of producing a 6.75-magnitude 
shock or greater crisscross the northern and eastern San Fernando Valley, 
including the Simi-Santa Rosa-Northridge Fault zone close to the epicenter of 
last month's devastating quake. The map lists that fault zone as capable of 
generating a 7.5-magnitude quake. The Verdugo, San Fernando-Sierra Madre and 
Santa Susana thrust faults also are shown in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans commissioned the map in 1982 for use in designing freeways and 
establishing priorities for reinforcing highway bridges and overpasses to 
withstand quakes. But it took the state Division of Mines and Geology 10 years 
-- until 1992 -- to publish the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In July of 1989, less than three months before the Loma Prieta quake rocked 
Northern California, James H. Gates, chief of structural mechanics engineering 
for Caltrans, demanded the release of the map in a strongly worded memo to 
Joseph I. Ziony, then-assistant director of the state Department of 
Conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it incredible that anyone would question the desirability of releasing 
(the map). The map was developed using public funds and it exists," Gates 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not a legal expert, but it seems to me that if a significant (quake) 
were to occur, the Division of Mines and Geology could be held responsible for 
withholding information which could have reduced damage or saved lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the data on levels of ground shaking contained on the map is basic 
and "can be applied with engineering judgment to any structure, just as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziony no longer works for the state. After reviewing the memo, state geologist 
James F. Davis recalled that Gates "wanted the map to come out. His interests 
were taken into account." 
</P>
<P>
 But when released by the Division of Mines and Geology, the report was labeled 
for Caltrans' "internal use" and the map carried a prominent bold-faced 
disclaimer saying it was produced exclusively for Caltrans' use in the design 
of highway bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "General use of this (map) for seismic hazard evaluation is not recommended 
because this map does not take into account the probability that a particular 
level of shaking will occur," the disclaimer reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said some members of a special advisory committee to the state's Mining 
and Geology Board were concerned that broader use of the map might mislead 
engineering consultants and others in designing critical facilities, such as 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very special purpose map," he said. "One should not rely on a 
single map for anything." Instead, he suggested that engineering consultants 
make a full examination of available geologic information. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the Division of Mines and Geology is preparing a new map that will 
factor in the probability of a certain level of ground shaking occurring during 
a specified period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, now chief of the Office of Earthquake Engineering, said Caltrans is 
pleased with the map. The department has since hired the seismologist who 
prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in continuing development on that kind of map," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials say the information is critical in designing freeways and 
in assessing the seismic hazard to highway bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its development, the map has been used as one element in a complex 
formula to determine priorities for retrofitting freeways to resist quake 
damage, Gates said. Charting the Faults 
</P>
<P>
 After a behind-the-scenes struggle with the state Division of Mines and 
Geology, Caltrans received the most comprehensive map ever prepared by the 
state listing the maximum earthquake expected along major fault lines in 
California. The map shows that the Los Angeles region, including the San 
Fernando Valley, is riddled with fault systems capable of generating a quake of 
the same magnitude as the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor or greater.

 Each time an earthquake's brutal force exposes the relative fragility of 
California's freeways, momentum builds for strengthening bridges and rethinking 
designs for the future. In Japan, it took only one such seismic call to action, 
the 8.3-magnitude Kanto quake of Sept. 1, 1923, that killed more than 140,000 
people around Tokyo.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Japanese remember" that quake, said Caltech engineering professor 
emeritus George W. Housner, "their freeways are stronger and heavier" than

 The country's reaction to the 1923 disaster resulted in a fierce commitment to 
limiting the death toll from subsequent killer quakes, including spending huge 
sums on earthquake engineering research. In Japan, an area 10 times as 
seismically active as California, where three vast plates of the Earth's crust 
grind against and beneath one another, a quake of 8.0 magnitude or higher is 
considered an imminent threat. 
</P>
<P>
 And if it comes, the Japanese want their rapidly expanding 4,000-mile 
expressway system to be ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a willingness to recognize the potential problems and to face up to 
the fact that it is going to take major dollars," said Reidar Bjorhovde, a 
professor of civil engineering at the University of Pittsburgh who spent six 
weeks recently studying Japanese construction techniques. "I think we have to 
be willing to do that as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Californians who have driven from Los Angeles to Oregon on the usually 
wide-open Interstate 5 would find Japanese highways frustrating in many ways. 
All Japanese highways are toll roads, and a trip of that length would cost $50 
or more. Moreover, all but the newest expressways in Japan are only two lanes 
in each direction and often congested. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Japanese highways are usually elevated, to preserve precious real 
estate for other uses, soaring high-speed overpasses such as the collapsed 
Golden State-Antelope Valley interchange do not exist. As a result, connecting 
turns are sharper and slower. 
</P>
<P>
 In other ways, quake-shaken Californians might find driving long distances in 
Japan comforting. To make taller structures more stable, supporting columns are 
usually connected with crossbeams to help them resist an earthquake's sideways 
forces. Other strengthening techniques include using more steel girders in 
spans, designing a wider overlap of adjacent spans and making columns or piers 
as much as 50% more massive, with more reinforcing steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Kasuhiko Kawashima, an engineer who is head of earthquake engineering for 
Japan's Earthquake Disaster Prevention Department, said that after the 1923 
quake, the Japanese began trying to calculate the sideways force that 
structures would have to withstand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of our many earthquake experiences since then we have gradually 
improved our earthquake design methods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1964 Nigata quake and the 1971 Sylmar earthquake each resulted in stronger 
designs. Since then, the Japanese have concentrated on designs to combat soil 
liquefaction and on strengthening the connections between columns and spans. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawashima said Japanese bridges have to be stronger than California's because 
earthquakes there are more frequent and potentially far more intense. In 
addition, a lack of land often requires bridges to be built on poor or wet 
soils where liquefaction is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese construction standards require concrete to come through quakes 
virtually undamaged, whereas American designers expect some crumbling or 
breaking. "Even if a very, very big earthquake were to occur, we cannot allow 
the concrete to fail," said Hiroshi Mutsuyoshi, an associate professor of 
construction engineering at Saitama University. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of all those techniques is to make the supports for elevated 
freeway bridges in Japan far stiffer, although researchers are trying to 
develop ways to counteract that. The fear is that stiff structures are brittle 
and could collapse in a cataclysm if bent too far by a massive earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal opinion is that they have a lot of vulnerability in their bridge 
structures that is going to show up in a big earthquake," said James H. Gates, 
Caltrans' chief of earthquake engineering in the division of structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridges in California, he said, are designed to bend by building flexibility 
into joints and the connections between columns and spans. Joints connecting 
sections of the San Mateo Bridge over San Francisco Bay are designed to be 
displaced by an earthquake by as much as five feet without coming apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But many Japanese designers believe that those flexible elements create 
weaknesses, which have been demonstrated in each of the state's major 
earthquakes since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Transportation's top bridge engineers and 
designers believe that retrofitting older structures and the designs of newer 
structures are solving those problems. Even so, the design goal for 
California's bridge engineers is quite different from that of the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese "tend to design everything for the worst case," said James E. 
Roberts, Caltrans' chief bridge engineer. "But we're trying to design 
rationally based on the probability and the statistical possibility of that 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 In California the risk is that "in the real biggie, (a bridge) might yield 
enough that you would get some permanent damage," Roberts said. "But you repair 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The weightier Japanese highway designs are 10% to 20% more expensive than U.S. 
techniques, depending on the type of structure, experts estimate. Part of those 
costs are borne indirectly by the government in the form of subsidies to the 
Japanese steel and concrete industries. In Japan, highways are paid for mostly 
with tolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get more rigid and more expensive structures, then the further you get 
in time from a major earthquake, the more the public is going to say, 'Hey, 
what are you wasting money for?' " said Roland Sharpe, a Cupertino structural 
engineer who has advised Caltrans on seismic issues and who is the only 
non-Japanese honorary member of the Japan Structural Consultants Assn. "Now 
we're very close to an earthquake, and people are saying, 'Why didn't you do 
more?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe said that in general, California highway bridges of comparative age are 
as safe as those in Japan. But more of the overpasses there are newer and use 
more up-to-date designs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, earthquakes have damaged more than 3,000 highway bridges in Japan over 
70 years, although none have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 As in California, the collapse of overpasses in the 1971 Sylmar quake caused 
the Japanese to reanalyze the seismic safety of their bridges. More than a 
quarter of 40,000 bridges that were inspected were found to need some type of 
retrofitting, according to a paper presented last month in Berkeley by 
Kawashima, the earthquake engineering expert. 
</P>
<P>
 Retrofitting in Japan tends to be a much more comprehensive undertaking than 
here. Methods include sinking more piles into the ground, enlarging the footing 
or base of columns, adding reinforced concrete around columns or adding cross 
beams for lateral strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the differences in perspective, California bridge designers admire 
much about the Japanese system for researching new technologies and designs. 
The Japanese established the world's first earthquake engineering research 
institute at Tokyo University soon after the devastating 1923 quake. 
Government, universities and private companies cooperate on the development, 
testing and marketing of technological advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese also pump far more money into earthquake engineering research, 
partly because of a requirement that engineering and construction companies 
spend as much as 1% of their income on it. That money goes for hiring hundreds 
of engineers to consider earthquake issues and for research equipment, such as 
huge shaking tables that can reproduce an earthquake's forces on built-to-scale 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 One such shaking table, maintained by the government's Nuclear Power 
Engineering Corp. at Tsukuba Science City northeast of Tokyo, is 50 feet by 50 
feet and is capable of testing 1,000-ton test structures. That device cost 
hundreds of millions of dollars to build and costs $1 million a month to 
operate, according to Housner, who chaired a committee appointed by then-Gov. 
George Deukmejian that made recommendations to Caltrans after the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're just way ahead of us in the number of people (involved in earthquake 
engineering) and the experimental facilities," Housner said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the government gives a boost to private construction companies 
working on methods of controlling the response of large structures to high 
winds or earthquakes by means of energy-absorbing springs or other devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The governmental labs offer themselves for testing, providing equipment, 
staff and materials that will aid the companies in perfecting the new 
products," Bjorhovde of the University of Pittsburgh said. "That is a model. . 
. . and I would like to see that sort of thing evolve here." 
</P>
<P>
 Other engineers said Japanese researchers are also getting attention for their 
work in analyzing the effect of soft or wet soils on freeway structures and in 
what is known as base isolation. Base isolated structures are built on rubber 
or steel bearings that allow them to remain stable during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that both countries have much to learn from each other, engineers, 
scientists and policy-makers from Japan and the United States have been meeting 
annually for at least 15 years to discuss advances in earthquake engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gates, the Caltrans earthquake expert, believes that California could 
learn more if state engineers were allowed greater freedom to travel -- both to 
the sites of distant, destructive earthquakes and to participate in more joint 
research activities with the Japanese and scientists in other countries, such 
as Italy and New Zealand, where new research is being conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates and other engineers have traveled to Japan to learn from their research. 
But, he said, they usually have to apply for federal grants to pay their way. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the big sore points is that we were told that we had to improve our 
technology, yet we continually get slammed on budget requests for out-of-state 
travel," he said. California versus Japan 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese highways are squatter, more massive, somehow more grounded than those 
in Southern California. Japanese designs generally require more steel, in 
columns and spans, and more and higher quality concrete. Engineers debate 
whether highways designed that way will be flexible enough to move to the 
forced rhythm of an earthquake. But there is no doubt that the additional 
material adds to construction costs. 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA FREEWAY 
</P>
<P>
 Roadbeds: Overpasses are essentially hollow boxes made of self-reinforced 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns: Generally are built taller and narrower in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior support: Vertical rebar wrapped by circular steel provides strength 
within poured concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 JAPANESE EXPRESSWAY 
</P>
<P>
 Roadbeds: The reinforced roadbeds of most overpasses contain more steel and 
more concrete than in the U.S. Some overpasses are as much as 80% steel by 
volume. The Japanese also build more all-steel overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Columns: Japanese support columns are as much as 50% wider. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross beams: Used to stabilize the few tall overpasses. Generally, however, 
Japanese roadways are built lower to the ground and interchanges are less 
sweeping, which slows traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Footings: Bases are enlarged and piling is driven deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding Support: Because many Japanese expressways are built in areas of soft 
soil, on artificial fill such as along Tokyo Bay, or on the sediment of 
riverbeds, the Japanese have developed techniques for keeping structures 
stable. These include making the structures more rigid, sinking piles deep into 
the ground and adding to the bulk of column footings. COMPARING THE DIFFERENCES

KILLER OF POLICE WAS JURIST'S SON; AUTOPSIES SEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The man who shot two Palos Verdes Estates police officers to death during a 
robbery attempt before dying in the struggle to subdue him was the 32-year-old 
son of an appellate court judge and the owner of a large cache of weapons, 
police said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid conflicting reports on how gunman David Fukuto died, autopsies were 
performed on him and the two dead police officers. However, the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office ordered that results be kept confidential for 
45 days, saying that revealing anything now might be detrimental to the police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's special investigations division began a supplemental 
probe into how Fukuto -- the son of state District Court of Appeal Justice 
Morio Fukuto -- was killed. The unit routinely looks into the possibility of 
criminal misconduct by officers whenever police are involved in the death of or 
injury to a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, speculation that Fukuto also may have been a suspect in the slaying 
of a Manhattan Beach police officer two months ago was weakened after Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department investigators determined that none of the 
weapons recovered from Fukoto's car and home were used in that attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Fukuto, who has had a distinguished legal career, issued a statement 
Tuesday condemning Monday's attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "David committed a terrible and unforgivable crime in taking the lives of two 
fine police officers without reason," the justice said. "We cannot explain his 
acts. We can only extend our deepest condolences to the officers' families and 
to the members of the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department. Our prayers are 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses say Sgt. Vernon Thomas Vanderpool, 57, and Capt. Michael Tracy, 50, 
were slain when David Fukuto burst into a motivational seminar at the Holiday 
Inn in Torrance on Monday, wearing a bulletproof vest and armed with two 
pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thought was that it was a joke, a bad joke," said Palos Verdes 
Estates Police Chief Gary Johansen, who recalled similar scenarios during 
stunts pulled in police training classes. "I was angry because I was concerned 
somebody could get hurt. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just about to stand up and grab the guy when he ran down to the end of 
the table," the chief said. "Vanderpool said, 'I'm not going to take this crap 
anymore,' and then he stood up. The guy fired two rounds at Vanderpool and hit 
him in the chest. He was wearing a white T-shirt. There was blood everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The chief said that as Tracy rose to aid his fallen comrade, the gunman fired 
a shot that struck Tracy in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that instant, two or three officers made a dive for this guy," Johansen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief said that during the violent struggle that followed, the suspect 
fired one of his pistols at least once. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of yelling going on, people yelling, 'Drop the gun!' " the 
chief said. "It was a life-and-death struggle. . . . Once they got him subdued 
and handcuffed, we rolled him over, and he didn't look real good at that 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 There are reports that Fukuto died from a head injury during the struggle. 
There are several rumors as to how that injury was inflicted, but because the 
coroner's office has been told to remain silent, the cause of Fukuto's death 
remains unverified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our information at this point is that he died of a possible head injury that 
was sustained as a result of the people in the room wrestling the guns away 
from him," Sgt. Dave Smith of the Torrance Police Department said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paramedics told me they couldn't find a gunshot wound on him, although 
bullet holes can sometimes be hard to find," said Jack McCarter, a Torrance 
Fire Department battalion chief who was the incident commander at the hotel. 
McCarter cautioned, however, that he was not among the paramedics who 
administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation to Fukuto. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Botula, a spokesman for Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, said the 45-day hold on 
the autopsy reports was ordered because "divulging the details about the cause 
of death at this point would be to the detriment of the criminal 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 An honor student in high school and an active and respected member of his 
Episcopal church congregation, David Fukuto was a considerate man who took good 
care of the aging grandmother with whom he lived on Oxford Street in the 
Mid-City area, according to friends. They said he never had been in serious 
trouble and, according to investigators, had no known police record. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Johansen, chief of the 23-member Palos Verdes Estates department, 
said he is convinced that Fukuto intended to pull an armed robbery when he went 
to the hotel in Torrance on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because no one was in uniform, the suspect apparently did not realize that 
most of the men in the 12th-floor meeting room were police officers, the chief 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johansen said that before entering the room, Fukuto taped door locks on the 
12th floor in the open position, apparently to aid in his escape. The chief 
said Fukuto was carrying 30 to 40 plastic handcuffs with him in a fanny pack. 
</P>
<P>
 "He apparently planned to tie everybody up and then rob them," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johansen said 13 top city and police officials from Palos Verdes Estates were 
seated around a large, square table in the meeting room about 3:50 p.m. Monday 
when Fukuto "came barging in with guns in both hands. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a semiautomatic in his right hand and something with a silencer on it 
in his other hand," the chief said. "He started screaming, 'Put your hands 
behind your heads! Put your hands behind your heads.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He fired a round out of the gun with the silencer (and) the bullet hit the 
wall. It turned out it was a .22, and with the silencer, it just went 'pop'. It 
sounded like a toy gun." 
</P>
<P>
 In the seconds that followed, Vanderpool and Tracy were fatally wounded and 
police officers wrestled Fukuto to the ground, the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fukuto was taken to Little Company of Mary Hospital in Torrance, where he was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Johansen reacted angrily to some of the questions about the 
gunman's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two of my best officers died yesterday," he said. "You think I care (about 
how Fukuto died)? I don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, Johansen expressed sympathy for the suspect's father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have children," the chief said. "We all know what it's like when they 
run afoul of the law. We feel very much pain for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Smith said caches of weapons and ammunition were recovered from Fukuto's 
car and from the house where he was living with his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said police "recovered a large number of weapons," including a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic handgun, an Uzi carbine with 120 rounds of 
ammunition and a Colt 223-caliber assault rifle believed to be fully automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the weapons used in the Valentine's Day attack also belonged to 
Fukuto, Smith added, identifying the guns as a .22-caliber handgun with a 
silencer and a 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, authorities believed Fukuto might also have been involved in the 
fatal attack two months ago on another South Bay officer, Martin Ganz of the 
Manhattan Beach Police Department. That department, the Torrance Police 
Department and the Sheriff's Department said they are still investigating a 
possible connection, but physical evidence linking the two proved elusive 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are physical similarities to the composite of the suspect wanted in the 
Ganz shooting and the suspect in the Palos Verdes Estates police officers' 
shooting," said Deputy Fidel Gonzales, a spokesman for the Sheriff's 
Department. Ganz, 29, was shot to death Dec. 27 during a seemingly routine 
traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Assigned to a holiday drunk-driving abatement patrol, Ganz used his patrol car 
loudspeaker to pull over a Daihatsu Charade in front of a Manhattan Beach mall 
about 11 p.m., investigators said. They said that when he got out of the car, 
he was shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness to that shooting -- the officer's 13-year-old nephew who was on a 
department-sponsored ride-along -- said the gunman was a heavyset Asian man in 
his 30s. The description roughly fits Fukuto, but he did not own a Daihatsu, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, according to Sheriff's Deputy Rich Erickson, all the guns seized 
from Fukuto's home and car were checked by investigators Tuesday, "and none 
were used in Officer Ganz's murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Shawn Hubler, Ted Johnson and John L. Mitchell contributed 
to this story. Crime Scene 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the fatal shooting of two Palos Verdes Estates police officers 
unfolded Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 1. David Fukuto, 32, enters 12-floor room at Torrance Holiday Inn and 
announces to police gathered at seminar, "This is a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 2. Sgt. Tom Vanderpool, 57, stands and heads toward Fukuto, getting about four 
to six feet from him before being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Capt. Mike Tracy, 50, is shot after standing to help Vanderpool. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Other officers subdued the gunman, who was pronounced dead at a local 
hospital.

PARAMOUNT DEAL: AS SHOW CLOSES, A LOOK AT THE SCRIPT; MEDIA: HALF A DOZEN KEY 
SCENES LED TO THE CLIMAX IN $10-BILLION BATTLE BETWEEN VICTORIOUS VIACOM AND 
QVC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, This story was reported by Times staff writers James Bates, Amy 
Harmon, Kathryn Harris and John Lippman. It was written by Bates. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, the biggest takeover war of the 1990s boiled down to five words 
penned personally by QVC Chairman Barry Diller: "They won. We lost. Next." 
</P>
<P>
 Diller's announcement on Tuesday will go down as one of the sharpest official 
concession statements in the annals of corporate takeovers. But his $10-billion 
battle for Paramount Communications Inc. actually may have ended a week ago, 
when Diller and his advisers met over sandwiches and pasta in investment banker 
Herbert Allen Jr.'s sleek Fifth Avenue office. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the home shopping network assembled some of the biggest Paramount 
shareholders in a last-ditch effort to rally support for its inferior final 
bid. As the meeting dragged on, someone casually mentioned that BellSouth 
Corp., QVC's chief financial backer, could buy QVC shares after the merger to 
prop up QVC's stock price. That would make the bid more valuable by boosting 
the value of QVC stock Paramount shareholders would receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller subsequently pinned his hopes on the plan, since he was unable to raise 
his bid any higher. But the strategy dramatically backfired in the days ahead, 
as rival Viacom charged that the stock purchase would violate the bidding rules 
and others talked about a possible federal investigation. Viacom's victory was 
assured when a besieged Diller finally pledged that his bid would remain 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allen & Co. meeting was one of half a dozen key moments that helped decide 
the marathon Paramount battle, which technically ended at midnight Monday in 
New York, when more than 70% of Paramount's shareholders tendered to Viacom. 
Along the way there were cameo appearances by CNN's Ted Turner, cable mogul 
John C. Malone and others too numerous to mention. The two-way battle 
alternately fascinated and fatigued those following it. It also opened the way 
to a whole slew of deals that have already begun to reshape the communications 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It all started with a friendly merger agreement between Viacom and Paramount 
on Sept. 12, followed eight days later by QVC's hostile bid. By December, the 
Delaware Supreme Court had undone the merger, forcing Paramount to back QVC's 
stronger bid. The balance changed again when Viacom arranged a merger with 
Blockbuster that gave it the financial wherewithal to take the lead, which led 
to Diller's desperate consideration of the BellSouth stock purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone was treated like a conquering 
hero, accepting congratulatory call after call from corporate chieftains such 
as Time Warner Chairman Gerald Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the fatigue and all of the stress disappeared at about 9 o'clock last 
night when we heard we were over the top," Redstone said in a post-victory 
telephone interview. "I picked up a glass of champagne and I said, 'Here's to 
us who won.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Viacom chairman revealed that on Monday afternoon, as the shares were 
being tendered, he left his office to play tennis with a pro. Redstone then 
attended the opening of a Nickelodeon boutique at FAO Schwartz, before hosting 
a small birthday party for his wife, Phyllis, at New York's "21." 
</P>
<P>
 Diller spent Monday on a plane between Los Angeles and New York. In a brief 
phone call, he was philosophical about the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we made mistakes," Diller said in a burst of staccato sentences. 
"Life is mistakes. We, however, achieved exactly what we asked for. We created 
a level playing field against enormous odds. We had the chance to bid fair and 
clean. We got into an auction. We stopped bidding. We take the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount that Redstone and Diller ended up fighting over was ripe for an 
acquisition, having blown several major opportunities in the last five years to 
arrange a major acquisition itself. Big ups and downs seemed characteristic of 
the company. 
</P>

 Founded by Adolph Zukor in 1916, Paramount in the 1920s was Hollywood's most 
profitable studio, with such hits as Cecil B. DeMille's silent classic "The Ten 
Commandments." In the 1930s and 1940s, Paramount was home to such stars as the 
Marx Brothers, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields, Claudette Colbert, Bob Hope and Bing 
Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio slid in the late 1950s and 1960s. A cagey Lew Wasserman at MCA 
snatched up Paramount's pre-1948 films just when Paramount needed cash. Today, 
MCA's vaults are home to such Paramount classics as the Marx Brothers' "Duck 
Soup," "Monkey Business" and "Coconuts" as well as a good portion of the 
Hope/Crosby "road" pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Bluhdorn's Gulf & Western bought the studio in 1966, beginning the 
trend of conglomerates gobbling up studios. The company collected a variety of 
assets, from the Simon & Schuster publishing house -- now Paramount Publishing 
-- to the New York Knicks basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount was revived in the 1970s and early 1980s, thanks largely to Diller 
and a team of talented executives he assembled to run the studio, among them 
current Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner and Walt Disney Studios Chief 
Jeffrey Katzenberg. When a heart attack felled Bluhdorn in 1983, onetime 
publicist Martin S. Davis took over. Diller, who frequently chafed under Davis, 
left for 20th Century Fox in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis launched Paramount on a corporate garage sale to whittle down Bluhdorn's 
collection of companies. The restructuring culminated in the 1989 sale of its 
huge credit card operation, Associates, to Ford Motor Co. The $1.2-billion gain 
Paramount recorded on that deal gave Davis a war chest that instantly made him 
a feared predator in the entertainment industry. What's more, the name was 
changed to Paramount Communications to reflect a more focused company. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis soon gained the reputation as a corporate tire-kicker, with critics 
saying he lacked the vision and guts to make a bold acquisition. One of the 
biggest failures, former Paramount executives said, was his inability to land a 
record company. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Paramount films, including "Flashdance," "Saturday Night Fever," 
"Top Gun," "Grease" and "Boomerang," produced wildly popular songs and 
soundtracks over the years for record labels belonging to Paramount's rivals. 
All told, some former Paramount executives estimate that the company has missed 
hundreds of millions of dollars in sales as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Former executives said that Paramount tried to cut deals to buy companies 
ranging from Geffen Records to Thorn EMI but that each time the deals fell 
apart. It also once held talks with fellow entertainment giant MCA, sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis did launch an unsuccessful hostile bid for Time Inc., losing to Warner 
Communications. By 1993, Paramount was a ripe takeover candidate, and some, 
notably cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. and cable's Turner, had been 
sniffing around. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were impatient that Davis had done little with the Associates 
proceeds. Paramount's film slate was sparse, and the company's earnings were 
regularly full of unpleasant surprises. Its stock was trading at about half the 
value that Viacom eventually agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, whose ambitions had become a hot Hollywood guessing game after he left 
Fox Inc. two years ago, surprised people by signing on to head QVC, a home 
shopping channel. Although he often touts home shopping as a place that allows 
viewers to "shop for underwear in their underwear," his real goal was to use 
QVC as leverage to build an entertainment/technology company at the forefront 
of the "information superhighway" explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Depositions filed in a Delaware court case show that he began holding 
discussions with investment bankers Allen & Co. shortly after taking the reins 
at QVC. Allen Executive Vice President Enrique F. Senior said in his deposition 
that Allen first suggested Paramount to Diller, although most believe that 
Diller had Paramount in mind for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long before Davis was hearing Diller's footsteps. In his deposition, 
he spoke of running into Diller in a restaurant and having lunch with him in 
July at Paramount's headquarters, each time trying to squeeze information out 
of him to determine if Diller had anything planned. Acting carefully to avoid 
legal problems, Diller didn't bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom and Paramount, which had talked on and off for four years, finally 
reached an agreement in mid-September on a bid that was worth $9.2 billion at 
the time. A week later, QVC made its move, backed by partners such as regional 
cable giant Comcast and Liberty Media, a Malone and TCI affiliate. Its bid was 
worth about $9.5 billion then. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom decided to make Malone the issue, painting him as no less than the John 
D. Rockefeller of cable, eager to control every part of the business. Viacom's 
anger at Malone also was triggered by plans by the movie network Encore -- 
backed by Malone affiliates -- to launch a batch of movie channels that would 
pose a direct threat to Viacom's Showtime and The Movie Channel. Malone 
eventually backed off the Paramount bid when TCI agreed to be bought by 
regional phone company Bell Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides then scrambled for partners. Viacom lined up regional phone company 
Nynex. Blockbuster Entertainment, long criticized for not diversifying fast 
enough from its video rental business, invested as well. Diller lined up 
BellSouth, cable and newspaper giant Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications, 
the last of which is owned by the wealthy Newhouse family. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Davis stiff-armed QVC. That changed on Nov. 24, when a Delaware 
Chancery Court ruled that Paramount could not use as a defense its "poison 
pill," a mechanism designed to make an unwanted takeover more expensive. That 
meant that Paramount had a duty to evaluate both offers. There were two 
ironies: QVC's chief legal adviser was lawyer Martin Lipton, Wall Street's 
godfather of anti-takeover defenses and the father of the "poison pill" 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the ruling seemed a direct conflict with a 1990 ruling in which Time Inc. 
was able to spurn a bid by Paramount itself, arguing that it fit better with 
Warner Communications. Just three years earlier, Davis was hailed as a 
shareholders champion. Now Diller was enjoying that role, as the Delaware 
Supreme Court found that Paramount failed to fulfill its shareholder 
obligations and voided a $100-million payment it promised to pay Viacom if the 
deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turning point was very clearly the Delaware court system," Davis said 
Tuesday. "The Delaware court is creating new law . . . to fit the climate. The 
Delaware decision is one that I respectfully and at the same time vehemently 
disagree with." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two months, Viacom and QVC volleyed bids, changing the terms of 
their complex offers each time. "The last two months of it just seemed to take 
forever," one investment banker said. "It was clear that both sides seemed to 
have lost excitement about bidding more . . . . It got to the point where you 
just wanted it to be over, no matter what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood agreed. Some referred to it as "The Neverending Story." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Paramount's studio suffered under the uncertainty. Some executives 
defected. Some agents were reluctant to pitch projects because of not knowing 
who would be in charge. Although the summer film "The Firm" was a hit, 
Paramount's Christmas sequels, "Wayne's World II" and "Addams Family Values," 
were disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount disclosed that it would lose $35 million to $40 million in the 
quarter covering Christmas, naming "Addams Family Values" as one reason. If 
that wasn't enough, the original negative to Paramount's "Blue Chips" -- set 
for release in March -- was being processed when the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake hit. Covered with water and debris, the negative was saved only 
after painstaking efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who returned to his office Monday night after dinner to get word of 
Viacom's victory, suggested in an interview that he felt vindicated that 
Paramount's original suitor won. Of Diller, Davis said: "Barry conducted 
himself as best he could under difficult conditions. I don't agree with what he 
did, but from a strategic viewpoint, he did what he thought was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone said he doesn't know whether his old friendship with Diller can be 
repaired because Diller used QVC "to come after a deal that was done." 
Nonetheless, he said, "I don't have the slightest bit of ill will. Barry's 
terrific and he'll do something else and I'm sure he'll succeed at it." 
</P>
<P>
 And what did Diller mean by "Next" in his statement? He refused to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I learned long ago about auctions . . . you have to 
remember it's not ego or talent. It's simply raising your hand for the next 
bid. You don't always get to win," Diller said.

BROAD U.S. PLAN TO CLEAN UP AIR IN L.A. AREA UNVEILED; POLLUTION: 
ADMINISTRATION BLUEPRINT WOULD TARGET SHIPS AND ALL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES FOR THE 
FIRST TIME. THE EPA WILL HOLD PUBLIC DEBATE ON THE PROPOSED RULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a sweeping strategy that moves further to clean up California's smoggiest 
cities than ever before, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday 
revealed almost 100 clean-air measures it plans to mandate for the Los Angeles 
Basin, Sacramento and Ventura County over the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited plan -- prompted by a court order -- is the Clinton 
Administration's version of what bold and sometimes painful steps must be taken 
to bring healthful air to the four-county Los Angeles region by 2010 and to 
Ventura County and the Sacramento area by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2,700-page array of highly detailed federal proposals, virtually every 
source of pollution is targeted: cars, trains, airlines, ships and trucks. Lawn 
mowers, tractors, recreational vehicles and motorcycles. Large factories and 
small businesses. Paints and pesticides. In all, the proposed rules encompass 
15 million people -- half of California's population -- who are exposed to the 
nation's dirtiest air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a complicated web of strategies that affect truly every 
aspect of life here in California. You put all that together and it's a pretty 
enormous impact on the region," said Robert Wyman, a Los Angeles attorney who 
represents a variety of oil companies, utilities, aerospace firms, chemical 
plants and engine manufacturers on air quality issues. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time the EPA has stepped squarely into the quagmire of 
identifying ways to clean up California's air. The EPA, however, is proposing 
the rules only under duress, after losing in a 10-year legal odyssey. The 
lawsuit was initiated by Los Angeles-area environmentalists to force the EPA to 
step in when local air quality regulators failed to comply with the 1977 
federal Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 While a majority of the EPA's blueprint is fundamentally the same as measures 
already under development by local and state officials, some are new and highly 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Most notably, sources of pollution that have never before been targeted would 
be regulated, including all commercial airlines, ships that dock at the Los 
Angeles and Long Beach ports, recreational boats and passenger and freight 
trains. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the federal government has sole control over many pollution sources, the 
clean-air plan is the most comprehensive one to emerge during the two decades 
that the Los Angeles Basin has struggled to comply with the nation's clean-air 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner signed the proposed rules Monday night, and 
the agency has kicked off six months of public debate, including a long series 
of forums in California this spring and hearings scheduled for July. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of a court order, the EPA must adopt final regulations within 
one year, and the agency must enforce the provisions or be vulnerable to more 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the end of the line," Felicia Marcus, the EPA's western regional 
administrator, said Tuesday. "We are under obligation to not just come up with 
a plan, but all the regulations, the whole program, as opposed to being 
theoretical. What you have here for the first time is an overall comprehensive 
picture of what it will take to give California clean air." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the South Coast Air Quality Management District and state Air 
Resources Board -- who are under increasing pressure from the business 
community to scale back anti-smog rules -- said they welcome the federal help. 
For years, they have urged aggressive action from the EPA in regulating sources 
such as airliners that only the federal government can control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope," said James Lents, the AQMD's executive officer, "that it at least 
sends a signal that what we're trying to do here in cleaning the air is driven 
by federal law." 
</P>
<P>
 In its plan, the federal agency avoided measures considered Draconian that it 
once had threatened to impose on the Los Angeles region, such as gasoline 
rationing, no-driving days for motorists and taxes based on miles driven. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also does not attempt to regulate California development, land use or 
population issues, and mostly avoids targeting consumers or motorists directly, 
saying such steps, if needed, should be undertaken by local and state 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Administration plan is a series of pollution fees and emissions 
standards for manufacturers and other businesses, including some novel 
approaches designed to give them an economic incentive to cut smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ultimate goal is public health, and to try to minimize as much as we 
could the negative impact on the economy and the social fabric of all three 
areas," said David Howekamp, chief of air management at the EPA's regional 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very difficult measures. We've stayed away from gasoline rationing 
and other measures that are not politically acceptable, but they will still be 
painful." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the EPA plan would cut smog-forming gases equally in all three 
metropolitan regions, at a price roughly estimated by the agency at $3 billion 
to $6 billion a year. Most of the economic burden would fall on the Los Angeles 
Basin -- Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, Howekamp 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists were pleased Tuesday, mainly because they believe the 
proposed rules will gradually mean much cleaner cars, buses, trucks and planes 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talk about reinventing L.A. and if we are going to reinvent 
L.A. -- and we should -- then one place we should start is a plan to clean up 
our air," said Denny Zane of the Coalition for Clean Air, the Santa 
Monica-based environmental group whose lawsuit forced the EPA to develop the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Soto, president of the Coalition for Clean Air, called the plan "the most 
significant proposal on air quality since the adoption of the national Clean 
Air Act" in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the face of it, it looks very practical and even sort of soothing because 
it looks like they are seeking integration with local policy. It seems 
consistent with the goals California already has on the books," Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many business leaders, however, say it would have a tremendous impact on all 
aspects of California's economy. They especially fear that proposed regulations 
on airlines, trucking and commercial ships would restrict interstate commerce 
and make California less competitive with other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can mistake this as a halfhearted proposal," Wyman said, predicting a 
lively debate between regulated businesses and the EPA over the next six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline industry in particular worries about the impact. Some airlines 
fear they can achieve the proposed pollution limits only by eliminating some 
flights in the three metropolitan areas -- especially in the Southland, where 
many airlines plan to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, each commercial airline would be allocated an annual 
pollution limit based on emissions from its planes and ground operations in 
1990. Starting in 2001, each airline's pollution would have to drop 4% to 9% 
per year. Airlines could choose their own techniques, such as converting 
baggage loaders and other ground service equipment to alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think in terms of transporting people and goods into and out of the Los 
Angeles area, we are already the most fuel efficient and cleanest form of 
transportation," said Chris Chiames of the Air Transport Assn. of America. 
"There is a limit technologically speaking how much we can achieve, and then 
you run into that wall of what is a safe operation of an airline." 
</P>
<P>
 Another potentially controversial proposal is a fee on commercial ships that 
dock in Los Angeles and Long Beach and another fee imposed on those passing 
within 20 miles of Ventura County's shoreline, which is the traditional route 
to Los Angeles. The size of the fee would be based on the amount of pollution 
each ship emits. Under a worst-case scenario, the fees could total about 
$16,000 each time a ship docks, the EPA says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a defeat for the auto industry, the EPA endorsed the state's automobile 
standards, including one requiring 2% of all cars sold in California beginning 
in 1998 to be powered by electric batteries or an equally exhaust-free source. 
</P>
<P>
 In a state proud of an air quality program often hailed as innovative and 
aggressive, the prospect of the federal government stepping in has been 
fearsome. But the EPA was apologetic on Tuesday about imposing the plan on 
California, and Marcus made it clear that local and state officials would 
remain in control of most anti-smog efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA had long preferred to leave air quality issues to California when 
environmentalists first sued the agency in 1984. The Coalition for Clean Air 
and the Sierra Club filed another lawsuit over the clean-air issues in 1988. 
The EPA lost in federal court and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected its bid for 
an appeal in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went all the way to the Supreme Court and lost, so this thing is real," 
Howekamp said. "We have to implement it." 
</P>
<P>
 To the relief of local leaders, federal officials issued a challenge Tuesday 
to California's political and business leaders to come up with their own plans 
that satisfy federal law. The three metropolitan areas are working on new 
clean-air plans due Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been clear we are not wedded to this," Marcus said. "It's our best 
shot, but if people come up with a better idea, we will take that and 
incorporate it. When people say don't do X, we'll say, OK, what should we do 
instead?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman called the offer "quite a wake-up call to Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an invitation to chart our own course or do what EPA says. They are 
inviting the region to take control of its own destiny and propose a better way 
to do it," he said.

COUNTY OKS DILUTED PENSION REFORM PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five hours of sometimes angry debate, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday approved a watered-down pension reform plan that allows 
most senior county officials to continue receiving unusually high retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a partial but disappointing victory for Supervisor Gloria Molina, 
who waged a two-year battle to rescind pension rules that boosted the 
retirement pay of senior county officials by 20% at a cost to taxpayers of more 
than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the board cast a 3-2 vote to curtail pension benefits for new 
hires and slow the growth of pension benefits for current employees. Those 
changes could ultimately save as much as $18 million a year, officials said. 
But the board refused to approve a key recommendation to freeze or at least 
reduce the current controversial level of pension benefits, which could have 
saved an additional $12 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pension spiking didn't end today," Molina said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Ed Edelman, who blocked some of Molina's efforts, said progress 
was made: "It sets in motion some important steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The current pension rules, adopted in 1991, dramatically increased retirement 
pay by counting the value of fringe benefits, such as health and life 
insurance, as compensation for the purposes of calculating retirement pay. 
Under the pension rules, some senior executives and elected officials can get 
more in retirement pay than they do on the job. For instance, Public Works 
chief Tom Tidemanson, who is planning to retire in March, will receive $193,000 
in annual pension pay -- or about $35,000 more than his current annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina and her ally, Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, voted against 
the proposal on new hires because it did not go far enough. They wanted the 
benefits for new management employees halted immediately. The motion carried by 
Edelman, Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana would put off that decision until an 
agreement is worked out with union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders for the most part had endorsed Molina's proposal and were 
willing to quickly negotiate a halt to extending the benefits for new hires. 
But when the package began to unravel under amendments by Edelman and 
Antonovich, labor officials said all bets were off, and they may refuse to open 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 That would essentially put off any savings from reforms until at least 1995, 
when contracts come up for renegotiation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina argued -- and Gilbert Cedillo, general manager of Service Employees 
International Union Local 660, agreed -- that some of the amendments offered by 
her colleagues would actually accentuate the pension problem by providing even 
more generous benefits for the most highly paid managers and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, Edelman's plan to freeze the percentage of fringe 
benefits that an employee can count as part of his compensation, rather than 
freezing the dollar amount, favors the highest-paid county officials. Fringe 
benefits for the rank and file are set by dollar amount, while benefits for top 
management are based on salary and would continue to grow with every pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edelman said that Molina's recommendation to freeze the dollar amount of 
fringe benefits counted toward pensions would be illegal. The competing 
proposals will be debated by the board again next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's proposal was based on the recommendations of the county's Citizens 
Economy and Efficiency Commission, which concluded that the current pension 
rules were overly generous and in need of an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Gunther W. Buerk said that overall he was pleased with the 
supervisors' actions but was disappointed that they did not go further and 
support Molina's bid to freeze the monetary amount of benefits, which was a key 
element of the commission's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Buerk said the pension controversy had been hanging 
over the county like a "black cloud that will only go away if you take action." 
After the meeting, Buerk said, "Well, the black clouds are at least moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission member Louise Frankel was more frank in her assessment: "They 
emasculated it." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina had hoped to build a minimum three-vote majority vote with Burke and 
Dana, who ran in a hotly contested reelection bid in 1992 saying he was 
"leading the fight against pension spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he did not support Molina on Tuesday, Dana, who was silent 
through much of the protracted debate, said "I like to have four votes" on 
important issues such as pensions. But Dana had no apparent problem being part 
of 3-2 votes that sent some of Molina's proposals to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dana was not on my side because he's not running anymore," Molina said after 
the marathon debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of pensions is complicated enough, but the supervisors' job of 
sorting through the issue was complicated by widely divergent figures on the 
potential savings of the proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission, which hired the pension 
consulting firm of W.F. Coroon to crunch its numbers, said the reforms could 
save $18 million to $30 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed calculated the figure at less 
than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Frankel told supervisors that the dollar amount was immaterial, 
that any savings are worth the effort. "Let's get on with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's decision four years ago to increase pensions of the highest-paid 
county employees and elected officials has been criticized in a string of 
investigations, studies and legislation, and by Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
state's largest taxpayers organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension rules, revealed by The Times two years ago, were adopted without a 
public vote of the supervisors or any study of their financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's pension decision immediately created a deficit in the employees' 
pension fund of about $267 million. That has grown to more than $400 million, 
after the rules were extended to include rank and file employees on a limited 
basis. The deficit has to be paid off by the county within 20 years.

<P>
 They are seemingly unreconcilable, these divergent images of David Joseph 
Fukuto; son of a respected jurist, he died flouting the law with ultimate 
contempt. 
</P>
<P>
 For most of his 32 years, he did nothing that might sully the name of a father 
who spent nearly two decades as a prosecutor before being named by then-Gov. 
Ronald Reagan to the South Bay Municipal Court bench. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of an elite honor society at Torrance's North High School, a 
teen-age David carved pumpkins with disadvantaged kids and helped decorate a 
float for the Tournament of Roses Parade. After spending four years as a 
top-flight student at El Camino Community College, he was accepted as a 
communications major at USC. He left in 1989 to work as an independent 
insurance broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he had been caring for his widowed grandmother at her 
turn-of-the-century home in the Mid-City area, a short distance from the 
Episcopal church that honored him for his good works Sunday with a festive 
dinner at the New Otani Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a good family, I can't believe it," said Van Nuys Superior Court 
Judge Marvin D. Rowen, who used to car-pool with state District Court of Appeal 
Justice Morio Fukuto during their days in the district attorney's office. "He 
never said anything but good things about his kids." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday -- the day after the church ceremony -- David Fukuto strapped on a 
fanny pack containing 30 to 40 pairs of flexible plastic handcuffs and burst 
into a 12th-floor meeting room at the Torrance Holiday Inn, where more than a 
dozen Palos Verdes Estates police officers were attending an all-day 
motivational seminar. With a pistol in each hand, officials say, Fukuto fatally 
shot two veteran supervisors from the tiny South Bay department before 
succumbing in the ensuing struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Fukuto was intent on robbing the officers who, along 
with several municipal officials from the upscale beachfront community, were 
dressed in civilian clothes. But on Tuesday, as his family grieved privately, 
few people seemed able to explain why he would attempt such a brazen mission or 
what troubled path could have led him to the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would characterize him as somewhat conservative, across the board -- 
politically, morally, theologically," said Mother Catherine Culliane, rector of 
St. Mary's Church, where Fukuto was among the younger members of the board. 
"It's just mystifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said weapons and ammunition were recovered from Fukuto's car and from 
the Oxford Street house where his grandmother lives -- among them a 
9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol, an Uzi carbine with 120 rounds of ammunition 
and a Colt .223-caliber assault rifle that is believed to be fully automatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Church leaders acknowledged that Fukuto often took target practice with fellow 
parishioners, some of whom had served in the military or with the police, but 
said they did not view it as anything suspicious. David was "a very creative 
soul," said Father John Yamazaki, pastor emeritus of St. Mary's, which has long 
been an anchor for Los Angeles' Japanese-American community and an integral 
part of life for the Fukuto family for nearly 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamazaki recalled how David Fukuto struggled each year to devise an innovative 
way for Santa Claus to make his appearance at their annual Christmas festival. 
The 80-year-old minister also remembered how Fukuto went searching for his 
grandmother after she wandered off to watch the looting during the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very careful of her," Yamazaki said. "He was very, very considerate 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 After returning home Monday night, Yamazaki said, he received a call from 
Fukuto's mother, Grace. "She said, 'Father, remember him in prayers.' Then she 
said, 'Could you pray for the two officers and their families?' She said, 'I'm 
so hurt for them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Fukuto's father released a short statement that read in part: "David 
committed a terrible and unforgivable crime in taking the lives of two fine 
officers without reason. We cannot explain his acts. We can only extend our 
deepest condolences to the officers' families and to the members of the Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Dept. Our prayers are with them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old jurist, who friends said was sent to a relocation camp during 
World War II, was one of the first Asian American prosecutors when he joined 
the district attorney's office in 1957. Widely considered a tough but fair 
judge, Justice Fukuto has been mentioned as a potential nominee for the state 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the most down-to-earth, decent people I've ever met," said 
Michael Yamamoto, a Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer, who has tried many 
cases in front of Fukuto. "This has really bummed me out, thinking about what 
this has done to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors on a tidy, tree-lined street in north Torrance, where the Fukutos 
lived for nearly 25 years before moving to a larger home a few miles away in 
1991, spoke admiringly of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, they said, could often be seen puttering in the garden outside his 
modest stucco home. One neighbor, who has lived on the street for 17 years, 
said she was surprised to learn Morio Fukuto was a judge -- especially after 
seeing him head to work in a battered old Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
 When young David had parties, neighbors said, they were orderly affairs. 
Often, the teen-age crowd headed home by 10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just seemed so average," said one neighbor, who like most on the block 
declined to give her name out of respect for the Fukuto family's privacy. "It's 
such a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 A short distance away, at North High School, from which David Fukuto graduated 
in 1979, Principal Timothy P. Scully pointed out that the former student had 
belonged to the Julians and Valiants Honor Society, an academic and community 
service group that requires a 3.0 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 In a school yearbook, there is a photo of Fukuto next to the kind of adage 
that is meant to capture the potential of a graduating class. "It's not the 
lofty sails," it reads, "but the unseen winds that move the ship."

N. KOREA AGREES TO INSPECTION OF 7 NUCLEAR SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS and JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea sidestepped the threat of impending U.N. economic sanctions 
Tuesday by agreeing, after months of delay, to allow international inspections 
of seven nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Atomic Energy Agency announced that the Pyongyang regime of 
President Kim Il Sung has accepted the agency's plans and conditions for 
inspecting the facilities. The inspections are expected to take place within a 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other issues remain unresolved, both the IAEA and the Clinton 
Administration portrayed the new agreement as an important step forward. 
Discussions will now move to inspections of two other disputed sites in North 
Korea, although with no imminent threat of sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came less than a week before a Feb. 21 deadline for compliance. 
If North Korea had not agreed to the inspections, IAEA Director General Hans 
Blix had been expected to tell the agency's board of governors that it was no 
longer possible to guarantee that North Korea was not diverting nuclear 
material for weapons in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a declaration could have led to economic sanctions against North Korea. 
The Clinton Administration recently began talks with other members of the U.N. 
Security Council about the possibility of such sanctions. North Korea, in turn, 
had warned that it would consider the imposition of economic sanctions an act 
of war. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea's willingness to submit to IAEA inspection temporarily defuses the 
controversy over its nuclear program but does not end it. The agreement covers 
only the seven nuclear installations that North Korea has formally acknowledged 
are on its soil. It does not apply to two undeclared sites where North Korea is 
suspected of having disposed of nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the new agreement, in fact, is to put the dispute over North 
Korea's nuclear program back where it was a year ago. In February, 1993, the 
IAEA asked to inspect the two undeclared nuclear sites. North Korea countered 
by threatening to withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty and then barring 
the IAEA from making routine inspections at the seven declared sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer and again two months ago, the Clinton Administration reached 
agreements with North Korea that U.S. officials believed would pave the way for 
the routine inspections. But on both occasions, North Korea subsequently raised 
new questions and obstacles that prevented the inspections from taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters Tuesday, 
"We welcome the agreement, and we look forward to the beginning of these 
inspections as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers called the agreement "a step in the 
right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, after negotiations in New York City, Clinton Administration 
officials thought they had concluded a groundbreaking deal with North Korea in 
which Pyongyang was supposed to allow inspections of its seven declared nuclear 
installations in exchange for a pledge that the United States and South Korea 
would give up their annual Team Spirit joint military exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this arrangement, the United States and North Korea would then move to a 
broader round of diplomatic negotiations in which the United States would offer 
such incentives as a normalization of relations and economic benefits in 
exchange for steps by North Korea to give up its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal between the United States and North Korea was made conditional on 
an agreement between the Pyongyang regime and the IAEA on the terms and 
conditions for inspections of the seven nuclear facilities. And North Korea 
quickly began trying to impose restrictions on the ability of the IAEA to make 
these inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that until Tuesday, the United States had had no meetings 
with North Korea since the December talks. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior State Department official denied that China, North Korea's powerful 
neighbor and longtime ally, had played any role as an intermediary in working 
out the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't say China was an intermediary," he said. "But we've constantly 
told them in recent meetings to weigh in (with North Korea). And we are 
confident that they have." 
</P>
<P>
 Another State Department official said that the IAEA had had a long list of 
things it wanted to do as part of its inspections of the seven North Korean 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (IAEA officials) got like 98% of what they wanted, which is pretty good 
for any negotiation," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he would not identify what kinds of inspection activities the IAEA had 
decided to forgo during its negotiations with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the negotiations, the IAEA was trying to avoid making any 
concessions to North Korea that could be used as a precedent by other potential 
nuclear powers, such as Iran. But U.S. officials acknowledged that the 
inspections the IAEA will now make in North Korea are not the same as the 
regular inspections it makes elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official said that because of the "special circumstances" 
in the North Korean case, the IAEA will make a new kind of inspection, not yet 
carried out in any other country, in which it will examine the North Korean 
facilities exclusively for the purpose of guaranteeing the continuity of the 
IAEA's traditional nuclear safeguards -- and not for looking at North Korea's 
past behavior.

DISNEY EXPLORING ASIA PARK SITES, CRUISE SHIP VENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though smarting from the miserable performance of its Euro Disney resort in 
France, the Walt Disney Co. may start its own cruise ship line and is looking 
for additional theme park sites in Asia, a top executive confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's interest in entering the cruise ship business comes about a month 
before its eight-year relationship with Florida-based Premier Cruise Lines Ltd. 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than window shopping," Peter Rummel, president of Disney 
Development Co., said in an interview. "We have spent some time trying to 
understand the (cruise) business." 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the Pacific Rim presents an "enormous business opportunity" for 
Disney, Rummel said in a memo last week to Disney executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel said Disney is ready to continue expanding internationally despite the 
severe problems at its Euro Disney resort outside Paris, which lost more than 
$900 million in the last fiscal year. Disney has threatened to abandon the 
project -- it owns 49% of Euro Disney's parent company -- if lenders won't 
refinance its construction loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The plans are further evidence that the Burbank-based company is actively 
looking for fresh opportunities that exploit its strengths in family 
entertainment. They come on the heels of an announcement that Disney will 
renovate a theater on New York's 42nd Street for stage productions and in the 
midst of the first season of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, an NHL hockey team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Logsden, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, 
called the company's long-range planning on Asia commendable, though he cast 
doubt on Disney's cruise ship efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of developing a cruise business, he said, profit margins would be 
higher if Disney could entice more people to stay at hotels in its theme parks, 
where they are continually shelling out money for food, tickets and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, Disney already has its name on the popular Tokyo Disneyland, which is 
owned by Oriental Land Co. The relationship remains close enough that Disney 
Chairman Michael Eisner announced plans two years ago to develop a new Disney 
ocean-oriented theme park in Tokyo in tandem with Oriental Land. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel said any additional Asian sites would be developed without interfering 
with the Japanese property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we are going to do is step on our own toes," said Rummel, who 
also heads Disney Design & Development, an umbrella organization that covers 
his division and Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, the company's creative 
and engineering arm for theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel has promoted Senior Vice President Ken Wong to lead the effort to find 
Asian sites. Wong is also the executive in charge of the proposed $3-billion 
Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. Rummel stressed, however, that putting Wong in 
charge of both projects should not suggest any loss of interest in the Anaheim 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Theme park industry observers were mixed about Disney's chances of developing 
Asian sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Benedick, senior vice president of the theme park consulting firm 
Management Resources in Tustin, said Asia is "a relatively untapped market." 
</P>
<P>
 Benedick, himself a former Disneyland executive, added: "I think there are 
opportunities for well-developed, quality resorts in Asian countries. A lot of 
individuals in those countries are considering the same types of investments." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the countries ripe for theme park and resort projects, Benedick said, 
are China, Singapore, Taiwan and Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Spiegel, a consultant based in Cincinnati, who manages theme parks 
in China and Singapore, said, "it would be really difficult for them to go 
deeper into Asia" now because there are so many established attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to cruise ships, however, Disney could quickly become a major 
player in the family market. For years, it has allied its name with the "Big 
Red Boats" of Premier, a three-ship outfit based in Cape Canaveral that 
specifically promotes family cruises with Disney-costumed characters aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms recently announced that the arrangement would end March 31 "by 
mutual agreement." Since then, Disney has been talking about an alliance with 
another major cruise ship line. 
</P>
<P>
 But Premier Senior Vice President Gary Sain said he expects Disney will find 
no takers because of the high price it demands under the cooperative marketing 
agreement, which he said was "several million dollars" to his company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe they have come to crossroads where they may feel it is better to do 
it themselves," Sain said. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Premier co-founder and president who is now chairman of American 
Family Cruises in Miami, Bruce Nierenberg, said Disney is "definitely" going to 
enter the cruise ship business. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be great at promoting the concept of family cruises," Nierenberg 
said. "It's an enormous market. There will be plenty of room." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Oivind Mathisen editor of Cruise Industry News, a trade publication 
based in New York: "It is known that Disney executives have been visiting 
European shipyards."

O.C. JET CRASH PROMPTS WAKE TURBULENCE PLAN; AVIATION: FEDERAL SAFETY BOARD 
URGES LENGTHENED LANDING DISTANCES BETWEEN PLANES, NEW WEIGHT CLASSES FOR 
CRAFT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER and JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday approved a detailed set of 
recommendations designed to prevent airplane accidents caused by wake 
turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners -- the presumed culprit in a Dec. 15 crash 
in Santa Ana that claimed five lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action sent a strong message to the Federal Aviation 
Administration that the minimum distances between landing airplanes should be 
lengthened and that its 20-year-old weight-classification system for larger 
aircraft be overhauled to reflect a new generation of commercial jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also urged that air-traffic controllers provide more detailed 
information to pilots about wake turbulence and that training manuals be 
updated to emphasize the dangers of such airborne encounters -- particularly 
when the trailing plane is smaller and more vulnerable to the miniature 
cyclones produced by rapid air movement across the larger aircraft's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB records show that 51 instances of wake turbulence have occurred over the 
last decade, killing 27 people and damaging or destroying 40 airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at an airport, the 
FAA has been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and 
trailing aircraft. But only a week after the crash of the corporate jet in 
Santa Ana two months ago, FAA Administrator David Hinson issued a directive 
requiring air-traffic controllers nationwide to warn pilots of the turbulence 
caused by 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board's action on Tuesday, though not binding on the FAA, is 
expected to put more pressure on federal regulators to adopt the preventive 
procedures adopted unanimously by the board's five commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Paul Steucke said the agency would review the NTSB 
recommendations "immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware of the problem and we're taking measures to make sure there is 
not another occurrence," Steucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatal accident in Santa Ana occurred when a twin-engine corporate jet was 
on a landing approach to John Wayne Airport. The jet, which was about two miles 
behind a Boeing 757, went out of control and slammed nose first into the ground 
near the Santa Ana Auto Mall. All five aboard, including the top two executives 
of the In-N-Out Burger chain, were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other incidents attributed to 757 turbulence have occurred in the past 14 
months, including a Dec. 18, 1992, crash in Billings, Mont., that killed eight 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the long list of safety recommendations, NTSB commissioners did not 
cite any particular flaw in the 757's design. The heart of the problem, they 
said, was revising the FAA's plane-classification system to ensure the proper 
separation between airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some unique characteristics of the 757," said Commissioner John. 
K. Lauber, " . . . but it is clear that the fundamental problem goes back to 
the outdated weight-categorization scheme that needs to be fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 The board found that "inadequacies in the current airplane weight 
classification scheme . . . air control procedures . . . and pilot knowledge . 
. . of wake vortices were more important factors in the five recent accidents 
investigated by the Safety Board than any specific characteristic of the B-757 
wake vortex." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present system, the 757 is considered a "large" aircraft, but 
industry experts have previously urged the FAA to reclassify it as a "heavy" 
aircraft and require most smaller planes to stay five miles back on final 
approach, as opposed to the three miles they are supposed to adhere to now. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board on Tuesday took action on both fronts. It recommended that 
the separation distances be lengthened for smaller planes trailing 757s -- even 
for jetliners such as Boeing 737s, MD-80s and DC-9s. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also urged that the three-tiered U.S. airplane weight-classification 
system be revised to narrow the weight ranges in some categories. Under present 
U.S. rules, the 757 is the heaviest aircraft in the middle-weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it didn't specifically say so, the board seemed to be leaning toward 
a version of the British system that divides aircraft into four weight 
categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Murray, a veteran airline pilot who regularly flies 757s, said he 
believes the FAA should adopt the NTSB guidelines -- at least until turbulence 
testing on the 757 is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can relax the separation standards later, fine," Murray said. "But 
for now, safety should come first." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board also recommended that 757s and other large aircraft conduct 
landings on a more standard flight path angle. The board's study of wake 
turbulence showed that trailing airplanes are in more danger of being thrown 
out of control when they fall below the larger plane's descending flight path. 
</P>
<P>
 Because 757s and other newer jets can slow down quicker than older jetliners, 
trailing aircraft can inadvertently close in too quickly and wind up in this 
danger zone. NTSB staff members made it clear that maintaining a higher 
relative position to larger landing aircraft was the key preventive factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flight path is (the) critical factor), but maintaining proper distance is 
the best solution," said John Clark, an aircraft performance specialist for the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners also recommended: 
</P>
<P>
 * Certain air-control procedures be amended to give pilots more information 
about the planes landing in front of them, especially if the leading plane is a 
757 or "heavy" aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wake-turbulence warnings be issued more frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Training of pilots and air controllers include more detailed study of 
wake-turbulence dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Manufacturers be required to determine the wake vortex characteristics 
during aircraft certification procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 During discussion of the wake-turbulence issue, several new facts emerged 
about the Santa Ana crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The 757 was at 5,000 feet, Clark said, and had to make a sharply banked turn 
to the right in order to make its approach to John Wayne Airport. The Westwind 
corporate jet was at 4,000 feet and was heading straight in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westwind jet was traveling faster than the 757, but the smaller craft's 
pilot intended to stay safely above the larger craft, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The geometry of the flight paths, rather than the speed difference" was the 
critical factor, said Clark. Because landing clearances were issued to both 
planes in a short space of time, "the primary effect was to lose separation," 
Clark said. Instead of staying far enough behind, the smaller jet was actually 
closing on the 757, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests have indicated that the 757's sleek wing design makes it capable of 
producing wake turbulence more powerful than that caused by aircraft four times 
its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB's recommendations "all make sense to me," said William Reynard, head 
of the nation's Aviation Safety Reporting System, which noted an increase in 
757 turbulence-related incidents in January, 1993, and, shortly thereafter, 
alerted the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of looking at incidents in order to prevent accidents is very 
valuable," he said. "You don't have to have an accident first." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was one of the first to bring the 757 
turbulence problem to the FAA's attention in 1991, applauded the NTSB 
recommendations -- some of which were identical to ones he and co-researcher 
Kirk Clawson submitted to the FAA in a formal report three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at times don't listen unless you have a Ph.D," said Garodz, an 
ex-fighter pilot who worked in the FAA's wake turbulence department for 20 
years. "It's frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this is great. I agree with all of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the NTSB is right," said Christopher Fotos, editor of Avmark, a 
Washington-based airline industry newsletter, "this is a very serious problem. 
The FAA may have a hard time . . . dismissing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB commissioners took nearly three hours to pore over the staff report 
and fine-tune its recommendations. One recommendation was eliminated 
altogether, and the board, at one point, was inclined to meld several technical 
points into a more general recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 But staff members worried that the FAA would not respond as vigorously to the 
broader language. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Lauber agreed. "We could receive the classic bureaucratic 
response: 'We already have the proper rules, if they were just followed we 
wouldn't have accidents.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Aviation officials in Canada and the United Kingdom have already implemented 
similar recommendations on the 757.

VEXED BY TAILHOOK ISSUE, KELSO TO QUIT NAVY EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he no longer wanted to be a "lightning rod" for the Tailhook scandal, 
Chief of Naval Operations Frank B. Kelso II abruptly announced his early 
retirement Tuesday as the nation's top uniformed Navy officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Kelso, newly accused of witnessing lewd behavior at the 1991 Tailhook 
Assn. convention in Las Vegas and of lying about his knowledge of the 
misconduct, said he moved up his departure only after his Pentagon superiors 
agreed to issue formal statements attesting to his honesty and integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso, who began his career as a U.S. Naval Academy midshipman more than four 
decades ago, had planned to retire in June. 
</P>
<P>
 But his announcement Tuesday was the culmination of a chain of events that 
began last week when a Navy judge in Norfolk, Va., ruled that Kelso had covered 
up his knowledge of the Tailhook debauchery. Over the weekend he struck the 
agreement with top Pentagon officials that led to the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years after the Tailhook incident, not one Navy or Marine Corps 
member has been ordered to a court-martial, even though the Defense 
Department's inspector general identified at least 90 victims of indecent 
assault and referred 140 Navy and Marine Corps officers for criminal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've clearly become the lightning rod for Tailhook," said Kelso, 60. "I'm the 
senior naval officer that attended Tailhook or had anything to do with it. So 
when the issue of Tailhook comes up, it strikes me. It won't go away. The 
lightning keeps striking all the time. So I think it's best for the Navy to get 
a new leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso fixed his departure date at April 30, but Pentagon sources said they 
expect his successor will be nominated by President Clinton and confirmed by 
the Senate before then. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources added that the strongest candidate to be the new Navy chief of 
operations is Adm. Jeremy Michael Boorda, NATO's southern region commander who 
would oversee any air strikes in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another strong candidate is Adm. Charles Larson, commander-in-chief of the 
Pacific Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Kelso said he hoped his early retirement would "put an end to 
Tailhook," it appears likely that his successor also will be confronted with 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief whistle-blower on Tailhook, Lt. Paula A. Coughlin, has filed a 
federal lawsuit against the Tailhook Assn. and the Hilton hotel and casino, 
where the convention was held. The case is scheduled for trial in Las Vegas 
next month. It will represent the only public adjudication of the Tailhook 
scandal, in which dozens of women have said they were assaulted by drunken Navy 
and Marine airmen. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelso maintained that under his leadership, the Navy has made significant 
improvements in opening up more job opportunities for women and in altering the 
male-dominated culture that has resulted in allegations of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great lesson learned from Tailhook is that we have to be more attentive 
to our house so we can prevent something like Tailhook from happening," he 
said. "We need to work harder to be able to understand the changes that are 
taking place around us. 
</P>
<P>
 "A problem like this is a social problem that has lasted a long time," he 
added. "I think we've stepped up to address the problems that caused Tailhook. 
. . . We put into place the training. We put into place procedures to make it 
clear to people that if they act that way, they're not going to be in this 
man's Navy." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the inspector general found that although Kelso attended the 
Tailhook convention, he had not been aware of the incidents taking place in a 
hotel hallway. According to the report, women were groped and manhandled, some 
women were stripped of their clothing, and others were assaulted when they were 
forced to walk through a gantlet of drunken servicemen. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, Capt. William Vest, a Navy judge in Norfolk, dismissed the last 
three pending Navy cases, ruling that Kelso should not have referred the cases 
for criminal adjudication because he had failed to report some of the 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Vest further ruled that Kelso "manipulated" the investigative and disciplinary 
process in the scandal "in a manner designed to shield his personal involvement 
in Tailhook '91." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso attempted to blunt Vest's conclusions by releasing documents from the 
inspector general's office reiterating its conclusion that Kelso had not seen 
the activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I categorically deny the findings about my honesty and integrity," he said of 
Vest's ruling. "He had to do his job and he did his job. But what I've said is 
I don't agree with his conclusions about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend and on Monday, Kelso met at the Pentagon with Defense 
Secretary William J. Perry and Navy Secretary John H. Dalton. They discussed 
several alternatives Kelso could pursue to defend himself in light of Vest's 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those options, sources said, would have been for Kelso to plead his case 
before a military Court of Inquiry. But the sources said Kelso chose not to 
pursue that course because it would involve a formal, public hearing that would 
bring more negative attention to the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the sources said, Kelso asked for and received from Perry and Dalton 
statements attesting to his good character -- a scenario that the four-star 
admiral believed would help him save face if he stepped down early. 
</P>
<P>
 The written statements were released at the Pentagon before Kelso announced 
his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regard Adm. Kelso as a man of the highest integrity and honor," Perry said 
in his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "With respect to the underlying causes of the events of Tailhook '91, he 
understood the importance of addressing this issue and taking all necessary 
measures to permit the Navy to move on to a new era." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalton's statement said: "Although I have questioned the leadership which 
permitted the excesses of Tailhook to take place, I have never questioned the 
personal integrity and honor of Frank Kelso." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelso insisted that "my retirement was not requested from anyone," a position 
supported by Pentagon sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never, 'I'll retire if you do something for me,' " said one senior 
defense official. "It was, 'How can we clear your name and how can I get my 
name cleared?' "

CLINTON QUALIFIES HIS SUPPORT OF 3-STRIKES EFFORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton called on Congress Tuesday to trim back the so-called 
three-strikes-and-you're-out provisions of its pending crime bill, saying that 
life imprisonment for repeat offenders should be reserved for those whose 
crimes "threaten other people's lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking here at an event that closely resembled a George Bush rally during 
the 1988 presidential campaign -- complete with the Pledge of Allegiance and a 
tableau of more than 100 uniformed officers posed behind him -- Clinton 
outlined the provisions he hopes will be included in the crime bill now being 
fashioned in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the elements he listed have become standard Clinton fare: more money 
to help local jurisdictions hire 100,000 new police officers and improve 
security at schools; boot camps for nonviolent offenders that would clear more 
prison space for violent criminals; more prison space overall, and a ban on 
certain types of assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 And as he has done before, Clinton endorsed a federal death sentence for 
killers of police officers and reminded his audience that as Arkansas governor 
he oversaw several executions. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the calls for more prisons and longer sentences, he also issued a 
carefully worded but unmistakable call for Congress to rethink some of the 
provisions approved by the Senate last fall in its version of the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he supported the three-strikes concept, which would permit courts 
to impose life sentences for certain repeat offenders. But, he added: "We 
shouldn't litter it up with every offense in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Congress should focus on identifying and punishing "the very 
small percentage of the total criminal population" who commit a 
disproportionate share of the nation's violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks, delivered at a police training academy situated next to a 
5,000-inmate prison in this small central Ohio town, were his first 
acknowledgment of what his aides had been saying privately: that he should 
scale back the unqualified endorsement he gave the three-strikes proposal 
during last month's State of the Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's speech also provided his first public response to complaints from 
some congressional leaders and others that he has done too little to restrain 
Congress' impulse to react to the mounting fear of crime nationwide by passing 
laws that have not been thought out carefully enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, including Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
(D-Del.), have focused on provisions that would transfer large numbers of 
crimes from state to federal jurisdiction and on the three-strikes proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill passed by the Senate last fall contains two separate 
three-strikes provisions. Either one would permit the courts to impose life 
sentences for criminals convicted a third time of certain kinds of felonies. In 
both cases, the crimes that would qualify are considerably less severe than 
those usually considered dangerously violent. One, for example, would be a 
purse-snatching in which a victim was knocked to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The House has not yet passed a three-strikes bill, although it may do so next 
month, perhaps as part of a larger crime package. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's cautious language on the bill, coupled with the imagery of a stage 
filled with uniforms and the references to the death penalty, illustrated the 
delicate political balance he must strike on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to the consternation of Republican strategists, Clinton has taken on the 
tough-on-crime mantel that traditionally has been worn by the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, he has struggled to keep the debate from swinging 
so far to the right that it would deepen the divisions between him and some of 
his constituencies, particularly blacks and liberals, many of whom believe that 
some provisions in the Senate bill are too punitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's speech was designed, in part, to address that problem and to give 
the President an opportunity to tell Congress what he hopes to see in the bill 
it finally passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also used the opportunity to mend relations with Biden, taking 
the senator with him on Air Force One and publicly praising his leadership on 
crime issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been hoping for quick passage of a crime bill designed to his 
liking that would provide some momentum for the Administration as it enters 
what is certain to be an arduous spring- and summer-long debate over his health 
care proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive for quick passage of the bill, however, has been complicated by 
resistance in the House, where some liberals and members of the Congressional 
Black Caucus oppose key parts of the Senate bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has tried to prod the House leadership into acting quickly on the bill 
but has been wary of pushing too hard and offending congressional 
sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech Tuesday, he seemed about to issue a deadline for Congress but 
stopped short. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people have waited on this bill long enough," he said. "This 
bill needs to be passed, on my desk for signature -- soon." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing a showcase for his anti-crime proposals, the trip 
here also gave Clinton an opportunity to obtain favorable publicity in a state 
that was key to his 1992 election and remains key to his reelection hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 On arrival in Columbus, Clinton greeted the family of a policeman recently 
killed while on duty. He later visited a German delicatessen in Columbus.

TAILHOOK WOES FORCE KELSO TO QUIT NAVY EARLY

 Saying he no longer wanted to be a "lightning rod" for the Tailhook scandal, 
Chief of Naval Operations Frank B. Kelso II abruptly announced his early 
retirement Tuesday as the nation's top uniformed Navy officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Kelso, newly accused of witnessing lewd behavior at the 1991 Tailhook

member has been ordered to a court-martial, even though the Defense 
Department's inspector general identified at least 90 victims of indecent 
assault and referred 140 Navy and Marine Corps officers for criminal 
investigation. At least nine of the 20 Marines under suspicion had been 
stationed at El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine-related charges stemmed from activities in the infamous "Rhino 
Room," a hospitality suite at the Hilton Hotel hosted by former members of an 
El Toro reconnaissance squadron. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon investigators alleged that some Marines forced or tried to force five 
women to drink an alcoholic concoction from a penis-shaped dispenser attached 
to a 5-by-8-foot mural of a bull rhinoceros. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most celebrated Marine case, assault charges were dismissed for lack of 
evidence against Capt. Gregory J. Bonam, a fighter pilot who was accused of 
groping Lt. Paula A. Coughlin, whose complaints initiated the Tailhook 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've clearly become the lightning rod for Tailhook," said Kelso, 60. "I'm the 
senior naval officer that attended Tailhook or had anything to do with it. So 
when the issue of Tailhook comes up, it strikes me. It won't go away. The

HOPSCOTCH PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION IS FOUND; AFTERMATH: QUAKE CAUSES $1 BILLION 
IN DAMAGE TO VALLEY STRUCTURES. SOME AREAS ARE RELATIVELY UNSCATHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake created a hopscotch pattern of destruction, 
hammering neighborhoods as far away as Sherman Oaks but sparing densely packed 
rows of apartment buildings much closer to the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the quake caused more than $1 billion in structural damage to the 
San Fernando Valley, half of the estimated total citywide. About 5,300 Valley 
structures were damaged, including 3,600 single-family homes, 285 condominium 
buildings, 842 apartment buildings and about 570 non-residential structures, 
according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 But some communities fared much better than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage estimates in adjacent ZIP codes vary dramatically throughout the 
Valley, according to a Times computer analysis of Los Angeles Department of 
Building and Safety lists of structures rendered unsafe, or safe only for 
limited use. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the damage was greater in some neighborhoods miles farther from the 
epicenter is the big question facing scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those questions will be answered, but you must be patient," said Mihailo 
Trifunac, a USC professor of civil engineering. "Obviously, the damage was 
where the motion was severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Building construction, soils, geography -- even luck -- may account for wide 
differences in damage suffered by Valley neighborhoods during the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Trifunac said there may also be some discrepancies in the damage estimates 
because of differences in judgment among city inspectors. Many were hired 
temporarily from municipalities across the country to help tally the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, scientists say it may take months or years to understand why the 
6.8-magnitude earthquake caused at least $160 million in damage to Sherman 
Oaks, but only a tenth as much to high-density neighborhoods east of the San 
Diego Freeway and much closer to the earthquake's epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The communities of North Hills, Panorama City, Arleta and Van Nuys -- 
identified by ZIP codes 91343, 91402, 91405, 91411 and 91401 -- were not even 
among the 20 hardest hit in the Valley, although the areas are much closer to 
the quake's epicenter than Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 With few exceptions, the neighborhoods north of Magnolia Boulevard and east of 
the San Diego Freeway were spared the worst damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, the most destruction was in Northridge, where building inspectors 
have so far estimated a total repair cost of $163 million to homes and 
businesses in the 91324 and 91325 ZIP codes. 
</P>
<P>
 At least $150 million more will be needed to fix buildings on the Cal State 
Northridge campus, bringing the Northridge damage total to more than $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But less than two miles east of CSUN, in the North Hills ZIP code of 91343, 
damage is estimated to be under $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 About three miles north of CSUN, however, in the Granada Hills ZIP code of 
91344, damage has been estimated to be more than $70 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas L. Henyey, a geology professor at USC's Southern California Earthquake 
Center, said one reason the quake may have caused such havoc in Sherman Oaks is 
because of proximity to the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 The amplification effect of thinning sediments may be to blame, he said. The 
closer to the mountains, the thinner the underlying sediment, causing the force 
of the earthquake to become more focused, he said. The result, usually, is more 
shaking on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henyey said more information is needed to explain the pattern of 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "A whole variety of factors cause the ground to shake differently; the force 
doesn't radiate evenly," he said. "As the waves travel through the earth, it is 
like a hall of mirrors and lenses, where forces can be focused and defocused, 
amplified in certain places." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage in the 91367 ZIP code of Woodland Hills is estimated to approach $30 
million. But south of Ventura Boulevard in the same area, in neighboring ZIP 
code 91364, city inspectors estimate about $10 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino neighborhoods in the 91436 and 91316 ZIP codes escaped, in comparison 
to Sherman Oaks, with only $6 million in damage. But Tarzana's 91356, just 
west, sustained an estimated $13 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hard hit was the Chatsworth ZIP code of 91311, the high-tech industrial 
center of the Valley, with nearly $50 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many research and development firms there are fleeing to 
available space in eastern Ventura County, said Jeffrey M. Woolf, vice 
president of Beitler commercial realty services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I predict that most would come back, but some won't," Woolf said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Keim, principal inspector for the Department of Building and Safety, 
said that for all the damage to buildings -- totaling about 61,000 structures 
-- only half a dozen or so buildings have been ordered demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 But about 11,000 structures citywide have sustained enough damage to warrant 
immediate repair, city records show. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9,000 of those are posted with yellow notices, which allow limited use, 
and 2,000 have red notices, which means that they are unsafe to enter. 
Commercial buildings account for 1,000 of the yellow-tagged buildings and about 
500 of the red, Keim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases, even red-tagged buildings are, in fact, repairable," Keim 
said. "The variable will be cost. Owners have to decide whether it is worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has issued 26 permits to rebuild, 848 to repair and 28 to

POVERTY, FEAR ABIDE IN AREA OF RECENT MEXICAN UPRISING; SOCIETY: TOURISTS VISIT 
CHIAPAS STATE FOR ITS QUAINT TRADITIONS. PEASANT REVOLTS ARE THE DARK SIDE OF 
ITS HISTORY.

 Wisps of incense drift up the pine-covered mountains toward the fog from a 
dozen street-corner braziers, fanned by men in black tunics and women wrapped 
in red wool shawls against the morning chill. 
</P>
<P>
 Gathered near small bands of violins, flutes and drums, they sway and chant in 
a modern Mayan dialect as they pass around a bottle of posh , the local 
moonshine. They are warming up for a pilgrimage through the town's dirt streets 
to bless each house on the first day of Carnaval, a two-week celebration that 
roughly coincides with Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
 At the main square, town elders wearing straw hats with multicolored ribbons 
radiating from the peak and waist-length chains dangling silver-dollar-size 
peso coins look on approvingly as the first group of pilgrims forms in front of 
the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Such beauty and ritual draw 132,000 tourists a year to Chiapas, Mexico's 
southernmost state. But those quaint traditions are intertwined with a culture 
of alcoholism, isolation and terror that has rendered entire villages immune to 
government anti-poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chiapas has been the largest recipient of funds from such programs, 
nearly one-third of the state's 3.2 million inhabitants still do not have 
access to health care. Fifteen thousand die of curable diseases each year. A 
quarter of the mainly Indian population has no formal income, and one in six 
adults cannot read. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperation resulting from unremitting poverty led to a New Year's Day 
uprising that left more than 100 dead before a government truce a month ago set 
the stage for peace talks. Still, the violence of both the revolt and the 
Mexican army's initial response briefly focused international attention on 
conditions in the Chiapas countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 For people living here, the rebellion was another episode in a history of 
terror that usually passes unnoticed by the outside world. Chiapan Indians have 
revolted at regular intervals since the 16th Century, when the Spaniards 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Between uprisings, the climate of violence is maintained by kidnapings, 
murders, torture and expulsions from communities. Acts of violence are so 
common that twice a year the Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human Rights Center in 
San Cristobal de las Casas fills a 60-page newsletter with new cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violation of civil rights is an evil endemic to our state, and violence has 
become epidemic," the newsletter's editors noted a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the violence is random, the outcome of an explosive mix of machetes 
and posh. Just as often, the human rights center reports, the violence is used 
to maintain Chiapas' feudal power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's fiefdoms are roughly divided among coffee plantation owners on the 
Pacific Coast, Indian chiefs or caciques in the highlands and cattle ranchers 
in the state's denuded eastern jungle, although areas of influence overlap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good business, the real fortunes have been made getting Indians drunk and 
sending them for generations to work on the ranches in the mountains or the 
plantations of the Soconusco," the state's premier coffee-growing region, 
anthropologist Fernando Benitez wrote 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably little has changed since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "Power in Chiapas historically has been exercised by families and landholding 
groups with (government) authorities on their side, who have continually 
frustrated the people's efforts to reach slightly less unjust living standards 
and dignity," according to a report from the human rights center, which is 
associated with the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Paved highways that wind through the mountains between Mayan ruins and 
colonial towns provide only a glimpse of the Chiapas that rose in revolt last 
month. Barefoot women in embroidered blouses and calf-length wrapped skirts 
trot along the roadside, stooped under bundles of firewood held by head straps. 
</P>
<P>
 They sometimes smile and wave at passing cars but reply with only a puzzled, 
impatient look when asked a question in Spanish. Even if they understand, they 
are too busy for idle chatter. Like millions of impoverished women throughout 
Africa, Asia and Latin America, they spend three to four hours every day 
searching for and hauling firewood and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors who want to see more of Indian culture can board the air-conditioned 
buses that whisk tourists from the town square in colonial San Cristobal to 
Carnaval and Holy Week ceremonies in nearby towns, particularly San Juan 
Chamula. 
</P>
<P>
 At City Hall, visitors can buy admission tickets to the brightly painted 
colonial church, its floor covered in pine needles, where Indians kneel before 
rows of tapered candles to toast their favorite saints with posh. For an 
additional fee, outsiders may take pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour buses usually leave before many Indians pass out on the town's 
streets and plazas from the ritual posh . They do not stop at La Hormiga -- the 
Ant -- an eroding hill outside San Cristobal where 20,000 people are clustered. 
The people living there are Indian peasants who over the last two decades have 
been driven out of San Juan Chamula for choosing Protestant or standard Roman 
Catholic religious practices over the blended faith of posh and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Each new expulsion brings stories of beatings and household burnings. But 
community leaders say religious converts endanger their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Tenejapa, local authorities are more tolerant of religious diversity, 
although residents and human rights organizations say that challenges to 
political power are repressed violently. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Sunday and Wednesday night, services are held at the hot-pink 
Presbyterian church at the edge of the county seat. Many residents are 
mestizos, people of mixed blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mestizos here are settled in; they were born here," said Sebastian Lopez 
Luna, a high-ranking township official. "They participate in community 
activities and speak our language. There is no problem about them." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that mestizos are not allowed to hold political office. 
"Municipal positions are linked to traditional Indian offices," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lopez Luna considered that a logical explanation, mestizos gathered at 
the local dry goods store said they are angry at being locked out of local 
decision-making. The emphasis on drinking at town celebrations -- which left 
many celebrants passed out hours before the Carnaval house blessing started at 
2 p.m. -- leads to an aggressive atmosphere that makes them feel like prisoners 
in their own homes, afraid to go out, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 They added that their complaints are answered by a Mayan version of "love it 
or leave it." 
</P>
<P>
 Indians with a gripe do not fare much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Kotolte, a village of about 200 people, 10 miles up a rocky dirt 
lane from the county seat, joined protests against alleged election fraud when 
Sebastian Lopez Mendez, the local Pepsi bottler, became mayor two years ago. 
Lopez Mendez ran as the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party that 
has ruled Mexico for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said Lopez Mendez was out of town visiting villages, and Lopez 
Luna denied that city government officials were involved in any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses, however, told human rights center representatives that the day 
after Lopez Mendez took office, his supporters began visiting outlying 
villages, rounding up people and sacking stores and houses. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kotolte, they stole more than 100 sacks of coffee, according to the human 
rights center report. Sitting on low chairs in the shade of coffee bushes, 
villagers recounted the confrontation two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "That first time, we fled to the mountains," recalled Alonso Lopez Guzman. 
"They took our coffee and trampled our corn. Then we decided to organize 
ourselves to fight back. Why should we let them rob us? Better we should wait 
for them in our houses." 
</P>
<P>
 When four truckloads of men rumbled into Kotolte one July morning, villagers 
were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our machetes, and the women grabbed sticks," said Lopez Guzman, 
flailing his arms in a re-enactment. "We did not let them in." 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, the men were back -- with guns. Dozens of villagers were 
injured in the resulting battle. 
</P>
<P>
 State authorities visited the village a month later to negotiate a peace 
agreement signed by townspeople and municipal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Such stories are repeated throughout the township, said Diego Mendez Santis, a 
former city official who does not like the way municipal government is being 
run. "There has been no peace, and without peace there can be no advancement," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenejapa's problems are typical in Indian communities, according to human 
rights center reports. Pro-government peasant groups regularly expel members of 
independent organizations from their villages. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal authorities routinely send the township police to arrest and beat up 
their enemies, reports say. People protest by occupying city halls and town 
plazas, but dissidents disappear when they speak out too often. 
</P>
<P>
 While Indian communities have been fighting for basic rights, other groups 
have taken advantage of the federal funds channeled to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, the adults at the Ejido Campet semi-communal farm were day 
laborers at Jorge Castellano Rivera's cattle and coffee ranch. Most of them, 
like 53-year-old Maria Cristina Cruz, were born on the ranch, whose owner is a 
member of the Chiapas ranching oligarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of us used to have a trade, grinding coffee or whatever," she said. "Now 
we are free." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz spoke as she spread cornmeal over a banana leaf and passed it along to 
her sister, who filled it with meat and sauce as part of a six-woman assembly 
line making tamales for that night's festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Indian communities that have struggled for decades to get land, the 43 
families of Campet got their 1,500-acre farm without a fight. When Castellano 
Rivera decided to sell off some of his land, he helped persuade the government 
to buy it, creating an ejido , land owned by the government but assigned to a 
group of farmers and their descendants as long as they work it. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seemed to know why he decided to sell or how much was paid for the land 
that lies two miles from the dirt road that connects Ocosingo and Altamirano, 
now on the edge of rebel territory. (On a recent visit, Castellano Rivera's 
house appeared to be deserted; many area ranchers have moved into town since 
the uprising.) 
</P>
<P>
 Within two years, Campet had electricity and a cistern with hoses running to 
spigots throughout the town, conveniences beyond the dreams of many Indian 
villages. The primary school has four teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses are modest, made of wood planks with thatched roofs and dirt floors. 
Villagers have obviously put their money into livestock, the peasants' way of 
saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle graze around the combination plaza and basketball court, a typical 
feature of Chiapas villages. With the help of a government anti-poverty 
program, townsfolk started a commercial pigsty last year, with 50 sows. 
</P>
<P>
 Their next project is to improve the rock-strewn lane that runs from the main 
dirt road to their village, he said. Villager Javier Lopez shrugged when asked 
to explain Campet's prosperity in the midst of so much poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get loans, we pay them back," he said. "We all work together. Just as 
the rich have, we are going to have." 
</P>
<P>
 But that vision is rare in Chiapas. For most people, the struggle remains more 
basic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired of hearing about politics and parties," said Kotolte resident 
Alonso Lopez Mendez. "I have done no harm to anyone. I am just a peasant. If we 
are all children of God, why can't they leave me alone?"

JUSTICES SKEPTICAL OF ATTEMPT TO LIMIT SELF-DEFENSE CLAIMS; LAW: SEVERAL 
CHALLENGE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONTENTION THAT LAWMAKERS AND VOTERS ABOLISHED 
CERTAIN DOCTRINES WHEN THEY CHANGED REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVING MURDER. CASE 
INVOLVES A DANA POINT YOUTH WHO KILLED OUT OF HONEST BUT UNREASONABLE FEAR OF 
IMMEDIATE HARM.

<P>
 The California Supreme Court, hearing an Orange County case, seemed skeptical 
Monday of an attempt to prevent defendants from escaping murder convictions 
when they kill out of an honest but mistaken conviction that their lives are in 
danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "imperfect self-defense" doctrine is a powerful tool for defense 
attorneys. Used typically by battered wives, the defense helped produce hung 
juries in the recent murder trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case before the court, a Dana Point teen-ager killed a reputed member 
of a "skinhead" gang who had threatened and harassed him for about a year 
before the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Steffens, then 16, the defendant, shot and killed Robert Elliott, a 
schoolmate, on Sept. 8, 1990, after Elliott chased him on the beach, 
threatening "to get" him for smashing his truck window. Although Elliott was 
not armed, he refused to retreat after a trembling Steffens pointed a gun at 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 During court proceedings, witnesses told a story of vendettas, gangs and drugs 
among white, upper-class teen-agers. They testified about the animosity between 
Steffens and Elliott, which dated back to when the two were eighth-graders and 
had dramatically escalated in the months before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified during the trial that Steffens was so fearful of Elliott 
that he had taken to sleeping with a gun next to his bed. Steffens believed 
Elliott was responsible for twice firing a weapon into his bedroom. Shortly 
before the shooting, Elliott blamed Steffens for breaking his car window. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge convicted the boy of second-degree murder, but a Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana reduced the conviction to manslaughter. The court held Steffens had 
an "honest but unreasonable fear of immediate harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Supreme Court justices indicated during oral arguments Tuesday that 
they did not accept the California attorney general's contention that the state 
Legislature and voters intended to abolish such defenses when they changed the 
requirements for proving murder in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine something more in mitigation (in a killing) than the belief 
that my life is in danger," said Justice Ronald M. George, "even if the belief 
turns out to be somewhat unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Murder defendants may be convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter if 
they can show they believed they were in imminent harm, as unreasonable as 
their fear might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the defense, judges would be required to instruct juries to convict 
defendants of murder unless the killing occurred in clear self-defense or the 
heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez case, which is expected to be retried, defense lawyers claimed 
that the brothers killed their parents because they feared for their lives 
after years of physical and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce L. Kennard cited a legislative committee report that said such 
defenses were not being abolished when the Legislature narrowed the legal 
requirements for proving murder in 1981. She also noted that a majority of 
states have found such defenses proper. 
</P>
<P>
 The court will issue an opinion in the case within 90 days.

COURTS REJECT PLEA; AERIAL MEDFLY SPRAYING BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aerial spraying of the Medfly-killing insecticide malathion began Tuesday 
night after the state Supreme Court and a Riverside Superior Court rejected 
last-minute appeals to stop the controversial air attack on the crop-ravaging 
pest. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after 9 p.m., three helicopters began spewing a sticky corn syrup bait 
laced with the garden-variety insecticide over an 18-square-mile area of Corona 
and Norco. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a widespread community outcry over the aerial application of malathion 
and four court battles in which the city stalled but could not derail the 
eradication plans, there were no disruptions once the operation began. 
</P>
<P>
 Some protesters had threatened to release helium-filled balloons to thwart the 
aircraft, but later decided against it. Concern that the most passionate 
opponents might resort to more violent means appeared to be unwarranted as the 
spraying continued into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of concerns that attempts might be made to sabotage the operation, the 
helicopters were prepared under military guard at March Air Force Base near 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather conditions were considered perfect for the 3 1/2-hour operation, in 
which the helicopters flying in formation made continuous passes over the city 
at an altitude of about 400 feet, blanketing residential neighborhoods, 
business, parks and farmland with the droplets. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the area, many vehicles were covered with tarps and other material 
to protect the paint. Spectators watched the aircraft from a distance, then 
retreated indoors for cover as the helicopters approached. Some horse owners 
hobbled their animals so they could not run away if they were spooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Corona could not stop the flights, officials threatened more legal 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will cost us $100,000 or better to send crews out to hose down the parks 
and schools," City Councilman Jeff Bennett said. "I'm advising every resident 
to file a damage claim against the state." 
</P>
<P>
 The spraying began after three false starts caused by bad weather and 
court-ordered postponements. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona had appealed the spraying to a Riverside Superior Court Judge, arguing 
that the state violated its own environmental regulations by failing to study 
the long-term health effects of malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 It also contended that Gov. Pete Wilson legally erred when he declared a state 
emergency over the presence of a single Medfly in Corona. State agriculture 
officials said that if the fly is not eradicated in Corona it could spread to 
rich farmlands and threaten the state's $18-billion agricultural industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said that Wilson acted properly and that malathion did not pose a 
risk to the public's health. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's appeal to the 4th District Court of Appeals was rejected after that 
court said the need to eradicate the pest was obvious. Tuesday morning, the 
state Supreme Court in San Francisco refused to review the case. And later in 
the day, the city was again rebuked by Riverside Superior Court Judge Vincent 
Miceli when it argued that the state's notice of the spraying was too 
ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Bill Miller said he talked to Wilson late Tuesday afternoon but failed 
to win a last-minute reprieve. Miller said he was resigned to the aerial 
spraying but worried about any possible long-term health effects. "I don't want 
Corona to be the example of the case study 20 years from now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller spent part of the evening at the local National Guard armory, opened to 
shelter the homeless from the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of malathion released equaled 1.2 fluid ounces per acre -- a weaker 
dose than probably would be used by back-yard gardeners and commercial growers 
if they were to battle the Medfly on their own, state officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentration was half that used in 1989-90 when more than 500 square 
miles of Southern California were targeted for aerial malathion spraying. 
Officials believed then that they had gotten rid of the pest, but it reappeared 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan and other export markets have threatened to boycott California citrus 
and other produce vulnerable to the Medfly if the infestation spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 To battle the current Medfly infestation in the Los Angeles Basin, about 500 
million sterile Medflies will be released weekly in a 1,500-square-mile area 
encompassing parts of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona officials said some of those flies should have been reserved for use in 
western Riverside County as well. But the state said there were not enough 
sterile Medflies to also blanket Corona, so the aerial spraying was a necessary 
last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 From eight to 10 aerial applications are scheduled in the next four months by 
the state and federal Cooperative Medfly Project to rid Corona of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly.

SAFETY PANEL OKS RULES ON TRAILING 757 JETS; AIRCRAFT: GUIDELINES SEEK TO AVERT 
CRASHES LINKED TO WAKE TURBULENCE, WHICH APPARENTLY DOWNED A PLANE IN SANTA ANA 
IN WHICH FIVE PEOPLE DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday approved a detailed set of 
recommendations designed to prevent airplane accidents caused by wake 
turbulence -- the presumed cause of a crash that claimed five lives when a 
twin-engine corporate jet went out of control while landing about two miles 
behind a Boeing 757 at John Wayne Airport in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action sent a strong message to the Federal Aviation 
Administration that the minimum distances between landing airplanes should be 
increased and that its 20-year-old weight classification system for larger 
aircraft be overhauled to reflect a new generation of commercial jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also urged that air controllers provide more detailed information to 
pilots about wake turbulence and that training manuals be updated to emphasize 
the dangers of such airborne encounters, particularly when the trailing plane 
is smaller and more vulnerable to the miniature cyclones produced by rapid air 
movement across the larger aircraft's wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety board records show that 51 wake turbulence incidents or accidents have 
occurred over the last decade, killing 27 people and damaging or destroying 40 
airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and 
trailing aircraft. But only a week after the crash of the corporate jet in 
Santa Ana two months ago, FAA Administrator David Hinson issued a directive 
requiring air traffic controllers nationwide to warn pilots of the turbulence 
caused by 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety board's action Tuesday, although not binding on the FAA, is 
expected to put more pressure on federal regulators to adopt the preventive 
procedures adopted unanimously by the board's five commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Paul Steucke said the agency would review the safety board 
recommendations immediately. "We're aware of the problem and we're taking 
measures to make sure there is not another occurrence," Steucke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the fatal accident in Santa Ana, four other incidents related to 757 
turbulence have occurred in the last 14 months, including a Dec. 18, 1992, 
crash in Billings, Mont., that killed eight people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the wake turbulence accidents involve Boeing 757 jetliners, 
the commissioners did not cite any particular flaw in the airplane's design. 
The heart of the problem, they said, is revising the FAA's plane classification 
system to ensure the proper separation between airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be some unique characteristics of the 757," Commissioner John. K. 
Lauber said, ". . . but it is clear that the fundamental problem goes back to 
the outdated weight categorization scheme that needs to be fixed." 
</P>
<P>
 The board found that "inadequacies in the current airplane weight 
classification scheme . . . air control procedures . . . and pilot knowledge . 
. . of wake vortices were more important factors in the five recent accidents 
investigated by the safety board than any specific characteristic of the B-757 
wake vortex." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the present system, the 757 is considered a large aircraft, but industry 
experts have previously urged the FAA to reclassify it as a heavy aircraft and 
require smaller planes to stay farther behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The board took action on both fronts Tuesday. It recommended that the 
separation distances be lengthened for smaller planes trailing 757s -- even for 
jetliners such as Boeing 737s, MD-80s and DC-9s. 
</P>
<P>
 And it also urged that the three-tiered U.S. airplane weight classification 
system be revised to narrow the weight ranges in some categories. Under present 
U.S. rules, the 757 is the heaviest aircraft in the middle weight class. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also recommended that 757s and other large aircraft conduct 
landings on a more standard flight path angle. The board's study of wake 
turbulence incidents showed that trailing airplanes are in more danger of being 
thrown out of control when they are below the larger plane's descending flight 
path. 
</P>
<P>
 Because 757s and other newer jets can slow down more quickly than older 
jetliners, trailing aircraft can inadvertently close too quickly and wind up in 
the danger zone. Safety board staff members made it clear that maintaining a 
higher relative position to larger landing aircraft is the key preventive 
factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flight path is (the) critical factor), but maintaining proper distance is 
the best solution," said John Clark, an aircraft performance specialist for the 
board.

JUSTICES SKEPTICAL OF ATTEMPT TO LIMIT SELF-DEFENSE CLAIMS; THE LAW: SEVERAL 
CHALLENGE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S CONTENTION THAT LAWMAKERS AND VOTERS ABOLISHED 
CERTAIN DOCTRINES WHEN THEY CHANGED REQUIREMENTS FOR PROVING MURDER. CASE 
INVOLVES A YOUTH WHO KILLED OUT OF HONEST BUT UNREASONABLE FEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 The California Supreme Court seemed skeptical Monday of an attempt to prevent 
defendants from escaping murder convictions when they kill out of an honest but 
mistaken conviction that their lives are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "imperfect self-defense" doctrine is a powerful tool for defense 
attorneys. Used typically by battered wives, the defense helped produce hung 
juries in the recent murder trial of Lyle and Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Several justices indicated during oral arguments Tuesday that they did not 
accept the California attorney general's contention that the state Legislature 
and voters intended to abolish such defenses when they changed the requirements 
for proving murder in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot imagine something more in mitigation (in a killing) than the belief 
that my life is in danger," said Justice Ronald M. George, "even if the belief 
turns out to be somewhat unreasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Murder defendants may be convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter if 
they can show they believed they were in imminent harm, as unreasonable as 
their fear might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the defense, judges would be required to instruct juries to convict 
defendants of murder unless the killing occurred in clear self-defense or the 
heat of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez case, which is expected to be retried, defense lawyers claimed 
that the brothers killed their parents because they feared for their lives 
after years of physical and emotional abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Joyce L. Kennard cited a legislative committee report that said such 
defenses were not being abolished when the Legislature narrowed the legal 
requirements for proving murder in 1981. She also noted that a majority of 
states have found such defenses proper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County case before the court, a 16-year-old Dana Point boy shot 
and killed a reputed member of a skinhead gang who had threatened and harassed 
him for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, identified as Christian S., shot and killed Robert Elliott 
after Elliott chased him on the beach, threatening "to get" him for smashing 
his truck window. Although Elliott was not armed, he refused to retreat after 
Christian, trembling, pointed a gun at him. Witnesses testified that Christian 
had been terrified of Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge convicted the boy of second-degree murder, but a Court of Appeal in 
Santa Ana reduced the conviction to manslaughter. The court held that Christian 
S. had an "honest but unreasonable fear of immediate harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Marvin R. Baxter noted that eliminating the legal doctrine of 
imperfect self-defense could actually hinder prosecutors. Taking the 
hypothetical case of a woman who repels an attempted rape by killing an unarmed 
assailant, Baxter said a jury might acquit her if the only other option is 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Atty. Gen. Garrett Beaumont argued that the hypothetical defendant 
could still claim self-defense. He said defendants who claim they killed out of 
an unreasonable fear for their lives may actually be more dangerous than 
contract killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica attorney Stephen Gilbert, representing Christian S., contended 
the case was "a victims' rights case." After the arguments, he said in a brief 
interview that he was "cautiously optimistic" that the court will rule in favor 
of his client. 
</P>
<P>
 The court will issue an opinion in the case within 90 days.

EDUCATION SUMMIT OFFERS HUGE RANGE OF IDEAS ON SCHOOLS; LEARNING: SHEER VOLUME 
AND DIVERSITY OF PROPOSALS AT CONFERENCE SHOWS IT WILL NOT BE EASY TO REACH 
CONSENSUS ON OVERHAULING STATE INSTITUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If the education summit here was meant to be a marketplace of ideas on public 
schools, Tuesday's opening session was the main bazaar where hawkers sought 
attention for their intellectual wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups from the California Business Roundtable to the California Teachers 
Assn. unveiled ambitious shopping lists for school reform. Others sought to use 
the gathering of 500 business, education and political leaders to get their own 
ideas out for public consumption. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, who convened the meeting and led the panel 
sessions Tuesday, called the exercise a "think-tank session." Its aim, he said, 
was to write an agenda for overhauling California's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sheer volume of divergent ideas and priorities bandied about at the 
Westin St. Francis Hotel indicated that building consensus will be not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Republican Gov. Pete Wilson said, "before we do anything else we 
must . . . make our classrooms safe again." Senate leader Bill Lockyer, a 
Democrat from Hayward, called for "re-examining the strictures of Proposition 
13," which slashed local school funding almost a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), longtime chairman of the Senate 
Education Committee, said the gathering of so many opinions under one roof was 
a rare opportunity to hear a broad spectrum of thought on education. 
</P>
<P>
 "My initial feeling was this is all PR, " Hart said. "But as I look at it and 
think about it, I think it's very helpful." After these sessions, he said, 
legislators might try to look at the big picture when writing policies for 
local schools in the halls of Sacramento. He also had his own idea: Bring 
California back up to the national average in per-pupil spending within five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has a wish list," said business leader Sanford Sigoloff, who was 
recently forced by opposition in the Legislature to withdraw as Wilson's 
nominee to head the state Department of Education. Wilson subsequently 
appointed him to the State Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers said the summit was most likely to produce consensus in areas 
in which there already is broad agreement that something needs to be done, such 
as reducing campus violence, eliminating vast portions of the cumbersome 
Education Code and increasing schools' access to technology. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, for example, technology got a pre-summit boost with Pacific Bell's 
announcement that it will provide $100 million to begin wiring the state's 
public schools and libraries with the equipment they need to be able to tap 
into outside resources via computers and phone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most participants Tuesday gave the schools credit for implementing some 
reforms while confronted with more and needier students and with a 
budget-depleting economy. All agreed that the schools need to do better but can 
improve only with the help of political and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called the schools' performance record erratic, noting that some are 
among the nation's finest but "too many are forced to confront problems not of 
their own making." 
</P>
<P>
 The tightly orchestrated program frustrated some participants, who were given 
no more than seven minutes each to make their points, but it ensured that no 
one group or ideology dominated the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups hoping for more attention distributed summaries of their proposals. 
Among them was the California Teachers Assn., which touted its plan as the only 
one put together by "those who know students and education best" -- teachers 
and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 It called for more education money to be spent in the classrooms. It also 
called for involvement by teachers organizations in refining the state's 
fledgling efforts to broaden parents' choices among public schools, and to give 
charters to schools that allow them to operate with full autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The association, the state's largest teachers union, initially opposed these 
programs. Among its other proposals were full federal funding to send all needy 
youngsters to preschool, partnerships with businesses and more participation by 
parents in their children's schooling. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Business Roundtable, made up of leaders of the state's largest 
corporations, renewed its call for an "interlocking web of education and 
training" from preschool through college and beyond. Holding schools 
accountable for student achievement, improving the transition from school to 
workplace and integrating technology with classroom instruction were some of 
the executives' other proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) pushed a plan to set up 
military-style charter schools for young troublemakers. The union that 
represents 300,000 non-teaching school employees wanted college-level 
instruction provided to school aides at their jobs so they can earn teaching 
credentials. The Assn. of Calif School Administrators called for more attention 
to the stressful living conditions of today's students. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit also blended policy and politics, as some of the nation's foremost 
education reformers and child advocates, including psychiatrist James P. Comer 
of the Yale University Child Study Center and Marian Wright Edelman of the 
Children's Defense Fund, shared the spotlight with leading candidates for 
governor and state superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 And it featured the re-emergence of Bill Honig, the education-reform leader 
who was forced to resign as state superintendent a year ago upon being 
convicted of felony conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with an appearance at a pre-summit reception Monday night, Honig 
handed out copies of a treatise he wrote on reform efforts under way in 
California and elsewhere. Greeted warmly by many participants, Honig had a 
chance to promote his new Center for Systemic School Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The privately funded center is based at San Francisco State University, where 
Honig has been teaching since shortly after receiving his sentence to perform 
community service work. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he expects corporate donors to pick up most of the estimated 
$200,000 tab for the summit. Any balance will be paid from his campaign funds, 
he said.

SAN ONOFRE CASE'S STAR WITNESS HAS DIVERSE INTERESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a blue-ribbon resume and has worked as an equal with many of the bright 
lights of American science and medicine. But he also pals around with Clint 
Eastwood, Sylvester Stallone and Burt Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a long list of professional honors and credentials and research papers 
in esteemed publications. But he has taken heavy fire from the science 
Establishment for peddling pills promoting eternal youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Harry B. Demopoulos -- who has his own radio show, has appeared in two 
"Dirty Harry" movies and a Stallone movie, and says he is on the verge of 
finding a drug to slow the ravages of AIDS -- is a man of many roles. 
</P>
<P>
 His latest: star witness for a former nuclear inspector who believes her 
cancer was caused by radiation poisoning at the San Onofre nuclear plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal jury in San Diego last week deadlocked 7 to 2 in favor of Rung C. 
Tang in her $15-million suit against Southern California Edison. Although short 
of a victory for Tang, the split was considered a moral triumph by the 
anti-nuclear movement, which has long insisted that nuclear plants are unsafe 
and carelessly operated. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrial in the case is set to start March 1, with a win or another deadlock 
in Tang's favor expected to provoke other cancer suits from workers at the 
nation's 109 nuclear plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang's lawyers say a dozen San Onofre workers have contacted them about filing 
similar suits, a prospect that could keep Demopoulos in front of juries for 
years to come. "R.C. Tang is just the tip of the iceberg," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although other scientists also testified on behalf of Tang, it was Demopoulos 
who provided the heart of her case, the first such suit in the history of the 
nuclear power industry. 
</P>
<P>
 For two days he lectured the jury on fine points of chemistry and biology and 
ended with the dramatic pronouncement that Tang contracted chronic myelogenous 
leukemia because the operators of the San Onofre plant were sloppy and 
negligent, assertions that Edison's attorneys vigorously and angrily denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The gregarious Demopoulos insists that he is not a cancer alarmist nor is he 
anti-nuclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a firm believer in nuclear technology," he said in a telephone interview 
from his laboratory in Elmsford, N.Y. "But you have to use the technology 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
 He was not bothered by attacks on his credibility by Edison attorneys who 
sneered at his Hollywood connections and what they called junk science, rank 
speculation and alleged attempts to pass himself off as an expert in a field 
they said he knows little about. 
</P>
<P>
 He's heard it all before, while testifying as a defense witness in cases in 
which plaintiffs have said that asbestos made them sick. Although he is neither 
an oncologist nor a radiologist, he offered rock-solid opinions on both 
specialties in the Tang case. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you know what you're talking about, there's no reason to come unflapped," 
said Demopoulos, 62, whose formal training is primarily in pathology. 
</P>
<P>
 Tang's attorneys, from the Los Angeles firm of Howarth & Smith, have called 
Demopoulos as an expert witness in numerous trials. In the world of expert 
witnesses, he is a superstar, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike most doctors, Harry really likes people," said one of the firm's 
partners, Suzelle Smith. "He can talk to jurors without talking down to them. 
He blends professional credibility, experience and a keen understanding of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas attorney Lisa Blue, who has cross-examined and taken depositions from 
Demopoulos in various asbestos lawsuits, thinks it is all an act by a likable 
fellow who is light on medical specialties but heavy on acting skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who knows a little bit about a lot of different things," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue's firm, Baron & Budd, represents plaintiffs suing asbestos users, and 
Demopoulos often testifies that the link between an individual illness and 
asbestos cannot be established, the reverse of his role in the San Onofre case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's dynamite in front of juries," Blue said. "He's quite an actor and, after 
all, he's learned from the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Among his teachers was Eastwood, who directed Demopoulos in "Sudden Impact" 
and acted with him in "The Dead Pool." The pair met when Eastwood became 
interested in his experiments with vitamins and amino acids to slow aging. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Eastwood, Demopoulos met Stallone and Reynolds and Muhammad Ali. He 
treated Reynolds for an ear infection and had a small role in Stallone's 
"Cobra." He is closest to Eastwood, considering him "like a brother." 
</P>
<P>
 When Eastwood and Stallone shoot a movie, Demopoulos travels on location, 
sizing up the medical risks in their acting stunts and offering medical advice 
and friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If everybody did what Clint, Burt and Sly do (for their health), Bill and 
Hillary (Clinton) wouldn't have a health problem in this country," Demopoulos 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his Hollywood friends become an issue in nearly every trial in which 
Demopoulos is a witness, as opposing attorneys try to whittle down his 
credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "How's Clint Eastwood's health?" an Edison attorney asked archly during the 
Tang trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clint Eastwood is healthy as a horse," Demopoulos replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue also dogs Demopoulos whenever he testifies: the pills that his 
company, Health Maintenance Programs Inc., sells through the mail. The Food and 
Drug Administration has ordered the company to stop making health claims that 
have not been verified by clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Demopoulos was an early believer in the now widely accepted "free radical" 
theory, which holds that certain molecules that react adversely to oxygen can 
damage cells and cause illness. He says his "antioxidant" pills slow down that 
process and thus promote health and longevity, an assertion that many in the 
academic community say is unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole field of antioxidants is up in the air," said Paul Saltman, a 
professor of biology at UC San Diego and a former colleague of Demopoulos at 
USC. "It is always possible (that the pills help), but there is no proof in the 
medical literature today." 
</P>
<P>
 Demopoulos and his pills, however, are not without their defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jonas Salk, developer of the Salk vaccine against polio and founding 
director of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, takes the 
pills and believes they are beneficial, although he adds that this is a 
subjective, not a scientific, judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry is a dedicated person who is trying to do some good in the world," Salk 
said. "He's a very passionate person, very human, very compelling and 
thoughtful. When you hear his laugh, you can feel his charm, his enthusiasm, 
his hope." 
</P>
<P>
 As for criticism that Demopoulos strays into medical fields outside his 
specialty, Salk said this is a common complaint when scientists are innovative 
thinkers or have controversial ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harry is an integrator," Salk said admiringly. "He can deal with more complex 
problems that require a generalist." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York, Demopoulos graduated in 1956 from the College of Medicine at 
the State University of New York and trained at the National Institutes of 
Health, the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and UCLA. He wrote a book 
called "Cancer and the Environment" and has 92 published research papers. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the New York University medical school faculty in 1967; his wife, 
Rita, is also on the NYU medical faculty. The couple live in fashionable 
Scarsdale; three of their four children are doctors, the fourth works with 
Demopoulos at his laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Although tenured, Demopoulos no longer keeps a laboratory at the university or 
draws a salary, preferring to devote himself to his own company and his 
writing. His current project for Random House is a book linking cancer with fat 
in the diet, with one chapter to be called "Fast Food in the Ghettos: The 
Killing Fields." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumpled, paunchy and with wispy hair that is combed over a spreading bald 
spot, Demopoulos plays the role of professor in the courtroom, complete with 
blackboard and diagrams. He is eager for a reprise of his role in San Onofre II 
and, as in the first trial, he asks only that Tang's lawyers pay for his plane 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be back," Demopoulos said. "Absolutely."

ON CALIFORNIA: GAS PUMPS IN THE REARVIEW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is how I remember it. We were driving on California 152, over by Los 
Banos. This was about 30 years ago, and the family car was a big Mercury 
Monterey sedan. The distinguishing feature of this model was its back window, 
which slanted down and in at a sharp angle. The design's intent, I suppose, was 
to give the car a futuristic look, like something the Jetsons might drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, on this summer day we happened to pass a strange little box of a car 
-- a Honda, I now believe. This was the first Japanese import we'd ever seen, 
and the image of the tiny machine bucking an afternoon breeze, its passengers 
squeezed inside, shoulder to shoulder, head to roof, seemed absolutely 
ludicrous. We all giggled, and I seem to remember my mother saying something as 
we boomed past. What I seem to remember her saying was this: 
</P>
<P>
 "Toot, toot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Well, how could we know any better? How could we know that the next wave in 
automobiles would be, not big Mercs with slant-back windows, but little 
Japanese imports? The future can be difficult to see, especially when it's in 
your rearview mirror. I face a similar quandary today, trying to imagine a time 
when electric cars dominate the roadways. Advocates insist this not only is 
inevitable, but could be only a decade or so away. Still, the idea of 
recharging some clean, quiet electro-wagon each night in the clutter of my 
garage seems faraway, fantastic. 
</P>
<P>
 In this failure of imagination I suspect I am not alone. And in this failure 
of imagination Detroit auto makers and their allies in internal combustion find 
opportunity. As evidence, I offer a well-attended hearing Monday at the 
Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 An Assembly committee was taking testimony on regulations that will mandate 2% 
of all new cars sold in California by 1998 emit zero pollutants. Under these 
mandates, drafted to help California comply with federal clean air 
requirements, 10% of the vehicles sold by 2003 must be so-called Zero Emission 
Vehicles, or ZEVS. Present technology pretty much dictates that the ZEVS will 
be electric cars. U.S. auto makers have been lobbying quietly against the 
coming mandates. The hearing forced them and their allies -- mainly, 
representatives of the oil industry -- to go public. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony, at news conferences and in encounters in the Capitol halls, they 
attacked the mandates from many angles -- bad science, bad public policy, bad 
economics, unfair, unfeasible, unnecessary, un-American. They invoked Adam 
Smith and the Edsel. They warned of taxpayer boondoggles, excessive regulation, 
higher electric bills and even job flight. The overarching intent seemed to be 
to plant one seed: The risk of enforcing the mandate schedule outweighs any 
benefit that will come from forcing along electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they pay homage to the quest for "exciting new technology," when it 
comes to electric cars, these people clearly are skeptics. The technology isn't 
there, they say, and neither is the market. Trust your instincts, they imply, 
it's not going to happen. After testimony from one electric car enthusiast, a 
representative of the Western States Petroleum Assn. gave me a grin and a 
knowing look and said: "Pretty wild stuff." He might have just said: Toot, 
toot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Electric car advocates -- and the most significant development Monday was the 
Wilson Administration's reassertion of support for ZEV mandates -- compare the 
auto makers' stance to those initially taken against air bags. Detroit, they 
say, simply wants to do business its way, on its timetable. And here is where 
the electric car people sense an opportunity of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all these cars have to be built in Detroit," said Michael Gage, the 
former politico who now serves as president of Calstart, a quasi-public 
consortium attempting to foster transportation innovations. If Detroit doesn't 
want to build them, he said, others surely will -- in Germany, or Japan, or 
maybe in Burbank, where his group is headquartered in a retired aircraft plant. 
A principal benefit of the mandates, he and others testified, will be to 
jump-start technology and create an entire new industry -- and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony, Gage presented slides of electric car prototypes under 
development around the world. The models ranged from Mercedes trucks to tiny, 
square Japanese contraptions that reminded me of that early Honda: Cars, 
quipped one Assembly member, "that fit in your pocket." 
</P>
<P>
 The most important slide Gage brought, however, was a shot of the Los Angeles 
skyline choked with smog. "This is what it's all about," he said. And he was 
right. The future might be tough to see, but the present is obvious. Just look 
out the window, and ask what is the greater risk: Trying something that might 
not work, or not trying at all?

 Air Force Lt. Jeannie Flynn had never been one to buck the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she had graduated first in her pilot training class early last 
year, she knew the Air Force would turn down her request to fly its top fighter 
plane. Women were, after all, prohibited from serving in combat. 
</P>
<P>
 When the expected denial came, Flynn quietly switched to Plan B and enrolled 
in a flight instructor course in California, hoping that some day the clouds 
would lift over her primary target. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the phone call came: the Clinton Administration had lifted its ban 
against women in air combat and the Air Force was offering her the chance to 
fly its screaming F-15E Strike Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than 10 months later, the 27-year-old Flynn has finished her 
training and will report next month to her unit -- the Fourth Wing at Seymour 
Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina -- as the first woman fighter pilot in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 In an acknowledgment that not everyone loves a trailblazer, Flynn said 
Tuesday: "I realize that not every person wanted this to happen. . . . But I 
also know that at this time, that's irrelevant." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that she was excited about reporting to duty as a full-fledged 
combat pilot, noting: "I've been in training for most of my Air Force life so 
far." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Administration lifted the ban last April and permitted women to join 
the ranks of fighter pilots, Flynn and 14 other women were chosen to lead the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn was ushered almost immediately into Strike Eagle qualification training 
at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona, while the others began or are scheduled to 
start training on an array of other combat aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 When she reports to duty after completing a brief survival course, Flynn will 
find herself in control of an attack plane considered to be the most advanced 
in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built by McDonnell Douglas in 1972, the Strike Eagles were among 
the first aircraft that were deployed in the Persian Gulf in August, 1990. They 
led an attack on Iraqi forces on Jan. 16, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Able to fly at low altitudes day or night and in bad weather, the planes can 
fight their way to and from targets and hit them at close or long range with 
infrared air-to-surface missiles and laser-guided bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in St. Louis, Flynn said that becoming a fighter pilot was the unexpected 
realization of a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to fly (a fighter) but I thought the policy would be (in force) for 
much longer than it was," she said. "I was looking at other options in case 
combat wasn't available to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her interest in flying began with her first trip on a commercial airliner when 
she was a senior at Bishop DuBourg High School in St. Louis, where she 
graduated in the top 1% of her class. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn went on to study aerospace engineering at the University of Texas at 
Austin, graduating with honors. 
</P>
<P>
 While in college, she enrolled in a two-year Reserve Officer Training Corps 
program that gave her her first taste of flying in a military jet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I tried that, I was hooked," Flynn said, explaining that she then began 
to look at career opportunities that would allow her to fly planes -- or 
perhaps become an astronaut. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn joined the Air Force on active duty in January, 1992, after a yearlong 
wait to enroll in a pilot training course. During the hiatus, she earned her 
master's degree in aeronautics and astronautics at Stanford University, 
graduating in December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said she has long gotten over the rejection of her first request to fly 
the Strike Eagle and now looks forward to the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has no worries about facing harassment from her male colleagues, 
saying she has never faced that problem in the Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "What really matters is just that you're qualified and that you're competent 
in your job," she said.

TAPE OF CULTISTS DISCUSSING BLAZE PLAYED; TRIAL: PROSECUTION RESTS AFTER THE 
RECORDING OF BRANCH DAVIDIANS SAYING, 'GOT ANY FUEL?' AND 'I WANT A FIRE AROUND 
THE BACK' IS HEARD IN THE MURDER CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prosecutors played tapes Tuesday of Branch Davidians discussing plans to 
ignite and spread a fire as authorities prepared to rush their compound, then 
rested their case against 11 cult members. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys attacked the credibility of the FBI surveillance tapes, 
which include such fragments as, "Got any fuel?" " . . . start the fire?" "I 
want a fire around the back," and "Let's keep that fire going." 
</P>
<P>
 Cult leader David Koresh and 78 other people -- including 18 children -- were 
killed in the inferno April 19 at the compound near Waco, Tex. Eighteen had 
been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the fire was set as part of a suicide pact. Their last 
witness, Texas Ranger Joe Haralson, testified that defendant Graeme Craddock 
told authorities Koresh had taught for months that "humanity was about to be 
taken from the Earth and that the Davidians would be the first of the harvest." 
</P>
<P>
 Haralson read a statement that Craddock made to a grand jury on April 20 in 
which Craddock said the Davidians expected to "undergo a long siege." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire ended a 51-day standoff that began with a botched raid by the federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. Four agents and six Davidians were 
killed in the initial assault as authorities stormed the compound trying to 
arrest Koresh on weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys said the Davidians acted in self-defense. The 11 cult 
members charged with murder and murder conspiracy face up to life in prison if 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, lawyers, defendants and the judge used headphones Tuesday to listen to 
about an hour of excerpts from more than 100 hours of tapes made during the 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 a.m. on the day of the fire, an FBI agent began warning by telephone and 
loudspeaker that armored vehicles were going to rush the compound and tear gas 
was going to be fired inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Got any fuel?" the transcript quoted a man as saying about 6:10 a.m. About 10 
minutes later, the transcript said, another unidentified man asked, " . . . 
start the fire?" 
</P>
<P>
 At 9:20 a.m., the tape quotes Koresh as asking top aide Steven Schneider about 
"two cans of Coleman fuel." Schneider replied that the cans were empty but said 
he had "some mineral oil," the transcript said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a fire around the back," an unidentified voice was quoted as saying at 
11:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's keep that fire going" was the last line of the excerpts that jurors 
heard. Prosecutors said an unidentified man made the remark within 25 minutes 
of the fire's ignition at 12:07 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When played in court, the line was difficult to decipher. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was clear to you?" defense lawyer Dan Cogdell asked electronics engineer 
Paul Ginsberg, who was paid $20,000 by the government to enhance and transcribe 
the recordings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear that in the courtroom here? Were we listening to the same tape?" 
Cogdell asked during his cross-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we were. And I did," Ginsberg replied.

MEMPHIS TURNS UP HEAT ON ITS DOWNTOWN PANHANDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNDA NATALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every day when Don Hungerford opens his store in downtown Memphis, panhandlers 
demand money from him. Sometimes, they beg in front of his clothing shop on 
South Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a day that goes by that I am not approached," Hungerford said. 
"I just keep walking and don't look at them." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Hungerford, the city of Memphis has decided to stop looking the other 
way and to crack down on panhandlers. The City Council recently passed an 
ordinance -- believed to be the first of its kind in the nation -- requiring 
all panhandlers to get a free, city-issued permit. Now, begging in Memphis 
without the proper paperwork can get a person arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Memphis used to be a place where this thing didn't happen. (Washington) D.C. 
had a problem. Philadelphia had a problem. But not Memphis," said Melanie 
Winton, staff administrator for the City Council. "It was getting to be a 
problem, not so much begging, but people who were harassing other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, panhandlers must get a permit to beg in public places, such as 
the library and the airport. Begging is banned on buses and at trolley stops, 
as is panhandling after sunset or before sunrise. Violators can be charged with 
a misdemeanor offense and fined $50. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was drafted in response to complaints by a neighborhood 
organization concerned about beggars harassing people in downtown Memphis, 
which, like many urban cores, is undergoing a revitalization effort after years 
of decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which the council will re-evaluate after nine months, is one of 
the most restrictive in use as cities around the country search for ways to 
curb panhandlers whose tactics are becoming more aggressive and even 
threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Panhandling is one element of a general decay and deterioration of life in 
cities," said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Sacramento-based Criminal 
Justice Legal Foundation. "We see the decay of public order as the root cause 
of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, a public interest group formed to protect the rights of crime 
victims, has published a pamphlet on regulating panhandling that some city 
officials, including those in Memphis, have used in drafting their ordinances. 
The laws target behavior and do not push for banning the practice altogether, 
in part to avoid legal challenges by groups who argue that panhandling is 
protected by the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Panhandlers in Memphis also can be charged if they use profane or abusive 
language, work in groups of two or more or intimidate pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, San Diego passed an "aggressive solicitation" law similar to 
what other cities have on their books or are trying to get. The rule prohibits 
individuals from "coercing, threatening, hounding, harassing or intimidating 
another person for the purpose of soliciting money or goods." 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, panhandlers are barred from using physical threats, blocking a 
person's path, interfering with traffic or continuing to pester someone who has 
said no. A companion measure also prohibits beggars from washing car 
windshields without permission, soliciting people entering or leaving a car and 
standing on a curb or in the street to beg from passing vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other cities that have tackled the issue include Baltimore, San Francisco 
and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In Memphis, only a few people have shown up to get permits, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Johnson, who begs in Court Square Park, does not think the permits will 
do any good. Johnson said he has been unemployed for the last two months and 
resorts to begging to provide for his wife and three children. He had heard 
about the permit but does not think he will get one. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to get a permit, most people think there is some sort of catch. They 
(the panhandlers) would rather go to jail," said Johnson, adding that he will 
soon begin working in a bubble gum factory. "I have no other choice. I have to 
feed my family."

U.S. URGES ARISTIDE TO AGREE TO HAITI PLAN FOR COALITION RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, clearly running out of patience, Tuesday called on 
ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to accept a new proposal by 
members of the Haitian Parliament to install a coalition government as a step 
toward restoring democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry chided Aristide, who lives in exile in 
Washington's Georgetown neighborhood, for refusing even to meet with members of 
Parliament who came to Washington last week pushing a proposal for a 
broad-based government that would include some of Aristide's political 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States certainly hopes that President Aristide would meet promptly 
with the delegation of democratically elected Haitian officials and enter 
substantive discussions with them on what is clearly a concrete and serious 
proposal," McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide replied that he held extensive meetings with the Parliament members, 
but he conceded that he had refused to discuss the proposal with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is unclear that these parliamentarians speak for their institution or 
command sufficient support to promote any specific proposal," Aristide said. 
"Whatever political vacuum that may exist in Haiti is due to the fear pervading 
the country because of the military oppression." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), a friend of Aristide, warned that the 
parliamentarians' proposal may "enable the Clinton Administration . . . to 
skirt the challenge of restoring Aristide." He said the plan is flawed because 
"it does not offer a concrete strategy for Aristide's return." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the United States, France, Venezuela and Canada have begun 
circulating a draft resolution at the United Nations to tighten economic 
sanctions against Haiti's military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The developments underlined the ambivalence of the Administration's attitude 
toward Haiti. Officially, it supports the restoration of Aristide. In private, 
however, many officials say that Aristide, who was overthrown in September, 
1991, is so politically radical that the military and the island's affluent 
elite will never allow him to return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry insisted that the ultimate objective is to allow Aristide to regain 
office. But he made it clear that Washington is growing weary of the exiled 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if Aristide lacks the flexibility necessary to reach an agreement 
that would allow him to return to the island, McCurry replied, "I didn't say 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," McCurry said. "Not now." 
</P>
<P>
 "When?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see," McCurry said.

YELTSIN JOINS MAJOR IN PROMISE TO PRESS FOR PEACE IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin warned the West on Tuesday not to bypass Russia in 
authorizing air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs. But he joined British Prime 
Minister John Major in promising to intensify peacemaking efforts in the former 
Yugoslav republic. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the visiting British leader voiced support for broader cooperation 
between Russia and the Group of Seven industrialized nations, "turning the G-7 
into a G-8." 
</P>
<P>
 Major is the first Western leader to come to Moscow since NATO threatened last 
week to bomb Bosnian Serb artillery positions unless they are withdrawn from 
around Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital. Russian leaders strongly oppose military 
action against the Serbs, their ethnic and religious kin. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving here Monday on a three-day visit, Major sounded intent on smoothing 
over the sharp differences between Russia and the West on this issue. After his 
meeting with Yeltsin in the Kremlin, he appeared to have partly succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general we agree on what's most important," an ailing Yeltsin told 
reporters afterward. "The main thing is to transfer the heavy weapons around 
Sarajevo to the U.N. forces, and this will put an end to the shelling. And 
secondly, through negotiations, to make both sides, the Serbs and Muslims, come 
to the negotiating table." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added a jarring note. "Some quarters are trying to resolve the Bosnia 
issue without Russia's participation," he said. "I would like to stress that 
they will not succeed. We won't allow this." 
</P>
<P>
 The warning underlined Moscow's insistence that a final decision on air 
strikes be left to the United Nations, where Russia has veto power in the 
Security Council. Yeltsin made it clear that Russia would support air raids 
only if U.N. peacekeepers were attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Without mentioning the controversy over U.N. authority, Major insisted that 
Russia and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have the same objective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish to bring an end to the bombardment of Sarajevo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major said his country, which has become Russia's third-largest trading 
partner, would favor Russian membership in the Council of Europe as well as the 
G-7 and press for opening all Western markets to more Russian exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders agreed that, starting May 30, they will no longer target each 
other's territory with nuclear missiles -- an accord identical to one signed 
last month in Moscow by Yeltsin and President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was Yeltsin's first public appearance in more than a week. His office 
announced last week that he was bedridden by a cold.

RUSSIAN AGENCY REVEALS CRISIS IN NUCLEAR POWER SAFETY; ENERGY: REPORT CITES 
20,000 VIOLATIONS LAST YEAR. PROBLEMS INCLUDE RADIATION LEAKS, URANIUM THEFTS 
AND GROWTH OF HAZARDOUS WASTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nuclear power in Russia poses a growing danger to human safety because of 
radiation leaks, thefts of uranium, ignorance of security regulations and 
shortages of funds to bury hazardous waste, a government watchdog agency 
reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In its first survey as an independent body with enhanced powers, the Federal 
Nuclear and Radiation Safety Oversight Committee counted 20,000 safety 
violations in 1993 -- nearly four for each of the 5,500 inspections it made. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the agency said it temporarily shut down 78 of the 14,500 
enterprises involved in atomic power, reprimanded 232 officials and charged two 
others with crimes. It also gave pop quizzes on safety procedures to 5,000 
atomic energy workers and flunked 437 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are serious drawbacks in the way we approach the problem of physical 
safety of nuclear materials in this country," Yuri G. Vishnevsky, chairman of 
the watchdog agency, told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's report painted a worrisome picture of what, at least through last 
year, was one of Russia's few growth industries. Nuclear power supplies 11% of 
the country's electricity and as much as 80% of it in some heavily populated 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the country's 29 nuclear reactors has all the right equipment for 
preparing radioactive waste for burial, the report said, and their existing 
pre-burial storage facilities are expected to fill up within two to three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia needs $72 million this year to bury the waste or expand its storage 
facilities and carry out other urgent maintenance, Vishnevsky said. But with 
government agencies scrambling for a share of the 1994 budget, he is not 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 A more immediate problem is the inter-company debts that paralyze much of 
Russia's economy. The nuclear power industry is owed $210 million by its 
clients; unless the government helps it collect, Vishnevsky said, reactors at 
St. Petersburg, Kursk and Smolensk could run out of fuel within months and shut 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Obscure and weak under Soviet rule, the oversight committee was empowered last 
year by President Boris N. Yeltsin to inspect all civilian and military 
handlers of nuclear materials and enforce safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vishnevsky said the agency is hindered by the lack of a modern legal code 
to regulate the industry, parts of which are coming under private ownership, 
and by resistance from the Defense Ministry to outside inspection of its bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Yeltsin's new regulations, the agency can order an enterprise shut down 
-- a drastic measure that it uses sparingly. But under existing legislation, 
which dates to the pre-1991 Soviet days, the maximum fine it can levy is 100 
rubles, about 6 cents at today's exchange rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Without serious penalties, law enforcement officials say they cannot stop 
poorly paid workers from stealing uranium for sale abroad as reactor fuel or 
bomb-making material. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nuclear Power Ministry reported three such thefts last year. But the 
watchdog agency recorded 10 thefts in 1993 totaling about 350 kilograms of 
spent uranium fuel.

 A powerful earthquake centered in the southern part of the island of Sumatra 
knocked down hundreds of buildings, killing at least 102 people, officials 
said.At least 500 others were injured, 300 of them seriously, said Hotman Atik, 
a spokesman for the governor of Lampung province. The quake was centered in 
Lampung about 125 miles northwest of Jakarta. Atik said the quake had a 
magnitude of 6.5, but the U.S. Geological Survey registered it at 7.2.

 Tens of thousands of Greeks demonstrated outside the U.S. Consulate in 
Salonika to protest Washington's recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of 
Macedonia as an independent state. Greece has tried to keep its allies from 
establishing diplomatic ties with Macedonia, contending that its northern 
neighbor has designs on the northern Greek province of the same name. "The 
United States is guilty of indecent behavior for recognizing this 
pseudo-state," said Bishop Panteleimon of Salonika, who organized the protest.

 Russia has executed serial killer Andrei Chikatilo, convicted of 52 murders in 
three former Soviet republics during a 12-year rampage, the Interfax news 
agency said in Moscow.Chikatilo, known as the "Rostov Ripper," was shot in the 
southern region of Rostov-on-Don after President Boris N. Yeltsin rejected an 
appeal for clemency, the agency said. The former teacher was found guilty of 
raping and murdering 21 boys, 14 girls and 17 older women in Russia, Ukraine 
and Uzbekistan starting in 1978. He was arrested in 1990.

 A Japanese father finally gave up fighting authorities for the right to name 
his 7-month-old son Akuma, or "Devil." Shigeharu Sato, 30, withdrew his appeal 
against officials who had refused to enter the name in Sato's family register, 
an official document required of all Japanese, said a family court spokesman. 
Authorities argued that the name would not conform to social norms.

INSTANT CELEBRITIES ARE SOMETIMES SEARED BY MEDIA SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID SHAW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver (Bill) Sipple didn't want any attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, he was a hero. He probably saved the President's life. On Sept. 22, 1975, 
while attending a San Francisco campaign rally for then-President Gerald Ford, 
he saw a woman aim a gun at Ford. Sipple -- a disabled Vietnam veteran -- 
instinctively knocked the gun from her hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, Sara Jane Moore, was sentenced to life in prison. Sipple's 
"sentence" was perhaps even worse. In 1989, he died alone, in a run-down 
apartment, a 47-year-old ex-Marine with a drinking problem. He was still 
estranged from the family that had not known he was gay until the media told 
them, a disclosure that he said caused him "great mental anguish, embarrassment 
and humiliation." 
</P>
<P>
 All Sipple had wanted was to be left alone. He didn't want to discuss his 
homosexuality or anything else. But he had performed his heroic deed on the 
national stage, at a time when personality journalism was just beginning to 
take off. However unwanted, instant celebrity was inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times and San Francisco Examiner wrote about Sipple's 
activities in the San Francisco gay community. Wire services picked up the 
stories. So did other newspapers -- including his hometown Detroit News. 
</P>
<P>
 Sipple's mother never spoke to him again. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have long cited invasion of privacy as one of the greatest 
shortcomings in news media ethics. In a time of instant celebrityhood, when 
mainstream media and sensationalist tabloid media alike are competing to be 
first with every new detail on the latest hero, villain, victim or eccentric, 
invasion of privacy has become an almost daily occurrence. One need not save 
the life of the President to suffer it. 
</P>
<P>
 For those hit by tragedy, trial-by-media can be especially intrusive -- 
offensive, suffocating and agonizing. The media often turn these people into 
what Tom Brokaw, anchor for the NBC "Nightly News," calls "the innocent victims 
of the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellen Levin can still recall in vivid detail the media ordeal she went through 
six years ago after her daughter Jennifer was choked to death in New York's 
Central Park in what became known as "the preppy murder case." 
</P>
<P>
 "The press camped outside our apartment," Levin says. "They kept a 24-hour 
watch on our building. Anyone coming and going, even while we were sitting 
shiva (the Jewish mourning process), was subject to unwanted interviews and 
cameramen pushing and shoving, especially if it was a relative or close friend 
of Jennifer's who was crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take our phone off the hook and change our number three times. The 
phone rang constantly. Our apartment buzzer rang constantly. The press never 
allowed us a moment of privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of invasion of privacy is devastating, Levin says, "because it comes 
at a point when you're most vulnerable," before there's been enough time to 
absorb a shattering personal loss. 
</P>
<P>
 One tabloid TV show, "A Current Affair," even broadcast a re-enactment of 
Jennifer Levin's encounter with her confessed killer, Robert Chambers, using 
actors. When Ellen Levin saw the show, she ran out on the terrace of her 
apartment building, screaming hysterically into the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The media echo chamber in New York is louder and more brutal than anywhere in 
the country, but Linda Biehl in Newport Beach knows just how Levin feels. 
</P>
<P>
 When her daughter Amy -- a white woman working for racial peace in South 
Africa -- was dragged from her car and beaten and stabbed to death last summer 
by a mob of black youths, the media descended instantly and en masse on the 
Biehls' home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were so surrounded and inundated by the press that it was three weeks 
before I really got out of my house," except for a couple of quick trips to the 
store, Biehl says. "I've never been through anything like it. . . . The media 
were here all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 When three of the suspects in her daughter's murder were subsequently released 
by South African authorities, Linda Biehl and her husband were in Washington. 
But one television station called her home at 5 a.m., awakening her 16-year-old 
son, then called his school to try to get him out of class so they could 
interview him. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined, but when he returned home he found the camera crew waiting 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Several TV magazine shows pursued the Biehls, asking for exclusive rights to 
their story. 
</P>
<P>
 "ABC had three magazine shows after us at one time," Linda Biehl says. "I 
wanted to call . . . Roone Arledge (president of ABC News) and say, 'Why don't 
you get your act together. . . ."

SUPPORT BEAMS CITED IN FALL OF JUMBOTRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two main support beams for Anaheim Stadium's Sony Jumbotron scoreboard 
were thinner at a crucial point than designers specified, which caused them to 
collapse during last month's earthquake, an engineer for Jumbotron said in a 
report released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard C. Adams, a Garden Grove engineer who helped design the huge 
scoreboard's structure for White Way Signs of Chicago in 1988, said Tuesday 
that his recent examination of the board's steel support system showed that a 
key portion of each beam was significantly smaller where it joined the 
stadium's main superstructure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this flaw, dating from the stadium's expansion by the construction 
firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, meant the beams could not support the 17 
1/2-ton scoreboard's weight when it began shaking during the Jan. 17 
earthquake. The falling scoreboard crushed or damaged about 1,000 seats in the 
stadium's upper deck in left field. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the frames on the building were not built the way (Skidmore's) 
plans showed them," Adams said. He made his examination the week after the 
earthquake and on Jan. 24 submitted his report to the city, which released it 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the support beams' flanges, the rims that project from the top and 
bottom of a beam to give it strength, were supposed to be 2 inches thick by 18 
inches wide throughout the beams' lengths. He said that he did not make exact 
measurements of the flanges, but that photos show the flanges reduced in size 
significantly as they came into the stadium's main frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday.

TORRES TO SEEK INSURANCE COMMISSIONER POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democratic state Sen. Art Torres, promising to protect Los Angeles earthquake 
victims from "unfair tactics" of insurance companies, announced his candidacy 
Tuesday for state insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 If elected, Torres, 47, who was born in East Los Angeles, would be the first 
Latino to hold statewide office since 1875 when Romualdo Pacheco was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not running as a Latino candidate," said Torres, chairman of the Senate 
Insurance Committee. He called himself a watchdog for consumers who is "best 
qualified to stand up to insurance companies and who happens to be Latino." 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat John Garamendi, who became the first elected insurance commissioner 
in 1990, is running for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary, Torres will face Assemblyman Burt Margolin of Los 
Angeles. Republicans who have declared their intent to run include Assemblyman 
Charles Quackenbush of Cupertino; Wes Bannister, the 1990 nominee, and Jim 
Conran, state director of consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres is the Legislature's senior Latino member, having been first elected to 
the Assembly in 1974. He told supporters in Chatsworth that he would work to 
make "whole" insurance customers whose property was damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake and last year's Southern California fires. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his newly drafted homeowner "bill of rights" legislation would protect 
policyholders from the types of "unfair insurance tactics" faced by survivors 
of the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 and the Oakland hills fires in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In those disasters, many policyholders charged that they were led by insurance 
representatives to accept inadequate settlements and were promised compensation 
they did not receive. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said he will accept no campaign contributions from insurance industry 
sources or trial lawyer organizations. The two groups often are in opposition 
on key insurance issues.

CLEAN AIR RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NONA YATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the proposed Environmental Protection Agency regulations would: 
</P>
<P>
 VEHICLES 
</P>
<P>
 * Mandate that 2% of all cars sold statewide by 1998 be zero-emission 
vehicles, such as electric cars. This is same as the state's existing standard, 
which the auto industry is trying to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shift responsibility for maintaining clean-burning cars from the consumer to 
vehicle manufacturers by expanding recall programs for cars and passenger 
trucks with faulty emission controls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require that businesses with 25 or more employees which offer free parking 
also offer their workers the cash value of the parking space. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish a special California emissions standard for heavy-duty trucks 
requiring them to be 60% cleaner than a national standard, beginning with 1999 
trucks. This might require trucks powered by methanol or other alternative 
fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require interstate trucks coming into California to meet the special 
emissions standard or make no more than one stop per trip in the Los Angeles 
Basin and two stops in the state. The idea is to force truckers to transfer 
their loads to cleaner-burning trucks at the state's border. 
</P>
<P>
 AIRCRAFT 
</P>
<P>
 * Require commercial airlines to reduce emissions from planes and associated 
equipment, such as ground service equipment, by meeting a declining amount of 
allowable emissions each year, 4% to 9% annually. Allowable limits would be 
based on 1990 passenger and cargo figures. Airlines would pay a fee on excess 
emissions. Take-off fees could be charged for private aircraft. Implementation 
would begin in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMERCIAL SHIPPING 
</P>
<P>
 * Charge ships docking in Los Angeles or Long Beach a fee based on how cleanly 
the engines operate. This might require ships to add catalytic controls or 
switch to turbine engines. Ships passing within 20 miles of the Ventura County 
coastline would be charged additional fees. Implementation would start in 2001 
to 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 BOATING 
</P>
<P>
 * Develop nationwide emission standards for gasoline-powered pleasure craft. 
Beginning with engines manufactured in 1998, new standards would require 
emissions reductions of 60% to 80%. Boaters would also be charged a fee of $90 
per day or $400 per year beginning in 2004 if they docked in the Los Angeles 
Basin. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCOMOTIVES 
</P>
<P>
 * Respond to a congressional mandate by developing nationwide emission 
standards for new locomotives which would limit nitrogen oxides in two phases, 
a 40% reduction in 2000 and a 60% reduction in 2005. Additional rules for the 
Los Angeles Basin would mandate a complete turnover of trains by 2010. This 
would probably mean use of alternative fuels in Los Angeles-area trains. NONA

CLINTON LETTER OPPOSES ANTI-GAY BALLOT INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton has given his support to homosexual rights groups with a 
letter strongly opposing anti-gay ballot initiatives in states across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who would legalize discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or 
any other grounds are gravely mistaken about the values that make our nation 
strong," Clinton said in a letter to the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. "The 
essential right to equality must not be denied by a ballot initiative or 
otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was dated Monday and -- with the blessing of the White House -- was 
released Tuesday by the group, a political action committee that supports 
openly gay candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of his presidency, Clinton found himself embroiled in a political 
controversy over his campaign pledge to lift the ban on gays in the military, 
an issue that the Administration has just managed to put behind it with the 
final release of Pentagon regulations on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 After that difficult beginning, the White House tried to recast Clinton's 
image in less liberal terms. But with his letter to the victory fund, Clinton 
placed himself in opposition to a major drive by conservative religious groups 
to promote such ballot measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory fund said at least 11 states are considering the initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton described the effort to defeat such measures as "a battle to protect 
the human rights of every individual" and said the "simple principle of 
justice" that people should be judged on their merits "has come under assault 
in several states this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's letter came five days after the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and 
other gay rights groups wrote to the President to ask for "a strong response" 
from him opposing such initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 William Waybourn, executive director of the victory fund, said he was 
surprised and pleased by the reply. He said he had gotten the signal from White 
House officials in advance of sending the letter that the Administration would 
be receptive to the request. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said he saw little political cost to Clinton 
in sending the letter. "He was going to have to take a position on it 
eventually," the official said of the ballot initiatives. "I don't think it's a 
big thing."

QUIET TOWN GRIEVES LIKE A FAMILY; COMMUNITY: 'WE LOST A COUPLE OF KIDS TODAY,' 
PALOS VERDES ESTATES CHIEF GARY JOHANSEN SAYS. SLAIN OFFICERS HAD A LOYAL 
FOLLOWING AMONG RESIDENTS AND COLLEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY and GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was somehow fitting that the worst tragedy in the history of the Palos 
Verdes Estates Police Department happened outside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 In a community where roof colors are regulated and homeowners are supposed to 
conceal their garbage cans from public view -- even on collection day -- 
residents boast that the crime rate is among the lowest in Los Angeles County 
because the city simply does not allow it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the kind of department that helps get your cat out of the tree," said 
Police Chief Gary Johansen, who has enough spare time to double as assistant 
city manager. "In most cities, cops have become the bad guys. We've managed to 
stay the good guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most respected of the good guys were Capt. Mike Tracy and Sgt. Tom 
Vanderpool, both killed Monday when a masked gunman opened fire in a conference 
room at a Torrance hotel. The men typified the department's low-key but highly 
dependable approach to policing, each attracting a loyal following in the 
community and among the 34 other employees in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy, 50, was deputy police chief and the longest-serving policeman on the 
tight-knit force. He briefly served as chief in the late 1980s and earned the 
South Bay Medal of Valor when he rappelled down a steep cliff and grabbed a man 
bent on suicide before he could jump to his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderpool, 57, was the department's oldest officer, playing Santa Claus at 
Christmas and acting as the city's self-described "widgetry sergeant," 
overseeing everything from training to vehicle maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a family, and we lost a couple of kids today," a grieving Johansen 
said outside police headquarters. "They are going to be very hard to replace." 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest and arguably proudest of four towns perched atop the exclusive 
Palos Verdes Peninsula, Palos Verdes Estates has always placed a high premium 
on its bucolic setting and relative isolation at the southern tip of Santa 
Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The community is so removed from the hustle and bustle of Los Angeles, police 
say out-of-town burglars often get nabbed on their way home after getting lost 
on the city's many winding, poorly lighted back streets. The No. 1 crime 
problem is vandalism, and Mayor Michael C. Moody said he could recall no murder 
since 1977, when a son killed his mother. (Police say there actually have been 
a few since then, but none in at least three years.) 
</P>
<P>
 With a median household income topping $100,000 a year and the average home 
selling for $600,000, Palos Verdes Estates belongs to the same class of 
affluent Los Angeles suburbs as Beverly Hills and San Marino. But it has never 
gained -- nor sought -- the limelight of its better-known counterparts, 
preferring to bask in the tranquillity of self-imposed obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is good living here, and people like it quiet," said Tom Johnson, a 
34-year resident who sells real estate. "Not too many people know it, but God 
spends his weekends here." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents describe the 4.5-square-mile town -- one-quarter of which is 
parkland -- as a place where neighbors look out for one another but generally 
keep to themselves. In 1989, when the city marked its 50th birthday, elected 
officials sponsored a festival only after floating the idea in a city 
newsletter. "We're a conservative community, and we don't celebrate much at 
all," the mayor explained at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has two small commercial districts that serve as unofficial town 
centers, the largest at Malaga Cove near City Hall and the police headquarters. 
But businesses have had a tough go of it, with most of the mom-and-pop shops at 
Malaga Cove Plaza closing during the real-estate boom of the 1980s, when rising 
land values forced them out and brought a slew of real estate companies and 
financial institutions to town. 
</P>
<P>
 The small commercial tax base has made it tough, despite the wealth of its 
residents, to keep the city running, forcing officials to seek special 
assessments to pay for many services. On several occasions, aspiring 
politicians have proposed cutting the budget by eliminating the Police 
Department, but as Johnson said, those politicians enjoyed very brief careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have something good, you don't want to mess with it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city of 13,500 pays a hefty price of $2.8 million a year -- more than 
half of its operating budget -- to maintain its distinction as the only 
peninsula city with a police department, the others having contracts with the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 That distinction has helped build a strong bond between residents and 
officers, one that was apparent Tuesday as dozens of people paid tribute to the 
dead officers by placing flowers outside the police station and making monetary 
donations to their families. One card was signed, "Just one of PV's grateful 
residents," while others listed family names and organizations across the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "A precious piece of innocence was taken away, and I am really (angry) about 
it," said a teary-eyed man who tossed a bouquet of flowers on the grass outside 
police headquarters. Identifying himself only as 38-year-old Ross, the man said 
he drove from Tarzana to pay tribute to the downed officers, both of whom he 
knew as a kid growing up in Palos Verdes Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept you honest, but not in a heavy-handed way," he said, recalling 
stories of Vanderpool scolding him after chasing him off an open field on his 
motorcycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who stopped by the police station had memories of two men who had long 
been an integral part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of them were those rare officers who always had a smile, always had a 
joke," said Alicia Dunn of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some Palos Verdes Estates officers eventually move on because of the 
town's sleepy reputation, most of the 23 sworn officers are longtime veterans, 
attracted by the pretty setting and deliberate pace. Indeed, some chose the job 
because of the pastoral duty, a job where officer shootings could never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tracy and Vanderpool, most of the force cannot afford to live in the city 
where they work, with the city's top cop earning far less than the median 
household income. But in a deal worked out with city officials, Johansen and 
several officers live in town in multimillion-dollar homes overlooking the 
Pacific Ocean. The city purchased the homes after they were damaged in a 
landslide and allow the officers to live there in exchange for maintaining 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is a good deal because we are glad to have them in the city, 
nearby in the event of an emergency," Mayor Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 In police recounts of what happened Monday when the gunman barged in, 
Vanderpool was the one who stepped forward first to take the gunman down. And 
the person right beside him, no more than five feet away, was Tracy. The two 
deaths were the first fatalities on the Palos Verdes Estates Police Department 
since it was founded in 1939.

<P>
 Vanderpool had plans for Monday evening. It was Valentine's Day, but more 
important, it was his 36th wedding anniversary. He planned to have dinner with 
his wife, Billy Jean. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, there was the training session with his colleagues. It took place 
at the Torrance Holiday Inn, where, coincidentally, he and Billy Jean six years 
ago held a reception to celebrate their 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanderpool was a member of the Los Angeles Police Department for 10 years 
before quitting to run a laundry business. But he returned to police work with 
the Palos Verdes Estates department in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Promoted in 1986, he was the personnel training sergeant, the reserve 
coordinator and supervised community relations. He had also played Santa to 
families for the last seven years, delivering toys, clothing and blankets at 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy was the kind of guy who last Friday brought flowers to every woman in 
the Police Department as a Valentine's gift. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the department in 1969 after a brief stint as a policeman in Garden 
Grove. Six years later, Tracy was presented with the South Bay Medal of Valor. 
He also assisted in the recovery of a kidnaped 1-year-old boy in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance policeman Ed Webb was helping with patrolling duties at Palos Verdes 
Estates Tuesday in the aftermath of the shootings. He said he had known Tracy 
for many years and characterized him as a "take-charge kind of guy." 
</P>
<P>
 And of his attempt to disarm the gunman, Webb said, "that sounds just like his 
style." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like them to be remembered as heroes," Johansen said. "They stepped in, 
in front of a guy with a gun in each hand who was threatening 13 people in that 
room, and their actions saved our lives."

JURY TO GET TRADE CENTER BOMB CASE LATER IN WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge said Tuesday that he planned to present the World Trade Center 
bombing case to jurors later this week and expected them to start deliberations 
after the three-day Presidents Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Kevin T. Duffy announced the timetable on a day when a 
federal prosecutor spent five more hours finishing closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Duffy said defense lawyers will start their final presentations this morning 
on behalf of the four defendants charged in the terrorist explosion last Feb. 
26 that killed six persons and injured more than 1,000 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Henry DePippo, who began his summation on Monday, spent 
much of Tuesday talking about an apartment in New Jersey that he termed "a bomb 
factory." 
</P>
<P>
 During 18 weeks of testimony by more than 200 witnesses, the prosecution 
showed the apartment had been rented in 1992 by Mohammed A. Salameh, the 
principal defendant, and was shared by Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a mysterious Iraqi 
who fled the United States only hours after the explosion and is under 
indictment as a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 DePippo said a pair of acid-stained shoes belonging to Mahmud Abouhalima, 
another defendant, as well as 50 phone calls to and from the apartment to 
Abouhalima's home showed his hand in the bomb-making. Abouhalima fled to his 
native Egypt several days after the blast, but was seized by Egyptian 
authorities and turned over to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there were 84 phone calls the month before the bombing between 
the phone in the apartment and a third defendant, Nidal Ayyad, a chemical 
engineer who gave advice on mixing the explosives, DePippo told the jury. Other 
records showed Ayyad helped in purchasing chemicals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found the walls and carpeting in the apartment streaked with 
chemical residues. 
</P>
<P>
 Salameh, the first man arrested last March, has acknowledged renting a yellow 
van used to carry the bomb into the trade center. But he has claimed the 
vehicle was stolen from him the night before the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 A fourth defendant, Ahmad Ajaj, is charged in the conspiracy chiefly on 
grounds he brought bomb-making manuals and special training videos into the 
United States in September, 1992. Ajaj was in jail on immigration violations at 
the time of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the defendants face a maximum punishment of life imprisonment 
without parole.

ACCUSED PLEADS GUILTY TO KILLING 5 FLORIDA STUDENTS; CRIME: LAWYER SAYS DANNY 
ROLLING WANTS TO SPARE FAMILIES A PUBLIC AIRING OF GRUESOME DETAILS. A JURY 
WILL DECIDE IF HE IS TO DIE IN THE ELECTRIC CHAIR. 
</P>

<P>
 Louisiana drifter Danny Harold Rolling surprised a Gainesville courtroom by 
pleading guilty Tuesday to the 1990 mutilation murders of five college 
students, heralding the end of one of the most wrenching chapters in Florida 
criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been running from first one thing and then another all my life, whether 
from problems at home, or with the law, or from myself," Rolling, 39, told the 
court just before jury selection for his murder trial was to begin. "But there 
are some things that you just can't run from, and this being one of those." 
</P>
<P>
 Circuit Judge Stan R. Morris accepted Rolling's guilty pleas to five counts of 
murder and three counts each of sexual battery and armed burglary in the serial 
killings that traumatized Gainesville just as the fall term at the University 
of Florida got underway 3 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling has been in custody since Sept. 7, 1990, about a week after the last 
of the bodies was discovered, when he was arrested for a supermarket robbery in 
Ocala. But more than a year went by before DNA evidence taken from blood and 
semen samples at the murder scenes linked him to the crimes, and during that 
time the north Florida college town was haunted by the grisly slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the pleading answered the question of guilt, a jury will be chosen 
beginning today to decide if Rolling is to die in Florida's electric chair. He 
has already been sentenced to three life terms in prison as an armed robber and 
career criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Rick Parker, Rolling's public defender, said his client decided three 
weeks ago to plead guilty to spare the families of his victims a public airing 
of the gruesome details of the murders. "He thinks it is the right thing to 
do," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the jury picked to recommend Rolling's sentence is likely to hear more 
than they wish about the brutal killings of the four women and one man. One of 
the female victims was decapitated, three were raped and all were stabbed 
several times. The bodies of the four women were also posed, investigators 
said, to shock whoever discovered them. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said that although Rolling was competent to enter the guilty pleas, "he 
is and has been since before these crimes mentally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony from experts about Rolling's mental state, Parker said, "will be 
helpful in understanding how the same person can rape and murder then later 
regret these acts and feel compassion for the living loved ones surviving his 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the victims, many of whom were in the courtroom Tuesday, found 
that hard to take. "I have no pity for this individual," said Mario Taboada, 
whose brother, Manuel, died at Rolling's hands. "This is a life form gone bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students at Florida's largest state university, most of whom were not on 
campus when the killings occurred, expressed relief that they would not have to 
relive the horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Added university President John Lombardi: "On the one hand, we're delighted 
there is clear closure as to the question of guilt. But on the other, nobody 
will have closure to the pain, to the loss, the scar it leaves on your soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Rod Smith said no deals were made with Rolling in exchange for his 
guilty pleas, and he vowed to seek the death penalty. "We now know who is the 
slayer of the students in Gainesville," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said Rolling will fight to avoid execution, and wants to testify during 
the upcoming penalty phase. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Rolling, which included DNA evidence as well as statements 
from a cellmate, was constructed by a multi-agency task force that employed 
more than 200 investigators and spent more than $5 million. Some 148 witnesses 
were scheduled to testify at the trial, which was expected to last up to 10 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The nightmare in Gainesville began on Aug. 26, 1990, when the bodies of 
University of Florida students Christina Powell, 17, and Sonja Larson, 18, were 
found in the off-campus apartment they shared. Powell had been raped, and both 
had been stabbed to death. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, Christa Hoyt, an 18-year-old student at Santa Fe Community 
College, failed to show up for work as a records clerk in the Sheriff's 
Department. Police checking her apartment found her dead of multiple stab 
wounds. She also had been beheaded. 
</P>
<P>
 As hundreds of students left town, and hundreds more bought firearms and 
chemical Mace for protection, two more bodies were found the next day, Aug. 28. 
University of Florida pre-law student Tracy Paules and Santa Fe student Manuel 
Taboada, both 23, longtime friends from Miami, were found dead in their 
apartment. Surprised as they slept, they too had been repeatedly stabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling, who once shot his father, a retired police officer, in the face 
during an argument, is also a suspect in a triple murder in his hometown of 
Shreveport, La. Police there point to detailed similarities between the 
Gainesville slayings and the November, 1989, stabbing deaths of college student 
Julie Grissom, her father and an 8-year-old nephew. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caddo Parish Dist. Atty. Paul Carmouche said Tuesday that authorities 
still lacked enough evidence to charge Rolling. "If he's in a confession mode 
and wants to talk about Shreveport, the Shreveport police are on call," 
Carmouche said.

EMPLOYEE OPENS FIRE IN TULSA RESTAURANT, WOUNDING 6 PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fast-food restaurant employee whose Valentine's Day advances reportedly had 
been rebuffed opened fire Tuesday, wounding the woman, his boss and four other 
people during the lunch-hour rush. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Muriel Thompson, 26, went to Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers before 
his shift was to begin Tuesday and got angry when he was asked to start working 
immediately, Police Sgt. Steve Emmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the disagreement with the manager in the office, Thompson "came out in 
the seating area and had everybody lie down. He hesitated a bit, then just 
started firing," Emmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 He fired 10 to 12 shots, then walked out of the restaurant as the first police 
cruisers arrived and surrendered, Emmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at a back table and didn't get to get out," said high school student 
Jenny Edwards. "He started shooting all my friends. And then he came to me and 
held the gun right in my face. And he said, 'You better be awful lucky.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman, armed with a .380-caliber handgun, asked her if she believed in 
God. "I said yes. He said, 'The clip is out,' " Edwards told radio station 
KVOO. "And then he started running toward the front." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Edwards' fellow students at East Central High School were among the 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The first person shot was 17-year-old Ericka Osborn, witnesses and police 
said. Thompson had pursued Osborn for a date several times, said her mother, 
Susan Davis. He was rebuffed on Valentine's Day only minutes before a dozen red 
roses arrived for Osborn from her boyfriend, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager who asked Thompson to start work early, Doug Bowen, 37, was in 
serious condition with a head wound. Osborn was in fair condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacy Burgess, 15, was shot five times in the stomach and was listed in stable 
condition. Heather Rowe, 16, was in fair condition with a leg wound. Richard 
Goldrick, 47, was in fair condition and Christina Ferris, 16, was treated and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, also known as Marcus Benson, was booked into the county jail on six 
complaints of shooting with intent to kill. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was led into the jail, Thompson told reporters: "God, I love America."

EX-JUSTICE OFFICIAL ASSAILS SENATE'S HARD-LINE CRIME BILL; LEGISLATION: THE 
DEPARTMENT'S FORMER NO. 2 MAN TAKES AIM AT MANY OF THE GET-TOUGH PROPOSALS AS 
WASTEFUL, ILL-CONCEIVED AND DOOMED TO FAILURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The former No. 2 official at the Justice Department on Tuesday condemned many 
hard-line provisions of the Senate crime bill as exceedingly wasteful and 
doomed to failure. "Politics have overwhelmed reason," Philip B. Heymann, who 
left office Monday as deputy attorney general, said in remarks unusually abrupt 
for a recently departed high Administration official. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has to be frank about this," Heymann said. "Somebody has to talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann, whose sharp criticism of the crime bill contrasts with some public 
statements coming from the White House, announced his resignation last month, 
citing differences of "chemistry" and "operational and management styles" 
between him and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to make truth or common sense or frankness work on this issue 
ever -- let alone now," said Heymann, who headed a criminal law center at 
Harvard University and ran the Justice Department's criminal division during 
the Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion polls have shown that crime and violence, driven by reports of 
sensational crimes, have supplanted the economy as the leading concern of 
Americans today. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering a briefcase bulging with studies and data to support his arguments, 
Heymann took aim at such highly popular provisions of the Senate crime bill as 
the three-strikes-and-you're-out provision, which would sentence criminals to 
life without possibility of parole after their third violent offense, and the 
construction of regional federal prisons for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized provisions that would expand the use of mandatory minimum 
sentences and federalize many state and local crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a meeting with reporters, Heymann declined to discuss what happened 
when he raised such arguments at the Justice Department or the White House 
before his resignation. In announcing his departure last month, Heymann said 
there were no "philosophical differences" between him and Reno and "no 
precipitating episode (or) disagreement on some particular matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann said Tuesday that he had told Reno, Acting Deputy Atty. Gen. Jo Ann 
Harris and Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell that he was going discuss his 
opposition to the crime bill and "none objected in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes proposal, which has been embraced by President Clinton in 
concept, is so broad that it includes "everything in sight," Heymann said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, under the legislation a 25-year-old violator convicted 
of three armed robberies would have to serve 30 years more than the 25-year 
sentence he would otherwise likely receive. "Those last 30 years -- from age 50 
to 80 -- he would be very unlikely to commit a street robbery," Heymann said. 
"We don't have very many 50-year-old robbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of imprisoning the convict would be $20,000 to $30,000 a year for 
each of the 30 years, Heymann said, enough to cover the health care costs of 
150 families for a single year. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking aim at the proposed expansion of mandatory minimum sentences, Heymann 
cited the findings of a Justice Department study of mandatory sentences given 
out under existing federal law. The study found that 21% of federal prisoners 
serving mandatory minimum terms had no prior violations and played no 
significant role in any drug organization, yet had drawn longer sentences than 
criminals who committed very violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "My point is that we are filling federal prisons with people who are not 
particularly dangerous," said Heymann, who has noted that release of the study 
has been held up at the request of presidential counselor David Gergen. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann also criticized provisions of the bill calling for construction of 
federal regional prisons to house state prisoners who commit violent offenses. 
Under the bill, taxpayers would pay $2.5 billion to build the 25,000 cells -- a 
cost of $100,000 a cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be spent, he said, even though half of the 800,000 to 900,000 
prisoners now in state penitentiaries are serving time for nonviolent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 On provisions of the bill that would turn state offenses into federal crimes, 
Heymann noted that the number of federal agents to investigate crimes is 
slightly declining -- not increasing to handle a broader jurisdiction. "It 
sounds so terrific," he said with obvious sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Heymann refused to discuss how government officials dealt with his 
criticisms, he did say the Administration's strategy had been to support the 
Senate and House leaders on an issue that mushroomed late last year. "What 
happened was that in many ways the issue overtook us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heymann repeatedly emphasized that he was not making light of the crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have a bigger scandal than that. In many places, Americans 
can't live without a grave risk of violence," he said. The U.S. rate of 
violence is five to six times that of other Western countries, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of his own support for tough steps to counter violence, Heymann 
said he advocated keeping certain violent criminals behind bars until "they're 
reasonably safe," cracking down on guns on the street even if such efforts 
tread on privacy rights, and forfeiting the cars of young people found to 
contain guns. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Stern, Reno's chief spokesman, brushed aside the suggestion that 
Heymann's comments revealed an Administration rift over the crime issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lively discussion inside the (Justice) department, as there has 
been elsewhere as to the content" of the crime bill, Stern said. "The precise 
content is still being formulated. . . . We're certainly discussing the kinds 
of concerns Phil has raised."

HEALTH PLAN ADDS CHOICES, FIRST LADY SAYS; MEDICINE: IN DEFENDING THE PROPOSED 
REFORMS, SHE DENIES THEY WOULD LEAD TO A GOVERNMENT-RUN SYSTEM. INSURANCE FIRMS 
CRITICIZED FOR POLICY LIMITATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a spirited defense of President Clinton's health reform proposal, First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Tuesday that the plan she helped design will 
increase consumer choice of medical providers and will not lead to a 
government-run system, as critics claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavishly praising doctors and nurses, Mrs. Clinton also characterized the 
reform effort as a battle against the insurance industry, which she blamed for 
having created "probably the stupidest financing system in the world for health 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady also touted a universal benefits package under the 
Administration's plan that would not impose lifetime limits, as most policies 
now do. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current system, she said, "if you get really sick and you spend 
whatever that limit is -- and some policies have limits as low as $50,000, 
others have millions -- but once you hit that limit, you are not insurable 
anymore unless you pay a huge, huge increase in your premiums." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton also took aim at insurance companies for barring coverage for 
people with "pre-existing medical conditions" -- a practice that would be 
prohibited under the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning so much about the human gene system, and what genes cause 
various diseases, that by the turn of the century, every one of us is going to 
have a pre-existing condition. If we don't hurry up and get this health care 
system reformed, none of us is going to be able to afford insurance at the rate 
we're going." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady's remarks to an American Legion conference here were the 
Administration's staunchest defense yet of a plan that has come under intense 
attack this month, largely from business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Clinton's 1,342-page prescription "cannot 
even be used as a starting point" because "it proposes such a burden of high 
employer premium contributions, rich benefits and counterproductive regulation. 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton said: "Now you're going to hear a lot, as you already have, about 
how the government is going to take over health care. That is not the 
President's plan at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's plan," she said, "is designed to simplify our system to get 
it to the point where we can put doctors and nurses back in charge of this 
system again, where they can be making the decisions -- not insurance company 
executives or government bureaucrats." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton also urged her audience not to believe a particular TV 
advertisement sponsored by health insurers that assert Clinton's plan will 
reduce consumer choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's just flat untrue," she said. "In fact, we're going to give you 
more choice because the choice is not going to be your employer's, and the 
choice is not going to be the government's. The choice is going to be yours to 
make." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clinton plan, government-appointed regional health care alliances 
will designate various coverage plans -- including health maintenance 
organizations and insurance-company sponsored organizations -- from which local 
residents can choose. In theory, residents would have more choices than they 
currently enjoy under most employer-sponsored health plans.

CONGRESS HEARS BOTH VIEWS ON FORCING BALANCED BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House took its campaign against a balanced-budget amendment to 
Congress on Tuesday, as four Cabinet officers told lawmakers that the 
requirement would undermine national security and devastate programs like 
Medicare and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 With the issue expected to come to a head later this month in the Senate, 
supporters and opponents of a constitutional amendment to require a balanced 
budget by the year 2001 presented their arguments at rival hearings on Capitol 
Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can study the past 25 years of successive deficits without recognizing 
that there has been governmental abuse that must be halted," Sen. Paul Simon 
(D-Ill.), chief Senate sponsor of the balanced-budget amendment, said at the 
outset of hearings that his Judiciary subcommittee is holding this week. 
</P>
<P>
 One floor below, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.), the amendment's chief Senate 
opponent, argued that budget deficits cannot simply be "wished away . . . 
through incantations." Byrd made the remarks as the Appropriations Committee he 
chairs opened its own weeklong set of hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each hearing was a one-sided affair, with Byrd and Simon taking testimony only 
from witnesses who supported their respective positions. And, while 
well-scripted, the hearings offered insights into the arguments that will be 
aired later on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 To win approval, the amendment would have to be passed by two-thirds 
majorities in the House and Senate and then ratified by three-quarters of the 
states. House passage is considered certain, but the Senate vote is expected to 
be close. 
</P>
<P>
 Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala, testifying before Byrd's 
committee, warned that a constitutional requirement to balance the budget would 
crush popular entitlement programs like Social Security and derail Clinton's 
efforts to reform health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me assure those who believe that both health reform and a balanced-budget 
amendment are possible that they are dreaming," Shalala said. "A vote for the 
amendment is a vote to gouge Medicare and Medicaid . . . (and) a vote to 
destroy the promise of guaranteed private insurance for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon's panel heard former senator and presidential candidate Paul E. Tsongas 
issue an equally apocalyptic warning: "The leadership of our country in both 
parties lacks the political will to balance the federal budget." And unless a 
way is found to force that will upon them, he said, "our children's future will 
be bankrupted" by mountains of federal debt. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stanley, president of the conservative National Taxpayers Union, said 
the danger posed by the current system "is the economic collapse of our nation 
and the destruction of our people's jobs, standard of living and retirement 
income caused by the rising, crushing burden of debt." 
</P>
<P>
 At Byrd's hearing, three other Cabinet officials joined Shalala in denouncing 
the amendment. Budget Director Leon E. Panetta, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry warned of the massive budget cuts and steep 
tax increases that would be required by Simon's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "A balanced-budget amendment . . . represents perhaps the ultimate budget 
gimmick: A constitutional provision that has no effect at all on reducing the 
deficit," argued Panetta, who said it would "degrade the Constitution and . . . 
shake the public trust in government."

SAN DIEGO DEFENSE CONTRACTOR RAIDED IN FRAUD PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Military investigators raided the offices of defense contractor Science 
Applications International Corp. in San Diego on Tuesday to investigate alleged 
fraud in the Army's Comanche helicopter program. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen agents of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, an 
arm of the U.S. Defense Department, and the U.S. Air Force Office of Special 
Investigations entered the SAIC complex at about 10 a.m. Tuesday and carted 
away dozens of boxes of documents. 
</P>
<P>
 SAIC is developing liquid crystal displays used in the control panels of the 
helicopter, a scout aircraft that is under development. SAIC is one of the 
nation's biggest defense research firms with more individual contracts, 4,000, 
than any other U.S. defense contractor. The employee-owned company reported 
more than $1 billion in revenue last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, SAIC said it would not comment on the "as yet-unknown 
allegations" and that it was "fully cooperating in this investigation."

DANA PARSONS: A TRYING CASE OF HUMAN EMOTIONS VS. LEGAL MOTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some celebrated legal defense strategies (the Bobbitt and Menendez cases, for 
example) have many people wondering recently what juries are thinking about 
when it comes to personal responsibility for criminal acts. People seem to be 
getting away with, in the most dire cases, murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Given defense attorneys' success, why should we be surprised that prosecutors 
want to get in on the act too? 
</P>
<P>
 So here comes the Orange County district attorney, wanting to convict Jose 
Garcia of murder. No, Garcia didn't kill anyone in the conventional sense; the 
accusation is that, while drunk on May 22, 1992, he raped Mary Ward, a 
79-year-old woman, who died a month later of complications from lung cancer and 
kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney is trying Garcia for murder, on the theory that the rape 
so traumatized and devastated Mary Ward psychologically that it hastened her 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution effort would turn the cult of victimology on its head -- the 
D.A. would move us away from the position that argues in the extreme that no 
one is responsible for anything to the position that a person is responsible 
for everything . 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, not yet 21 years old and not much over 5 feet tall and weighing about 
130 pounds, is an unlikely looking criminal. He is some 50 to 60 pounds smaller 
than was his victim. There is no swagger or tough-guy look to him at all. For 
the two days I attended his trial this week, he entered the courtroom with head 
bowed (even though the jury was still out in the hallway) and sat almost 
motionless at the defense table, permanently hunched at the shoulders. 
Possessor of only minimal English understanding, he wears headphones as a court 
interpreter translates what's being said into Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Deputy Public Defender Leonard Gumlia, isn't contesting that 
Garcia raped Mary Ward. Gumlia asked his own witness, a doctor from 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, what he thought of the crime of rape. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor, Gregory Sarna, described rape as "unconscionable" and added, "I 
have absolutely no sympathy whatsoever for a rapist." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumlia then asked Sarna, a cancer specialist, if the rape contributed to 
Ward's death. Sarna, who testified he has treated between 4,000 and 5,000 
cancer patients, said emphatically that it did not. "I'm surprised the issue is 
even being raised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarna's testimony followed that of Ward's personal physician, cardiologist 
N.R. Devaraj, who first met her in 1982. He testified that the attack "affected 
her significantly" and that it "might have curtailed, somehow, her will to 
fight and (her) determination to live." 
</P>
<P>
 But under Gumlia's questioning, Devaraj conceded that he was expressing a 
personal opinion and not a medical one. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury of six women and six men, which can generally be characterized as 
white and middle-aged, shows signs of being numbed by the medical information. 
They have heard medical terms like "creatinine" and "brachiocephalic" and 
"superior vena cava." 
</P>
<P>
 During a short recess the other day, one juror said jokingly to another 
outside the courtroom: "Anyone else falling asleep?" 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Francisco P. Briseno must have picked up on that in court, because upon 
the jury's return, he gently and humorously reminded them that all evidence is 
potentially important and that their duty is to pay attention to everything 
that is said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarna struck me as a strong witness, noting that Ward's cancer had gone 
undetected for at least a couple months before her death, that the small-cell 
carcinoma she had was already incurable and that, after being hospitalized in 
the weeks following the rape, she was subjected to tests that contributed to 
her kidney failure. That renal failure, along with her advanced cancer, led to 
her death and within the time span normally expected for that diagnosis, Sarna 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But even while listening to Sarna, I found myself thinking about the jury. How 
much stock will they put in complicated medical evidence? Will their personal 
intuition or experience tell them that an elderly woman's frame of mind must 
have been damaged by a brutal assault? Will they tell themselves that they know 
that a person's outlook can improve a cancer prognosis, although Sarna took 
pains to tell them just the opposite? And perhaps most importantly, will the 
jury be so repulsed by Garcia's assault that they decide to convict him of 
murder, even if they're not certain of the legalese? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is probably a week or more away, based on Gumlia's witness 
timetable. As we've seen in other controversial cases, juries are impossible to 
read. Deputy Dist. Atty. David La Bahn seemed to be pounding away on the fact 
that Ward's life was shortened by at least some unspecified number of days or 
weeks, and that Garcia must be held accountable for that. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Gumlia wants the jury to get past their feelings about Garcia 
and accept that Mary Ward died because cancer and kidney failure worked at 
their own lethal pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that ever worried me about this case is the emotion and anger 
that could be directed at Mr. Garcia," Gumlia said after court this week. 
"That's always been my major concern. If the jury can keep that in perspective, 
they will understand there was no shortening of life in this case."

INQUIRY FINDS NO RACE BIAS AT MIDDLE SCHOOL; EDUCATION: PARENTS OF LATINO, 
AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS HAD CITED 14 INCIDENTS. CAPISTRANO DISTRICT PLEDGES 
MORE SENSITIVITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 School officials here announced Tuesday that they cannot substantiate charges 
of discrimination against minority students at Aliso Viejo Middle School, but 
they pledged to improve racial harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have determined that there is no evidence of racism or discriminatory 
treatment at the school," Capistrano Unified School District Supt. James A. 
Fleming said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added, the district "recognizes the need for the school staff, as 
well as employees throughout the school district, to improve communication and 
enhance their sensitivity and treatment of minority children." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said he based his conclusions on a district panel's two-month 
investigation into charges leveled by African American and Latino parents at a 
meeting of district trustees Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents complained that minority students at Aliso Viejo Middle School had 
been harassed, falsely accused of being gang members and ridiculed in front of 
classmates by school administrators and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges tarnished the image of the new school, heralded as a 
forward-looking educational facility with a state-of-the-art information system 
and computer lab when it opened in October in a quiet valley in the planned 
community of Aliso Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the school's 800 students, 87% are white, 6% are Latino, 4% are Asian and 
3% are black. 
</P>
<P>
 Before making his findings public, Fleming met with some of the concerned 
parents for about an hour Tuesday morning. In an interview afterward, Fleming 
described the meeting as "productive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not perceive any animosity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attending the closed-door meeting were district administrators and seven 
members of the African American Parents and Concerned Citizens of South Orange 
County, who organized the effort to make the complaints public. Four of the 
seven from the African American group were either parents or grandparents of 
Aliso Viejo Middle School students, Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Lathan, the organization's education coordinator and spokeswoman, said 
Tuesday that the group would "not comment at this time" on the district's 
report or the meeting with Fleming. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said in an interview that district administrators began a prompt 
investigation, calling parents of African American and Latino students the day 
after the charges were aired. 
</P>
<P>
 In those conversations, the 27 African American and 72 Latino parents reported 
14 incidents involving their children that they felt resulted from racial 
insensitivity or bias. The cases were evenly divided between the ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district's panel investigated 21 specific charges, some of them taken from 
newspaper reports based on the parents' complaints. None of the charges 
constituted acts of racism or discrimination, Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Fleming said some of the situations could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking at those 21 cases, we did find some instances in which the 
misunderstanding might not have occurred if there were better communications at 
the time," Fleming said. "We also found some situations that might have been 
seen as insensitive. . . . We're learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Distrust and miscommunication resulted from a number of factors at the school, 
Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school was not ready for occupancy until October, so its students and 
teachers, who came from other schools and were not familiar with each other, 
were thrown together for the first two months of the school year in cramped 
conditions at Niguel Middle School in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, teachers and administrators were being directed to carry out 
new, stricter discipline and dress-code policies that the district had adopted 
to quell the glorification of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a combination of juxtapositions coming together" when the school was 
"without that past knowledge, that trust factor and the relationships that 
develop over time," Fleming said. "Once (the suspicion of discrimination) 
started, then it spread like wildfire and everything that happened after that 
was misperceived." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Fleming said one complaint that was investigated dealt with a 
white student and an African American student who cut into a lunch line. A 
staff member pointed the white student to the end of the line but sent the 
African American student to serve detention. 
</P>
<P>
 To some students who witnessed the situation it appeared discriminatory, 
Fleming said. But the reality, he said, was that the African American student 
had been caught committing such an offense twice before and was being punished 
more strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said the district's report has been forwarded to the U.S. Department 
of Education's Office of Civil Rights in San Francisco for review. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also plans to hire a mediator to bring the school's principal, 
staff and teachers together with concerned parents to discuss their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are strong and strident feelings on both sides," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said he has asked the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, the Asian 
Pacific Legal Center, the Orange County Commission on Human Relations and the 
American Civil Liberties Union to advise the district on how to improve race 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Viejo's principal, Cheryl Lampe, who had been the focus of many of the 
parents' complaints, said she welcomed the report's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really pleased that the investigation is over and that we can get back to 
the business of educating students," said Lampe, who was a teacher and 
principal in the racially diverse Hawthorne School District before being hired 
to head Aliso Viejo last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dave Chamberlain, one of the school's 35 teachers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this ends any actions by students or parents who feel that there 
are things that are going on that aren't. We don't treat people differently 
based on their race. We treat people differently based on their behaviors." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the complaints were aired, Lampe and the school's Parent Teacher Student 
Assn. have scheduled several workshops, meetings, assemblies and classes 
dealing with cultural diversity and racial prejudice. Counselors from the YMCA 
and Los Angeles County's Community Service Program have been brought in to hold 
weekly sessions with groups of students who want to discuss racial concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Wednesday, in an exchange program coordinated with Lampe's former school, 
Aliso Viejo's students will meet those from the racially diverse Hawthorne 
Intermediate School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been moving forward very proactively and I have a sense that people are 
feeling better about the situation," Lampe said. "We're just looking forward."

A NEW TRADITION; HISTORY, THEORY, EVEN FEMINISM MARK JEWISH EDUCATION WEEK 
TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual exploration of their heritage, Orange County Jews young and old 
are gathering this week to learn about topics as diverse as "How to Refute 
Missionaries" and "Male and Female Roles in the Bible." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the sudden rush for knowledge: Jewish Education Week, 
proclaimed by the County Board of Supervisors at the urging of the nonprofit 
Bureau of Jewish Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers hope the four daily lunch-and-learn sessions held at businesses and 
community centers throughout the county this week will show the Jewish 
community that religious education is dynamic, provocative and may even be the 
answer to national leaders' fears that American Jews are losing touch with 
their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big discussion nationally is how to make the Jewish people survive. Well, 
we think it's education," said program organizer Joan Kaye, executive director 
of the Bureau of Jewish Education, as a roomful of participants nearby analyzed 
Dr. Robin Goldberg's feminist interpretation of the Book of Genesis. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't think that's sexy. They think of Hebrew school and many of them 
probably had bad experiences as youngsters. But this is Jewish education," Kaye 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event kicked off Friday with a tribute to Jewish educators at synagogues 
countywide. The lunchtime study sessions began Monday and continue through 
Thursday. Sessions still to come today and Thursday include "Suing Your Rabbi 
-- Clergy, Malpractice and Jewish Law," and "A View of Suffering in Jewish 
Tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 25, the Board of Supervisors proclaimed Feb. 11-18 Jewish Education 
Week on a motion by Supervisor Thomas F. Riley. The gesture thrilled organizers 
like Kaye, but she said the purpose of the discussions is to enlighten the 
Jewish community and honor Jewish educators -- not to spread knowledge of 
Jewish religion and history to non-Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 That, she said, is a task yet to be tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to combine the idea of everybody studying, for free, in a lot of 
different places . . . open to the public (with the of honoring) Jewish 
teachers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, about 3,000 students attend Jewish schools, which are run by 
most of the county's 21 synagogues, Kaye said. To commemorate this week's 
events, teachers compiled a small book of their students' writings about being 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular events, however, proved to be the lunchtime learning 
sessions, some of which included lunch spreads of bagels, cream cheese and lox. 
The discussions attracted participants ranging from 9-year-old James Van 
Tatenhove of Irvine to 76-year-old Ruth Cohen of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a whole different way of looking at things," said 42-year-old Lauren 
Packard of Laguna Beach, after sitting in Goldberg's session. "It's wonderful 
to have a feminist outlook on the Bible."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lunch sessions provided an opportunity for others to share their 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Davida Gregory said she has been trying for years to draw attention to the 
plight of developmentally disabled children and other Jewish children who need 
to be institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great need in the Jewish community for homes for kids who are 
developmentally disabled," said Gregory, 46, of Irvine, who attended a Monday 
session by Rabbi Jane Litman titled "Educating the Community About 
Non-Traditional Families." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregory proudly showed off a picture of her own family, a mix of stepchildren 
and foster kids of varied ethnic and religious backgrounds, some of them with 
developmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's Lutheran homes, there's Baptist homes, there's Catholic homes -- but 
there is no Jewish home," she said. "I'd really like the Jewish community to 
become more aware of this population, because they can't speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Litman's Laguna Beach congregation, Kol Simcha, caters to the gay and lesbian 
community. Most of the people who attended her session, however, didn't need 
much convincing that Jews must more publicly acknowledge diversity within their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brea woman at Litman's session said she started a support group for Jewish 
parents of gays and lesbians when her son came out to her four years ago. She 
asked that her name not be used to protect her son's privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 She attended the discussion to meet other parents like herself and to learn 
what more she can do to break traditional stereotypes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the study sessions are an encouraging sign that Orange County's 
Jewish community is coming together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Orange County Jewish community is still trying to create its own 
pathways and networks," said Phyllis Lerner of Huntington Beach, who attended 
Goldberg's session on male and female roles in the Bible. "It's a very 
Christian-dominated county." 
</P>
<P>
 To Kaye, the keen interest in the lunch sessions -- about 150 people attended 
on Monday and Tuesday -- is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it brings the community together," she said. "Orange County has not 
been known for its Jewish community, but there's a tremendous hunger (for 
knowledge) here."

BOLSA CHICA ARCHEOLOGIST RECEIVES BULLET WITH HER NAME IN MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The archeologist who unearthed what some believe to be ancient Native American 
bones in the Bolsa Chica Wetlands reported to police that she received a 3-inch 
bullet in the mail, engraved with a Native American slogan and her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked," said Nancy Whitney-Desautels, the archeologist hired by the 
Koll Real Estate Group to excavate a 7.4-acre site near the wetlands in 
preparation for a proposed housing development. "I went numb for at least half 
an hour. Others had to prod me to call the police." 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet was engraved with the slogan "Remember Our Ancestors" and her name. 
It was mailed in a padded envelope and to a post office box for her research 
firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Desautels, who opened it on Friday, said she has been living in various hotel 
rooms ever since in fear for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to keep a low profile," she said from her office on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Remember Our Ancestors" is the slogan of the Ti'at Society based in Long 
Beach, one of several Native American groups that have been critical of 
Desautels' work in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindi Alvitre, the society's director, said Tuesday that her group had nothing 
to do with any threat to Desautels. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what we're about," she said. "We're into maritime culture, not 
bullets. There would be no reason for us to do anything like that: We're not 
after life; we're after truth." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Huntington Beach Police Department said it referred the 
case to the FBI. Gary Morley, a special agent with the FBI in Santa Ana, said 
bureau policy prohibited him from saying whether the FBI was investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy over the excavation of the wetlands erupted last month when it was 
publicly revealed that Desautels and her associates had unearthed several human 
bone fragments believed to be 8,000-year-old Native American remains. Last 
Saturday, about 60 demonstrators on the steps of Huntington Beach City Hall, 
including Alvitre, protested the disturbance of their ancestors' remains. 
</P>
<P>
 And earlier this week, the argument became even more heated with the 
revelation that the excavated site contained at least 20 separate bone 
concentrations, lending credence to Native American claims that it may have 
been a prehistoric Native American burial grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greed has got to stop," Alvitre said at Saturday's demonstration. "Who 
gave them the right to rape my ancestors?" 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll company, which proposes to build 
4,286 homes near the wetlands, said Tuesday that the threat against Desautels 
has more to do with politics than with ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are appalled," she said. "Nancy is an innocent pawn in political warfare 
that has nothing to do with protecting ancestors and everything to do with 
stopping a very positive economic and environmental project for the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Desautels, meanwhile, said she has hired a private security consultant to 
advise her and her staff on how to protect themselves from attack and increase 
their security at the site of the archeological dig.

HEARINGS BEGIN FOR DANA POINT HEADLANDS RESORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two decades of debate, the showdown finally began Tuesday night over the 
future of the Dana Point Headlands, one of the county's last undeveloped 
coastal properties. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people packed a City Council meeting, deeply divided over whether a 
$500-million resort proposed for the 121-acre bluff top above Dana Point Harbor 
will be a key to the city's financial future or the devastation of an important 
natural resource. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of at least three public hearings before the council votes on 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of environmentalists, including local representatives of the 
Sierra Club and the Audubon Society, have long declared the hotel-residential 
project too massive and insensitive to the plants and animals on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Their cause was aided Feb. 1 when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service placed 
the Pacific pocket mouse -- known to live only on the Headlands -- on the 
emergency endangered species list. A colony of 39 of the hamster-like mice was 
discovered last summer during an environmental survey of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dana Point Headlands is truly a unique place on the Earth," said Michael 
Redding of San Juan Capistrano, a local Sierra Club representative. "It's home 
to threatened (animal) species. You will be inviting litigation from one side 
or the other if you approve the project before you." 
</P>
<P>
 But the project's supporters, including the Chamber of Commerce, maintain that 
the city of 34,000 people needs the estimated $2 million a year in revenue the 
development would generate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost everybody in Dana Point has a deep appreciation of the property and it 
will always be utmost in our minds," Jody Tyson, the chamber's executive 
director, said before the meeting. "But if we have a quality development up 
there, it will open up the land to more people than ever before while still 
providing economic development to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyson called the parcel "the only open space we have left in the city" and the 
only chance to generate revenue "to put more police protection on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The Headlands is owned by the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co. and Chandis 
Securities. Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the financial holdings of 
the Chandler family, is a principal stockholder of Times Mirror Co., which 
publishes the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The landowner wants to build a five-star, 400-room hotel, two commercial 
centers and 394 homes. More than 34 acres of parkland, including Dana Strand 
Beach, will be made public if the project is approved by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 No developer has been chosen to build the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of concerns from local residents and the city Planning Commission, the 
proposal was reduced to less than half of an earlier plan approved in 1978 by 
the California Coastal Commission, said Dan T. Daniels, the president of the 
M.H. Sherman Co. Daniels added that the Headlands is hardly pristine, having 
first been graded by developers in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an undeveloped parcel," Daniels said. "For about 30 years, the 
property has been occupied by a 90-unit trailer park and a nursery." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the trailer park has been removed, the nursery and several homes now 
stand on the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said he did not believe the listing of the Pacific pocket mouse should 
delay city approval of the project. The mice were found in a four-acre section 
of the property planned for residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 In environmental documents prepared for the project, the landowner suggested 
that relocating the mice to a similar habitat would save them from cats and 
other predators while allowing the development to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've already had conversations with Fish and Wildlife and they are saying 
it's certainly too early to preclude relocation," Daniels said. "That's not a 
dead deal." 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the project, it would then move to the California 
Coastal Commission for approval.

JUMBOTRON'S THINNER BEAMS BLAMED FOR COLLAPSE AT BIG 'A'; DESIGN: ANAHEIM 
HASN'T AFFIXED BLAME, WHICH COULD COST SOMEONE MILLIONS, BUT ENGINEER CITES A 
KEY FLAW IN ITS SUPPORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two main support beams for Anaheim Stadium's Sony Jumbotron were thinner 
at a crucial point than designers specified, which caused the beams to collapse 
during last month's earthquake, an engineer for Jumbotron said in a report 
released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard C. Adams, a Garden Grove engineer who helped design the huge 
scoreboard's structure for White Way Signs Inc. of Chicago in 1988, said 
Tuesday that his post-quake examination of the board's steel support system 
showed that a key portion of the beams was "significantly smaller" where they 
joined the stadium's main superstructure. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this flaw, dating from the stadium's expansion by the construction 
firm of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, meant it could not support the 17.5-ton 
scoreboard's weight when it began shaking during the Jan. 17 quake. The falling 
scoreboard crushed or damaged about 1,000 seats in the stadium's upper deck in 
left field, and hundreds may have been killed if an event had been taking place 
during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like the frames on the building were not built the way (Skidmore's) 
plans showed them," Adams said. He made his examination the week after the 
quake and submitted his report to the city on Jan. 24, which released it 
Tuesday. "The scoreboard should have fared well during the quake, and it would 
have fared well if this weakness hadn't been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the support beams' flanges, the rims that project from the top and 
bottom of a beam to give it strength, were supposed to be two inches thick by 
18 inches wide throughout the beams' length. He said he did not make exact 
measurements of the flanges, but said photos show that the flanges reduced in 
size significantly as they came into the stadium's main frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was terrible," he said. He said that the change in size added to the 
stress on the beams. "You go all of a sudden from a large beam to a small beam. 
This makes it very difficult" for the support system to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore officials were unavailable for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said their engineers have not yet issued a report on the quake, 
so they are not ready to affix blame yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But they said it is no surprise that White Way would be pointing its finger at 
Skidmore. Whoever is found responsible for the collapse could have to pay the 
city several million dollars in damages. The $125-million stadium has a 
$6-million deductible on its earthquake insurance. It was the only building to 
suffer major structural damage within 35 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect them to be blaming each other," stadium General Manager Greg 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadium and Anaheim city officials also have said they are considering 
applying for federal disaster relief aid to repair the Jumbotron. 
</P>
<P>
 Skidmore, a San Francisco firm, built the stadium section where the Jumbotron 
was located in 1979, when the stadium was enlarged to accommodate the Los 
Angeles Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, a decision was made to replace the section's old black-and-white 
scoreboard with a more modern one that could show color replays. 
</P>
<P>
 A Skidmore study before the installation concluded that the old scoreboard's 
support structure would be sufficient to handle the new board. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract for installing the board went to Sony, which subcontracted the 
work to White Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said White Way had received Skidmore's old blueprints when it was 
planning the new board's installation and trusted that they were correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not build (the support system) according to their own plans," Adams 
said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; VOLUNTEERS SCORE HIGH WITH POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their police radio identification code, appropriately, is 755. 
</P>
<P>
 The number the Police Department was supposed to assign them, the one next in 
sequence, was 716. But officials decided on the special 755 tag for the 
department's new SCORE volunteers because all are 55 years old or over. 
</P>
<P>
 SCORE (Senior Citizens Organizing Reciprocal Efforts) members will donate time 
to helping police with everything from patrolling neighborhoods to filing 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we'll be getting radio calls, 'Car 755, where are you?' " joked 
64-year-old Rosemary Scichilone, one of a dozen uniformed members in the new 
group who are set to be out in full force within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from other cities across the country, La Palma initiated its 
volunteer program in January in an effort to cope with increased service 
demands and decreasing revenue, police officials say. The volunteers allow 
police officers to devote more time to preventing and solving serious crimes, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seniors have a wealth of information and talent," Police Chief David Barr 
said. "And the reaction so far has been extremely favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 SCORE volunteers attend a "mini-academy" where they are taught the basics of 
police work and the court system. Many of the volunteers, who are retirees, 
will go on ride-alongs with officers to get a feel for law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's training prepares the seniors to patrol neighborhoods (in their 
own specially marked squad car), walk a beat in shopping centers, and cite 
violators of handicapped-parking regulations. Police also instruct the senior 
volunteers on how to recognize suspicious people or conditions during their 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 However, armed only with radios, the volunteers will make no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're told to be good witnesses only," said Barr. "And not to take 
enforcement action of any kind." 
</P>
<P>
 Other important duties for volunteers will be making home and business 
security checks, presenting neighborhood watch programs and cataloguing 
incidents of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Said 78-year-old Glenn Reeves, volunteer coordinator for SCORE, "We are the 
eyes and ears of the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the volunteers, however, will be pounding the beat. Some prefer to 
help officers sort through the mountains of paperwork that accompanies police 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be involved in any violence or anything like that," said Hope 
Olivares, a retired executive secretary, who would say, with a wink, only that 
she is over 60. 
</P>
<P>
 Police expect to have 18 SCORE volunteers working by this summer. Volunteers 
must be able to work at least four hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a lot of good reaction," said Reeves. "We make it a point to 
be amicable."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY OKS FUNDING FOR SKATEBOARDING PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City and school district officials have approved plans to build a community 
skateboarding plaza at Huntington Beach High School and to make improvements to 
the entry of the school's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement may be the first in the nation in which a city has agreed to pay 
most of the cost for a public skateboard area at a school, Community Services 
Director Ron Hagan said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The skateboard area will be located on the east end of the campus, next to 
Main Street. It's expected to be completed when the school year starts next 
September. The project is expected to cost $185,000 with the city paying 
$125,000 and the Huntington Beach Union High School District paying $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's portion of the expense will come from redevelopment funds because 
the skateboarding and stadium entry constitute public use, according to Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-by-70-foot skateboard plaza would be located near the stadium, away 
from classrooms, Hagan said. It's intended to eliminate unauthorized 
skateboarding at the high school and at the plaza at City Hall, both incurring 
about $20,000 in damage a year from the activity, according to Hagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans at the stadium include new ticket booths, landscaping, security lighting 
and a new stadium sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are asking the district to permit the city to use the stadium up to 
10 times a year without having to pay a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials previously have authorized use of the stadium up to 
four times a year without charge and are expected to increase the use to 10 
times. Trustee Jerry Sullivan said the school has incurred a great deal of 
damage from skateboarders and expects trustees to approve the increased use.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; MEETING TO EXPLAIN POOL DRAINAGE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials will meet with residents Thursdayto explain the 
reasons behind a county policy that requires swimming pool owners to get a 
permit before they are allowed to drain into the county's flood control 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7:30 p.m. at Montecito Center, 12341 Montecito 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. is sponsoring the meeting after complaints from 
residents who were confused with the new permit, according to Shirley Bailey, 
president of the homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just need to know what is the purpose of this (permit) and what is 
expected of them," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, the county has required swimming pool owners to pay $100 for 
the three-year permit. It may be renewed after it expires for a $100 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said that chemicals in pools may follow the channels and end 
up in environmentally sensitive areas. They said the permit will give them more 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the permit, the swimming pool owner has to notify the county environment 
management office 48 hours before draining the pool water into the channel. An 
inspector will come to check if the chemical level if acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent county survey showed that hundreds of homeowners have illegally 
installed drainage pipes from their pools to nearby channels and storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Several homeowners here have received letters from the county informing them 
to get the permit within 60 days or remove the connections to the flood control 
channel.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; STUDENT EXCHANGE GROUP NEEDS HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Host families are needed for exchange students from several countries who are 
scheduled to visit Orange County in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers would be asked to open their homes for the 1994-95 school year or 
for just a few weeks under student group visits run by the International 
Exchange Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The most immediate need is short-term housing for a group of high school 
students from Thailand who will be visiting Orange County in April. Several 
French students are scheduled in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding people willing to provide housing for even a two- to four-week stay 
can be difficult, said Lila Brumbeck, a regional coordinator for the exchange 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, everyone thinks that foreign exchange student programs are a 
good thing. But when it is actually time to volunteer, few families actually 
do, even for short programs," Brumbeck said. "Once they do it, though, they 
find the experience enriching." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of my host families have made lasting friendships with the families" of 
the exchange students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brumbeck also hopes to find accommodations for students from Croatia and Egypt 
who will be going to an Orange County high school next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I am seeking host families for two teen-age girls . . . a Croatian 
16-year-old who is fond of philosophy and music and speaks four languages, and 
an Egyptian 15-year-old who is fluent in three languages," Brumbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange students are usually between 15 to 18 years old and speak 
English. They have their own expense money and carry full accident and health 
insurance. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; RENOVATION PLANS FOR CASA ROMANTICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A local businesswoman Tuesday submitted a renovation and vacation resort plan 
for the historic Casa Romantica mansion and a neighboring city-owned parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Capielo Gates said her development company is still negotiating with a 
major hotel/time-share chain for the 3.1-acre oceanfront project, but she's 
optimistic a deal will be made by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday about the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the mansion, built by city founder Ole Hansen on a scenic 
bluff overlooking the ocean municipal pier, for $2.5 million in 1989. The city 
also bought a one-acre parcel below the mansion on Alameda Lane for $875,000 in 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the city Redevelopment Agency granted Gates first rights to submit 
a redevelopment plan for the 66-year-old mansion and vacant Alameda Lane 
property. Gates leases Casa Romantica from the city for about $9,600 a month 
for her 9-year-old wedding business, Events By Design. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, working with the San Clemente Historical Society, proposes to buy the 
properties from the city for $2 million, renovate the Casa Romantica to its 
former splendor, and build 80 time-share units and a 2,250-square-foot 
conference center on land to the side of the mansion and on Alameda Lane. In 
addition, retail shops and an 8,000-square-foot ocean-view restaurant, the 
Spanish Bay Inn, would be built on the Alameda Lane property. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion itself would be put under the management of a nonprofit foundation 
and remain open for weddings, community events and a Historical Society museum 
dedicated to Hansen and Richard Nixon, whose "Western White House" at Cotton's 
Point brought much fame to the city in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The mansion and Alameda Lane properties would be connected by a pedestrian 
walkway, and underground parking for more than 220 cars would be provided. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said the project conforms to the city's redevelopment plan for the Pier 
Bowl area, and is considerably less intensive than a 1990 proposal from the 
Ratkovich Co. that was scuttled because of community opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will be scrutinized by a special five-member committee before being 
sent to the City Council, which is acting as the Redevelopment Agency Board, in 
mid-March. The plan is subject to public hearings and a review by the 
California Coastal Commission. ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL BOARD SLASHES ITS BENEFITS PACKAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chipping in to close a $2.2-million deficit in its 1993-94 budget, the Orange 
school board approved reducing its own compensation package last week by about 
10% in a move that will save the district about $7,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 6 to 1 Wednesday to trim its benefits package.Under the 
new program, trustees will receive a monthly stipend of $750. Previously, 
trustees received $380 plus a $450 health insurance package. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Maureen Aschoff cast the lone dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to try to be as fair as possible to all board members and at the 
same time be sympathetic to what's going on in the district," said board member 
Max Reissmueller. "We can't keep asking school employees to shoulder the 
burden."  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new compensation package, board members can "buy back" their 
insurance benefits for $450, but would then only receive a stipend of $300. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison, two other similarly sized school districts in the county pay 
their trustees more than Orange. Capistrano Unified gives its trustees a total 
benefits package valued at $1,250, while Saddleback Unified offers benefits 
totaling $1,284 to trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's vote Wednesday night follows a decision earlier this month to 
eliminate 36 classified employee jobs. The cutbacks saved the district 
$485,000.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DUCKS YOUTH HOCKEY FULFILLS PET CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials from the Mighty Ducks will hold a press conference today to announce 
details of a youth hockey program the team intends to organize this year, 
Anaheim city officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks officials said only that the charitable organization will be known as 
Disney Goals and the team will make a substantial financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement will be made at 10 a.m. at the Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Youth hockey is a pet cause of Disney Chairman and Ducks President Michael 
Eisner, whose son, Anders, has played goalie with a team out of Glacial Garden 
Ice Arena in Anaheim. Eisner is also a major patron of USA Hockey, the 
governing body of amateur hockey in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Team and city officials have previously said they are working on a joint 
venture to build an ice rink that would be used as a practice facility for the 
Mighty Ducks, which is owned by the Walt Disney Co., and a community youth 
center focusing on youth hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth said a couple weeks ago that the plans for the rink 
are in the formative stages. He said under the team's proposal, the city would 
provide the land and the Walt Disney Co. would build the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 A specific site has not yet been chosen, but city official said it probably 
will be built in downtown Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth also has said that the hockey program being discussed by the team was 
going to be aimed at troubled youth to steer them away from gangs and drugs and 
into organized sports. MATT LAIT and ROBYN NORWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RECREATIONAL VEHICLE PARKING BAN DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who is irritated by his neighbor's large recreational vehicle asked the 
Planning Commission on Monday to ban such vehicles from parking on city 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners refused to prohibit the motor homes, which must be moved 
every three days to avoid parking tickets, on a 3-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Theodore Encinas, a resident of Alaska Avenue, told commissioners he became 
upset after moving into his home last September and discovering that a motor 
home parks frequently in front of his property. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have to look out my front window, this is not appealing to me," 
Encinas said. He also said the vehicle takes up too much street parking, and 
blocks his vision when he drives onto the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Scheafer, who lives around the corner on California Street, said he owns 
the motor home, which he said is 25 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of motor homes in Costa Mesa, and only a couple of people who 
want them off the street," Scheafer said. Still, he said his motor home is for 
sale because of his neighbor's irritation. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Naghavi, city manager of transportation services, told the commission 
that in almost two years, only four people have complained to the city about 
parked motor homes. Two more residents complained to commissioners Monday that 
the vehicles are eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission said the problem is not big enough to warrant action. "It 
doesn't seem to me that the residents of this city are overly concerned with 
this issue," said Commissioner John Palme.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have this concern that we chip away at people's rights and liberties 
endlessly," said commission Chairman Walt Davenport. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD OKS LOANS TO FORESTALL EVICTIONS

 The county expects to start approving up to $1 million in no-interest loans 
within the next six weeks for residents in danger of eviction. The Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday approved four nonprofit organizations as disbursers of 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 One-time loans of up to $2,000 per household will be made available to anyone 
having trouble making a rent payment or security deposit. The loans are part of 
a program designed to prevent homelessness in Orange County, Supervisor 
Harriett M. Wieder said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Recipients will receive a hand up, not a handout," Wieder said.  
</P>
<P>
 The money will be given out over a period of three years and it should help up 
to 15,000 households countywide, said Kathleen Campini, a spokesman for Wieder. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The county anticipates it will complete negotiations with the nonprofit 
organizations in the next six weeks, and residents will then immediately be 
able to apply for the loans, Campini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Havert, founder of Saddleback Community Outreach in Laguna Hills, said the 
program will help "terrifically" in his organization's attempt to provide rent 
assistance.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be able to extend the program to far more people than we could on our 
own," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In these economically tough times, all kinds of people need help to prevent 
homelessness, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 While no income requirements are necessary to get the loans, a recipient must 
prove need and the ability to repay, Campini said. A family making $40,000 a 
year that fell on bad times would be just as eligible as someone who earns 
less, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations handling the loans will be FISH-Harbor Area Inc. of Costa Mesa; 
Interval House, a shelter for battered women; Lutheran Social Services of 
Southern California in Fullerton, and Saddleback Community Outreach in Laguna 
Hills.MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; RAMS PRACTICE FIELD ACCORD FALLS APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city thought it had reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Rams on 
Tuesday for a new 10-year lease for the football team's practice facility, and 
released a copy of the document. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the City Council met Tuesday night, the agreement had been 
scrubbed and both sides were heading back to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are very close to an agreement. It's basically one issue," said 
City Atty. Jack White. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams spokesman Rick Smith said the team would have no comment until an 
agreement is reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement on a practice site, whenever it is reached, will not tie the 
team to the city and will have an escape clause allowing the team to break the 
lease if it carries through on its threat and moves out of Anaheim after next 
football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving to Anaheim from Los Angeles in 1980 the Rams have practiced at 
the former Juliette Low Elementary School -- a Magnolia School District campus 
that was closed because of declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The city leases the school from the school district and sublets it to the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Tuesday's aborted agreement, the city would have paid Magnolia $250,000 
this year in rent, up from the $120,000 the district had been receiving. The 
rent would have increased by $12,500 annually between 1995 and 1998. Between 
1998 and 2003, the rent would have increased by the rate of inflation or by 4%, 
whichever was less. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams would have continued to pay the city $120,000 annually, which has 
been the team's rent since it began subleasing the school. The city would have 
paid the difference out of its $21-million stadium budget, which is financed 
primarily by rental payments from the California Angels baseball team, the Rams 
and other exhibitors such as concert and racing promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 To have broken the lease, the Rams would have had to give six months' notice 
and paid the school district one year's unsubsidized rent -- $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams announced last month that they will give the city notice in May that 
they may move at the end of the 1994 season. The team is being courted by 
officials from several cities -- the most prominent being Baltimore and St. 
Louis -- which are each promising new stadiums and low rents if the team will 
move to their city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' lease with the city for Anaheim Stadium expires in 2015, but it has 
an escape clause that allows the team to leave if it gives 15 months' notice 
and pays the remaining $30 million owed on bonds issued to expand the stadium 
for the team when it moved there. Even if the team gives notice, team officials 
could change their mind and remain in Anaheim. TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: PLACENTIA; HIGH-TECH COMES TO EL DORADO HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most high school students have the opportunity to learn about lasers, robotics 
and wind tunnels from textbooks in science classes, but students at El Dorado 
High School can actually use these technologies in class.  
</P>
<P>
 The school's technology lab opened this semester, replacing a metal shop that 
was filled with outdated equipment. The lab has 17 different modules, each 
featuring a different technology. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 students have signed up for the two classes offered this semester. 
During the course of the semester, they will work for 10 days at eight of the 
modules, learning about the principals behind the technology and sampling how 
it is used in real-world applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Larry Eynon said the course is designed to make technology 
non-threatening by using a quick-hit, hands-on format for each discipline. The 
purpose isn't to make students proficient in any one technology but rather to 
expose them to a variety of fields. 
</P>
<P>
 After carefully placing a clear plastic container filled with blue water on a 
white table, freshman Tim Cahill uses a photometer to measure the intensity of 
a laser through the liquid. Getting a reading, he replaces the blue water with 
a salt solution, then a container of sugar water. 
</P>
<P>
 When he completes the laser module, Cahill should have an understanding of 
both how laser works and its application in medicine, manufacturing and other 
real-life fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much more fun than just sitting in a class hearing a teacher talk 
about lasers," said Cahill, 14. "I think you learn more this way."  
</P>
<P>
 Cahill said he signed up for the course after hearing about the expensive 
equipment that went into it. The fast-paced module format means there is just 
enough time to get a sense of a technology but not enough time to get bored, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured it was a good way to find out what I might like to do later," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially the course will be open to all students, but Eynon said eventually 
it will be offered to just freshman and sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The class is really an introductory course, designed to get students thinking 
about where their interests are," Eynon said. "Hopefully from here they can 
take other courses that will expand that interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students in the class said they were interested in careers in 
science fields that would make use of the technologies they were studying. But 
at least one student has found a more immediate application. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really want to learn how (an engine) works," junior Ryan Sparks said. "I 
need to know so I can build a go-cart." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

<P>
 Paul Gilbrook, the president of the firefighters' union, has appealed his 
dismissal from the Fire Department, arguing that he has not violated any policy 
that could justify his firing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook, 37, filed his appeal Mondayto City Manager Jerry Kenny, who is 
expected to review the case this week. 
</P>
<P>
 After a closed-door hearing, Gilbrook was fired on Feb. 8 based on the 
findings of a city investigation that found Gilbrook allegedly drove a fire 
engine with a suspended driver's license and allegedly used sick leave 
improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilbrook said that city officials failed to establish cause for his 
dismissal, and that he could present witnesses to refute the charges against 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbrook filed his appeal through his attorney, Alan C. Davis. BERT ELJERA

PERMIT REJECTED FOR NUDE-DANCING BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LILY DIZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday rejected a permit for what would have been the 
city's first nude-dancing bar. 
</P>
<P>
 After passionate pleas from residents urging them to reject the bar's 
application, the council members voted unanimously to deny a permit to the 
Mermaid, at 4248 Martingale Way, in Newport Place Planned Community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Talmo, attorney for the owners of the Mermaid, said he will probably 
file a federal civil lawsuit against the city, alleging that the action of the 
council members violated his client's First Amendment rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Talmo had claimed that the Mermaid, which would offer live nude and topless 
dancing, would be a theater and therefore protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the City Council used the same theater argument to keep the 
Mermaid from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Atty. Robert Burnham, the zoning standards for the Newport 
Place Planned Community do not allow for a theater.LILY DIZON

CONGRESSMEN ENDORSE IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE; POLITICS: MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY 
SERVICES TO ILLEGAL MIGRANTS NEEDS 385,000 SIGNATURES TO QUALIFY. CRITICS 
CHARGE THE PROPOSAL IS RACIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two local congressmen on Tuesday endorsed a proposed state initiative to 
require state and local agencies to report suspected illegal immigrants to the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service, deny them social services and access to 
a public education, and make it a felony to manufacture or use false 
citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a Newport Beach news conference which also featured the co-authors 
of the proposed initiative, Reps. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) and Dana 
Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) said it was time for state and local officials 
to take a stand on a problem that has aggravated California's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard, who succeeded in amending federal disaster relief legislation to deny 
long-term assistance to illegal immigrants, said that "nothing will stop them" 
from continuing to stream across the border as long as federal government 
policies remain unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must cut off the attraction through cutting funds," he said. "It's simply 
unfair to taxpayers." Current policies, he said, are "schizophrenic" because 
federal laws prohibit illegal immigration, yet those who break those laws are 
entitled to benefits such as a public education and medical treatment in 
publicly funded hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The "SOS" (Save Our State) initiative, being circulated since January, needs 
385,000 signatures by April 22 to be placed on the November state ballot, said 
co-author Harold Ezell, a former western regional commissioner of the INS. Alan 
Nelson, the initiative's other author and head of the INS from 1982 to 1989, 
was also present at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizing committee is seeking to collect a half million signatures, 
Ezell said. "It is our belief we're going to have a landslide on this thing." 
So far, about 3,000 signatures have been obtained, but Ezell said signatures 
were now being collected at the rate of 2,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, if passed, would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Exclude illegal immigrants from all publicly funded schools in California, 
from kindergarten through college. Ineligible students already enrolled would 
be given a transition period to return to their native country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exclude illegal immigrants from public health care except in emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make it a felony, punishable by a $750,000 fine and five years in prison, to 
make, sell or use false citizenship documents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require law enforcement officers as well as employees of many state and 
local agencies to report any suspected illegal immigrants to the state attorney 
general and to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of immigrant rights groups expressed outrage over the proposed 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to know when persecution of the hardest-working and lowest-paid 
people I know is going to stop," said Becky Esparza, former chair of the Orange 
County Coalition for Immigration Rights. "I understand that the economy is on 
the downswing . . . but scapegoating people not responsible for what is 
happening, I don't understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the initiative is "targeting a specific race of people" -- immigrants 
from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rohrabacher said "those who suggest this is racist are trying to obfuscate 
honest discussion of the problem. You will find the vast majority of 
Mexican-Americans will support the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Jaime Soto, the Roman Catholic Vicar for the Hispanic Community, said, 
"Anti-immigrant sentiments always accompany -- or is the consequence of -- 
economic hard times." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto acknowledged that some legal immigrants may favor stemming the tide of 
illegal immigration, but this was because they "suffer from historical amnesia 
and forget their own past. That doesn't justify this initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Political leaders must accept some responsibility for their sins of 
omission," he added. "These angry reactions against immigrants . . . are 
displaced anxiety. Unfortunately, they have chosen to cater to and exploit 
people's fears instead of showing courage and insight."

PILOT WHO DIED IN CRASH IDENTIFIED AS SANTA ANA MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pilot whose small plane crashed in South Lake Tahoe over the weekend was 
identified Tuesday as Donald Brannon of Santa Ana, the El Dorado County 
Sheriff's Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brannon's four-seat Piper Cherokee crashed Sunday in a mountainous area near 
the El Dorado-Alpine County line, Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Stroot said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane crashed shortly after taking off from South Lake Tahoe Airport about 
3:50 p.m., officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators on Tuesday were checking to determine whether Brannon had 
originally flown out of John Wayne Airport, said Fred O'Donnell, a spokesman 
with the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroot said the plane was registered in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the crash, sheriff's deputies searched the area with 
helicopters, a fixed-wing aircraft, snowmobiles and cross-country skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Search efforts were hampered by deep, loose snow, darkness and cold, Stroot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Highway Patrol helicopter spotted the wreckage about 8 a.m. 
Monday, and a ski team reached the wreckage 20 minutes later. The team found 
Brannon's body in the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Brannon was identified Tuesday through fingerprints, Stroot said.

AMATEUR SPORTS CENTER BINGO GAMES ILLEGAL, SUIT SAYS; CHARITIES: STATE ATTORNEY

 A suit filed by the state Tuesday against Amateur Sports Training Centers of 
Orange County charges that it operates bingo games in violation of state law 
and that it pays its executive director "excessive and unfair compensation." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit filed in Orange County Superior Court by the state attorney general's 
office alleges that the director, James V. Remmey, 58, of Newport Beach, 
received up to $202,000 from fund raising, some of it from bingo games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as bad as they're making us look to be," Remmey said Tuesday night. 
The 7-year-old organization, he said, has "really done a lot of good things." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the group violates state law, which requires that bingo 
games be operated "solely for charitable purposes," that "they be staffed only 
by members of the organization" and that money raised "shall not be commingled 
with any other fund or account." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the suit, ASTC has no members and "has paid profits, wages and/or 
salaries from its bingo games to various individuals," particularly Remmey. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint asks that Remmey and the other directors return his "excessive 
compensation" to the organization and the state of California, plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Remmey said he did not agree that his compensation was excessive for a 
nonprofit organization, whose fund-raising is divided about evenly between 
bingo at the organization's two facilities and door-to-door solicitations 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, Remmey was paid $191,346 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in 1991, his organization raised $2.5 million to $3 million, Remmey said 
Tuesday night, and made approximately $700,000 in grants to various amateur 
training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, according to the complaint, Remmey was paid $202,000. That year, 
Remmey said, the organization raised approximately $1.5 million and was awarded 
$300,000 in grants.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Remmey said, he received $112,000, "because of the recession" and its 
impact on fund-raising. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the complaint were board members Sara S. Remmey; Vance E. 
Remmey; Bruce Walker; David Meyers; T.J. Kerrigan; David Gingrich; Joan Colberg 
and William Doyle.

HOAG HOSPITAL'S 20-ACRE DEVELOPMENT PLANS GET COASTAL COMMISSION'S OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoag Hospital's controversial plans to develop 20 acres around the hospital, 
including a small wetlands, was unanimously approved Tuesday by the California 
Coastal Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The plans map out the hospital's growth over the next 20 years into a regional 
medical center with outpatient facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Coastal Commission's own staff recommended against the expansion, 
commissioners voted, 11 to 0, to approve zoning changes to allow construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect any (more) hurdles," said Peter Foulke, senior vice president 
at Hoag Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the plan does not lay out specific building designs, functions and 
locations, it does provide for maximum square footages and building heights for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission is involved in this planning process because the site 
to be developed lies within the coastal zone. Known as the lower campus, it 
already contains a cancer center, a child care center, a parking lot and stacks 
that burn methane gases collected from underground. The land also has a 40-foot 
bluff and a 2.5-acre wetlands dominated by cattails. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hoag plan before the Coastal Commission proposes to develop 19.6 acres of 
the 20.4-acre lower campus, leaving the remaining land for a public park. Also, 
because wetlands would be lost, the hospital has agreed to enhance similar 
wetlands near UC Irvine, Foulke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foulke said that the daylong commission meeting adjourned without "totally 
resolving" the question of how much wetlands the hospital must create elsewhere 
to mitigate the loss of the 2.5 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials plan to build facilities that will provide outpatient care 
such as same-day surgeries, which do not require an overnight hospital stay, 
Broussard said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a sweet victory for hospital officials who last month were stunned 
when Coastal Commission staff recommended denial of the Hoag plan primarily 
because of the loss of wetlands without sufficient mitigation. At that point, 
hospital officials asked that the hearing be delayed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In that month delay, Foulke said that hospital officials did not change the 
plan and hoped that commissioners would approve the plans despite staff 
objections. On Tuesday, 40 people, including hospital staff and local 
businessmen and residents, traveled to San Diego in a bus to speak on behalf of 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which has been the subject of public debates, was introduced by the 
hospital in 1989 and approved by the city of Newport Beach in 1992. It also has 
attracted a devoted opposition from residents who live on the bluff near the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Jennings, a resident who shares the bluff overlooking the ocean with the 
hospital, has been fighting the expansion plans since they were originally 
proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My particular interest in the whole thing was building heights and view," 
said Jennings, who also attended the hearing and testified before the 
commission. "It is a nice view up here . . . (but after expansion) you won't be 
able to see the water line, you'll only be able to see the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 He and other residents are opposed to cutting into the bluff to accommodate 
new buildings and, consequently, more traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not opposed to Hoag per se," he said. "But we are just the guys next 
door and the most vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Hoag Hospital designs specific building plans and dimensions, it must 
return to City Hall to seek the proper permits.

CITY'S RESPONSE TO BOLSA CHICA REPORT ASSAILED; WETLANDS: KOLL OFFICIAL 
QUESTIONS WHETHER HUNTINGTON BEACH'S CRITICISM OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY IS A 
DELAYING TACTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county official Tuesday accused the Huntington Beach City Council of 
injecting politics into consideration of the environmental impact report for 
the proposed development of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Mathews, Orange County's director of environmental planning, whose office 
prepared the report, said he would not discuss the council's criticisms while 
the draft report is open for public comment, a period that ends Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the council voted 4-2 to ask the county to write a new 
report, contending that the current study violates state law, does not 
sufficiently consider a reasonable range of alternative sites for development 
and does not take into consideration costs to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Dunn, senior vice president of the Koll Real Estate Group, which plans to 
build 4,286 homes on 400 acres in the wetlands, questioned whether the 
council's response is an attempt to slow the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope when I read the comment letter that there is substance there and it's 
not just a delaying tactic," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In its written response to the draft study, the city said restoration of the 
wetlands, "which seems to form the sole justification for the county's approval 
of the project, is unlikely to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would occur, if at all, 20 to 30 years after Koll has constructed its 
approximately 4,000-unit housing project atop the Mesa," the report said. The 
Koll company has proposed to spend $48 million to restore 1,100 acres of 
wetlands in exchange for the right to build homes on the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 245-page comment, to be delivered to county officials by Friday, city 
officials claimed: 
</P>
<P>
 * The draft report violates state laws because it fails to look at the entire 
project, and fails to seek federal approval for development in wetlands while 
seeking state approval for construction on a mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 * That local officials are being asked to approve conclusions in the report on 
faith, in violation of environmental quality acts, the report claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * The report fails to consider "a reasonable range" of alternate locations for 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
 * The report doesn't adequately detail possible hazards in event of 
explosions, earthquakes and other disasters in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 * The report should call on the county to require Koll to pay for the 
project's fiscal impact to the city for roads and services before development 
permits are issued. A preliminary city study sets these costs at about $58 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 * The report should have addressed the impact of the entire Koll project of 
4,884 homes, not just the 4,286 in the county's jurisdiction. There are 598 
homes, not addressed in the report, that are planned within city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan, a leading critic of the county's draft report, 
asserted that Koll's only obligation to restore the wetlands will come if it 
can get a federal permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under this faulty process, the Koll Co. could get approvals for 75% of its 
projects without making any commitment to restoration. I fear that this might 
be the company's goal," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilmen Earle Robitaille and Jim Silva voted against sending the comments 
to the county. Both expressed support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille, who accused his colleagues of throwing up roadblocks, said the 
cost of fighting the proposed development could climb as high as $500,000 by 
the time an economic impact report is completed and consultants are paid. The 
price of staff time could swell city costs further, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robitaille said Tuesday that the county staff and the city staff should work 
out details and get the project started without "political posturing" on the 
part of City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Victor Leipzig said that the city's expense may be "unfortunate" 
but is necessary.

COUNTY DELAYS REQUEST ON TUSTIN BASE REUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday delayed plans to seek 
government approval for detention facilities and a police training center on 
the Tustin Marine Corps Air Station after it closes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The county administrative officer, who had proposed those uses for the base 
and planned to present them to the supervisors on Tuesday for a vote, instead 
advised them to wait two weeks. That would give the board more time for 
discussions with Tustin city officials, who are wary of portions of the 
county's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to wait because we thought it would be better to work 
cooperatively. The goal is to have Tustin agree with our uses, and then they 
would be part their use plan," said Ernie Schneider, county administrative 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said he requested the delay also in part because the U.S. Department 
of Health and Human Services extended a deadline for the police training 
facility application. 
</P>
<P>
 The county hopes to use a portion of the 1,600-acre base for an indoor pistol 
range and classrooms for local law enforcement, a jail for prisoners on daytime 
work furloughs, an alcoholism recovery facility, a second juvenile hall, a 
family resource center and an animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many existing buildings on the air base could easily be converted into the 
proposed facilities and thereby provide substantial savings to the county, 
according to Susan Novak of the county administrative office. 
</P>
<P>
 But what might be good for the county has caused concern for some Tustin 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more time and information to see what just exactly what the county's 
plans are," said Tustin City Manager William A. Huston, who serves on the 
17-member City Council-appointed Base Closure Task Force. The task force will 
make a recommendation to the council as to the best reuse plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a positive sign that the county decided to wait so we can see what from 
their plan can be incorporated into our reuse plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force chairman, Thomas R. Saltarelli, said: "We are mindful of the 
county's needs, but the county must be realistic about what they propose for 
the site. Just because we agreed to talk does not mean we will accept 
everything the county wants."  
</P>
<P>
 According to federal law, land and buildings at closed military bases can be 
given or sold at below-market prices to local governments as long as the 
federal government approves of their future uses.

ARRESTS MADE IN ROBBERY, BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested an armed Texas man Monday on suspicion of armed robbery, 
several burglaries and a hit-and-run accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy David Broker, 30, and a companion, Teri Ann Bertsche, 30, of Costa Mesa, 
were taken into custody in the parking lot of a motel in the 11700 block of 
Beach Boulevard about 5:30 p.m., according to the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Angel Andrade said he spotted a vehicle in the parking lot that matched 
a broadcast description of the brown 1977 Ford Grenada thought to be involved 
in an armed robbery of a sandwich shop in Westminster 10 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy held the couple at gunpoint but without incident until backup units 
arrived. Deputies said Broker had a .32-caliber revolver. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertsche also was arrested on suspicion of robbery, and both were booked into 
the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Broker is considered a suspect in several other robberies and a hit-and-run 
accident in Westminster, and several burglaries in Newport Beach, according to 
Lt. Dan Martini of the Sheriff's Department.

ANGELS PLAN THREE OFFERS FOR SALMON; BASEBALL: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR WILL HAVE 
SEVERAL OPTIONS TO CONSIDER. TANANA, 40, SIGNS TRIPLE-A CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to offer right fielder Tim Salmon a guaranteed 
contract Thursday that will keep him in the organization through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have had preliminary talks with Ted Updike, Salmon's agent, 
are scheduled to submit their proposals in a formal meeting in Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who last season became the first Angel to win the American League's 
rookie of the year award, is expected to receive three offers: a one-year deal 
for about $500,000, three years for about $4 million, and four years for about 
$7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very optimistic we can get this done," Updike said. "We're anxious 
to get to the table and to the same page. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim has a very close relationship with the Angels, and we have an idea of 
what the long-term future holds between Tim and the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels are trying to nourish their future, they also are 
resurrecting a bit of their past, inviting 40-year-old pitcher Frank Tanana to 
camp. Tanana, the Angels' first-round pick in 1971 who was traded 13 years ago, 
signed a triple-A contract Tuesday and will report Saturday to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to feel a little funny," Tanana said. "I mean, outside (of 
coaches) Jimmie Reese and Bobby Knoop, everybody else is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm glad for the opportunity. It was a case where you believe in 
yourself, but you're just waiting to see if anybody else still does." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, who was 7-17 last season with a 4.35 ERA pitching for the New York 
Yankees and Mets, did not receive any major league offers during the winter. 
The Angels remained uninterested until left-hander Joe Magrane underwent 
arthroscopic surgery on his left elbow last week, which is expected to sideline 
him until May. 
</P>
<P>
 While salaries of $100,000 were exorbitant when Tanana last was an Angel, 
Salmon has the opportunity of being accorded the largest contract given to a 
second-year player. It comes on the heels of the three-year, $4.2-million 
contract provided last week to Dodger catcher Mike Piazza, the National 
League's rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was a good ice-breaker for us," Updike said. "From all 
indications, they'd like to do the same for Tim." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that no other Angel player has a contract guaranteed past 1995, 
it's quite possible General Manager Bill Bavasi might soon have other suitors 
at his door seeking multiyear offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell them that's fine," Bavasi said. " 'Go ahead and have a year like 
Tim's, and then we'll talk.' "

HIS SLAM IS MISSING AT PLATE; BASEBALL: JORDAN DISPLAYS GOOD SPEED, AVERAGE 
FIELDING AND LITTLE HITTING DURING WORKOUT.

 Even before the sun rose above the left field fence at Ed Smith Stadium, the 
running of the bull had begun, turning this quiet residential community into a 
different sort of Pamplona. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are dumb enough to wait for one guy, that's OK with us," a resident 
yelled as reporters climbed out of TV trucks and cars and made their way up his 
street. "Just don't park in our driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 This city, home of the Ringling Bros. & Barnum and Bailey, held another circus 
Tuesday, this one at the hands of a more celebrated ringmaster.Michael Jordan, 
who believes he can be a major league player by the end of spring training, 
staged his first official workout as a minor leaguer in the Chicago White Sox 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which one is he?" asked a fan who somehow got into the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the tall one," was the answer in unison from reporters, pointing to 
Jordan standing in the outfield, where he would likely play. 
</P>
<P>
 The workout was a solo act, arranged by the club so that about 250 media 
members could see Michael hit (he never reached the warning track), see Michael 
run (he could be one of the fastest in baseball from first base to third base), 
see Michael field (he's average), then hear Michael talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with a lot of my friends and my family members just to make sure 
that I'm not embarrassing them or myself," Jordan said. "I bounce things off of 
them, and they give me opinions that are honest. My father would have done it 
if he were here, but he wasn't here, so I talked with other people, and they 
have been very supportive of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan hit about 100 pitches thrown by a batting practice pitcher and a 
bullpen catcher, one a left-hander, the other a right-hander, with pitch speed 
averaging about 78 m.p.h. He hit only a few balls deep, pulled a couple of good 
drives down the left field line and scattered a few solid grounders. The White 
Sox have been increasing the pitch speed gradually, but the big jump will come 
on March 3, when Jordan will face first-line pitching for the first time in an 
intrasquad game. That might mean Jack McDowell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be 90 (m.p.h.), but it won't be 75 or 80," Manager Gene Lamont said. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't appear to be a publicity stunt by the White Sox, who have been 
criticized by baseball purists since Jordan was signed to a triple-A contract 
last week, abetting the notion that he could actually make the team. General 
Manager Ron Schueler has conceded that Jordan's chances are remote, but it 
hasn't stopped him from supporting the former Chicago Bull star as he chases 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I retired, I said I would do whatever I wanted to do that came to mind, 
and this suddenly came to mind," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 Jordan hasn't played baseball since two games into his senior 
season in high school, when he quit the team so he could concentrate on 
basketball. A right-handed pitcher and an outfielder, Jordan threw 42 scoreless 
innings his junior year while batting fifth or sixth. Edward Lewis, Jordan's 
coach at Laney High in Wilmington, N.C., said Jordan was beginning to show some 
power at the plate when he quit to play in the McDonald's all-star basketball 
game, causing him to forfeit his remaining eligibility. But by then, Jordan had 
grown from a skinny 5-10 sophomore into a 6-5 senior, and he already had a 
basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on the verge of turning 31 Thursday, Jordan is laboring to relearn the 
game in five months. Working during the off-season, he has hit 600 to 1,000 
baseballs a day, played in the field and studied tapes of John Olerud, Frank 
Thomas and Ellis Burks. He has shown improvement, but not enough to play in the 
majors or, according to one observer, even in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a down-kind of swing, it's a canned swing that can't be fixed in a 
month, it takes years in the minor leagues," Ron Fraser, former longtime 
baseball coach at the University of Miami and an ex-Olympic coach, said after 
watching Jordan Tuesday. "It's mechanical, like a second baseman's. It can be 
developed, but are they looking for a 6-foot-6 guy to hit low line drives? I 
don't think so. I think they want him to hit it out of the park, and it's not 
going to go out that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't throw the bat at the ball, and that's how the ball explodes off 
the bat. His swing is too smooth, too controlled. He should take up golf. He's 
a six handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ball doesn't explode off Jordan's bat, he certainly explodes on the 
basepaths. He has been clocked at 3.8 seconds from first base to third base, 
which would make him one of the fastest runners in the game. In the field, he 
appears to be merely adequate, with a good throwing arm. If nothing else, he 
might be able to snag balls headed out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much negativism about me doing this that I went to (White Sox 
and Bull owner) Jerry (Reinsdorf) and I asked him, 'Is this the right thing to 
do?' " Jordan said. "The last thing I want is to be a sideshow. It's a sense of 
pride when I step on the baseball field, and if I don't have the skills, I 
won't be out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has said he will go to the minors if he has to, which could mean that 
when the season begins, he could be riding a bus to a lot of small towns. He 
has indicated, though, that a one-year stint in the minors would be his limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not so adjusted to royalty that I can't ride a bus, as long as it's a 
luxury bus," Jordan joked. 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't make Chicago's 25-man roster by the time camp breaks at the end 
of March, Jordan could start the season playing anywhere from the White Sox's 
Class A team in Hickory, N.C., to Triple-A Nashville, Tenn. Meanwhile, as a 
non-roster player, he will begin working out with the full squad on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont said he's sure Jordan will bring some distractions, but nothing 
insurmountable. Tuesday's workout attracted reporters from 100 news outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I don't succeed, then I don't succeed, but nothing's hard until you 
actually try," Jordan said. "If it didn't work out, then I don't know. My goal 
right now is to be a part of baseball, and if it doesn't happen, then I still 
have a long life to live and I will choose whatever I choose to do." 
</P>
<P>
 And what about golf? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can play golf when I'm 40 years old," he said, "after I'm done chasing my 
dream."

MIKE DOWNEY: SAD HISTORY, BUT BRIGHT NHL FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He doesn't discuss it. Neither do his parents, or grandparents. Paul Kariya, 
the Mighty Duck superstar of tomorrow, is proudly playing Olympic hockey, 
though, on behalf of a country that once imprisoned his ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Left wing of the undefeated Canadian team that will meet the United States 
Thursday night, Kariya, 19, is the son of a British mother and a 
Japanese-Canadian father. Tetsuhiko Kariya, who is T.K. to his friends, was 
born in a World War II internment camp in Western Canada, where his parents 
were confined while North Americans and Japanese were at war. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul himself knew nothing of this until a couple of years ago when government 
officials made long overdue restitution to citizens who were interned, 
including financial redress and a formal apology. He overheard his grandparents 
mentioning it and became curious. But it is a delicate topic for Paul because 
he does not wish to cause his family any undue embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a long and winding road the family has traveled through Canada, however. 
T.K. Kariya ultimately represented his country on a national rugby team, and 
now here is Paul, wearing the maple leaf proudly in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I thought of that," he says, gently. 
</P>
<P>
 A student at the University of Maine, Kariya must decide whether to continue 
his studies beyond the Olympics or turn pro with the Ducks, who in 1993 made 
him the organization's original first-round draft choice. He is a swift, 
splendid player, short on muscle but long on hustle and talent, who, although 
not a scoring factor in Tuesday night's 3-1 victory over France, began his 
Olympics two days earlier with three deft assists in a 7-2 rout of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya's linemates are already professionals -- center Petr Nedved and right 
wing Chris Kontos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get this," Kariya says, chuckling. "When Vancouver made Petr their No. 1 pick 
a few years ago, I was the runner who took the slip of paper up to the podium 
to announce the pick. Me, I was the messenger. We got a good laugh out of that 
the other day." 
</P>
<P>
 They are having a good time so far at the Winter Games, enjoying one another's 
company and planning to attend a skiing event today on a day off from Olympic 
play. On the ice, Kariya, Nedved and Kontos have proven so compatible that it 
has been suggested in the Canadian press that the Mighty Ducks could do worse 
than sign the whole line. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver would need to be compensated for Nedved, who has vowed not to play 
for the Canucks any longer after a number of conflicts. Kontos, who once had a 
hot playoff series for the Kings, is an unrestricted free agent who reached an 
impasse with Tampa Bay, infuriated by the amount he was offered by the 
Lightning after having been their second-leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya isn't ready to commit himself on his future, much less speculate on 
what his teammates will or should do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure enjoying playing with these guys," Kariya said. "We've been playing 
together off and on for a while and on a regular basis for about a month now. 
They're both big guys who see the ice real well. They can really move the 
puck." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has ever called Kariya a big guy. He stands 5 feet 10 and goes 165 
pounds with his skates off. 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody ever called Wayne Gretzky a big guy, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Dany Dube, whose title is associate coach of the Canadian team here but who 
acts more as Tom Renney's co-coach, says of Kariya: "Oh, is Anaheim in for a 
treat. He won't just be in the NHL. He'll be big in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing is, he's got amazing speed. Just amazing. He's got that, you 
know, evasive quality that you just don't find anywhere. On top of that, he's 
so smart, so -- I don't know -- so rational for someone his age. What can I 
tell you? Nothing he might do would surprise me. You're talking here about 
someone who could be a millionaire tomorrow if he wants to be, but he's such a 
common man, such a regular person, that he's not in a hurry anywhere but on the 
ice." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul has patience. He got some of that from members of his family, from people 
who have been through a lot. He has their full support, even though none made 
the trip, just as he and the Kariya family now have all of Canada behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't decided a thing," Paul says. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything can happen, in hockey and elsewhere.

HARPER, MANNING HELD OUT BY WEISS; CLIPPERS: THE TWO STARTERS ARE BENCHED FOR 
SKIPPING PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Danny Manning and Ron Harper, the Clippers' leading scorers, were held out of 
Tuesday night's game against the Lakers by Coach Bob Weiss because they missed 
practice on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel it was a belligerent thing or a malicious thing, but I didn't 
feel it was something we could let pass," Weiss said. "For the betterment of 
the team, I felt that this had to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said that Manning and Harper weren't suspended for skipping the 
Clippers' first practice after the All-Star break. However, he declined to 
reveal whether they were fined. Charles Grantham, executive director of the 
National Basketball Players Assn., said $300 is the maximum a player can be 
fined for skipping practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning and Harper, who is often outspoken, made a quick getaway to avoid 
reporters after the game. They dressed in the shower room and left through a 
door between the King and Laker locker room, walking up the service ramp after 
the Clippers defeated the Lakers for the first time in four games this season, 
100-89. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be able to stand by your principles and still win," Weiss said. 
"This was a difficult decision. I think they both had relatively legitimate 
excuses, but I still think I had to make a statement to the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Tired after playing in Sunday's All-Star game, Manning skipped practice 
without informing the Clippers. The club booked Manning on an early morning 
flight from Minneapolis so he could make the practice, which began at 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Manning skip practice? 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny was home sleeping because he was at the entertainment parties for the 
NBA (during all-star week) at their urging," said Ron Grinker, Manning's agent. 
"From seven o'clock in the morning until late in the evening Saturday, he was 
tied up making commitments for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny said that certainly he should be fined for not being at practice. He 
got up and it would have taken him an hour and a half to get to practice with 
the traffic. . . . He chose not to go. You haven't heard us say he was right. 
All that aside, he should have been at practice. He was wrong. He didn't make 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Players Assn. has been advised of this and they're going to deal with it. 
It seems that everyone has to deal with the Clippers except the Clippers. It's 
another black eye for the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that the Players Assn. will get involved because Manning and 
Harper weren't suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Clipper spokesman Joe Safety: "That's standard, useless Grinker rhetoric. 
It obviously serves toward his own personal agenda to say that. It's an 
extension of his longstanding vendetta, and I think everybody's getting tired 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who spent the all-star break at his Cleveland-area home, missed his 
flight to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With the NBA trading deadline only eight days away, there have been reports 
that the Clippers are trying to trade Manning, who can become an unrestricted 
free agent at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Daily News reported Tuesday that the Manning would be going to 
Orlando as part of a three-way deal with the Sacramento Kings. The Clippers 
would trade Manning to the Kings for forward Lionel Simmons and and Dean 
Causwell. The Kings would then ship Manning to Orlando for Dennis Scott and 
several first round draft choices.

MCSORLEY FEELS LIKE A KING; HOCKEY: TRADE BRINGS HIM BACK TO THE TEAM HE HELPED 
SPARK TO STANLEY CUP FINALS. SANDSTROM, MCEACHERN GO TO PENGUINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defenseman Marty McSorley arrived in Los Angeles five years ago as an 
afterthought, but he returned to the Kings on Tuesday from the Pittsburgh 
Penguins viewed as a returning hero, assigned the task of reviving his 
struggling teammates, who are five points out of a playoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley, 30, was part of a four-player deal sending him and defenseman Jim 
Paek, 26, to Los Angeles in exchange for forwards Tomas Sandstrom, 30, and 
Shawn McEachern, 24. In one sense, it undid what was viewed as a disastrous 
transaction for the Kings in August when they traded McSorley to the Penguins 
for McEachern after matching the St. Louis Blues' five-year offer sheet of $1.8 
million per season. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be the first time in NHL history two players were twice traded for 
each other. There is speculation McSorley's contract has been revised, but no 
details were revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long nine months," McSorley said Tuesday from his home in 
Sewickley, Pa. "Wow! It's been a long time since June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the trade was made, I would have had a tough time believing that I could 
ever come back. It'll be a challenge because there's been a fair amount of 
emphasis on the fact I've been gone. I'm going to need their help and I'll try 
to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's move signaled a clear power shift in the King hierarchy with owner 
Bruce McNall becoming involved as he started the deal by speaking directly with 
Penguin owner Howard Baldwin. All season, King Coach Barry Melrose and Wayne 
Gretzky lamented the McSorley trade. McSorley said he spoke several times to 
Gretzky before and after the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley originally came to the Kings from Edmonton in the Gretzky trade.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," Melrose said. "We're in a battle for a playoff spot and if 
there's someone I want with us in a battle, it's Marty. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was all very hard and Bruce had to get involved. Bruce was great during 
this -- it was a very complicated deal. There were so many elements and it had 
been talked about so much for so long. Bruce was the main factor." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, McEachern broke the news of the trade to Sandstrom. 
Sandstrom had been with the Kings since January of 1990, when he came to L.A. 
from the Rangers with Tony Granato. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandstrom, who had 17 goals and 41 points in 51 games, became expendable 
almost from the moment he decided to play out his option this season. He was 
making $1.3 million this season and the Kings risked losing him to Europe for 
nothing in return next season. His ice time also had dwindled and he was 
scratched from the lineup Monday night against Boston, along with McEachern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they learned a lesson from Marty last season," Sandstrom said, 
laughing. "It worked out in a good way for me, especially you know how things 
have been going. The way things were going I couldn't see me sticking around. 
We have a lot of good players -- 12 good forwards. It's hard for all the 
players to get their ice time. 
</P>
<P>
 Said McEachern, who had 21 points in 49 games: "The first thing (Pittsburgh 
General Manager) Craig Patrick said to me was, 'You're not out lobster fishing 
this time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick couldn't find McEachern last year to tell him about the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strangest thing is as soon as I got here they said they needed Marty back 
here," McEachern said. "Hey, I'm probably the only guy to play with Mario 
(Lemieux), Wayne and then Mario again." 
</P>
<P>
 Paek is a close friend of McEachern's and the two found homes together in the 
same neighborhood last summer. McEachern spent one night in the new home before 
the trade and now he is coming back to Pittsburgh, but Paek won't be there this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the ice for warm-ups before the game (against Winnipeg)," Paek said 
Tuesday. "I came off the ice and was scratched and told to see Craig Patrick. I 
don't know. This is new for me. I'm still in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 So was McSorley, even though he had been hearing trade rumors since training 
camp and never really fit in with the Penguins. His role was undefined and he 
played poorly in the first half of the season, even saying he was embarrassed 
by his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Kings dwelt on his departure. They remembered the McSorley of last 
season: His 41 points, 399 penalty minutes and performance against Toronto in 
the playoffs. Forgotten was his ignominious role in Stickgate -- when his 
illegal stick penalty in Game 2 helped Montreal climb back and go on to win the 
Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was part of the deal, there was a stick check before the deal was made," 
McNall said, joking. 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Kings admitting they made a mistake? 
</P>
<P>
 "I owed it to the fans," McNall said. "The bottom line is we weren't playing 
well. Marty McSorley is not a savior. He is not going to single-handedly change 
the world, but I didn't like the way we were playing and something had to 
change. . . . He was missed. We didn't realize until he was gone how much we 
missed him." 
</P>
<P>
 No one among the Kings truly assumed McSorley's role in the dressing room or 
on the ice. They lacked a vocal presence in the dressing room and their three 
young defensemen -- Rob Blake, Alexei Zhitnik and Darryl Sydor -- have been 
erratic at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty is a leader and in the room he's a winner," Melrose said. "He 
challenges players. The group has to police itself." 
</P>
<P>
 McSorley and Paek are expected to be at practice Thursday. "I'm not going to 
try to get in there and do too much," said McSorley, who had 21 points and 139 
penalty minutes in 47 games this season. "I believe in our talent. I'm not 
going to try to be something I'm not."

'94 WINTER LILLEHAMMER OLYMPICS; SUPER-G IS MORE SUPER-GOLD FOR U.S.; ALPINE 
SKIING: ROFFE-STEINROTTER ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT AFTER ANOTHER STUNNING UPSET ON 
THE SLOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diann Roffe-Steinrotter can go off and ride her horses now, on summer days 
along the Raquette River near Potsdam, N.Y. She can stand in the stirrups and 
catch warm breezes. She can know contentment. 
</P>
<P>
 She can carry with her Tuesday's Olympic victory in the women's super-giant 
slalom at Kvitfjell, the latest American success on the slopes here. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Svetlana Gladischeva won the silver, Italy's Isolde Kostner the 
bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 For Roffe-Steinrotter, it was the end of a beginning, a last ride into one 
sunset, the first into another. 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke excitedly of plans, of pursuits, of normality, of her love for 
equestrian, as the metaphor grew of Roffe-Steinrotter upon her white steed, 
galloping away in the classic hero's exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers was not a quixotic quest, she claimed, nor her dream impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure all of you are surprised," she told assembled reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Shocked might have been a better word. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Roffe-Steinrotter could know how she, at 26, found it within her to 
muster such a last-chance charge for the ages. In the ski business, where 
careers are short, she was Jack Nicklaus winning the Masters in his 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Except Nicklaus didn't drop his clubs and walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after her stunning triumph in the super-G, an event in which she ranked 
36th in the world, Roffe-Steinrotter announced her retirement, effective next 
month after the World Cup finals in Vail, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The farewell speech, actually, had been written before the Games -- 
independent of Olympic success or failure. She had to scribble fast to keep one 
step ahead of the whispers. 
</P>
<P>
 She had fought, unsuccessfully for two years, to recapture her last great 
moment, at Albertville in 1992, when she claimed the Olympic silver in giant 
slalom. Now, she claims amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to compare today with low points," she said. "Low points don't 
exist right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11-year career, Roffe-Steinrotter has been nothing if not proud. History 
tends to remember what you did last, not first. She won the world championship 
in giant slalom at 17, an Olympic silver but, before Tuesday, it had been nine 
years between international victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Her ski clock was ticking, but she refused to go gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to cop out," she said. "I wanted to stick it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Her best finishes in super-G this season were 28th, 27th and 25th, but there 
were, she guessed, no laws stating that she could not win. Even so, 
Roffe-Steinrotter said, she was so prom-night nervous as she stood in the start 
gate she was "just dying." 
</P>
<P>
 By luck of the draw, she was the first skier down the course. Bib No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Most would say she drew short straw. There are no training runs in super-G. 
It's a blind race. You can inspect the setting of the gates only by 
side-stepping up the side of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic rookies might have panicked. But what Roffe-Steinrotter lacked in 
skiing power, she made up for in know-how. Before the race, she mapped out the 
course, memorized it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fast on top, more suited to downhillers, but the course tightened in 
the middle stretch and at the end, which played into her slalom skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the critical turns," she said. "That's experience, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 More than others, she also knew what it would take. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes risks," she said. "That's another advantage of experience. I didn't 
want to be fourth, fifth or sixth in the Olympics. If you don't risk 
everything, you won't be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter was ready to risk it all, and it scared her. She had started 
No. 1 in the super-G at Albertville and crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think that didn't go through my mind," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planted too was the memory of Austrian Ulrike Maier, a favorite to win the 
Olympic super-G, who risked everything and died Jan. 29 in a downhill crash in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought a lot about Ulli," Roffe-Steinrotter said. "She could race like no 
other. She should have been an American, the way she raced in big races. If 
she's up there, looking down, she would tell every competitor on the hill just 
to point your skis down and give it your best. She was such a fighter. I wanted 
to do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The course played just as she had seen it. Roffe-Steinrotter was slow on top, 
but held a tight line from the middle through the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time, 1 minute 22.15 seconds, meant nothing until it was measured against 
the field. When she crossed the finish line, Roffe-Steinrotter could only shrug 
her shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Kostner skied second and finished .30 behind the American. Knowing of 
Roffe-Steinrotter's woes this season, Kostner said later she thought she had 
skied poorly and was out of contention. She ended up with the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter's time held through six racers, but had yet to be challenged 
by Murderers' Row, a list of skiers that included Germany's Katja Seizinger, 
the gold-medal favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 When Seizinger crashed on course, the crowd let out telling gasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovenia's Alenka Dovzan, wearing bib No. 13, was leading Roffe-Steinrotter by 
.42 after the second interval, but she, too, skied off course. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovenia's Spela Pretnar, from starting position 28, had the lead by .27 
before she crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter had started to relax when Gladischeva, a longshot, started 
scorching the course from the 35th start. She came up just short, .29 behind 
the American, which was good enough for the silver, the first medal for Russia 
in an Olympic Alpine event. 
</P>
<P>
 America's Angst turned to euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty lucky to pull this one off, the way my season's been," Roffe 
Steinrotter acknowledged. "But no one can take this away. No one can take it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Years from now, no one will remember how close the 1994 gold medalist came to 
not making the Olympic team. Or how Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, drew 
up qualifying criteria the previous summer -- ostensibly to fire up or weed out 
the aging veterans -- and how Roffe-Steinrotter had not met those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't remember how she had hit rock bottom Dec. 4 in Tignes, France, when 
she failed to qualify for a second giant slalom run and wondered how much 
deeper into the bog she could sink. 
</P>
<P>
 Major suggested there was nowhere else to go but up. 
</P>
<P>
 Or out. It didn't help that the only decent showing for Roffe-Steinrotter this 
season didn't even count. In January, she was perched in eighth place in a 
super-G at Altenmarkt, Austria, when the race was canceled after 30 women had 
skied because of deplorable course conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when it came time to pick the U.S. team, Major penciled in 
Roffe-Steinrotter's name. Call it a lifetime-achievement award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's regretting the decision now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Major was expecting a strong performance, but certainly not gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen in athletics," Major said. "She 
was down and out, everyone gave up on her. Then, she wins the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. beat goes on. The super-G gold was the second of the week, a match 
for Tommy Moe's gold in downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. ski fever is contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Nobis, 21, brought to Lillehammer to get some experience for the 1998 
Olympics, finished 10th in the super-G, a result nearly as stunning as 
Roffe-Steinrotter's. First-time Olympian Megan Gerety, whose main claim to fame 
this week is being Moe's girlfriend, was headed for a top-10 finish when she 
went off course six gates from the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilary Lindh finished 13th, her best super-G result of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Major, ebullient and boastful, issued a challenge to the U.S. men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tag, you're it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning heals all wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But even a gold medal can't lure Roffe-Steinrotter back. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the only married member of the women's team, having fallen for Willie 
Steinrotter, a childhood friend. They became more than friends after the 1988 
Calgary Olympics, when Diann returned home and Willie asked her to dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinrotter's father had taught the young Roffe to ski at the Brantling Ski 
Club in Potsdam. Willie, a soccer and ski coach at Clarkson University in 
Potsdam, took a leave of absence to follow his wife to Europe for her last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, he stood, stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way I can describe it is, if you took all the good days that happen 
to you, and wrap them into one, that's how I feel," Willie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter feels like the mother hen among chicks on the U.S. team. She 
doesn't giggle anymore, or chase boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Or engage in pillow fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live a different life than I did at 17," she said. "I like quiet, being at 
home, spending time with my family. This is not the sport that keeps you at 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 Roffe-Steinrotter plans to devote more of her time to horses. She has been 
riding all her life and would like to concentrate on equestrian competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe go for the gold in that. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, it has already been a great ride.

FEMALE PITCHER'S DEBUT IS A BIG WINNER; BASEBALL: ILA BORDERS TAKES SHUTOUT 
INTO EIGHTH AS FIRST WOMAN TO PITCH IN COLLEGIATE GAME. 
</P>

<P>
 The young woman walked across the grass and construction workers in a nearby 
lot stopped their hammering and began to gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman walked to the top of a small slope, paused, looked around and 
threw the small object she was carrying in her left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Curveball low to Gabe Rosenthal, ball one. 
</P>
<P>
 Ila Borders took a deep breath, reared back and threw again. 
</P>
<P>
 Called strike, on the outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Attagirl!" rang a voice from the crowd milling around, a crowd of nearly 300, 
and Ila Borders threw one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 CLANK!  
</P>
<P>
 A high fly ball to center field, a routine fly, a can of corn, a piece of 
cake. Ken Turner, the Southern California College center fielder, squeezed it 
and history had been made at Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Ila Borders, the first woman to pitch in an NCAA baseball game, had retired 
the first man she faced. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an amazing moment -- amazing just to see Borders out there, in her blue 
and white pin-striped cap, surrounded by eight male teammates and decades of 
tradition that held that this was a man's game, no girls allowed, shouldn't you 
be keeping score or something? 
</P>
<P>
 But it would soon be eclipsed by another amazing moment, and another, through 
nine innings and 104 pitches and 27 outs and the incredible final score: 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College 12, Claremont-Mudd 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning pitcher: Borders (1-0). That's what it will say in the box score, now 
and forever, a simple notation that will stand as one of the greater 
understatements. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, on the afternoon of Tuesday, Feb. 15, 1994, Ila Borders pitched and won. 
She also retired the first 10 batters she faced, took a shutout into the eighth 
inning, threw a complete game and restricted Claremont-Mudd to a meager total 
of nine baserunners -- five hits, three walks, one error. 
</P>
<P>
 And, two strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave up one home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a good pitcher," Rosenthal said of the 5-10, 165-pounder. "She threw a 
lot of junk . . . (but) she's always around the dish. "I think she'll do well. 
She'll win again." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning once made SCC, a small Christian college in Costa Mesa that competes 
on the NAIA level, a media hub for one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely feel like this is a beginning for me," she said. "I don't know 
where my ability is going to level off. I don't know who will give me the 
chance to pitch in the pros. But I am not going to look back when I'm 60 and 
say, 'I wish I would have tried.' "

SALMON HAS NICE CHOICE; ANGELS: ROOKIE OF THE YEAR CAN SIGN FOR ONE YEAR OR 
MORE. TANANA SIGNS MINOR LEAGUE CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels are expected to offer right fielder Tim Salmon a guaranteed 
contract that will keep him in the organization through 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have had preliminary talks with Ted Updike, Salmon's agent, 
are scheduled to submit their proposals in a Thursday meeting at Tempe, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who last season became the first Angel to win the American League's 
rookie-of-the-year award, is expected to be able to choose from among three 
offers: a one-year deal for about $500,000, three years for about $4 million or 
four years for about $7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very, very optimistic we can get this done," Updike said. "We're anxious 
to get to the table and to the same page. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim has a very close relationship with the Angels, and we have an idea of 
what the long-term future holds between Tim and the Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 While looking to their future, the Angels are also indulging in a bit of 
nostalgia, inviting 40-year-old pitcher Frank Tanana to camp. Tanana, the 
Angels' first-round draft choice in 1971 who was traded away 13 years ago, 
signed a triple-A contract Tuesday and will report Saturday to spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to feel a little funny," Tanana said. "I mean, outside of 
(coaches) Jimmy Reese and Bobby Knoop, everybody else is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm glad for the opportunity. It was a case where you believe in 
yourself, but you're just waiting to see if anybody else still does." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanana, who was 7-17 last season with a 4.35 earned-run average while pitching 
for the New York Yankees and Mets, did not receive any major league offers 
during the winter.

GOLF / BOB HOPE CLASSIC; PLAYERS MUST WAIT FOR LAST DAY TO TAKE CENTER STAGE IN 
DESERT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Tom Kite has no illusions about what it takes to repeat as champion of the Bob 
Hope Chrysler Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to go out there and make a lot of birdies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite said last year, when he set a 90-hole record with a 35-under-par 325, was 
a lot of fun, but it's nothing like the fun he's about to experience this 
morning when he tees it up with tournament host Bob Hope, former President 
Gerald Ford and rocker Eddie Van Halen on the Palmer Course at PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite and 31 other pros must contend with celebrities as playing partners for 
the first four rounds of this five-day event, while the rest of the 128-player 
field plays with amateur partners in relative obscurity on the tournament's 
four courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The players will rotate among the courses through the first 72 holes, with the 
celebrities moving to La Quinta on Thursday, to Bermuda Dunes on Friday and to 
Indian Wells on Saturday. The final round Sunday will be played on the host 
course, Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Miller, who won this event in 1976 and '77, is the only repeat champion 
in the 34-year history of the Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing in the celebrity field does make it a little more difficult," Kite 
said. "It's going to be a little chaotic. People will be out there with 
cameras, and they will be out there to watch everybody. It's not going to be 
your usual conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to take a little more time and make sure everybody is quiet and 
concentrate a little harder when it's my turn to hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Bill Murray isn't in the field, which means fans probably won't be 
pulled out of the gallery, but Kite said it wouldn't have made any difference 
if Murray were here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have all the details of what went on at Pebble Beach," said Kite, 
referring to the verbal joust between Murray and PGA Tour Commissioner Deane 
Beman at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am two weeks ago. Murray was upset by 
criticism of his antics and lashed out at Beman, telling him he should resign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't see anything wrong with having Murray in the field," Kite 
said. "It's just a situation where you have to find the pros who don't mind it. 
Scott Simpson just loves playing with him. So does David Edwards." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite knows what it's like playing with a comedian for a partner. He has been 
paired with Tommy Smothers, yo-yo and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy has a great time, doing tricks with his yo-yo, lining up my putts with 
the string and walking all over my line," Kite said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the antics would always stop whenever it was Kite's turn to hit the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you're looking for excuses not to play well, you can find them," 
Kite said. "There are plenty there. I would rather find excuses to play well. 
When I'm on my game, playing well, concentrating well, you could set off a bomb 
and it wouldn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite was in such a state a year ago when he shot rounds of 67, 67, 64 and 65, 
then capped it with a record 10-under-par 62 on the Palmer Course. 
</P>
<P>
 His 325 shattered the 90-hole record shared by Andrew Magee and D.A. Weibring, 
both in the 1991 Las Vegas Invitational, by six strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite had two victories, including the Los Angeles Open, a second and an eighth 
in his first five events and was on the way to a record year when a back injury 
stopped him. It was the first time he had been sidelined because of an injury, 
and he was unable to play for nearly three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing wrong with my back now," Kite said. "I do my stretching every 
morning, and it has given me no more problems." 
</P>
<P>
 But that swing, that zone he was in, that confidence -- it's not quite there 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to get that back," Kite said. "I'm getting close to where I 
want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Fehr is working on a three-peat. He finished second two years ago with a 
24-under-par 336 and second last year with a 29-under-par 331. The latter score 
would have been good enough to win any of the previous 33 Hope tournaments, 
except the one in 1991, when Corey Pavin and Mark O'Meara each shot that total. 
Pavin won in a playoff. . . . When Johnny Miller won his consecutive Hopes, he 
was 21 under par in 1975 and 16 under par in '76. 
</P>
<P>
 A local newspaper ran the pairings with celebrities listed in bold face. One 
entrant in light type was a Gerald R. Ford. . . . They have already forgotten 
about part-time pro Mac O'Grady in the desert, despite his living here. He was 
listed as Mack O'Grady. . . . The winner of this $1.1-million tournament will 
receive $198,000, the same as last year. Second place is worth $118,800, which 
is $10,000 more than Donnie Hammond earned for his victory in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer won the Hope for an unprecedented fifth time in 1973. It was his 
last victory on the PGA Tour. Palmer, who is playing for the 35th time in this 
event, is the only one to play in the tournament every year.

DALY SUSPENSION TO END IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly's suspension from the PGA Tour will end March 10 when he competes in 
the Honda tournament at Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., the PGA Tour said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-month suspension was imposed by Commissioner Deane Beman on Nov. 6 
after Daly failed to complete pro-am play in the second round of a tournament 
in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 It came on the heels of a series of off-the-course incidents involving Daly, 
whose personal and professional life has been in turmoil since he became an 
instant hero with a victory in the 1991 PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly, 27, also missed the start of the 1993 season while undergoing treatment 
for alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly acquired a large gallery following when, as an unheralded rookie, his 
enormous distance off the tee helped him win the 1991 PGA title at Crooked 
Stick in Carmel, Ind.

RAMS GO THROUGH CONTRACT MOTIONS; FOOTBALL: TEAM SECURES RIGHTS OF FIRST 
REFUSAL ON CORNERBACK TODD LYGHT. IT DOES NOT DESIGNATE A 'FRANCHISE PLAYER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams bypassed their 13 unrestricted free agents Tuesday and instead 
secured the rights of first refusal on cornerback Todd Lyght, once his contract 
expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the second consecutive year, the Rams declined to designate a 
"franchise player," indicating that they have nobody who deserves to be paid 
the average salary of the top five players at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also bypassed their free agents last year to secure rights of first 
refusal on defensive tackle Sean Gilbert and quarterback Jim Everett, both of 
whom remain under contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert is signed through 1996, and Everett, the starting quarterback until he 
was replaced by T.J. Rubley for the final six games of last season, has two 
years left on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday was the deadline for NFL teams to designate the three players they 
wish to protect from free agency: a franchise player and two transition 
players. Ram Coach Chuck Knox said the team wanted to save its second 
transition pick for later use. 
</P>
<P>
 Franchise players can't solicit contract offers from other teams. Transition 
players can sign with other teams, but their team can retain them by matching 
an offer sheet from the new team. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting Lyght as a "transition player" requires the Rams to tender a 
one-year contract once his current contract expires. The contract would pay him 
the average of the top 10 players at his position or 120% of his previous-year 
salary, whichever is greater. Lyght, the fifth overall pick in the 1991 draft, 
will make $900,000 in the final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght started nine games at left cornerback last season, registering 39 solo 
tackles with two interceptions. He injured his knee during pregame warm-ups, 
was placed on injured reserve Nov. 23, the day after undergoing underwent 
arthroscopic knee surgery, and missed the final seven games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Player contracts expire on Thursday, and restricted and unrestricted free 
agents can begin negotiating with new teams on Friday. The deadline for signing 
restricted players' offer sheets is April 18, a week before the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have 13 unrestricted free agents and seven restricted free agents. 
The restricted free agents are linebacker Roman Phifer, defensive end Robert 
Young, cornerbacks Robert Bailey and Dexter Davis, fullback David Lang, 
defensive tackle David Rocker and guard Jeff Pahukoa. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrestricted free agents are center Blair Bush, tight end Pat Carter, wide 
receiver Henry Ellard, cornerbacks Wymon Henderson and Darryl Henley, 
linebacker Chris Martin, tight end Travis McNeal, offensive tackle Jackie 
Slater, strong safeties Michael Stewart and Pat Terrell, defensive end Tony 
Woods, punter Sean Landeta and tailback Cleveland Gary. The Rams have right of 
first refusal on Landeta and Gary. 
</P>

 Steve Moore, a former offensive assistant coach in Seattle under Knox, was at 
Rams Park Tuesday morning, and the team is expected to announce his hiring 
today.

VERDICT ON ICE?; SKATING JUDGE SAYS FOCUS ON PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding vs. Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the minds of many, it's villainess vs. victim. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the minds of the only people who really matter, those who will 
judge them on the ice in the figure skating competition at the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Can the judges totally block out the constant barrage of information about the 
attack on Kerrigan, which has bombarded them from every media outlet, and 
fairly assess these two skaters and the other competitors solely on the basis 
of their performances? 
</P>
<P>
 Absolutely without reservation, according to Margaret Anne Wier of Park City, 
Utah, who will be the lone U.S. judge in the women's figure skating competition 
starting next Wednesday at Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm judging, I'm focusing in on the skater," Wier said. "I cannot think 
of the publicity or where they placed before. I have to focus in on what they 
did that day. Judges are very open-minded." 
</P>
<P>
 They can't afford not to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't be out of line and be too high or too low," Wier said, "or we'll be 
called on the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 The result of biased judging could be probation or outright expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wier, who skated on three world teams in the 1950s and was a substitute judge 
in the 1992 Winter Games at Albertville, France, will depart for Norway today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to do my job," she said. "I can't let anything affect me. I have heard 
everything everybody else has heard, but I will have to put it all out of my 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're used to pressure, just like the skaters. It's not always easy, but 
we'll do our job." STEVE SPRINGER

DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; PLAYING GAMES IN HALL OF THE MOUNTAIN KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever wish, when you were a kid, that you could play in a cave? Olympic 
hockey players are doing that in nearby Gjovik. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the hockey games are being played in the Gjovik Fjellhall -- 
it means mountain hall -- an amazing sports complex carved into a mountain. 
Well, the Norwegians call it a mountain, but it's more like a good-sized hill. 
Even so, except for the concrete mouths of the entrance tunnels, you could look 
at the otherwise ordinary hill forever and never suspect there was anything 
under the surface but ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, an athletic wonderland -- a full-size international hockey rink with 
seating for 5,800 and an Olympic-size swimming pool -- greet the visitor. The 
rink can also be used for figure skating and curling, and, when it isn't a 
rink, track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 The arena itself looks as modern as can be -- there are even VIP suites -- but 
the corridors and concourses carry out the cave theme. The rock ceilings are 
sprayed with waterproof concrete and the rock walls are decorated with marble 
slabs of etched pictograms -- Viking ships, whales, moose, humans playing 
stickball games -- reminiscent of rock carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice arena, built at a cost of 134 million Norwegian kroner -- more than 
$18 million at the current exchange rate -- is only the latest project in the 
continuing development of the underground center. Excavation actually was begun 
by German armed forces during World War II. They wanted an ammo dump safe from 
air raids, so they built it into the hill. The swimming pool, normally open to 
the public, came years later, and the ice hall was built once the '94 Winter 
Games had been awarded to Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of low maintenance costs -- there are no windows to replace, no roof 
to repair -- the rink will have paid for itself in 15 years, according to Bjorn 
Sandnes, the venue manager. Refrigeration costs are kept low, too, by the 
natural coolness of the cave and huge strips of reflective fabric stretched 
high over the rink, which bounce the escaping cold air back down toward the 
ice.  
</P>
<P>
 There are four entrance tunnels for public use, and one secret one for very 
private use. Workers blasting out the bedrock, carving the tunnels, making an 
arena out of the inside of a hill, thought they would get tickets to all the 
events there. When they learned that wasn't the plan, they cut their own tunnel 
to an area high over the rink, where they put in a bank of seats that will 
never be sold to the public. And now, even the International Olympic Committee 
can't keep them away. MIKE KUPPER

AMERICANS TRY TO SKATE THROUGH THE PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since their wedding less than six months ago, U.S. ice dancers Elizabeth 
Punsalan and Jerod Swallow have been told that they have never skated with more 
affection and commitment. As they glided across the ice in a practice Tuesday 
at the Olympic Amphitheatre, their feelings for one another seemed even more 
vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 When that was mentioned to them later, their eyes met and locked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Punsalan said, "with what we've been through . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days earlier, they were having dinner with his parents in Northville, 
Mich., when she received a call from her family's home in Sheffield Lakes, 
Ohio. Her 57-year-old father, Ernesto, had been stabbed to death while sleeping 
in his bedroom, and her 20-year-old brother, Rickey, had been arrested in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before driving to Ohio the next morning, they released a statement 
through the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. saying that they would go to Norway to 
compete in the Winter Olympics because that is what her father would have 
wanted them to do. But she was not sure until much later that was what she 
wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made up a statement before we were sure," Punsalan said. "It happened so 
quickly. I don't think I was thinking straight at the time. Even on the plane 
to here, I wasn't sure how I'd feel, whether we'd be able to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 They are handling it as well as could be expected, even agreeing to speak to 
reporters virtually whenever asked. They met with a small group after their 
practice Tuesday in the Olympic Amphitheatre, where the dance competition 
begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not among the contenders, Punsalan, 23, and Swallow, 27, seem to be as 
enthusiastic about sharing the same ice with Great Britain's Jayne Torvill and 
Christopher Dean, the 1984 gold medalists who are making a comeback, as they 
are about competing. A top-10 finish would be commendable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even being here is commendable. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first couple of days, we talked about it a lot with close friends," 
Punsalan said. "It helps to get your feelings sorted out. But this is just the 
beginning. I think it's going to take a long time. Some days are better than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a roller-coaster ride. I go from being very high to very low to 
very high. It's tough. I guess I expected it to be tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerod keeps talking to me, and (coach) Igor (Shpilband) keeps talking to me, 
and all I think about is my skating and what I need to do from minute to 
minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swallow: "Our marriage is still young, and we're still young people. At 
this age, you don't always know how to deal with death this close to your 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Although buildings accommodations in the athletes' village don't mix men and 
women, are not coeducational, the USFSA arranged for Swallow to move into a 
room by himself across the hall from the suite Punsalan shares with three other 
woman female figure skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a door knock away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan said she was looking forward to the arrival Tuesday night of her 
mother, two brothers, a sister and a brother-in-law. Swallow's parents and a 
brother also are coming. Another brother who lives in Studio City is still 
cleaning up from last month's earthquake, Swallow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just been a lot of craziness in our lives lately," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with their wedding in Detroit on Sept. 4, the next few months could 
not have been more idyllic. Before leaving home for Norway, they spent hours 
looking at photo albums filled with family pictures from their wedding, 
Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual when she skated in major competitions, her father, a surgeon, could 
not get away from the hospital to travel to Detroit to attend last month's 
national championships, which Punsalan , 23, and Swallow , 27, won for the 
second time since 1991 to earn the United States' only Olympic berth. 
</P>
<P>
 But he planned was planning on taking time off to come to Lillehammer. see 
them skate here. 
</P>
<P>
 When they went to Sheffield Lakes after the national championships, they found 
a large sign on the front lawn of her parents' home, congratulating them on 
their triumph.victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I always knew you'd make it,' " Punsalan said of her father. "He 
wasn't very surprised. He learned all about ice dancing, and he studied our 
tapes. This year, he said he could tell we had improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Swallow: "He was very modest. He'd never talk to the staff at the 
hospital about Liz. They'd see her on TV and ask him, 'Why didn't you tell us 
about your daughter?' He'd just smile. He was so proud of her." 
</P>
<P>
 They said they are not sure what their future holds except that both plan to 
return to school to get their degrees, Swallow in art history and Punsalan in 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad always said ophthalmology was a good field, a 9-to-5 job," she said. 
"He worked around the clock, 24 hours a day, on call all the time. That's why 
he couldn't come to a lot of my skating events." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swallow: "He was as dedicated to his profession as Liz was to her 
skating. That's why he understood why she was doing what she was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan's voice cracked a couple of times while talking about her father, but 
she did not cry until asked about her brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten hours after his release from a psychiatric unit of a nearby hospital, he 
allegedly killed his father with a kitchen knife. He pleaded not guilty to a 
charge of aggravated murder and is being held in Lorain, Ohio, without bail.

CITY COACHES WANT SINGLE DIVISION; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: SIMPLER FORMAT WOULD 
TRY TO ENSURE THAT BEST TEAMS REACH PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As late as 1987, there were three divisions in City Section football. If the 
Los Angeles Football Coaches Assn. has its way, there soon may be one. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers of LAFCA, which represents football coaches in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, met last week to discuss postseason play with the idea 
that simpler might be better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pond is looking pretty even these days," said Kennedy Coach Bob Francola, 
LAFCA's treasurer and the Northwest Valley Conference representative to the 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dorsey or whoever may have a pretty good team, but it isn't like it was in 
the 1970s or '80s (when Banning and Carson were clearly dominant)." 
</P>
<P>
 Because 3-A and 4-A division playoff brackets are limited to 16 teams, several 
good teams are eliminated from consideration each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the postseason plans being considered by the group is a 32-team, 
one-division playoff. Also under consideration is a nine-game regular season 
for all 49 City schools, after which 32 teams would qualify for postseason 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 The eventual City champion would compete in five playoff games. Under the 
concept, the 17 schools that did not qualify for the tournament would play in a 
consolation tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to eliminate situations where good teams don't make the 
playoffs," Francola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plans under discussion: 
</P>
<P>
 * Francola said the association will petition the City athletics office to 
allow season openers next fall to be played Sept. 9, the date Southern Section 
schools begin play. City schools don't open until Sept. 12, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hell Week, a football staple, could fall by the wayside. Mny City schools 
are on the year-round calendar and cannot conduct two-a-day practices because 
students are in class all morning. Consequently, Francola said, the association 
will propose that an extra week of practice be added and that two-a-day 
practices be eliminated. Under the plan, practice would begin two weeks before 
the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 * A City Section all-star game, which could be in place by the summer of 1995, 
also is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
 The association is expected to meet again next month to iron out the specifics 
of the proposals, which must be submitted to the Interscholastic Athletics 
Committee for approval.

BERNARDI WAITED FOR THE RIGHT JOB; BURROUGHS COACH JUMPED BACK INTO COLLEGE 
RANKS WITH UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gary Bernardi's hiatus as a Division I college football coach is over. Barely 
15 months after being dismissed along with the rest of Coach Larry Smith's 
staff at USC, and two months after turning down a job at Missouri, Bernardi was 
hired by UCLA last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi, who was head coach at Burroughs High last season but didn't hide his 
desire to return to the college ranks, said he has been given the ideal 
opportunity at UCLA, where he will replace his best friend, Bob Palcic, who 
jumped to the NFL's Atlanta Falcons. Bernardi will coach UCLA's offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great opportunity and it's exciting as hell," said Bernardi, 39, who 
was back in his 18-hour-per-day routine Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernardi said he won't forget that one-season gap in his college coaching 
career because it was a year that provided misfortunes and blessings at the 
same time. He lost his job at USC and his marriage broke up. But Bernardi also 
improved his relationship with his three children -- using time that he 
couldn't spare while working for victories in the Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've all grown together through this," Bernardi said. "There's been good 
times and there's been times when we've had to work hard at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi longed for a return to the college ranks, but that desire was 
tempered by a firmer commitment to his family. The UCLA job will allow him to 
stay in Santa Clarita while helping the Bruins defend their Pac-10 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary has been a successful coach in the Pac-10 and is a fine addition to our 
staff," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "He has developed All-American and 
all-conference players in his previous positions and he will develop those same 
type of players at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Bernardi was developing a relationship with his children. He said 
he hadn't realized what he had been missing until he started sharing custody of 
Marina, 9, and twins Joe and Briana, 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Against his nature, Bernardi then backed away from four prospective Division I 
jobs: two last spring at schools he chose not to disclose, and two in December 
at Missouri and Memphis State. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had Bernardi on his staff for 12 seasons at Arizona and USC, 
offered him a job within days of his December hiring by Missouri. Bernardi 
declined regretfully, saying he didn't want to leave his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi recently had an eight-hour meeting with Donahue and was ready to jump 
at any offer. But Donahue waited for more than a week before offering the job. 
</P>
<P>
 When Donahue offered, Bernardi jumped -- but not without the full support of 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a majority rule with no dissenting votes," Bernardi said. 
"The children were thrilled to have dad go to UCLA and for the chance to go to 
the Rose Bowl. They know what it's all about. They were around it at USC. 
They've even made their own UCLA posters at the house." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernardi has said the closer relationship with his children changed him. 
At Burroughs, there were no long recruiting trips that made him an absent 
father for weeks at a time. And he cherished the time spent with his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's realized what he has missed all those years at Arizona and USC and 
realized what a support system he has in his family," said Leigh Bernardi, who 
married Gary 12 years ago. "He has been spending more time with his children 
and has been more of a family person because of this job change. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been conscientious about it. I hope it continues." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi said his children know he will again disappear for long periods 
during football season, but the foundation between them is stronger now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them dad will be gone a lot, but that doesn't mean dad does not love 
you," he said. "They're a part of the program. I think that, even though the 
divorce wheels are turning, the family and the job are working. And she 
understands I'm not ready to give up Division I football." 
</P>
<P>
 Leigh Bernardi, who works as a medical assistant while taking 17 1/2 units of 
nursing classes at College of the Canyons, said she remains close to Gary and 
supports all his career decisions. "I want Gary to be successful and happy, I 
want our children to be successful and happy as well," she said. "I know he 
didn't want to leave his kids and his parents, who live in the San Fernando 
Valley. But I know his time is going to be different. His priority is going to 
be UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernardi doesn't want the football players at Burroughs, who finished 5-6 and 
got to the playoffs after going 0-10 the year before, to feel they weren't a 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the best for that high school and those kids," he said. "I care about 
those kids and they busted their butts for me."

O.C. EXECUTIVES NOT SOLD ON PROSPECTS; BUSINESS: UCI SURVEY FINDS OPTIMISM 
ABOUT LOCAL ECONOMY, BUT FEW COMPANIES ARE PLANNING TO HIRE AND MORE ARE 
CONSIDERING RELOCATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Orange County executives are increasingly confident that the local economy is 
rebounding, but that optimism won't lead to significant numbers of new jobs 
this year, according to an annual survey of business attitudes by UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 And, despite the recovery, executives increasingly are looking for greener 
corporate pastures: Nearly two of every five local executives responding to 
UCI's annual Executive Survey said that a corporate relocation is "somewhat" or 
"very likely" during the next five years, up from 30% in 1993 and 20% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of talk about firms exiting Orange County for several 
years," said Dennis Aigner, dean of the UCI Graduate School of Management. 
"However, last year we found a small upturn in the number of firms expecting to 
relocate outside the county, and the trend continued this year." 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's survey does not suggest a massive exodus, however, because just one in 
five executives who is considering an out-of-town move intends to relocate the 
entire company. And, those executives who may relocate say they would leave 
California, suggesting that it's the Golden State -- not Orange County in 
particular -- that's to blame for such corporate unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a distinct lack of leadership in our public sector," said Rich 
Ottaviano, a senior vice president at AST Research Inc. in Irvine. "It's a real 
mess as far as getting a united front" on issues such as business retention. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottaviano, whose employer recently moved 650 technical support and 
manufacturing jobs to Texas and Ireland during a corporate consolidation, said 
there's no clear-cut leadership at the state or local level when it comes to a 
business retention strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at companies with international operations are more likely than 
their counterparts concentrating exclusively on domestic sales to be looking 
for greener corporate pastures, according to UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential flight of international companies "is troubling for Orange 
County," said Kenneth Kraemer, director of UCI's Center for Research on 
Information Technology and Organizations, which helped to conduct the survey. 
"Special attention should be paid to (international companies') concerns about 
the business environment," Kraemer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although survey respondents continue to grumble about the slow-moving economy 
and unfriendly government policies, 78% of the executives told UCI researchers 
that their businesses are better off than at the start of 1993. Most executives 
also believe that the painful process of downsizing -- cutting payrolls to 
respond to the recession -- has bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this guarded optimism will not likely translate into a hiring binge, 
Aigner said. Only a third of executives plan to build their work forces in the 
coming months. Fully half expect no change in the size of their payrolls and 
nearly 20% expect to be cutting back during 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Local executives said they'll be hiring secretaries and salespeople -- a trend 
that doesn't bode well for managers, professional and technical workers and 
blue-collar employees who lost jobs during the recent economic slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "This suggests that companies have permanently eliminated layers of middle 
management and, in many cases, can increase output without adding production 
workers or managers," Aigner said.  
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of respondents said they expected to generate additional business 
in Mexico as a result of the passage of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. But only 2% said they plan to increase operations in Mexico within 
the next year or within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to belie the fears of NAFTA opponents that the treaty would result 
in a rush of jobs out of the United States," Kraemer said. "At least for Orange 
County, that does not appear to be the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives remain convinced that Southern California's economy continues to 
recover. Sixty-two percent of executives said their companies are better off 
than a year ago, up from 49% a year earlier.  
</P>
<P>
 But a substantial number of executives again listed slow economic growth as 
the region's most important issue. Thirty-six percent of respondents listed 
slow growth as their biggest concern, down from 46% in the 1993 survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime -- nearly absent from past surveys -- is now a major concern for 22% of 
executives surveyed. In past surveys, fewer than 5% of executives listed crime 
as a factor. Traffic and population growth -- the leading sources of discontent 
in past surveys -- fell to the bottom of most executives' lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives again complained that California governmental agencies are 
"anti-business." But 65% of executives surveyed said they were satisfied with 
local government, and 51% suggested that county government is doing its job. 
</P>
<P>
 But executives again lambasted state government: Just one in five respondents 
said they were satisfied with lawmakers and regulators in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leading reasons for dissatisfaction with state government are its 
anti-business attitude, workers' compensation issues and an over-regulated 
business environment," Aigner said. 
</P>
<P>
 While 41% of executives believe that the local business environment won't 
deteriorate noticeably this year, an equal number feel the county will become a 
less attractive place to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reasons for the county becoming less attractive are the recession, 
government regulations and the high cost of doing business," according to 
Aigner. 
</P>
<P>
 A sizable number of executives, 15%, said it is difficult to find properly 
trained workers in California. While the state is home to a large pool of 
unemployed workers, Aigner said executives are concerned that "the specific 
technical skills needed in their industry often are lacking, especially among 
professional and technical workers." Relocation Likelihood On the downside, 
more executives this year say it is at least somewhat likely their business 
will move out of Orange County: 04,06,08,10,08 Not Somewhat Very likely likely 
likely 1989 76% 12% 12% 1990 72 15 13 1991 75 16 9 1992 80 13 7 1993 70 17 13 
1994 62 27 11 Business Outlook Brightens 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County executives are somewhat more optimistic about the local economy 
than they were last year. Hiring plans are more positive this year as are 
attitudes toward the county as a place to do business:

 For some, it's a time for champagne. For others, the party is over. Here's a 
look at where the power players stand, now that the Paramount deal is done. 
WINNERS Sumner Redstone: 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom chief vowed that nothing short of an atomic bomb going off would stop 
the deal. The only explosions now are Champagne corks popping. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazard Freres' Felix Rohatyn: 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount's blue chip investment banker looked pretty bad when a Delaware 
court blew Paramount's friendly merger with Viacom out of the water. But they 
escaped with their skin -- and some handsome fees, no doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Barney: 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it wasn't pretty, Redstone's investment bankers helped guide him to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 H. Wayne Huizenga: 
</P>
<P>
 Cut a savvy deal just when Viacom needed him most, allowing him to get a good 
deal in a merger before technology rewinds his video rental business. Some 
Blockbuster shareholders think he should have held out for more. Will he stay, 
or launch yet another new venture? 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Biondi: 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's second-in-command emerges a victor as well. Could he eventually be 
eclipsed by Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga? Losers: 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Diller: 
</P>
<P>
 Clock runs out on QVC bid, just like on one of his home shopping channel's 
cubic zirconia jewelry offers. Stanley Jaffe: 
</P>
<P>
 Savaged by the Wall Street Journal as a screaming nose bleeder (and detailed 
in Variety as a guy who practices growling in front of a mirror), the Paramount 
president will probably be heading for the exits before the credits finish 
rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Davis: 
</P>
<P>
 The Paramount chairman would have been second in command under the friendly 
merger with Viacom. Look for him to bail out with a $150 million parachute. 
Herbert Allen Jr.: 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's investment banker/matchmaker had better luck marrying off MCA to 
Japan's Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC's backers: 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth, Cox Enterprises and Advance Publications see their Hollywood dream 
die - for now, at least.JAMES BATES

JAMES FLANIGAN: JAPAN MUST CHANGE, ASSUME A GROWN-UP ROLE IN WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The highly public arguments now flying between Washington and Tokyo could 
bring healthy change to Japan and the world economy. But the matter is very 
tricky, and misunderstandings between the Clinton Administration and the 
government of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa could worsen relations between 
the world's two largest economies, with consequences unpredictable and ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue goes well beyond trade, which is a relatively simple problem. A deal 
could be made in automobiles and parts, or Congress could permit the export of 
Alaskan oil which Japan would buy. Either way, the roughly $59-billion 
Japan-U.S. merchandise trade deficit could be eliminated. Simply including the 
$19-billion U.S. surplus in services trade with Japan -- transportation, 
tourism, banking and legal services -- reduces the overall deficit sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 But numbers are not the issue. Rather, the concern is Japan's role in a world 
of open economies. Japan benefits from open trade with other countries but 
doesn't reciprocate by allowing access to its own considerable market. It has a 
trade surplus with every major country and trading bloc -- the European Union, 
the rest of Asia, Latin America, the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The imbalance is more than an annoyance. Japan's economy is so large -- $3 
trillion a year in economic activity -- that its policies distort the world 
economy. Denying access to the world's second-largest market reduces 
opportunity for other countries; selling goods abroad at lower prices than in 
Japan, is a strategy designed to "export unemployment," says economist Michael 
Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable on the International Economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overproducing some goods in an attempt to monopolize a business, as Japan did 
years ago when its companies took a $4-billion loss in semiconductors, 
threatens strategic industries of other countries. That's why the United States 
hammered out a semiconductor agreement with Japan in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the U.S. government is seeking an even broader new deal, to open Japan's 
home market which often operates like a stacked deck. Motorola, subject of 
Tuesday's trade action by the U.S. government, has been in Japan for 40 years. 
The Schaumburg, Ill., firm is a pioneer in cellular telephones. But when it 
first brought cellular to Japan, it was told it could only do business in rural 
areas. Motorola protested and was allowed into the Osaka and Tokyo markets, and 
it is doing well in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Tokyo it has done poorly because the Japanese government assigned it an 
affiliate of its chief competitor, Nippon Telegraph & Telephone, as a 
joint-venture partner. The U.S. market may be no picnic, but Fujitsu, Sony, 
Matsushita, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, NEC, Mitsubishi, Hitachi and other Japanese 
firms didn't face that kind of runaround here. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the U.S. government and American trade and economic experts say 
Japan needs to change. 
</P>
<P>
 And many political and economic experts in Japan agree. Tokyo's policy of 
protecting industry, a relic of the nation's postwar rebuilding, has also hurt 
the Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers in Japan pay 40% more for food, furniture and most other goods. 
There are fewer public amenities, such as parks, and a lower standard of 
residential housing than in countries with a fraction of Japan's wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate was severely distorted because capital from years of trade 
surpluses pushed up building prices astronomically. Now prices have fallen in 
Japan's 3-year-old recession, and Japanese banks are left with an estimated 
$200 billion in bad loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, there is more hope than gloom at the moment because Japan is changing. 
Hosokawa, who came to office last year, replacing 45 years of single-party 
rule, brought in voting reform to redress an imbalance that had given farmers 
and other rural residents three times the parliamentary representation of the 
highly populated urban districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlook is for more change -- although it won't come easy. Hosokawa wants 
to boost the economy with income-tax cuts, but he is being blocked by the 
Ministry of Finance, which wants to keep control at the center -- almost like a 
commissariat of the old Soviet Union -- in an era of decentralization. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's a cue for the Clinton Administration. Just as U.S. policy has been 
to help Russia make the transition to a post-Cold War economy, so it wants to 
do the same with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 A more democratic, open Japan would be in the U.S. interest. U.S. companies 
would benefit from access to the Japan's market; the Japanese people would 
benefit from a reorganization of their economy and Japan's companies would 
benefit in an open world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a caveat. The Clinton policy must be principled and long-term, a 
determination to work with the best in Japan, and not a ploy of U.S. domestic 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "A poke in the eye with a sharp stick can be useful," says Richard Drobnick, 
head of an International Business program at USC. "But do we have a policy for 
when Japan screams, or retaliates? Is our policy truly geared to making Japan a 
more cooperative member of the world economy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Borrus of the Berkeley Roundtable, the think tank that Laura Tyson belonged to 
before she became Clinton's chief economic adviser, says it is: "There are some 
smart people in the Administration with very interesting ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Japan, Hosokawa said in Washington that the relationship with the 
United States is changing to one of "grown-ups." A good term. For more than 48 
years now, Japan has been defended by the U.S. military and its protectionist 
policies tolerated while the United States built a postwar world of open 
commerce. It's about time Japan took its place in that world as a grown-up 
nation.

WILSON ACCUSED OF 'JOBS EXTORTION' WITH DETROIT; ELECTRIC CARS: A TOP AIDE TO 
GOVERNOR CALLS THE ALLEGATIONS FROM MICHIGAN'S REP. JOHN DINGELL AND SEN. CARL 
LEVIN 'FLATLY WRONG AND SPURIOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two powerful Michigan lawmakers accused Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday of 
secretly offering to relax California's electric-car mandate in return for a 
pledge from the U.S. auto industry to move jobs to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's top environmental aide denied the charge as "flatly wrong and 
spurious," but Rep. John Dingell and Sen. Carl Levin, both Democrats, asked the 
Clinton Administration to intervene, upping the political ante in a bruising 
battle over California's 1998 deadline for the sale of electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Dingell and Levin -- closely aligned with the Big Three auto firms and the 
United Auto Workers union -- made their plea in a letter to Vice President Al 
Gore. They argued that such "jobs extortion" is an abuse of California's 
authority under the federal Clean Air Act, which gives the state freedom to set 
its own clean-air standards apart from federal requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 This authority was granted to Sacramento "only for the purpose of addressing 
its unique smog problems," they said. "It was never intended to give California 
a bargaining chip to offer up in exchange for automotive manufacturing jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 The auto industry is fighting the 1998 California mandate, contending that a 
breakthrough in battery technology is needed if auto makers are to build 
electric cars that people will want and can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 But regulators and electric-car advocates call that a familiar Detroit smoke 
screen and declare confidently that the state's requirements are forcing the 
technology needed to meet the 1998 deadline. The U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency endorsed the rules Tuesday in a new clean-air plan for the Los Angeles 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has continued to say publicly that he supports the standards and the 
deadline, set by the California Air Resources Board in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The mandate says 2% of all new vehicles sold in the state in 1998 must emit 
zero emissions -- in effect, a requirement to make available about 36,000 
electric cars. The minimum climbs to 10% of new vehicles in 2003. 
</P>
<P>
 A required CARB review of its clean-air schedule will take place this year, 
and that, along with the lead time required to bring new vehicles to market, 
has brought the matter to a head. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as Monday, Wilson's top environmental aide, Cal-EPA Secretary 
James M. Strock, told a legislative hearing that the governor "remains fully 
committed" to the electric-car mandate "as scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 Strock reiterated that position Tuesday in response to the allegations from 
Levin and Dingell. "California in no way intends to compromise" the standards, 
he said. A spokesman said that applied to the timetable, also. 
</P>
<P>
 In their letter to Gore, Levin and Dingell attribute their information on 
Wilson's purported secret offer to two recent articles in the trade publication 
"Inside EPA's California Report." 
</P>
<P>
 One story in the publication quoted an unnamed Wilson aide as saying: "We've 
been putting forth the message if they (Detroit) want consideration of their 
agenda, there's got to be a concomitant agreement (to invest heavily in 
California)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's compromise would relax the zero-emission rule in return for jobs, the 
publication said. 
</P>
<P>
 To those skeptical of Wilson's commitment, other facts lend the reports an air 
of credibility. The state's mania for new jobs is no secret, and Wilson last 
fall had lunch with Ford Vice Chairman Alan Gilmour, who made the auto 
industry's case for delaying the standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious plans to build an electric-car industry in the state have become a 
prominent item on California's economic-development agenda.

ENTERTAINMENT MEGA-MERGER; WALL STREET GIVES PARAMOUNT DEAL A RUDE WELCOME; 
MEDIA: VIACOM FACES A CASH CRUNCH. THE IMPENDING DEPARTURE OF MARTIN DAVIS WILL 
LEAVE STUDIO WITH LEADERSHIP VOID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Viacom Inc. officially secured victory in the five-month battle for 
Paramount Communications Inc. on Tuesday, Wall Street gave the new conglomerate 
a rude welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom shares fell sharply, reflecting concerns that it overpaid in the 
$10-billion deal and that it will have trouble successfully managing 
Paramount's assets. 
</P>
<P>
 In a trend that began with the Viacom/Paramount merger announcement in 
September, Viacom's Class B shares dropped $1.875 Tuesday, to $28 -- 54% below 
their all-time high of $61.25 last year. Its Class A shares lost 75 cents to 
$34.125. Paramount was up 87.5 cents to $77. QVC Network Inc., which lost the 
takeover bid, rose $1.75 to close at $50.25. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Viacom's drop, Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and Paramount Chairman 
Martin Davis celebrated the deal as a bonanza for shareholders and employees 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain resolute in our intentions and unwavering in our conviction that 
the combination of Viacom, Paramount and Blockbuster will create a global media 
powerhouse of unparalleled proportions in the entertainment industry," Redstone 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone remained dogged in his pursuit of victory throughout the long, 
complex battle with QVC and its equally determined chairman, Barry Diller. In 
the final round, Redstone prevailed easily, with some 74.6% of Paramount 
shareholders opting for Viacom's cash-and-stock tender offer over QVC's rival 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is expected to close in late April or May, following the completion 
of Viacom's merger with Blockbuster. Redstone will be chairman and majority 
owner of the combined companies, which combines Paramount Pictures, Simon & 
Schuster, Madison Square Garden, MTV, Showtime and Blockbuster's video stores. 
Viacom Chief Executive Frank Biondi will be CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who had planned to stay on under the original merger deal, will not 
have a role in the new company. He sent a letter to Paramount employees Tuesday 
proudly recounting what he considers to be major successes in refocusing and 
then selling Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to discuss his future plans in an interview but said, "You may 
look forward to hearing from me a great deal in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the biggest takeover battle of the 1990s was a disappointment for 
many stock traders: Although Viacom ended up paying nearly $2 billion more for 
Paramount than it originally planned, QVC never made the knockout offer that 
many expected after a court ruling in November forced a formal auction of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Viacom is feeling the pressure of having paid dearly for a company that 
lost money in its most recent quarter. The slide in Viacom's share price could 
even upset its merger with Blockbuster, a controversial alliance that gave 
Viacom the cash it needed to prevail in the Paramount battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pain for Viacom is going to be considerable," said an institutional 
shareholder who declined to be identified. "They've paid a huge amount of money 
for Paramount, and Paramount's operations are collapsing under people's eyes . 
. . as the pain becomes greater, what happens to the Blockbuster merger?" 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Blockbuster shares were selling for $34 before the Viacom merger 
agreement. They closed Tuesday at $25.25, up 37.5 cents.  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Haverty, an analyst at State Street Research in Boston, said Viacom 
needed to either increase the value of its stock somehow or renegotiate the 
merger with Blockbuster. "We don't think our clients are getting a fair price 
for Blockbuster as it now stands," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Blockbuster merger goes ahead smoothly -- which may happen, since 
Blockbuster Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga and other managers own large stakes -- 
the combined companies will still be burdened with debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Viacom will have to move quickly to sort out the problems at 
Paramount and especially at the flagship movie studio. Although Redstone and 
Biondi are well-regarded managers, neither has any experience running a movie 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Diller's perceived ability to turn the studio into gold that led many 
to favor his bid for Paramount. Now, the expectation is that Viacom will try to 
recruit a top-rank studio executive to manage the prize property. Current 
studio chief Stanley Jaffe is considered sure to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "No question, there's going to be a management shake-up at the studio," said 
Christopher Dixon, an analyst at Paine Webber. He was confident Viacom would be 
able to find the necessary talent to turn the operation around. 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon was not bothered by Viacom's debt. He said the combined companies would 
have more than $2 billion in cash flow -- more than two-and-a-half times the 
estimated debt service costs. "That's considerably less leverage than many 
media companies," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the merger worthwhile, though, Viacom will need to do more than put 
out better movies and maintain its interest payments. Jeffrey Logsdon, an 
analyst with Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles, said Viacom had promised at least 
$100 million a year in savings from eliminating duplicate functions and other 
efficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Far more important, however, is the theory that a large, vertically integrated 
entertainment production and distribution company will be able to take a bigger 
and bigger share of one of the world's fastest-growing -- and fastest-changing 
-- industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll be a globally oriented, vertically integrated manufacturer and 
distributor of 'copyrightable' material," said Dixon, who is bullish on Viacom 
shares.

ENTERTAINMENT MEGA-MERGER; BIONDI: 'GLUE' FOR MEDIA COLOSSUS?; EXECUTIVE: 
VIACOM PRESIDENT SEEN AS STEADY HAND TO RUN VAST CONGLOMERATE AFTER SUCCESSFUL 
DUEL FOR PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 And the winner is . . . Frank J. Biondi Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the merger of Paramount Communications, Viacom 
Inc. and Blockbuster Entertainment will place the 49-year-old Viacom president 
and chief executive at the helm of a conglomerate with a vast array of assets 
and combined 1992 sales of $7.4 billion -- roughly equal to Rupert Murdoch's 
News Corp. media empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The war for Paramount has dealt Biondi a good hand. Back in September, the 
chief executive's job was promised to Paramount Chairman Martin S. Davis as 
part of the friendly merger agreement struck by Paramount and Viacom. But Davis 
had to abandon that deal in order to conduct a court-mandated auction of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 As Viacom searched for a way to improve its bid, Biondi suggested selling a 
block of stock to raise more money for the cash portion of Viacom's tender 
offer. Blockbuster -- already a Viacom backer -- discussed buying more Viacom 
shares for $1.25 billion, and the talks turned to a full-scale merger. 
</P>
<P>
 By several accounts, it was Blockbuster's dynamic chairman, Wayne Huizenga, 
who insisted that Biondi be installed as chief executive of the combine 
companies. And it is a decision that was hailed by the Viacom troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank is a great boss. He's a quick study," said Tom Freston, the MTV 
Networks chairman, who was one of the old guard at Viacom promoted by Biondi. 
"People in Hollywood should be happy that someone like Frank Biondi is coming 
to oversee a studio," Freston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi and Viacom Chairman Sumner M. Redstone take obvious pride in their 
management style at Viacom, which Freston described as "very collegial, very 
accessible" and without "protocol." As Freston noted somewhat wistfully, "life 
will never been the same" as Viacom expands from 5,000 employees to more than 
40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Tuesday, both Biondi and Redstone indicated they want no 
overnight changes at Paramount, which has had three different bosses in as many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Redstone: "Their budgets are higher than I would like, but maybe they 
chose to raise them to attract the talent to the lot." Redstone said Viacom 
would be launching lower-budget movies to take advantage of some of its MTV and 
Nickelodeon characters. Despite speculation that Paramount movie chief Sherry 
Lansing might quit to rejoin her longtime associate, Stanley Jaffe, in an 
independent production company, one insider insisted Tuesday that Lansing is 
enjoying her job and is not a "Siamese twin." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd love for Sherry to stay." He also praised the work of Kerry McCluggage, 
who heads Paramount's television division. On the TV side, however, Viacom 
faces a challenge in merging its own operations with those of Paramount. Biondi 
said that McCluggage "is going to play a very senior role; I just don't know 
yet how that's going to configure." 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi has his detractors. "I've never been a tremendous fan," said the head 
of one entertainment firm, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He's a 
financial analyst. . . . (He's no) Michael Eisner." 
</P>
<P>
 But Freston said he has found Biondi "a fairly good judge of creative product, 
even of things way out of his demographic," such as MTV characters Beavis and 
Butt-head. 
</P>
<P>
 The oldest of three sons, Biondi was born in Manhattan, but his family moved 
when he was young to Livingston, N.J., when his father's job as an applied 
research scientist took him to the suburbs with Bell Labs. Biondi attended 
Catholic schools until switching to a public high school, where he made 
all-state baseball for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychology major at Princeton University, Biondi went on to Harvard Business 
School. Not long after graduation, he was hired by entrepreneur Marshall S. 
Cogan, who was recruiting for his Wall Street investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Biondi worked briefly as a financial analyst for Paul Kagan, among others, 
before settling into a job at Children's Television Workshop and finally, in 
1978, joining Home Box Office. In 1983 he was named chief executive of HBO, but 
was ousted the following year. He landed on his feet with a senior job at 
Coca-Cola's entertainment division, in the days when that company was snapping 
up motion picture and television production firms. In 1987, Biondi was 
recruited by Redstone to serve as Viacom's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 At Viacom, Bioni has been "the moderating influence" for Redstone and Huizenga 
as they plot the merger of their companies, one insides said. "He could be the 
glue that keeps everything together. He's calm; he's solid -- even if he does 
take off some afternoons to play racquetball!"

 Saudi Plane Order Reportedly Set: President Clinton will announce today the 
long-awaited, $6-billion sale of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas airliners to 
Saudi Arabia, said an administration official who asked not to be identified. 
The Saudis tentatively agreed last August to buy at least 50, perhaps 75 of the 
planes, but the order was held up while the Saudis and five U.S. contractors 
worked out a restructuring of about $9 billion worth of planned sales.

 Boeing Plans Production Change: The Boeing Co. said it will increase 
production of its 767 passenger planes and reduce production of the 757 early 
next year. Ron Woodard, president of the commercial airplane group based in 
Seattle, said it was not yet clear how the production change would affect jobs. 
Production of the 767 will increase from three planes a month to four; 757 
production will go to four planes a month from five.

 Weather and Quake Slow Production Rise: Industrial production kept rising in 
January, but more slowly because of severe weather and the Northridge 
earthquake, the federal government said. Economists said output will pick up in 
the first half of 1994, led by automobiles. The Federal Reserve said factory 
output was held to a 0.2% gain last month, but production overall still rose 
0.5%.

TEXACO CLAIMS ADDITIVE BOOSTS PERFORMANCE; GASOLINE: TREATED FUEL IS SAID TO 
BURN CLEANER AND IMPROVE MILEAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Texaco Inc. on Tuesday laid claim to a long-sought gasoline additive -- one 
that reduces engine deposits in a car's combustion chamber that can cause rough 
idling, poor acceleration and power loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its new ingredient, to be incorporated in all grades of 
Texaco gas beginning March 1, also improves mileage and performance while 
lowering emissions of nitrogen oxides, a smog-forming air pollutant, by an 
average of 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, most major oil refiners have relied for much of their 
marketing punch on detergents and other additives that improve engine 
performance. Each brand adds its own mix to various octane grades that 
otherwise are largely interchangeable. Even industry critics agree that most of 
them do some good. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new Texaco additive "can really only be termed a breakthrough," said 
David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation 
at the University of Michigan. "I'm not saying that this is a perfect product, 
but we have seen nothing like it in the marketplace," said Cole, at a press 
conference in New York Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal-combustion motors always have had problems with deposits of unburned 
fuel that clog engines. But a new, varnish-like deposit began to appear after 
unleaded gasolines became standard. Companies developed additives that helped 
to clean carburetors, fuel injectors and intake valves. 
</P>
<P>
 "But combustion-chamber deposits are the sort of Holy Grail of the business," 
said Christopher Dyson, analyst with the consumer group Public Citizen. 
"There's a tremendous value if they've been able to solve that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 There also would be great value to the refining industry if the oil companies 
could meet federal and state standards for cleaner, reformulated gasoline by 
using such additives, Texaco officials stressed. On Monday they presented test 
data to the state Air Resources Board, which is requiring that cleaner-burning 
fuels be available by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have always structured our rules to allow oil companies to devise 
alternatives to our formula if it reduces the same amount of pollution," said 
ARB spokesman Bill Sessa.

MURDOCH HOLDS TALKS TO BUY 2 TV STATIONS TO BE RUN BY DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Media baron Rupert Murdoch is in discussions to buy two TV stations in Salinas 
and San Luis Obispo that would be privately owned under a family trust operated 
separately from his corporate holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry sources said Tuesday that Murdoch has approached the owners of 
KSBW-TV in the Salinas-Monterey area and KSBY-TV in San Luis Obispo, both NBC 
affiliates, which are on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch apparently is interested in buying the stations for his daughter, 
Elisabeth, and her husband, who would then operate them under their own private 
company. The stations would not be part of News Corp.'s Fox TV Stations 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The stations are owned by Apollo Advisers, an investment firm headed by former 
Drexel Burnham executive Leon Black. Sources said the stations are likely to be 
sold for between $32 million and $37 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisabeth Murdoch, 25, has been working at Fox for several years, mostly in 
the TV stations division as a programming executive. She now heads programming 
at Fox's proposed cable TV network. Her husband, former banker Elkin Pianim, 
works in finance at Fox TV Stations. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with Murdoch's interest in the Salinas and San Luis Obispo 
stations said he wants to give his daughter and son-in-law some hands-on 
experience in running a business. Both may play bigger roles at News Corp. in 
the future. Murdoch is said to be one of a handful of potential buyers who have 
been touring the stations in recent weeks. Apollo is expected to have a deal to 
sell the stations by March. 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo and a Murdoch spokesman could not be reached for comment.

DISNEY SEEKING ASIA SITES, NEW CRUISE VENTURE; AMUSEMENTS: MORE OVERSEAS THEME 
PARKS ARE PLANNED. COMPANY AGENTS HAVE BEEN SHOPPING AT SHIPYARDS IN EUROPE. 
</P>

<P>
 Walt Disney Co. may start its own cruise ship line, and is looking for theme 
park sites in Asia, a top executive confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's interest in entering the cruise business comes near the end of an 
eight-year relationship with Florida-based Premier Cruise Lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than window shopping," Peter Rummel, president of Disney 
Development Co., said in an interview. "We have spent some time trying to 
understand the (cruise) business." 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the Pacific Rim presents an "enormous business opportunity" for 
Disney, Rummel said in a memo last week to Disney executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel said Disney is ready to continue expanding internationally although the 
Euro Disney resort outside Paris lost more than $900 million in the last fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has threatened to abandon that project -- it owns 49% of Euro Disney's 
parent company -- if lenders won't refinance construction loans there. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of expansion plans offered further evidence that the Burbank-based 
company is actively looking for fresh opportunities to exploit its strengths in 
family entertainment. It comes on the heels of an announcement that Disney will 
renovate a theater on New York's 42nd Street for stage productions, and in the 
midst of the first season of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, a National Hockey 
League team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Logsden, an analyst with Seidler Amdec Securities in Los Angeles, 
called Disney's long-range planning on Asia commendable, though he cast doubt 
on the cruise ship efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of developing a cruise business, he said, profit margins would be 
higher if Disney could entice more people to stay in the hotels in its theme 
parks, where they are continually shelling out money for food, tickets and 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia, Disney already has its name on the popular Tokyo Disneyland, owned by 
Oriental Land Co. 
</P>
<P>
 That relationship remains close enough that Disney Chairman Michael Eisner 
announced plans two years ago to develop an ocean-oriented theme park in Tokyo 
with Oriental Land. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel said any additional Asian sites would be developed without interfering 
with the Japanese property. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last thing we are going to do is step on our own toes," said Rummel, who 
also heads Disney Design & Development, an umbrella organization that covers 
his division and Walt Disney Imagineering in Glendale, the company's creative 
and engineering arm for theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rummel has promoted Ken Wong, a senior vice president, to lead the hunt for 
new Asian sites. Wong is also the executive in charge of the proposed 
$3-billion Disneyland Resort in Anaheim. Rummel stressed, however, that putting 
Wong in charge of both projects should not suggest any loss of interest in the 
Anaheim project. 
</P>
<P>
 Some theme park industry observers agreed that there are opportunities for 
Disney in Asia, where there are many theme parks near major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Benedick, senior vice president of Management Resources, a theme park 
consulting firm in Tustin, said Asia is "a relatively untapped market." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to cruise ships, Disney could quickly become a major player in 
the family market. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, its name has been linked with the "Big Red Boats" of Premier, a 
three-ship line based at Cape Canaveral that promotes family cruises with 
costumed Disney characters aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms recently announced that their arrangement would expire March 31 "by 
mutual agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Disney has been talking about an alliance with another major 
cruise ship line. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Nierenberg, co-founder of Premier and now chairman of American Family 
Cruises in Miami, said Disney is "definitely" going to enter the cruise ship 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Oivind Mathisen editor of Cruise Industry News, a trade publication 
based in New York: "It is known that Disney executives have been visiting 
European shipyards."

 Regulatory Supervision of Citicorp Ends: Citicorp said the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York have ended 
two years of close regulatory supervision since the banking company's financial 
condition has improved. Termination of the supervision could clear the way for 
Citicorp to pay its first quarterly dividend, suspended since October, 1991. In 
February, 1992, supervision was imposed because of bad loans.

 Firings of Mexican Workers Challenged: The Teamsters and United Electrical 
Workers challenged the firings of Mexican workers by two U.S. companies, filing 
complaints with the National Administrative Office set up under the North 
American Free Trade Agreement.The Teamsters' complaint was against Honeywell 
Inc.; the United Electrical Workers cited General Electric Co. Soon after 
Congress approved NAFTA, workers were fired by Honeywell in Chihuahua and by GE 
in Juarez, for leading labor-organization drives, the unions said. They asked 
the National Administrative Office to force the companies to reinstate the 
workers, and to allow Mexican employees to form and join unions without 
intimidation from management.

CALFED TO UNLOAD $800 MILLION IN LOANS; THRIFTS: THE TROUBLED SAVINGS AND LOAN 
SAYS THE SALE OF WILL RESULT IN A $280-MILLION CHARGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major effort to cleanse its balance sheet, California Federal Bank said 
Tuesday that it plans to unload $800 million in problem assets through bulk 
sales -- a move that will result in a charge of $280 million in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of the sale and the size of the charge were much larger than had 
been expected and are the final elements of a bold, but risky, restructuring 
plan that aims to restore the giant savings and loan to financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market reacted coolly to CalFed's bulk sale plan. CalFed shares fell 
75 cents to $12.50 Tuesday in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The loans are expected to be sold at a deep discount to private investors 
through Wall Street brokerage houses. CalFed said the sale will result in a 
first-quarter loss but did not say how large it would be. The Los Angeles-based 
savings and loan lost more $145 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bulk sale succeeds, CalFed would join H.F. Ahmanson, Great Western 
Financial and other thrifts that have recently jettisoned problem loans en 
masse rather than take the time-consuming route of nursing delinquent assets 
back to health or selling them piecemeal through foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit of selling off bad loans in bulk is they clean up a thrift's 
balance sheet in "one fell swoop," said Prudential Securities thrift analyst 
Thomas O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk is that lenders sometimes sell the assets too cheaply. If successful 
though, CalFed's move would reduce its portfolio of non-performing assets to 
less than 2% of total assets -- down from 5.26% at the end of December. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the loans that would be sold are officially categorized as 
non-accrual, meaning the borrowers are generally not paying back the loans.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SPAT OVER TRADE COULD BE BULLISH FOR WORLD STOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the afterglow of NAFTA and GATT, the last problem investors expected in 
1994 was a trade war. But if we're to believe the rhetoric, a war is in fact 
brewing between America and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The knee-jerk reaction is to view the breakdown of trade talks between the two 
giants as inherently negative for stocks worldwide. After all, if the United 
States slaps sanctions on Japan, the Japanese could follow suit. If the 
retaliation escalates, the level of trade affected could balloon, pulling other 
nations into the fray and leading to a breakdown of global commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, if GATT was bullish for world stock markets, wouldn't a trade war be 
bearish? 
</P>
<P>
 It would--except that it isn't likely to happen. And in the context of stock 
markets, the surprise could be that this trade spat is bullish for 
most--especially the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
 First, why doubt that the U.S.-Japan fight will mushroom? That too much is at 
stake is obvious. President Clinton, who risked considerable political capital 
in the battles for the North American Free Trade Agreement and the global 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade last fall, certainly understands the 
folly of a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters even suggest that the level of discord between Clinton and 
Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa last Friday, when their talks 
collapsed, was staged. "Why bring the prime minister all the way to Washington 
for nothing?" asked Steven Nagourney, global stock strategist at Lehman Bros. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The conspiracy theory actually isn't such a stretch: Just assume that 
Clinton's vehement response to Japan's unwillingness to set trade goals for key 
markets is meant to heat up the debate over what Japanese consumers pay for 
goods (i.e., that they pay too much). If the outcome is that Japan's rigid 
bureaucrats are further discredited with the people, Hosokawa the reformer 
could emerge the hero, with some compromise trade plan that finally starts 
serious economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also important to remember what the United States is fighting for. The 
conflict appears to be the United States versus Japan, but in fact, the war is 
being waged as well on behalf of the Europeans and the Latin Americans, who 
want greater access to Japan's sheltered markets. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this ultimately have to do with stock prices? If free trade, or at 
least freer trade, gives consumers everywhere access to the least-expensive, 
highest-quality products, then the odds of continuing global economic growth 
improve substantially. The efficient producers will be rewarded, which means 
that companies (and countries) will have strong incentives to continue to 
invest in their physical plant and in their people. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock markets naturally respond well to the promise of efficiency and growth; 
they abhor mismanagement and stagnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when bearish investors ask why U.S. stock prices are so high, the 
bulls have a good answer: The market senses the dramatic changes in our economy 
over the past 10 years, and the potential for surprising corporate profit 
growth in the '90s because of those changes. 
</P>
<P>
 What we may have, in fact, is a virtual reversal of roles between America and 
Japan from 10 years ago, says Tom Robinson, international investment strategist 
at Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago, Japan was the low-cost manufacturer with an undervalued currency 
and seemingly limitless access to cheap capital. Today, Robinson notes, that 
much more accurately describes America--after years of extraordinarily painful 
corporate restructurings and the Federal Reserve's oft-criticized efforts to 
wring inflation from our system. 
</P>
<P>
 If the role reversal goes ditto for the stock markets of the United States and 
Japan, it's not hard to see the possibilities. U.S. stocks could be in the 
midst of a far longer bull run than many investors now imagine. And Japanese 
stocks could remain mired in their trading-range-type bear market of the past 
two years, as Japanese companies finally restructure to compete in the changed 
economic order abroad and at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman's Nagourney, who regularly compares the fundamentals of 20 world stock 
markets to identify the most and least desirable ones for new investment, says 
U.S. stocks have jumped to eighth place in his rankings, from 18th three months 
ago. That is partly a factor of the sharp rise in many foreign markets in the 
fourth quarter, which effectively raised their risk levels. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Nagourney says, if you believe the U.S.-Japan trade skirmish 
implies something positive, rather than negative for the world economy in the 
year ahead, U.S. stocks in particular could be poised to perform much better 
than the bears would have us believe. Rating World Markets Lehman Bros. analyst 
Steven Nagourney rates 20 world stock markets by their earnings and price

 The European Commission is due to fine 17 steel companies Wednesday on grounds 
they colluded illegally to fix prices, a senior official for the commission 
said.Ironically, the fines will be announced the day after the commission meets 
industry representatives to seek cuts in production capacity as part of an 
attempt to haul the beleaguered sector out of trouble. Among the firms in line 
for fines are Arbed, British Steel, Unimetal, Saarstahl, Ferdofin, Fried 
Krupp-Hoesch, NMH Stahlwerke and Fundia Norske, the official said. Under 
European Union antitrust rules, the commission can fine firms up to 10% of 
their annual sales revenue.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; JAPANESE PIZZA WAR: DOMINO'S, KFC IN A FAST-FOOD FAMILY 
FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's a big cheese in Tokyo's fiercely competitive pizza business, it is 
Ernest M. Higa. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa courted pizza magnate Thomas Monaghan in the mid-1980s, and walked off 
with exclusive franchising rights in Japan for the Domino's Pizza Inc. chain. 
Since then, he has clawed his way to the top of Tokyo takeout, with home 
deliveries of sushi and smoked-eel pizza within 30 minutes or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, the Higa (pronounced Hee-guh) success story could come in for 
some serious revision, thanks to competition very close to home. Higa's 
brother-in-law is Takeshi Okawara, the head of Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) 
Japan, this nation's second-largest fast-food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 months ago, KFC acquired from Pepsico Inc. the right to duplicate the 
Pizza Hut restaurant concept in Japan, and it has already opened about 50 Pizza 
Huts for a trial run. 
</P>
<P>
 KFC is weighing a major expansion that could mean 300 outlets opening in the 
next few years. Higa's Domino's has 102 locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's awkward about all of this is that (Okawara) has been my mentor for 
this industry," said the 41-year-old Higa, although he describes the rivalry as 
a friendly, family one. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Okawara's wife and Higa's sister, Aiko Okawara, run JC Foods Inc., 
which supplies pizza ingredients to Domino's. While cross-linked family 
businesses are common in Asia, American executives who do business with the 
firms see the family feud as a little jarring. "It isn't an ideal situation 
from a conflict-of-interest standpoint," said Joel Silverstein, a vice 
president of Pepsico's KFC International unit. "In the United States it would 
be unheard of." 
</P>
<P>
 The turf battle between Higa and Okawara is an interesting twist in the 
history of what has been described as Tokyo's first family of fast food. Over 
the years, the Higa clan has made a fortune importing enshrined bits of 
Americana to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Descendants of Hawaiian sugar-cane farmers, the family moved to Japan after 
World War II. Patriarch and entrepreneur Yetsuo Higa, now 78, brought U.S. 
baseball teams to Japan for exhibition games in the 1950s. He also bought a 
Pepsi-Cola bottling franchise and played a big role in introducing the beverage 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 30 years later, Ernest Higa decided he wanted a slice of the pizza market 
after he read that a pizza fortune had helped finance Monaghan's purchase of 
the Detroit Tigers baseball team in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Higa's journey to the top of Japan's $8.8-billion fast-food business 
started just outside Tiger stadium in Detroit, where Monaghan had dispatched a 
helicopter to whisk the aspiring entrepreneur to the Domino's home office in 
Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Higa walked away with exclusive franchise rights for Japan. He 
opened his first Domino's in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa had a devil of a time, however, persuading his bankers, as well as his 
own Japanese executives at his Y. Higa Corp. trading company, that the venture 
would fly. At the time, the only Japanese familiar with pizza were college 
women, according to Higa's research. Pepperoni was unheard of in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa succeeded by sticking closely to the Domino's formula and making just a 
few changes to suit Japanese tastes. For starters, he shrunk the diameters of 
the pies to 10 inches and 14 inches from 12 inches and 16 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to American-style toppings such as Italian sausage and pepperoni, 
Domino's Japan also offered local favorites such as squid, scallops and corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Higa almost single-handedly created a booming business in pizza. Higa's 
Domino's franchises average about $1 million a year in sales -- about twice the 
U.S. average. Higa would not disclose profits, but his pizza business was 
growing 20% to 40% annually until last year, when recession curbed demand. 
</P>
<P>
 And fending off the Pizza Hut assault won't be a cinch. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Domino's meteoric success has attracted plenty of newcomers. 
About 20 major pizza chains in Japan are now discounting prices to draw 
customers amid the current economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the firms "might even go bankrupt," said Toshiko Binder, an analyst 
for S. G. Warburg, the British brokerage house. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Domino's hasn't budged from its standard pizza price of roughly 
$17.85, though the chain is running promotions of side dishes and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Higa will be at a decided disadvantage to brother-in-law Okawara when it 
comes to financial resources. Privately held Higa Corp.'s sales are close to 
$300 million, but publicly traded KFC Japan's revenue is more than twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives back at Domino's home office aren't too concerned, however. "(Higa) 
is really a beacon for Domino's, and flies to the United States at least once a 
year to pick up a boatload of awards at our annual franchise meetings," a 
Domino's spokesman said. "If we could clone Ernie Higa, we would."

 Northwest Airlines and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines will launch a new business 
class on their international flights beginning in April as part of the 
carriers' growing global partnership. Passengers flying World Business Class on 
either airline can expect larger seats and more legroom than in existing 
business class, as well as improved meals and in-flight amenities, say airline 
officials. The enlargement and improvement of business class cabins will come 
at the expense of first class, which KLM has eliminated and Northwest is 
reducing. JESUS SANCHEZ

 Fifteen years after it got off the ground in Los Angeles, the Century Freeway 
Affirmative Action Committee is coming to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is a nonprofit organization founded in 1979 to foster minority- 
and female-owned business participation in the construction of the Century 
Freeway.The freeway is almost completed, but the Century Freeway Affirmative 
Action Committee lives on. The organization helps make small businesses aware 
of contract opportunities with government agencies and large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning March 9, the committee will hold monthly breakfast meetings in 
Orange County. Its first session here will be at the Red Lion Inn in Costa Mesa 
from 7:30 to 9 a.m. The networking sessions are co-sponsored by the U.S. Small 
Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a large constituency of small businesses in Orange County that could 
benefit from our services," said Andrew Delgado, executive director of the 
Century Freeway Affirmative Action Committee. The county is home to about 
26,000 minority- and female-owned firms, according to U.S. Census Bureau 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee provides companies with a list of contract and procurement 
opportunities, from repair of earthquake-damaged freeways to construction 
projects overseen by Irvine-based Fluor Corp. It also helps educate small 
businesses about the often-complicated process of working with a government 
bureaucracy or a large company. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't know what you're getting into, you can get swallowed up," 
Delgado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfasts will be at various locations on the second Wednesday of each month. 
Cost is $15. For reservations and more information, call the committee at (310) 
419-8003.

SUPERVISORS OK DILUTED PENSION REFORM PLAN; GOVERNMENT: GLORIA MOLINA IS UNABLE 
TO KILL A RULE GIVING UNUSUALLY HIGH RETIREMENT BENEFITS TO SENIOR OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After five hours of sometimes angry debate, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors on Tuesday approved a watered-down pension reform plan that allows 
most senior county officials to continue receiving unusually high retirement 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a partial but disappointing victory for Supervisor Gloria Molina, 
who waged a two-year battle to rescind pension rules that boosted the 
retirement pay of senior county officials by 20% at a cost to taxpayers of more 
than $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the board cast a 3-2 vote to curtail pension benefits for new 
hires and slow the growth of pension benefits for current employees. Those 
changes could ultimately save as much as $18 million a year, officials said. 
But the board refused to approve a key recommendation to freeze or at least 
reduce the current controversial level of pension benefits, which could have 
saved an additional $12 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pension spiking didn't end today," Molina said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Ed Edelman, who blocked some of Molina's efforts, said progress 
was made: "It sets in motion some important steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The current pension rules, adopted in 1991, dramatically increased retirement 
pay by counting the value of fringe benefits, such as health and life 
insurance, as compensation for the purposes of calculating retirement pay. 
Under the pension rules, some senior executives and elected officials can get 
more in retirement pay than they do on the job. For instance, Public Works 
chief Tom Tidemanson, who is planning to retire in March, will receive $193,000 
in annual pension pay -- or about $35,000 more than his current annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina and her ally, Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, voted against 
the proposal on new hires because it did not go far enough. They wanted the 
benefits for new management employees halted immediately. The motion carried by 
Edelman, Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana would put off that decision until an 
agreement is worked out with union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders for the most part had endorsed Molina's proposal and were 
willing to quickly negotiate a halt to extending the benefits for new hires. 
But when the package began to unravel under amendments by Edelman and 
Antonovich, labor officials said all bets were off, and they may refuse to open 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 That would essentially put off any savings from reforms until at least 1995, 
when contracts come up for renegotiation anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina argued -- and Gilbert Cedillo, general manager of Service Employees 
International Union Local 660, agreed -- that some of the amendments offered by 
her colleagues would actually accentuate the pension problem by providing even 
more generous benefits for the most highly paid managers and elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she said, Edelman's plan to freeze the percentage of fringe 
benefits that an employee can count as part of his compensation, rather than 
freezing the dollar amount, favors the highest-paid county officials. Fringe 
benefits for the rank and file are set by dollar amount, while benefits for top 
management are based on salary and would continue to grow with every pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edelman said that Molina's recommendation to freeze the dollar amount of 
fringe benefits counted toward pensions would be illegal. The competing 
proposals will be debated by the board again next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina's proposal was based on the recommendations of the county's Citizens 
Economy and Efficiency Commission, which concluded that the current pension 
rules were overly generous and in need of an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission Chairman Gunther W. Buerk said that overall he was pleased with the 
supervisors' actions but was disappointed that they did not go further and 
support Molina's bid to freeze the monetary amount of benefits, which was a key 
element of the commission's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, Buerk said the pension controversy had been hanging 
over the county like a "black cloud that will only go away if you take action." 
After the meeting, Buerk said, "Well, the black clouds are at least moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Commission member Louise Frankel was more frank in her assessment: "They 
emasculated it." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina had hoped to build a minimum three-vote majority vote with Burke and 
Dana, who ran in a hotly contested reelection bid in 1992 saying he was 
"leading the fight against pension spiking." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he did not support Molina on Tuesday, Dana, who was silent 
through much of the protracted debate, said "I like to have four votes" on 
important issues such as pensions. But Dana had no apparent problem being part 
of 3-2 votes that sent some of Molina's proposals to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dana was not on my side because he's not running anymore," Molina said after 
the marathon debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of pensions is complicated enough, but the supervisors' job of 
sorting through the issue was complicated by widely divergent figures on the 
potential savings of the proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Economy and Efficiency Commission, which hired the pension 
consulting firm of W.F. Coroon to crunch its numbers, said the reforms could 
save $18 million to $30 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed calculated the figure at less 
than $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Frankel told supervisors that the dollar amount was immaterial, 
that any savings are worth the effort. "Let's get on with it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's decision four years ago to increase pensions of the highest-paid 
county employees and elected officials has been criticized in a string of 
investigations, studies and legislation, and by Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
state's largest taxpayers organizations. The pension rules, revealed by The 
Times two years ago, were adopted without a public vote of the supervisors or 
any study of their financial impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's pension decision immediately created a deficit in the employees' 
pension fund of about $267 million. That has grown to more than $400 million, 
after the rules were extended to include rank and file employees on a limited 
basis. The deficit has to be paid off by the county within 20 years.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CSUN PLANS MASSIVE FUND-RAISING APPEAL; 
CONTRIBUTIONS: LETTERS WILL BE MAILED TO 130,000 ALUMNI NATIONWIDE. FOR THE 
QUAKE-CRIPPLED CAMPUS, IT WILL BE THE LARGEST CAMPAIGN IN YEARS. 
</P>

 Hoping to strike at a time when massive earthquake damage on campus has thrust 
Cal State Northridge into the national spotlight, university officials said 
Tuesday that they plan to mail fund-raising campaign letters to 130,000 alumni 
nationwide, their most ambitious solicitation effort in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal will consist of three letters from CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson. 
Alumni in the San Fernando Valley and adjoining earthquake-damaged areas will 
get a general greeting and update, while alumni in other Southern California 
areas and nationally will receive specific appeals for contributions of up to 
$1,000, CSUN officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've been splashed all over the world as an institution that got very 
badly hit, it's important you communicate with your friends and alumni that 
you're still alive and well," said Wilson, who was named CSUN's president in 
May, 1992, with a mandate to improve the campus' historically lagging 
fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hammerschmidt, CSUN's director of university development, said the 
Jan. 17 earthquake simply accelerated the university's prior plans to mount a 
major fund-raising campaign. Without the earthquake, he said, "we probably 
would have not even started thinking about it for two or three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no official tally has been prepared, CSUN officials have estimated 
that the earthquake will cost the campus $250 million to $350 million in 
damages and other expenses. That would make it the costliest loss ever for a 
U.S. institution of higher learning. Federal and state disaster relief funds 
are expected to cover most of the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Any proceeds from the mailed solicitations, which will cost $10,000 to 
$12,000, will be used toward covering expenses not reimbursed from other 
sources, Hammerschmidt said. But he offered no estimate of how much money the 
appeal might produce.  
</P>
<P>
 In the forthcoming letter to Valley-area alumni, the university decided 
against making an explicit financial appeal, figuring local residents may have 
suffered earthquake losses as well. But Hammerschmidt said the university 
nonetheless hopes to expand its contacts with those alumni as a prelude to 
future fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, Hammerschmidt said CSUN hopes to do three or four fund-raising 
mailings a year to alumni. Neither he nor Wilson could recall the last time 
that CSUN sent as large a fund-raising appeal as is planned this week. In 
recent years, the university has relied mostly on a computerized phone bank, an 
operation staffed by paid students. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northridge in 1992-1993 ranked as the fourth-largest campus in 
enrollment in the 20-campus Cal State system, it ranked only 10th in attracting 
donations, a total of $4.9 million, according to state records. But only about 
$450,000 of that came from alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, the university has already received a $50,000 donation 
from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, $25,000 from The 
Commonwealth Fund and $10,000 from Union Bank, Hammerschmidt said. Wilson 
serves as a director for the latter two groups. CSUN also received an 
unsolicited $1,000 donation from a graduate alumnus in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments, the campus, which reopened Monday, showed fewer signs 
of chaos. Workers toiled to complete the remainder of a mini-city of portable 
classrooms brought in because virtually all of CSUN's major classroom buildings 
remain closed. Even so, students and faculty members seemed to better cope with 
the disarray than on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 More portable classrooms were opened and signs identifying individual 
classrooms and areas, virtually absent the day before, were widely posted. But 
clusters of modular classrooms mostly at the north end of the campus remained 
incomplete, and many groups of instructors and students were forced to gather 
in the open or under the shade of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN Dean of Libraries Susan Curzon predicted that the heavily damaged Delmar 
T. Oviatt Library will remain closed at least for the entire spring semester. 
The expected long delay in reopening the library, the centerpiece building on 
campus, is due to the extensive work required to identify how severely it was 
damaged, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, meanwhile, are being shuttled to UCLA, and Curzon said she hopes to 
have an electronic mini-library open in temporary quarters on campus within a 
month.

 Joan Cassese split from her husband of 10 years in 1992, setting off to start

 After yet another long day of unclogging drains and plunging toilets, plumber 
Charlie Scott can't even smoke a cigarette, zoning out in front of the boob 
tube. For now, he's living with the in-laws, who can't stand smoke and go to 
bed so early that Scott and his wife have to watch TV with closed captions, as 
though watching some highfalutin foreign film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie raises his eyebrows a lot around here because my parents are 
particular about things we're not used to," said wife Cathy. "Like, they don't 
smoke and we do. So we end up lighting up outside in the back yard. It's kind 
of cold, but there we are, huddled like a couple of teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley has been filled with some bizarre bedfellows after the 
temblor as countless displaced residents have taken advantage of something far 
more traumatic than the no-strings-attached kindness of strangers: 
</P>
<P>
 Grandmothers. In-laws. Kooky co-workers. Estranged siblings. Ex-wives. 
</P>
<P>
 Under many roofs, it's been a replay of "All in the Family." The Meathead 
arguing with grouchy father-in-law Archie Bunker. It's cranky Uncle Charlie 
moving back in to feed the boys in "My Three Sons." The Hotel California. 
Melrose Place meets The Golden Girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Grown children endure the saccharine-sweet nicknames they won as infants. 
Obsessive mothers force chicken soup and bag lunches on their white-collar 
sons. Even among friends, there have been fights over first-shower rights, 
angry looks at the breakfast table over the teething baby's cries the previous 
night. And, of course, there's the opinionated grandmother poking her nose into 
family arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, your mother loves you -- she loves you too much," said one 22-year-old 
North Hollywood nurse forced to move back in with her widowed mom. "It's really 
like some nightmare you have about going back to your childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because no matter how nice your mother is, how understanding, how willing to 
help, she still lives life differently than yours. You think you're finally out 
of the house and then you're back and your mother is trying to stuff you with 
food like a turkey. It's like, 'Later Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake has affected about 55,000 homes and apartments in 
the Los Angeles area. While statistics are hard to come by, Red Cross officials 
estimate that thousands of residents continue to seek temporary and long-term 
shelter with friends, family and co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Cosley has been keeping an eye on such informal arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 He's a domestic-violence detective for the LAPD's West Valley office who has 
been looking for signs that such family reunions don't lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, such instances have been few. But as time goes on and as family guests 
reluctantly overstay their welcome, Cosley says, even the calmest nerves may 
fray. People lash out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like the guy from Canoga Park who punched out his wife, apparently from the 
stress of living with his in-laws," Cosley said. "The in-laws called police. 
We're still looking for him." 
</P>
<P>
 As the dust clears from her own personal earthquake, 22-year-old Kristi 
Skinner has realized that being back home in Glendale isn't so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if her mother, Sharon Saye, and her 6-year-old sister call her 
"Sissy"? And what if Mom, as she did years ago, waits for Skinner when she goes 
out? 
</P>
<P>
 Five years away from home can change a young woman, she says. Things like that 
don't grate on her as much. She and Mom are friends now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, we've resumed some of our old roles now that she's back home," said 
Saye, an Encino dentist. "But there have been the surprises, like coming home 
to find the house clean and the dishes done. That didn't happen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Most nights, Charlie and Cathy Scott hold their breath at her parents' Canoga 
Park home, tiptoeing around so as to not wake their hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Being good guests, they do what they can to keep the peace. But Cathy still 
isn't used to her dad snooping into the pots on the stove. Charlie likes to eat 
late and his father-in-law early, so there always seems to be a meal cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the time Charlie parked his truck too close to the security 
night light trip switch in the front yard. "My dad made him move his truck 
about six inches," Cathy said. "After they went to bed, Charlie said, 'Why 
didn't he just turn the dumb light off?' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill and Fern Burch say that, despite minor disagreements, everyone has 
made the best of things. After all, the kids don't have to keep the television 
sound off at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heck, Bill is hard of hearing and I just blank everything out," Fern said. 
"We just close our door at night. The kids are just trying to be considerate." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sherman Oaks, Vicki Shenkman's mother has had the paradoxical effects of 
dividing and uniting her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Mom butts her nose into arguments. The longer she stays, Shenkman says, 
the more opinions she has on every subject. And the schoolteacher and her 
husband cannot entertain anymore: Mom has moved into the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mom's presence has drawn Shenkman's husband and young daughter closer. The 
girl runs to Dad with every outrageous thing Grandma has to say. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom's birthday is coming up," Shenkman said. "And her son-in-law bought 
her a nice gift: A Coleman stove and a pup tent." 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Cassese defines a new breed of post-earthquake victim: the middle-class 
homeless. You name the place, she's slept there. Couches of co-workers and of 
pesky older brothers. She's slept in the same bed as married-couple friends. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was The Ex. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning of the quake, he came driving up to her Woodland Hills apartment 
with friends and drove her to the safety of his home -- the one that used to be 
theirs together. She stayed only one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of weird, kind of tense," said the 31-year-old accountant. "He 
didn't want the divorce. We're not enemies, but it was hard because there are 
still lots of feelings there. His parents called and thought it was strange 
that I answered the phone. It was strange." 
</P>
<P>
 With Cassese, there was no happy ending to the reunion. She and her husband 
still don't talk much. She has moved on to other places as she searches for a 
permanent home. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night, I checked into a motel, just to get away from everybody and the 
questions," she said. "But I've learned something from all of this -- that I 
like my own company the best and that I can accommodate any situation. Still, 
it's stressful not having your own home, with your own TV to flip to the 
stations you want." 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the quake, new friendships have been forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Country residents Dave and Kathy Baldwin opened their home to a single 
mother whose apartment was devastated by the temblor. In a short time, a 
surprising chemistry has evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Baldwin and her guest, Ronnalee Evert, are both in their late 30s. 
Baldwin has twin 7-year-old girls and Evert a 6-year-old daughter, all of whom 
have become fast friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Brianna Evert has even taken to calling Dave Baldwin "Papa Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Brady Bunch in some ways," Evert said. "It's been wonderful. 
Dave is like a father figure to my daughter, something she has needed for a 
long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Evert helps with the bills. She helps cook and clean when she's not at work as 
a customer service representative. The twins obey her like a mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the morning, while Dave cooks breakfast, Kathy and I get the girls up for 
school," Evert said. "I play tickle monster. She plays something else. We're 
like sisters in that way." 
</P>
<P>
 At night, Evert lays in bed and knows that good things can happen, even in the 
face of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange," she said. "I would have never in a million years wished for 
this earthquake. But now, every night, I say my prayers knowing that I am 
blessed to have met a family like this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we're all one family now."

TENANTS GET 1ST PRIORITY AFTER REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to require landlords to give 
tenants of quake-damaged apartments first priority to reoccupy them after 
repairs, despite a warning from the city attorney that the law may be legally 
flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney expressed the only opposition to an ordinance supported by 
an unusual alliance of apartment owners, tenant representatives and community 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the best available compromise that we could come up with on this 
issue," said George Mihlsten, a prominent attorney who represents an 
association of apartment building owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was designed to prevent landlords from using quake damage to evict the 
thousands of tenants forced out of about 18,000 damaged apartment units 
citywide -- including about 12,000 in the San Fernando Valley -- so they can be 
replaced by new tenants paying higher rents. 
</P>
<P>
 It allows a displaced tenant five days after the completion of repairs to 
inspect the unit and decide whether to reoccupy it at the same rent. The 
landlord cannot raise the rent to recoup repair costs without city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senior Assistant City Atty. Claudia McGee Henry said the law may be 
vulnerable to legal challenges by landlords, who may complain because, in most 
cases, tenants who have found other lodgings they must cancel will not actually 
move back until the beginning of the next month. That could tie up the unit 
with no rent coming in for up to 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a court finds that these new restrictions are unnecessary . . . it may 
simply refuse to enforce them or require the city to pay a successful 
plaintiff/landlord for lost rentals," McGee Henry said in a report to the 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the law also is vague about when the landlord must give the former 
tenant a chance to inspect a unit in a now-damaged building: when the building 
is declared safe to enter or not until after all cosmetic repairs are 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who proposed the ordinance, called McGee 
Henry's concerns "overly cautious and bureaucratic," especially when the city 
is in a state of emergency and needs to take fast action on the housing 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that a similar ordinance adopted in San Francisco after the 1989 Loma 
Prieta quake was challenged in court but was upheld by a state court of appeal 
in December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the City Council's law, a landlord who refuses to allow a tenant to 
return to a repaired unit will be guilty of a misdemeanor and be liable for 
damages to the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 A previous version of the law allowed the landlord to offer the apartment to 
the tenant before all repairs were completed, thus allowing the landlord to 
begin collecting rent sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials modified the law to require the landlord to offer the 
apartment for rent only after the repairs are made, in order to prevent 
prospective tenants from having to commit themselves to rent apartments with no 
guarantee that the units will ultimately be restored to livable condition.

SOKA LOSES A ROUND IN LEGAL FIGHT FOR ITS LAND; CALABASAS: APPEALS JUDGE RULES 
UNIVERSITY CANNOT RAISE A SEPARATE CHALLENGE, BUT MUST ADDRESS FORMAL EMINENT 
DOMAIN PROCEEDINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court on Tuesday cleared the way for the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy to proceed with its legal fight to seize Soka 
University's scenic Calabasas campus for use as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Overturning a Ventura County judge's decision, the 2nd District Court of 
Appeal ruled that Soka's objections to the conservancy's legal attack should be 
raised in formal condemnation proceedings -- not in separate court challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers had sought to avoid condemnation proceedings altogether by 
arguing that the conservancy did not have proper authority to start those 
proceedings -- known formally as eminent domain -- in the first place. A 
Ventura County Superior Court judge agreed with the school in late 1992, but 
her decision was reversed by justices Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a waste of judicial and other public resources if a property 
owner could challenge each step of the taking process by writ brought separate 
and apart from the eminent domain action," Associate Justice Arthur Gilbert 
wrote in the court's unanimous decision, filed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy staff counsel Liz Cheadle called the ruling a "major victory. 
We're extremely happy to have a unanimous court decide, as we have said all 
along, that the case should be down in Los Angeles County." 
</P>
<P>
 She added later: "I think Soka has to view this as a major body blow." 
</P>
<P>
 But Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan characterized the decision as "not unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 "The conservancy won on a legal technicality this time," he said. "It's far 
from a winning run. It's more like they squeezed out a single in the bottom of 
the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Ourvan said Soka administrators and lawyers are discussing whether to appeal 
the decision to the California Supreme Court or to argue their case in 
condemnation proceedings, which could begin later this year in Los Angeles 
County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case stems from a long and tortuous fight between the school and some of 
its neighbors. Soka wants to expand its 580-acre campus at the corner of 
Mulholland Highway and Las Virgenes Road into a liberal arts college, but state 
and federal parks officials want a large chunk of the land to be used as a 
visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka administrators have offered to share the site with parks officials but 
have rejected offers to sell the property outright. So, late in 1992, the 
Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority -- an arm of the conservancy -- 
launched condemnation proceedings to seize 245 acres through eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 The way that action began formed the basis for Soka's Ventura County suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority has a joint powers 
agreement with park agencies in Ventura County, conservancy officials sought 
approval to launch condemnation proceedings from the Ventura County Board of 
Supervisors -- even though Soka's property is entirely within Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka lawyers argued that Ventura County officials had overstepped their bounds 
and, on those grounds, sought to have the approval overturned. A Ventura County 
judge agreed and the conservancy appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tuesday's ruling overturns the Ventura County judge's decision, it 
does not address the question of whether the conservancy acted properly. 
Instead, it simply tells Soka lawyers that the proper forum for their 
objections is condemnation proceedings in Los Angeles County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's as well and good as we could expect," said Joseph T. Edmiston, executive 
director of the conservancy. "We argued the case on procedural grounds, so in 
terms of this lawsuit it was a complete victory." 
</P>
<P>
 During condemnation proceedings, a judge will decide whether the conservancy 
has the right to take Soka's land against the school's will. If the judge 
decides in favor of the conservancy, a jury will determine how much Soka should 
be paid for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The process can take several years.

VALLEY BRIEFING: TALLYING THE DAMAGE; ANALYSIS SHOWS ERRATIC PATTERN OF 
DESTRUCTION ACROSS VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake's destruction in the San Fernando Valley was 
erratic, sparing buildings in some communities near the epicenter and toppling 
structures miles away. It caused about $1 billion in structural damage in the 
Valley, about half the estimated total citywide. Outside of Cal State 
Northridge, the Valley ZIP code with the highest repair estimates is in Sherman 
Oaks, according to a Times computer analysis of Los Angeles Dept. of Building

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; DRUG REHAB AGENCY CELEBRATES 20 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming through the earthquake in one piece was just the beginning of a tough 
month for the nonprofit Inter-Agency Drug Abuse Recovery Programs of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which has a contract with Los Angeles County to provide addiction 
recovery programs, including treatment for juveniles in detention, is 
celebrating its 20th anniversary today under trying circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's offices on Van Nuys Boulevard remained intact after the Jan. 17 
earthquake. But for the agency's clients, the quake left scars, not only on 
homes and property, but on the progress of their recovery from drug dependence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake is certainly intensifying things," said Ken Castro-Oistad, 
executive director of the program. "The population who are addicts are on edge 
anyway. When a major catastrophe occurs, it pushes some over." 
</P>
<P>
 For some clients, the strain of losing homes and possessions was enough to 
prompt them to falter and start using drugs again before returning to the 
program, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost a few clients. We just literally can't trace them," said program 
counselor Candy Smyers. "There is a real possibility they are using again." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the difficulty of resuming the agency's outpatient service 
immediately after the quake. Treatment sessions were canceled. Employees were 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Smyers recalled the difficulty of maintaining clients' concentration and sense 
of security during group sessions that were repeatedly rocked by aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the earthquake tested one of the founding principles of the agency -- 
that people addicted to drugs and alcohol should apply the coping mechanisms 
they learn in treatment to their life outside the treatment program. That's why 
the agency concentrates on outpatient services, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro-Oistad said despite continued difficulties, the agency, which now has a 
$1.3-million annual budget, will go ahead with a planned open house to 
celebrate its anniversary.  
</P>
<P>
 Administrators are marking the occasion by adding a physician to the program's 
staff, and by establishing an annual awards program to recognize outstanding 
contributions to drug treatment in the San Fernando Valley, he said. JILL LEOVY

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; OLDER CARS ARE A 
STEAL IN L.A. AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We have lists of the 10 best dressed, the worst dressed, the richest, the 
winningest, the oldest, the quickest and the deadliest. There are lists of the 
top 10 TV shows, newest slang usages and most popular foods. 
</P>
<P>
 So it only makes sense, in an age where there's a top 10 list for everything, 
to have one for car thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Not for the wheel-snatchers themselves (rot their cruel hearts), but for their 
preferred prey: the cars most sought after by the slim-jim and chop-shop set. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, what the list says is that the Los Angeles area, including the 
San Fernando Valley, is different in this, as in so many other areas of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Angeleno thieves, it seems, have a greater penchant for foreign cars than do 
their counterparts in the rest of the country. The most stolen cars nationwide 
are all American made. In Los Angeles, four of the top 10 are Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves here also go for older cars. Nationally, the 1984 Oldsmobile Cutlass 
Supreme is the most stolen car; in Los Angeles, the number one choice is the 
1979 Olds Cutlass, says Detective William Fulton of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Community Effort to Combat Auto Theft, or CECAT unit. That's five 
years older than the oldest car on the national top 10 list of those most often 
stolen, according to CCC Information Services Inc. of Chicago. And, comparing 
CCC data with Fulton's shows that the average stolen car here is 6.5 years 
older than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The older ones are easy to get into, easy to steal and they're popular among 
a large segment of this community," Fulton explains, "including the car 
thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popular cars are going to be the ones stolen. If two-thirds of the 
population of L.A. happens to like Toyotas, then that's what is going to be 
stolen -- either for resale or for stripping the parts or for shipping the 
vehicle out of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The three cars most stolen nationally are: the 1984 Cutlass Supreme, the 1986 
Chevrolet Camaro (which does not show up on the top 10 list for Los Angeles -- 
although they were a local product from the now-closed GM Van Nuys plant), and 
the 1986 Cutlass Supreme (another car that L.A. thieves like less than 10 
others). Here, the favorites are: the 1979 Olds Cutlass, the 1980 Toyota Celica 
and the 1981 Olds Cutlass, Fulton said.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Fulton said, car thefts in the Valley make up slightly more than 30% 
of all those in the city. In 1993, there were 20,159 cars stolen in the Valley 
and 65,541 cars stolen in the city as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 CECAT, Fulton's unit, does its best with 12 officers. The unit recovers 
slightly less than 60% of the cars stolen, Fulton said. And if you add in 
recovered car parts, the number jumps to about 80%, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many cars are stolen just for their parts, some of the most stolen 
cars are popular because of the interchangeability of their components with 
others cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual business of stealing the cars is not very difficult, Fulton said. A 
good car thief can break into a car with a slim jim or other tools about as 
quickly as the owner could open the door with a key. The crudest way is often 
the quickest, Fulton said: Many thieves just break the window and unlock the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves have also learned the different -- and effective -- ways to hot-wire 
both American and Japanese cars, Fulton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, he said, is that if thieves really want your car, they'll get 
it. But there are precautions that will discourage them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing people can do is pay attention to where they park . . . the 
car to make it less accessible to the car thief," Fulton said. "The second 
thing is an alarm system that cuts off the ignition system or fuel supply." 
</P>
<P>
 But a better alarm system is no guarantee that a car will not be stolen, 
Fulton warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the new expensive cars have such good alarm systems that about the 
only way to get the car is to carjack it," Fulton said. "That's one of the 
reasons for an increase in carjackings." 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on the most carjacked car in Los Angeles, or what that might say 
about us.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; COLLEGE SEES LOSS OF ESL STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While other educational institutions lost entire buildings to the Jan. 17 
earthquake, Mission College has been struggling with a more perplexing loss -- 
its English-language students. 
</P>
<P>
 Exact attendance figures have not been compiled, but Carlie Tronto, dean of 
academic affairs at the Sylmar campus, said more than two dozen course sections 
were canceled or combined due to lack of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen of those sections were in the English-as-a-second-language (ESL) 
department, which can attract about 1,500 to 2,000 students a semester, 
according to Tronto. Peer colleges throughout the city experienced similar 
attendance drops, but not so persistent or deep as at Mission College, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, we are not getting them back," Tronto said of the ESL 
students, many of whom are Latino immigrants. "We can only assume that they 
lost homes or they rearranged their priorities." 
</P>
<P>
 College spokeswoman Ina Geller said the college will not penalize the students 
for returning late. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the college's private foundation is offering $100 grants for books 
and supplies to students affected by the quake, said Rosalinda Gonzales, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Mission College Foundation. So far, the 
organization has raised $5,000 from GTE California and is seeking other 
corporate donors, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many students who have been impacted by this, who say, 'I just had 
to move, I have no money for books, I have no money for transportation,' " 
Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students need only fill out a simple application, which should be available 
this week in the financial aid office, Gonzales said. Applicants will not be 
required to prove their loss for the grant, which is operating on an honor 
basis, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel real good about our students," Gonzales said. "Most of them come from 
a lower economic situation. Even before the earthquake, there probably was a 
need." GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; TRAIN RIDERSHIP UP AS NEW STATIONS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The number of people riding Metrolink commuter trains along the Ventura County 
line increased by about 11% Monday, the first day the agency expanded service 
along the line by adding two new emergency stations, including one in 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers on the line numbered 3,166, said Francisco Oaxaca, spokesman for 
Metrolink.The line, which extends from Camarillo to downtown Los Angeles -- 
with stops in Moorpark, Northridge, Burbank and other sites on the way -- 
transported an average of 2,500 passengers per day before the Jan. 17 
earthquake, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right after the quake, which forced many motorists to shun cars, the average 
number of passengers per day rose to about 2,800, he said. Monday's addition of 
new stations at Camarillo and Northridge appears to have further boosted 
ridership, although Oaxaca cautioned that the first day may not provide a good 
sample of how many people will end up using the trains. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stops are among seven Metrolink has established since the earthquake, 
using money from a $63-million federal emergency grant. The new stations are 
temporary, and their fates will be reconsidered in 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Canfield, manager of the Northridge Chamber of Commerce, said some 
business owners in the area are already hoping that the Northridge station, on 
property owned by the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power at Wilbur 
Avenue and Parthenia Street, will remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love it to be a permanent situation," said Walter Prince, a 
businessman who works on transportation issues for the chamber. "You have a 
huge population of the work force located right across the street there." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials say the station will stay only if local funding is 
provided to maintain it. JILL LEOVY

MAN CONVICTED IN SERIAL RAPE CASE; CRIME: MONETTE JOHNSON, 35, MAY FACE A 
SENTENCE OF MORE THAN 150 YEARS. SEVERAL VICTIMS HAVE BEEN TOLD THEY WERE 
EXPOSED TO HIV. 
</P>

<P>
 A prison parolee was convicted Tuesday of being a serial rapist who sexually 
assaulted six women and one man during a series of late-night attacks in the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days of deliberations, a Van Nuys Superior Court panel convicted 
Monette Johnson, a 35-year-old Lake View Terrace man, who prosecutors said 
slipped into his victims' residences through unlocked doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so glad we got the bastard," one of Johnson's victims said after the 
verdicts were announced. "He's really an evil man. He has no remorse." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was convicted of eight counts of rape, one count of sodomy, one count 
of digital penetration and three counts of forced oral copulation. The jury 
also found him guilty on six counts each of robbery and burglary and a single 
charge of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. Rabichow, who prosecuted the case, said a "quick 
calculation" reveals that Johnson faces "150-some years" in state prison when 
he is sentenced March 14 by Judge John Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 During a trial that began Jan. 11 and was interrupted for a week and a half 
when the Northridge earthquake struck, a jury of seven men and five women heard 
each of the sexual assault victims testify about their ordeals in late 1991 and 
early 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching their decisions, jurors said they believed the victims' 
testimony but were convinced of Johnson's guilt by a wealth of other evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution's evidence was so overwhelming that nothing the defense 
presented changed our minds," juror Laura Halstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was linked to the crimes by a preponderance of evidence that included 
an identification by one victim, a fingerprint at one scene and stolen property 
recovered in Johnson's apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, according to Rabichow and the jurors, was genetic evidence 
that almost conclusively identified Johnson as the man who raped and sodomized 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists testified that DNA found in semen collected after the rapes was 
compared with DNA in Johnson's blood and the match was identical. During the 
trial, one geneticist said the DNA evidence led him to conclude that the odds 
are 1 in 43 million that Johnson is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's almost irrefutable," Halstead said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, defense attorney M. David Houchin attacked the DNA evidence, 
particularly the statistical figures, which he said are "predictions based on 
theories." 
</P>
<P>
 Houchin, vacationing out of state, was not present when the verdicts were 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's case gained attention in January, 1992, when police arrested the 
alleged serial rapist, who initially was suspected of attacking 15 women. 
Later, prosecutors determined there was enough evidence to charge him with 
attacking six women and the boyfriend of one of the female victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the case intensified recently when it was revealed that four of 
the rape victims were informed they had been exposed to the HIV virus, which 
causes AIDS. But neither the county Department of Health Services nor the four 
victims can legally say if Johnson is responsible because people with the virus 
are protected by state confidentiality laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two female victims and several other alleged rape victims were 
alerted that they may have been exposed to the virus but were never told who 
was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, it's just wrong," said a 24-year-old rape victim, who received 
a notice from the health department and was told who is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) introduced legislation Monday 
that will require courts to provide the results of HIV tests to victims of 
sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 The questions of HIV and AIDS were never presented to the jury weighing 
Johnson's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 However, jurors briefly discussed whether Johnson is infected with the deadly 
virus "because AIDS is such a big issue," Halstead said. She added that it 
would not have changed the jury's verdict had the panel been told that Johnson 
was responsible for infecting his victims with the HIV virus.

MORATORIUM OKD AS PIPELINE INQUIRY CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a moratorium Tuesday on all new 
agreements to operate oil pipelines in the city until an investigation into a 
blaze caused by a quake-ruptured pipeline in Mission Hills is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The moratorium initially will last 45 days, but can be extended until city 
officials submit a report to the City Council on the Mission Hills rupture and 
on the safety measures used by operators of underground pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 miles of oil pipelines operate under city streets. During the 
Northridge quake, a 1920s-era line carrying oil from Kern County to Los Angeles 
refineries broke at eight spots, including at Wolfskill Street in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The broken line filled gutters on both sides of the street with crude oil, 
which then ignited, burning one man, destroying one house, damaging three other 
residences and charring 17 cars and dozens of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alarcon, whose district includes the Wolfskill 
neighborhood, called for the moratorium because he said the city should not 
approve new pipeline agreements until the safety of such lines can be assured. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Pacific Pipeline Systems Inc., which is proposing a 52-mile 
pipeline from Santa Clarita to Wilmington, said his firm supports the 
moratorium. But he assured the council that the pipeline his company wants to 
operate is much more earthquake-resistant than the line that broke.

GUARD FOILS BANK HOLDUP; SUSPECTS FLEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A quick-thinking Brink's guard used his armored truck to ram a motorcycle on 
which two robbers were trying to flee with $400,000 they had just taken at 
gunpoint from his partner, LAPD Officer Ed Orton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bag of money was pinned under the cycle and recovered, but both robbers 
escaped, one by taking the car of a bank customer at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Police detectives in Los Angeles refused to confirm the amount of money in the 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began at 8:50 a.m. Tuesday when one robber confronted a guard who 
was delivering a bag of cash to the Bank of America branch at 6600 Laurel 
Canyon Road, authorities said. The guard was ordered to lie on the floor of the 
bank's foyer, and one robber grabbed the cash and fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The guard radioed his partner, the driver of the armored truck parked near the 
bank. The driver spotted the robber wearing blue overalls and a helmet hopping 
on a motorcycle parked in front of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 A second suspect in his mid-30s waiting nearby then fired two shots at the 
armored truck before both men jumped on the motorcycle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the driver, who was also not identified, ran his truck into the 
motorcycle, knocking both men off and pinning the bag of money under their 
vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 One suspect ran across the street into a waiting red minivan and fled. The 
second suspect ran to the bank's parking lot and took a bank customer's car at 
gunpoint and escaped.

$160,000 SETTLEMENT IS NEGOTIATED IN LAWSUIT OVER BULL TERRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people have agreed to pay $160,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a 
Northridge physician who contended they stole a championship dog from her back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The case that began with the dognaping of Shavin-Kingsmere Notty Nada ended 
quietly with a negotiated settlement approved in Van Nuys Superior Court on 
Monday, almost four years after anyone involved in the case last saw the dog, 
which other breeders say was the most highly esteemed bull terrier in the 
nation when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Nada, the same breed as the beer-swilling Spuds McKenzie in the TV 
commercials, now lives with a mysterious couple known only as "Helen and Jim." 
The pooch will stay with the couple, according to the five defendants, who 
gained control of the animal as part of the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dog's got to have a life too," said Major Alan Langer, the attorney who 
represented Patricia Walters, the doctor who filed the suit. "Everybody gets 
something -- even Nada gets something this way." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants wanted a trial but were forced into the settlement by their 
insurance companies, which were paying their legal expenses, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 One lawyer involved in the case from the beginning has estimated that legal 
expenses on all sides have topped $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, a podiatrist who paid $600 for Nada as a puppy, filed the suit April 
5, 1990, about one month after the dog was removed from her back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a shared ownership agreement between Walters and 
Shavin-Kingsmere -- the breeding partnership that sold the dog to her. That 
agreement called for Shavin-Kingsmere trainers to present the animal at dog 
shows throughout North America and to supervise her breeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters contended in her lawsuit that the trainers used unethical methods to 
show the dog, while Shavin-Kingsmere contended in their reply that Walters was 
improperly training the animal and had plans to breed Nada without their 
consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters "in effect stole the dog by refusing to give up possession to the 
other owners," said attorney Robert Armstrong, who initially represented all 
the defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 One defendant, William Edwards of Glendale, admittedly climbed over a block 
wall into Walters' back yard, grabbed the dog and handed it over the wall to 
Robert Bollong, an off-duty Orange County sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards "saw this dog was distressed," said attorney Nathan B. Hoffman, who 
represented Linda Lethin-Martin and her husband, Terry Martin, Anaheim 
residents and participants in the Shavin-Kingsmere partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters mistreated Nada, especially in terms of training her, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the partnership said in court documents that while attending a dog 
show, they met a couple they identified only as Helen and Jim, whose bull 
terrier had recently died. 
</P>
<P>
 They gave them the championship dog as a replacement, the defendants said. 
They would not say where the couple and the dog live. Their only continuing 
contact with the couple is an occasional postcard, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the lawsuit, members of the partnership went to jail rather than obey 
a judge's order to produce the terrier. In an action that was fought all the 
way to the California Supreme Court, they were eventually allowed to conceal 
the dog's whereabouts in return for posting a $15,000 bond guaranteeing its 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Bollong, a 12-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, maintained that he did 
nothing wrong because he was merely helping a friend retrieve property that was 
being held hostage in a business dispute. Nevertheless, the holders of his 
homeowners insurance policy will pay Walters $30,000 under its personal 
liability provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards and his wife, Patricia, are responsible for $100,000 of the total 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance covering Lethin-Martin and her husband will pay the final $30,000. 
One expert involved in the case said the dog was worth as much as $300,000.

BANK ROBBED OF $1,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An armed bandit robbed an independent bank Tuesday, making off with more than 
$1,000 from a teller's window, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect walked into Pacific Charter Bank in the 26000 block of Agoura Road 
about 1:30 p.m. and told a teller that he had a gun, said Sgt. Denise Jezak of 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. He never showed a weapon, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving the cash, the suspect walked out of the bank and into a blue 
compact car, possibly a Nissan, Jezak said. The car headed northwest toward 
Ventura County, Jezak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect is described as a white male, about 6 feet tall, who wore a 
baseball-style cap bearing a Harley Davidson emblem.

MTA OFFICIALS SAY CUTS SAVE $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said Tuesday that the 
cash-strapped county agency has cut its costs in outside professional services 
by nearly two-thirds over the last two years, saving an estimated $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings, in large part, are the result of streamlining after the MTA was 
created last year by merging the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission 
and the Southern California Rapid Transit District.Officials of the new 
super-agency credit an aggressive campaign to get rid of duplicate services and 
to perform more tasks in-house. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of contracts awarded to outside agencies for such services as 
printing and accounting dropped from a combined 675 by the two agencies in 
fiscal year 1992 to a projected 340 at the end of this fiscal year. During that 
same time period, costs for these services dipped from $146 million to $46 
million, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our budget is tight, (so) we're being much more careful" about securing 
outside services, MTA chief Franklin White said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, White said, the savings have already been accounted for in this 
year's budget and will have no effect on the $126-million deficit the MTA 
expects to incur next year. Also, he said, other outside costs, such as design 
contracts, are expected to increase.

SYBERT BEGINS CAMPAIGN WITH ATTACK ON BEILENSON; POLITICS: THE FORMER AIDE TO 
GOV. WILSON CALLS THE INCUMBENT CONGRESSMAN A 'TIRED AND INEFFECTIVE' LIBERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Richard Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson, kicked off his 
campaign Tuesday to unseat U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), 
denouncing the incumbent as a "tired and ineffective" liberal, while urging the 
use of the National Guard to bolster local police forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's be candid," Sybert said at a news conference where he was introduced by 
former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Bob Philibosian. "Tony Beilenson is a 
Westside liberal -- he's not from the Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the 41-year-old Sybert accused fellow Republican Robert Hammer, who 
is also running for the Beilenson seat, of being unfit to serve in the Congress 
because Hammer has been an infrequent voter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he moved to California in 1985, Robert Hammer has almost never voted 
and I think he will have to explain that to the people who do vote," Sybert 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, an attorney, was director of Wilson's Office of Planning and Research 
from 1990 to 1993 and is currently the president of Lanard Toys of California. 
He has a $430,000 campaign war chest and a long list of endorsements from GOP 
elected officials.  
</P>
<P>
 A native of Whittier and a Harvard Law School graduate who has been with a 
downtown Los Angeles law firm for 12 years, Sybert lives in Calabasas with his 
wife and daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference Tuesday outside an earthquake-damaged Ventura Boulevard 
store, Sybert said it was time to rebuild the state's economy and a sense of 
public safety. "When you ask my opponent (Beilenson) about crime, he throws up 
his hands and says it's a local problem," Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of such despair, he said he would offer solutions -- including making 
the National Guard and military police units available to patrol crime-plagued 
cities. Such resources are already being paid for and there should be no 
reluctance to use them, Sybert said, especially in the fight against gang 
activity.  
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the economy, Beilenson has "never seen a tax hike he didn't 
like," Sybert contended, referring to the incumbent's vote for President 
Clinton's five-year economic package and a federal income tax increase to 
implement it. Citing recent news reports, Sybert noted that Beilenson's 24th 
District constituents will be hit harder by the tax increase than the 
constituents of all but eight other congressional districts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson spokesman Craig Miller said that Beilenson's votes to raise taxes 
have served "to reduce the deficit by historic proportions, and if that means 
the nation's wealthiest are called upon to pay their fair share, then so be it 
-- middle Americans will greatly benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also noted that Beilenson has frequently enjoyed the endorsement of 
rank-and-file police groups, has backed the death penalty for drug kingpins and 
terrorists and currently supports the President's crime bill, which would 
provide 100,000 additional police. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hammer admitted that he had not been -- as Sybert charged -- a 
diligent voter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose you could fault me for that," Hammer said. "But during this time, I 
was working 16-hour days making acquisitions for my company that produced jobs 
here locally and traveling around the country." Hammer said absentee voting was 
established to help meet such contingencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammer, a banking consultant, in the late 1980s was a top executive with First 
Interstate Bank. Hammer has boasted that his work of acquiring credit card 
assets for First Interstate created or preserved more than 100 jobs in Southern 
California.

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDY ON PROJECT CRITICIZED; DEVELOPMENT: LAWYERS TELL VENTURA 
COUNTY JUDGE THAT REVISED REPORT ON AHMANSON RANCH PLAN IS INVALID. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The environmental impact report on the giant Ahmanson Ranch development was no 
longer valid after the project grew in size from 1,850 houses to a 
3,050-dwelling golf course community and a new report should have been ordered, 
attorneys argued in court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors relied on an amended 
environmental document that did not adequately address the project's impacts on 
surrounding communities, said Mark Weinberger, an attorney representing the 
city of Malibu in a lawsuit filed against the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plaintiffs in the case include Los Angeles County, the cities of Los 
Angeles and Calabasas, and several homeowner and environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a closed-door deal pushed through by developers," Weinberger said 
after a hearing on the lawsuits Tuesday in Ventura County Superior Court. 
"Hopefully, we will get the project back before the community and in a forum 
where significant issues like traffic impacts can be thoroughly addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, attorneys representing Ventura County and Ahmanson Land 
Co. said the project's environmental impact report had met all of the 
requirements outlined by the California Environmental Quality Act. 
</P>
<P>
 They also argued that the supervisors had approved the project -- planned in 
the rolling hills south of Simi Valley -- after deciding that the prospect of 
receiving nearly 10,000 acres of public parkland included in the deal 
outweighed the environmental damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public not only had an opportunity to participate, but the record 
suggests that it had significant participation," attorney Steve Weston said, 
referring to the nearly 500 pages of public comments that were submitted on the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston pointed out that after the project was increased in size to 3,050 
dwellings, the Board of Supervisors recirculated the environmental impact 
report for 45 days to give the public a chance to comment on the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the county acted properly," he said. "To ask the county to go back 
and start all over again would be potentially devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rosemary Woodblock, an attorney representing the environmental group Save 
Open Space, argued that 45 days was not sufficient to review an environmental 
impact report that included more than 1,000 pages. She said the public did not 
have ample time to determine whether the 10,000 acres of parkland was 
sufficient compensation for the environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to have a valid statement of overriding consideration, you have to 
have a valid environmental impact report," she said. "And the facts in the 
environmental impact report are not valid." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Weiss, an attorney representing Los Angeles County, argued that 
additional mitigation measures should have been required of the developer to 
help reduce traffic impacts on the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe they should shoulder some of the costs" of improvements on the 
freeway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Vining, another Ahmanson attorney, said the developer had already 
planned to spend about $19 million to reduce traffic impacts throughout the 
region. He said the improvements include building new on- and off-ramps to help 
ease the flow of traffic on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors approved the Ahmanson project in December, 1992, on 
condition that Ahmanson Land and its partners turn over to state and federal 
park agencies 10,000 acres of mountain land -- most of it owned by entertainer 
Bob Hope. So far, only about 3,000 acres -- including Hope's 2,308-acre Jordan 
Ranch -- have been acquired as parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, which has agreed to dedicate 2,633 acres of its ranch as open space, 
must also deliver two other Hope properties to park agencies before it can go 
forward with its development. These include Hope's 4,369-acre Runkle Ranch near 
Chatsworth and his 339-acre Corral Canyon tract in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its agreement with the county, Ahmanson has about two years left to 
acquire Hope's land. But the developer, concerned about potential financial 
impacts from the lawsuits, has put its plans on hold indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Tuesday's hearing, attorneys for both sides said they were confident 
about Superior Court Judge Barbara A. Lane's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the judge gave us a full hearing today on how much the county 
short-circuited the public's right to fully participate" in the environmental 
review process, Weinberger said. "We hope the judge will take the hands of the 
developers back out of the cookie jar." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were reluctant to say if they would appeal the judge's decision if 
she ruled against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about an appeal," Weston said. "All I can say is that the 
developer feels very strongly about its project." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph T. Edmiston, executive director of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy, which stands to gain thousands of acres of parkland from the 
Ahmanson deal, said he is worried that the lawsuits may prompt Ahmanson to 
withdraw from its original parkland-for-development deal with the county. He 
said he fears that Ahmanson may try to go back to its initial 1,850-house 
proposal if the county is willing to release the developer from its obligation 
to deliver Hope's two other properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my biggest concern," Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane said she will probably have a decision on the case in about three weeks.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN CHARGED WITH DOUBLE SLAYING; VIOLENCE: 
INVESTIGATORS SAY WILLIAM STRONG OF ACTON WAS UPSET BECAUSE HIS DOG WAS SHOT TO 
DEATH. BUT THEY'RE NOT CERTAIN IF THAT WAS THE MOTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 39-year-old Acton man was charged Tuesday with murdering a father and son, 
possibly because he believed the father had shot the man's dog, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged William Strong, a 39-year-old property caretaker in the 
rural area, with two counts of first-degree murder, using a gun, said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. S. Kelly Cromer. Because more than one death occurred in the 
confrontation, prosecutors filed a special circumstance allegation that could 
lead to the death penalty if Strong is convicted, Cromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 His arraignment, scheduled for Tuesday in Antelope Municipal Court, was 
postponed until Feb. 22 to give the public defender's office more time to 
evaluate the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Strong was upset because someone had shot to death his dog, 
a German shepherd mix, about a month ago. They could not say for certain 
whether the double slaying was linked to that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had put out reward posters to see if he could find out who did it," Cromer 
said. "The defendant had contacted several people in the neighborhood and 
confronted them about shooting the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the neighbors Strong had accused was Kenneth Laux, 59. On Saturday 
afternoon, investigators said, Laux and his son, Kenneth Laux Jr., 34, of 
Pearblossom, drove to Strong's trailer on West Hubbard Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not know whether the father and son were talking to Strong 
about the dog's death or any other matter before the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had driven up his driveway and gotten out of their truck," Cromer said. 
"Then they were shot. They were shot in the driveway." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor added, "There is nothing to indicate the victim or his son 
actually shot the dog." 
</P>
<P>
 After the father and son were shot, Strong went to the house of a neighbor, 
who called a sheriff's deputy after Strong talked about what had occurred. 
Deputies arrested Strong and recovered a shotgun, the possible murder weapon, 
from his trailer, Cromer said. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading a police report on the incident, Manuel Martinez, a deputy 
public defender in charge of the Antelope Valley office, said, "There are 
indications that self-defense may come into play in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 At Strong's arraignment next week, "I can assure you he will plead not 
guilty," Martinez said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GUARD SHOOTS INMATE IN FOOT DURING CELL SEARCH

 In the second time in less than a week, a guard at the state prison here shot 
and wounded a maximum security inmate who would not comply with orders, prison 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Hall, who is serving a 13-year, 4-month sentence for robbery, assault 
with a firearm and firing shots at an occupied vehicle, was hit in the left 
foot Tuesday with a single bullet from a 9-millimeter rifle during the 10:45 
a.m. incident at the state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 A Feb. 9 fight between two maximum security inmates ended when a guard fired 
one round from a 9-millimeter rifle, striking one of the brawling inmates in 
the left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials said the shooting Tuesday stemmed from a routine cell search. 
Inmate Hall would not leave the area "and took an aggressive stance," spokesman 
Kenn I. Hicks said. Further instructions were ignored and the officer hit Hall 
on the thigh with a baton and fired wooden blocks from a rifle before the 
9-millimeter gun was fired, Hick said. SHARON MOESER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SAUGUS RECREATION CENTER FACES NEW OPENING 
DELAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saugus recreation center expected to draw hundreds of people per day for 
miniature golf, batting cages, roller-skating and other games now faces 
additional delays to its already postponed opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-sponsors Skateland Enterprises and Mountasia Entertainment International 
first hoped to open the nine-acre "fun center" in November.The projection was 
changed to late this month as negotiations with a fast-food vendor stretched 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers now say they're unsure whether the Northridge earthquake has added 
to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're checking into all the implications of the earthquake," said Dan Tebor, 
Mountasia vice president of creative services. "We want to see if there's going 
to be a moratorium on concrete. We want to see if all the building materials 
will be available." 
</P>
<P>
 A new timeline is expected to be announced in a few weeks, Tebor said. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the $4.35-million recreation center off Golden Triangle Road will 
include an 18-hole miniature golf course, game room, bumper boats, batting 
cages, go-cart track and roller-skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's low crime rate and high number of families attracted the sponsors, 
and Santa Clarita officials believe that the site will provide youths with 
activities to occupy their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateland officials have predicted that 300 to 1,000 people will use the 
center daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility may help reduce drag-racing, graffiti or other vandalism that 
occurs when youths are bored, according to local law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Graffiti incidents are believed to have dropped in Santa Clarita from the same 
time last year. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 40 to 50 reports of graffiti have come in monthly to the city's 
volunteer cleanup hot line since August, down from 120 calls per month during a 
similar period the year before.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STUDENTS SETTLE IN AT NEW CAMPUS; EDUCATION: 
DISTRICT WEIGHS ABANDONING VAN GOGH SITE BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL UNSTABLE SOIL. 
REOPENING OF TWO OTHER CAMPUSES IS DELAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Students from Van Gogh Street Elementary School, the only Los Angeles Unified 
district campus that may have to be abandoned because of the Jan. 17 
earthquake, settled in to new surroundings Tuesday, relocating to five portable 
classrooms and one empty wing of nearby Frost Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 After a half-day orientation Monday, in which parents and students gathered 
for tours of Frost, about 350 Van Gogh students were eager to share experiences 
and settle in to a new routine, bending familiar programs to fit new spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being back," said Haley Weiner, 6, giggling with another girl about 
the boys' playground attempts to skip rope. "I get to see my friends even 
though it's at a different place." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have not decided the fate of Van Gogh, where the buildings 
have been declared structurally sound but there is concern about unstable soil 
beneath them. Officials have said the site might have to be abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at quake-hobbled El Camino Real and John F. Kennedy high schools, a 
long, unplanned vacation dragged on as an overly ambitious Tuesday deadline for 
restarting school came and went without much notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had originally pledged that the two schools would open by March 7, 
but moved up the date after parents complained -- and after the state promised 
to furnish all necessary bungalows by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But by late last week, principals and others who had sounded optimistic the 
week before said last-minute construction glitches, rain and other problems 
would delay the reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 No new date has been set, although both principals and district officials have 
said they anticipate resuming regular classes around Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping against hope it will be the 22nd," said Dan Isaacs, the 
district's assistant superintendent for school operations. "We're very 
optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 The only courses that have been held at the two high schools have been 
advanced placement and other optional classes, which continued to meet Tuesday. 
Students roamed around looking for teachers and trying to locate appropriate 
bungalows, a harbinger of the confusion that could ensue when all 5,000 
students return to the two newly rearranged campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "My AP Spanish teacher, she just said to show up," said 17-year-old Irma 
Chavez, a Kennedy senior. "We have to go around looking for the class. The 
classes are open, and you just go in and ask the teacher where your class is." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and students had not gotten word of the delay, said El Camino 
Principal Joyce Washington; scores of them called in to confirm the start time. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'Is it true, are we open?' " said Diana Ryan, an El Camino office 
assistant. "We've been getting a lot of phone calls like that. We had hoped to 
be open today, and that's the last some people heard so they're calling to 
check." 
</P>
<P>
 At Frost, elementary classes doubled up to most efficiently use a smaller 
number of large classrooms; Principal Maureen Diekmann said 12 additional 
bungalows are expected to arrive within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Missing materials, fewer restrooms, unpainted playgrounds, a lack of office 
phones and cold lunches were just a few of the complications, Diekmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers did their best to help students adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 In Janny Cho's kindergarten bungalow, underneath brightly decorated bulletin 
boards and beside child-sized tables and chairs, a group of 5- and 6-year-olds 
gathered on the floor for "sharing" time. 
</P>
<P>
 Students wrote in one or two sentences their experiences during the quake and 
then drew illustrations for their stories. "When the earthquake happened, I was 
very scared," said Ryan, 6, reading aloud to his classmates. "There was no 
light." 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, when anxious Van Gogh students hesitated to leave their 
parents' sides during a morning welcome-back assembly, Diekmann summed up the 
feelings of her staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome back to your old, new school," she said while the children clapped 
and cheered. "We are Van Gogh School, and I don't want anyone to forget that.

 Allstate to Reduce Its Florida Exposure: Allstate Corp. will not renew 3% of 
its homeowner policy base plans in Florida, Chairman and Chief Executive 
Officer Wayne Hedien said.Allstate, a major writer of property, casualty and 
life insurance that is 82% owned by Sears, Roebuck & Co., said the action will 
cut its catastrophic exposure in Florida to less than $1 billion in the next 
two years. A number of companies cut back on coverage in Florida after paying 
huge claims due to Hurricane Andrew. The Allstate Insurance Group posted a net 
loss of $139 million in the fourth quarter of 1992. That included a loss of 
$506 million from paying for damage caused by Andrew.

 Market Overview * Blue chips shares closed sharply higher Tuesday as investors 
flocked to the market, afraid of missing out on a rally that could take stocks 
into record territory. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar rebounded against the Japanese yen as dealers took a breather 
from a dramatic selloff sparked by fears of a possible U.S.-Japan trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treasury bond yields ended largely unchanged amid a lack of factors to guide 
investment decisions. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Stocks were encouraged by the stable bond and currency markets as well as 
easing fears of a trade war between Japan and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average rose 24.21 points to 3,928.27, on Big Board volume 
totaling 306.79 million shares. At the same time, advancing issues outnumbered 
declines by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The steady interest rates and modestly recovering dollar cleared the way for 
the stock market's advance, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also said the strong advance illustrated the level of investors' 
confidence after the market weathered U.S.-Japan trade tensions that battered 
currency and bonds Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets brushed aside the announcement by U.S. Trade Representative Mickey 
Kantor that Japan's violation of an agreement on cellular telephones may lead 
to retaliatory measures.  
</P>
<P>
 Also pushing stocks Tuesday higher was better-than-expected industrial 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Production climbed 0.5% last month, compared to an expected gain of about 
0.4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks ended mixed abroad. In Tokyo, the yen's relentless surge since Friday's 
failure of U.S.-Japan trade talks sent Tokyo stocks skidding for the second 
straight day Tuesday. The 225-share Nikkei ended the day down 484 points, or 
2.49%,, to 18,974.60.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Viacom won its five-month battle against QVC Network Inc. for Paramount 
Communications, which rose 7/8 to 77 on the NYSE. QVC said it dropped its rival 
bid and the stock rose 1 3/4 to 50 1/4. Viacom class B stock lost 1 7/8 to 28 
and Blockbuster Entertainment, which joined Viacom in its bid, rose 3/8 to 25 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Mining rose 2 5/8 to 108 3/8, Caterpillar added 1 1/2 to 107 1/2 and 
Goodyear Tire finished up 1 1/2 to 47 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Healthcare fell 5/8 to 85 after the company agreed to buy Ramsay-HMO 
in exchange for 5.9 million common shares. Ramsay rose 9 1/4 to 55 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Softimage rose 6 1/8 to 21 1/4. Microsoft said late Monday it agreed to 
acquire the company, a leading developer of high-performance 2-D and 3-D 
computer animation and visualization software. Microsoft rose 5/8 to 79 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Healthcare, fell 5/8 to 85 after it agreed to buy Ramsay-HMO in 
exchange for 5.9 million common shares. Ramsay rose 9 1/4 to 55 1/8. Currency  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar started out lower but strengthened after the government's 
industrial production report. "The statistics showed more economic growth," 
which is positive for the dollar, said Andrew Busch, a senior vice president of 
Harris Trust & Savings Bank in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bargain-hunting traders also boosted the U.S. currency after its huge selloff 
Monday, when traders dumped dollars on concerns that the Clinton Administration 
would drive the American currency lower against the Japanese yen after last 
week's breakdown of trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 103.85 Japanese yen, up from 102.65 yen on 
Monday, its lowest closing level against the Japanese currency since Aug. 18. 
In Tokyo, the dollar finished at 102.02 yen, down 3.67 yen from Monday. Other 
Markets  
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield was ended unchanged at 6.45%, while its 
price slipped 1/32 point, or 31 cents per $1,000 in face value. The only price 
movement was in intermediate government maturities, which rose 1/32 point to 
1/8 point, the financial information service Telerate Inc. reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold prices fell slightly in domestic trading. On the New York Comex, gold for 
current delivery settled at $383.80 an ounce, down 10 cents from Monday. Silver 
closed at $5.255 an ounce, down from $5.343 late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-strapped California sold a record $3.2 billion in short-term notes 
Tuesday to help fund state operations through the end of the current fiscal 
year and to pay off part of its long-term debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The state sold $1.2 billion in notes at an average interest rate of 3.02% and 
$2 billion at an average rate of 2.81%. The first series will mature on Dec. 
21, the second on July 26. Ten firms participated in the competitive bidding, 
many on behalf of syndicates.
