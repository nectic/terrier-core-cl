PITCHESS JAIL FIGHT INVOLVES 600 INMATES; VIOLENCE: GUARDS FIRE RUBBER BULLETS 
TO END BRAWL USING HOMEMADE KNIVES AND BROOMSTICKS. EIGHTY ARE INJURED. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 600 Latino and African American inmates battled with homemade knives 
and broomsticks in maximum-security dormitories at Peter J. Pitchess Honor 
Rancho on Sunday before dozens of jail guards firing rubber bullets broke up 
the melee, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty inmates were injured, including 24 who were hospitalized with stab 
wounds, severe cuts and head injuries. No jail deputies were hurt in the 
incident, which officials described as one of the biggest brawls in recent 
years in the county jail system. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said the fighting broke out simultaneously at 20 separate dormitories 
at 3:55 p.m. Sunday. Inmates battled for 25 minutes with jail-made knives, 
broomsticks, "anything they could get their hands on" before deputies could 
subdue them, said Benita Hinojos, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojos said the cause of the brawl is under investigation but would not 
speculate on the possibility that the fight was prearranged. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation into the exact cause is ongoing and possible disciplinary, 
criminal charges and transfers are pending," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty to 75 deputies fired rubber bullets and pellets from shotguns and rifles 
and tossed grenade-like bombs containing rubber pellets to stop the fights, 
Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies at the nearby Santa Clarita station were placed on standby in the 
event that the scuffles erupted again.  
</P>
<P>
 Four of the most seriously injured inmates were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita, and about 20 others were taken to the 
hospital ward at the Men's Central Jail in Downtown Los Angeles, Hinojos said. 
Another 50 inmates were treated at a clinic at the Pitchess facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had problems in areas where inmates congregate, but never one with this 
many inmates actually fighting," said Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Stoneman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials said that although they didn't know if the fight was 
prearranged, inmates can see inside the five dorms where the brawls erupted, so 
that inmates in one dorm could join a fight that broke out in another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is visual contact between the dorms and (inmates) hear radio traffic. 
When deputies respond to a disturbance, they know it," Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial differences were identified as the primary motive in most of the 
facility's 53 reported inmate clashes last year, prompting some administrators 
to consider separating inmates by race. 
</P>
<P>
 Racially tinged fighting among inmates also broke out on consecutive days last 
week in the holding cell Downtown at the Criminal Courts Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing everything in our power to try to prevent this kind of thing, 
short of segregating inmates," Cmdr. Ken Bayless of the sheriff's jail division 
told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, frankly, we've thought of that."

 Although the Eaton Canyon Nature Center was destroyed in October's Altadena 
fire, the staff is still offering a way to learn about nature at the burned-out 
canyon site. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire, as most Southern Californians know, is a natural part of the local 
environment -- but often results in tragic loss. The Nature Center, for 
example, housed a library and a 186-seat auditorium where visitors learned 
about the plants, animals and environment of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, naturalists from the center will lead a twilight hike in Eaton Canyon 
Park and discuss how fire fits into the ecology of the park -- in good and bad 
ways -- and observe the beginning regeneration of the park's plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will run from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. Visitors should should bring a 
flashlight and water and meet in the center's parking lot. Pets are not 
allowed. Call (818) 398-5420 or (818) 821-3246.

 Howl of the day: "Mondo Canine," a collection of "doggie joie de vivre " 
edited by Jon Winokur of Pacific Palisades, asks the question: "Ever consider 
what they (dogs) must think of us? I mean, here we come back from the grocery 
store with the most amazing haul -- chicken, pork, half a cow. . . . They must 
think we're the greatest hunters on earth!"

 Southern California's tofu-and-bean-sprout crowd must be a real mystery to the

 Speaking of food that makes the heart pound: Evidently aware of how much 
weight we gained over the holidays, author Marya Charles Alexander wrote to ask 
us to nominate an eatery "that treats solo diners well" for her book, "Solo 
Dining Savvy for Business Travelers." The tome will consist of four categories: 
"Community table, counter/bar, share-table and solo." 
</P>
<P>
 We hereby offer Downtown L.A.'s sidewalk emporium, Vege-Dog, which offers a 
meatless frankfurter as well as a blood pressure test for $1.65. (Take pity on 
the test-taker and hold the onions.)

 And now for dessert: Alan G. Fine photographed an unusual invitation to fuel 
up in West L.A. "Perhaps the oil company has developed an intriguing new

 For anyone who says, "It oughta be in a museum" . . . We mentioned that Sunset 
magazine, in an article titled "Southern California's Most Unusual Museums," 
listed three examples: the Banana Museum of Altadena, the Ralph M. Parsons 
Insect Zoo at the L.A. County Museum of Natural History and the Jurassic 
Technology Museum in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 But we didn't want to leave the impression that L.A. is losing its reputation 
for offbeat shrines. There are several others. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood, alone, boasts the reopened Weird Museum, containing the reputed 
remains of a werewolf (possibly a Hollywood agent); the Max Factor Museum, 
whose exhibits include a kissing machine for testing lipstick, and the 
International Brassiere Museum at Frederick's (still missing Madonna's bustier, 
which was stolen during the L.A. riots). 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Museum of Hair in Pasadena, a hair and art salon whose symbol is 
the Mona Lisa adorned in a green facial mask with hair rollers. And Long Beach 
has the Foot and Toe Museum, which is listed in the travel guide "Medical 
Landmarks USA" and has 9,000 items, though no bananas. 
</P>
<P>
 And, still in storage . . . We hold out hope that a mass-mailing executive 
will deliver on his plans to open a Junk Mail Museum in a Van Nuys mini-mall. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps new homes will be found for the soon-to-close Hopalong Cassidy 
Museum in Downey, as well as the Crypto-Phenomena Museum in Malibu.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the latter, we're happy to report that the recent fire did not damage 
curator Jon Erik Beckjord's collection of stored treasures. As Crypto fans 
know, it includes NASA photos of mysterious Martian formations that resemble, 
among other things, the jowls of Edward M. Kennedy, the eyes and nose of Saddam 
Hussein, and the profile of Tammy Fae Bakker.  
</P>
<P>
 Alas, L.A. seems to have lost forever the Exotic Dancers Hall of Fame, founded 
in San Pedro by ex-stripper Jennie (Miss Forty-Four and Plenty More) Lee. The 
last we heard, Miss Forty-Four had moved the institution to Hesperia. 
miscelLAny:

<P>
 A pet food company's survey found that the most popular dog names nationwide 
are Duke, Brandy, Max, Sam and Shadow. In L.A., Max is No. 2 and Brandy is No. 
4. But L.A. also has some different preferences: Lady (No. 1), Rocky (No. 3) 
and Bear (No. 5).

BUT WILL YOU LOVE IT IN MAY?; GOVERNOR LAYS OUT FIRST DRAFT OF NEW BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In delivering his initial budget for fiscal 1994-95, Gov. Pete Wilson has 
fulfilled one of his annual gubernatorial chores. However, what was submitted 
last week was more an opening political document than a final word, a fact that 
will become increasingly apparent after Sacramento gets down to serious work on 
the budget in May. 
</P>
<P>
 For now perhaps the most controversial aspects of the governor's $55.4-billion 
outline are (1) the further realignment he proposes in the relationship between 
the state and local governments, (2) more cuts in aid to the poor and (3) the 
assumption that the state will receive long-overdue federal funds for 
immigrants. Significantly, there are no proposed tax increases. That's the 
budget in its simplest terms. 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL IMPACT: Officials at the county level are both wary and hopeful about 
Wilson's determination to allow counties more flexibility in meeting local 
needs. That's not surprising. It seems to us that this flexibility is right, 
Wilson's shifting approaches during his governorship notwithstanding. Last year 
he yanked $2.6 billion in state aid out of city and county accounts and gave it 
to local schools. This year the spending plan would shift $5.4 billion to 
counties to give them greater control over a variety of social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is to raise state funding to $4.5 billion for mental health, foster 
care and other social programs. Those funds would come from allocation of a 
greater share of existing revenue sources, such as property tax and the sales 
tax. Wilson also urges that counties be helped with the cost of operating trial 
courts, to the tune of $683 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the proposed realignment would give greater accountability and 
flexibility to counties -- and there's no quarreling with that. What's at issue 
is how the funds would be distributed to the 58 counties. The formula for that 
has not been determined; would it be fair? The realignment would require 
changes in state and federal law to grant counties more authority over welfare; 
would they be enacted? 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL WORRY: The shift to counties would mean that they would have to pay 
bigger shares of Medi-Cal and of the non-federally funded portion of such 
programs as Aid to Families with Dependent Children. 
</P>
<P>
 One question the counties are asking is whether the amount of state money 
would increase if the caseloads and obligations for counties rose. It should. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wouldn't be easy in this economy, with tax revenues sagging. And, 
indeed, the governor acknowledges that this proposed budget balances only if 
Washington allocates $3.6 billion to help cover the costs of illegal immigrants 
and refugees living in California.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a long time until May.

MAY THEY GET THE MESSAGE; JUDGE RIGHTLY LEVIES A STRONG SENTENCE IN HOMOPHOBIC 
HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hate-crime assaults -- in which people are attacked because of their race, 
gender or sexual orientation -- have risen alarmingly in recent years in 
Southern California. That's why Orange County Superior Court Judge Everett W. 
Dickey last week was so very right to send a strong message that such 
violations will not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickey sentenced a 19-year-old to 10 years in prison for the near-fatal 
beating of a 56-year-old man in Laguna Beach who the attacker believed was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker, Jeffrey Michael Raines, was a high school student at the time of 
the beating. He pleaded guilty to attempted murder, assault and taking part in 
a hate crime as defined by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 An accomplice who pleaded guilty to assault and committing a hate crime was 
sentenced to a year in county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Dickey denounced the savagery of the attack: Nearly a year later the 
victim still needs help walking and must continue to undergo physical therapy. 
Although both assailants expressed remorse, Dickey said the attack was clearly 
a hate crime and involved "excessive violence and viciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Human Rights Commission has reported that gay men are frequent 
targets of hate crimes. In Orange County, gays and lesbians said the attack 
confirmed their fears of being victimized because of their sexual orientation. 
However, some were reassured by the speedy police work and community 
condemnation of the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate Orange County case, after pleading guilty to federal charges 
members of a self-described racist group known as the Fourth Reich Skinheads 
were required to meet last month with Holocaust survivors. That was an 
innovative effort at remediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with tough sentencing, such education of defendants is a valuable weapon 
against hate crimes. However, greater efforts are required in homes, in 
churches and in schools to ensure we all understand that everyone deserves to 
live free from the outrage of being abused for reasons of race, religion or 
sexual orientation.

PLO ISSUE: POLICING THE POLICE; AUTHORITATIVE REPORT RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT 
ABUSIVE PALESTINIAN GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B'Tselem, the Israeli human rights group whose monitoring of abuses of 
Palestinians by Israeli authorities often arouses official ire, has now taken a 
long look at Palestinian crimes against Palestinians and issued a report that 
raises uncomfortable questions for both the Palestine Liberation Organization 
and the government of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, B'Tselem finds that over the last six years as many as 950 
Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and West Bank were murdered by other 
Palestinians, many after being tortured. Virtually all were alleged to have 
collaborated with Israeli occupation authorities. In fact, B'Tselem found, most 
had not. Some, including homosexuals and prostitutes, were killed for being 
"morals offenders." Others were killed to settle old scores having nothing to 
do with the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 B'Tselem holds both the PLO and its political rival, the Islamic 
fundamentalist group Hamas, responsible for the torture and killings, either 
directly or, most often in the case of the PLO, for implicitly condoning them. 
The PLO, which expects soon to take over from Israel partial administration in 
the territories, is severely faulted for failing its political responsibility 
to try to halt the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Saleh Abdel Jawad, a political scientist at Birzeit University, goes to the 
heart of the matter for Palestinians by noting that the B'Tselem report raises 
crucial issues of "what kind of democracy will we have, what kind of society 
will we be?" The PLO promises a "democratic and secular" state, which would be 
the Arab world's first. A basic obligation in such a society is to respect the 
humane rule of law. Is the PLO ready to meet that imperative? 
</P>
<P>
 And, B'Tselem asks, is Israel ready to meet its obligation to protect the 
estimated 5,000 Palestinians who have served as agents for occupation 
authorities? These are not parochial issues. Human rights standards are valid 
measurements in helping the United States and other democracies determine the 
warmth and depth of their relations with other governments. The rights record 
in the occupied territories isn't good. There is a chance to begin immediately 
to improve on it. Do Israel and the PLO have the will and courage to seize that 
chance?

CITY WATCH; MINDING THE STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles has a rich cultural past, our surviving architectural 
legacy is pretty meager. That's why it's important that Macy's restore to the 
former Bullocks Wilshire store, which it now owns, many of the antique 
chandeliers, sconces and other one-of-a-kind furnishings that have been 
removed.And the retailing giant should not delay in fulfilling its promise to 
return some of those pieces. So fine an example of Art Deco architecture is the 
1929 building that it is on the National Register of Historic Places. But that 
protection does not apply to furnishings. Macy's is enhancing some of its other 
stores with the prized objects; Bullocks Wilshire chandeliers recently were 
spotted hanging in an I. Magnin store in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Preservationists and Bullocks Wilshire loyalists worry that this city landmark 
has been mistreated in an effort to attract shoppers elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After pressure was applied by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- who 
described the building as "one of the most significant historic-cultural 
monuments in the city" -- Macy's promised to return 12 of the nearly 100 
contested items and to discuss disposition of the rest. That was before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern University, which plans to convert the now-empty building to a 
law library, hopes to reinstall the original design elements and furniture, and 
the L.A. Conservancy seeks to reinstitute public tours of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the city, preservation groups and Macy's will meet 
Wednesday. The company can do itself and this city proud by producing the 
goods.

NUNS KILLED IN LIBERIA

<P>
 * In response to "5 Seekers of Good Find Evil," Dec. 26, and "Days of Grace 
End in Terror," Dec. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 To the families and friends of the nuns, Sisters Barbara Ann Muttra, Shirley 
Kolmer, Joel Kolmer, Agnes Mueller and Kathleen McGuire, murdered in Liberia, 
please accept our deepest regrets and pledge to locate and bring to justice 
those responsible for the deaths of your loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 We shall isolate and expose the guilty and let judgment be levied by people of 
conscience. Today, crimes committed by those hungry for power may be overlooked 
by the international community, but we refuse to accept criminals as our 
leaders.They will be held accountable for their actions. Justice will be 
served! 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Liberians have benefited from the goodwill and compassion of nuns 
and people like them. St. Patrick's High, the school Sister Shirley reopened 
during a lull in the fighting, is where many Liberians, myself included, 
received our secondary education. As a matter of gratitude, we will not rest 
until those guilty of the unprovoked killings are identified and punished.

 * Your articles by Richard E. Meyer on the deaths of the five Adorers of the 
Blood of Christ missionaries were excellent. There are few real, vital role 
models in our society today. The faith, courage and charity of these 
magnificent women are a shot in the arm to a weary, solipsistic and jaded 
society. We need more of these stories. The selflessness and heroism of these 
great ladies really inspired these 76-year-old bones of mine. Their lives are 
signs of hope to a weary and somewhat cynical world.

LAUSD HONOR BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On New Year's Day a shining star broke through the overcast that seems to 
have settled over the state of education in the city of Los Angeles. Marching 
proudly down Colorado Boulevard in the 105th Rose Parade was the Los Angeles 
Unified School District All District Honor Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone involved with the LAUSD -- parents, students, faculty, staff and 
administrators -- should all take pride in having been represented by such a 
fine group of young musicians. Unfortunately, all the hard work and dedication 
that the band members, band directors and support staff have put in could not 
be appreciated in the precious few seconds of television coverage or the few 
moments one has as the band marches past during the parade. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, everyone involved with Los Angeles schools should hold their heads up a 
little higher as 350 of our students marched in front of the world and answered 
the question that they were asked many times during practice: "Who's the best 
band in the parade?" The reply, "All District, sir!"

TICKET BROKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * To malign the entire ticket brokerage industry for this year's Rose Bowl 
debacle is hugely unfair (editorial, Jan. 1). It is true that some ticket 
agencies made promises that they were unable or unwilling to keep.The people 
who bought their seats through these agencies have every right to be very 
upset, particularly if they made the trip from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, several ticket agencies that lost a great deal of money 
ensuring that their obligations were met. Losing money is part of any 
speculative venture, which ticket brokering certainly is. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket brokers are not inherently evil. There are people, businesses and even 
ticket brokers that are willing to lose money is order to keep their word.

RIGHTS OF POOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was sickened by the column by Adela de la Torre (Commentary, Dec. 29) on 
welfare reform. Descending from her ivory tower at the Cal State Long Beach and 
wielding studies by the Children's Defense Fund (read Hillary & Co.), she 
declares that the way to correct the failed system of welfare that has been 
built and mutilated by the political left is for the state to take poor 
children away from their parents. We should, she says, "bury our family 
rhetoric and examine and respect the individual rights of children." De la 
Torre should walk the streets of the real world, where families are real, not 
rhetorical, and the most respected right of children is to be in the protective 
care of their mothers and fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 If, God forbid, I should lose my job and my income bracket should drop a notch 
or two while I seek new work, I do not want some committee to come along and 
snatch my children because it deems me economically unfit. Kidnaping is 
kidnaping no matter who does it, and every working-class parent in America 
should be terrified to read such ideas in a paper with circulation as wide as 
that of The Times. 
</P>

<P>
 * And a Happy Heil Hitler to Adela de la Torre. "We need to decouple the link 
between biological parent and child. . . . need to shift our focus away from 
parents toward society's responsibility." To implement the program, a detailed 
blueprint can be found in Germany's archives. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much longer will we act as accomplices to a failed state and federal 
welfare policy that places parental rights above children's rights?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was no doubt in my mind who had more rights in my family. And I, not 
some nameless bureaucrat, decided what they were. While children, they didn't 
even have complete freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 MARVIN BREHM

</P>
<P>
 * Yes, children's rights should come first, ahead of neglectful/abusive 
parents. And if the only solution is taking the children and raising them in 
"safe havens," then so be it. But unless something is done to stop these 
parents from going out and making a whole new batch of kids, the vicious cycle 
of poverty breeding poverty will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the deal. If parents (mothers and fathers) are judged in court to be 
unfit, neglectful, abusive, etc. or can't/won't support the children they've 
already made, then the kids are put into a residential placement and both 
parents are sterilized, either with surgery (vasectomies) or long-term 
contraceptives (Norplant).  
</P>
<P>
 It's time for the politically incorrect idea that making babies is not a 
right, it's a privilege. And if you don't support those you've already made, or 
abuse and neglect them, then why should you have the right to make more?

ZAPATA'S REVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a historian of Latin America and more specifically of the Mexican 
Revolution of 1910-1920, I was distressed to find that your coverage of the 
Chiapas revolton both Jan. 2 and Jan. 3 contained a serious historical error 
regarding Emiliano Zapata's revolutionary movement, for which the Chiapas 
movement is named. That is, you imply that Zapata and his followers sought land 
owned by others.In this you do little more than reproduce the perspective of 
the actual thieves,the large sugar plantation owners, who during the late 19th 
Century systematically stole the land of the peasants in Zapata's home state of 
Morelos. Upon exhausting legal remedies, the peasants mounted a guerrilla war 
to obtain what was rightfully theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the widespread inability to come to terms with the thought that 
poor people are -- at times -- more honest and more democratic than the 
wealthy, and the related problem with seeing that at times organized poor 
people manage to change things, as the Zapatistas certainly did, it would be 
helpful if The Times reflected historical realities more faithfully.

 Heading to South Africa: Actors Danny Glover, Angela Bassett and CCH Pounder 
are among those heading to South Africa on Wednesday as part of a weeklong 
"South Africa Democracy Tour," organized by Artists for a Free South Africa, a 
human rights program of the Hollywood Policy Center. "We're coming to South 
Africa to lend our support to the historic birth of a new democracy," explained 
AFSA co-founder Glover, who, along with the rest of the entourage, will visit 
churches, townships and hospitals to promote voter education and participation 
in the country's April 27 election, the first in which blacks will be permitted 
to vote. The group, joined by South African artists Johnny Clegg and John Kani, 
will meet with a variety of political leaders, including African National 
Congress leader Nelson Mandela. A Wednesday morning press conference prior to 
their departure will hook up the group with journalists from countries such as 
Zambia and Zimbabwe for a satellite question-and-answer period. RADIO & TV

 Jerry Brown to Take On Limbaugh: Former California Gov. Jerry Brown is joining 
the ranks of radio talk-show hosts. The former presidential candidate is 
scheduled to launch a two-hour daily syndicated show Jan. 31. Intended as an 
alternative to conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the show will be carried 
by the Massachusetts-based Talk America Radio Network, which expects about 50 
stations nationwide to carry the program. The show will originate from Oakland, 
where Brown has bought a warehouse to serve as his studio. A Talk America 
spokesman said that a few Los Angeles stations have "expressed interest" in the 
show and that the network does "intend to have it (air) in L.A."

President Boris Yeltsin. Russian State Television is available in 79% of the 
Commonwealth of Independent States, which has 73 million TV households and a 
potential audience of 227 million viewers. . . . Meanwhile, Clinton has 
scheduled more than just diplomatic meetings during his three-day Russian 
visit. Walt Disney Pictures is rushing a print of its current release, 
"Tombstone," for a Clinton-requested showing at Moscow's 550-seat American 
House of Cinema. Clinton, who called the Western "a classic Americana movie," 
will host the screening for his staff and numerous Russian diplomats. POP/ROCK

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: AN IMPRESSIVE OFFERING OF 'NEW FILMS FROM GERMANY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "New Films From Germany," which will be presented at the Directors Guild, 7920 
Sunset Blvd., Thursday through Sunday, is one of the American Cinematheque's 
strongest offerings ever. Once upon a time most of these films would 
automatically be picked up for U.S. distribution, but today this may well be 
your only chance to see some of these truly outstanding pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrillers don't get much better than Lars Becker's taut, economic film noir 
"Shadow Boxing," which opens the series Thursday at 7:15 p.m. Becker plunges us 
into the action with no exposition only to intertwine the strands of his plot 
with a relentless tension. The heart of the matter is that a recently released 
ex-con (Diego Wallraff, who will appear in person) believes he has a moral 
obligation to prevent another convict (Hussi Kutlucan), who saved his life in a 
prison fight, from being deported to Ghana, where he faces certain execution. 
</P>
<P>
 The point that "Shadow Boxing" makes so deftly is that the criminals depicted 
in it are penny ante crooks, capable of living up to their own code of conduct, 
compared to the police officers, who deal drugs on the side but are charged 
with delivering Kutlucan to Accra. With nary a touch of heavy-handedness, 
"Shadow Boxing" also pinpoints the sorry state of political asylum in Germany 
and also its all-too-familiar racism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shadow Boxing" will be followed at 9:15 p.m. with Werner Herzog's "Lessons of 
Darkness," a somber yet exalted meditation upon the devastation wrought upon 
Kuwait, which paradoxically turns vistas of limitless destruction and 
desecration of the landscape into images of terrible beauty, accompanied by 
Herzog's spare, incantatory narration and a score that contains great swaths of 
classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most complex of all the offerings, Hans Geissendorfer's film of 
Friedrich Durrenmatt's "Justiz" (Friday at 7 p.m.) begins, after only the 
briefest prologue, with Maximilian Schell, cast as a witty and philosophical 
Swiss state senator, calmly entering a luxe Zurich hotel restaurant and 
shooting to death a colleague almost as prominent as he -- and without any 
apparent motive.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the many witnesses (Thomas Heinze), a young attorney, ends up agreeing 
to investigate what seems patently an open-and-shut case only to wind up 
ensnared in labyrinth of shocking corruption and decadence. This formidably 
dense film means to reveal the difference between law and justice but is most 
striking -- and most accessible -- as a timeless tale of a naif caught up in a 
predicament way beyond his sophistication and experience. Geissendorfer will be 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Katja von Garnier's "Abgeschminkt!" ("Makin' Up"), which screens Saturday at 
9:45 p.m., lends the series a welcome light touch. Reminiscent of Dorris 
Dorrie's "Men . . . ," Garnier's giddy, zesty romantic comedy introduces a pair 
of beautiful, liberated young women, the brunet Maischa (Nina Kronjager, who 
brings to mind Geena Davis) and the blond Frenzy (Katja Riemann); the antics of 
the first, a nurse, inspire the work of the second, a struggling cartoonist. 
Garnier will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 In an instance of saving the best for last, Bernhard Sinkel's superb 
heart-tugger "The Movie Teller" (Sunday at 5 p.m.) stars the great actor Armin 
Mueller-Stahl in the role of a lifetime. He plays a silent movie narrator who 
rightfully sees both what he does and the movies themselves as genuine art 
forms, but looming ahead are talkies and the Nazis. What could be merely 
sentimental becomes endlessly poignant because Mueller-Stahl finds the grandeur 
and finally bravery in this highly theatrical man. Eva Mattes is 
Mueller-Stahl's mistress, increasingly impatient with his failure to make her 
an honest woman. The strong echoes of both "The Last Laugh" and "Cinema 
Paradiso" in "The Movie Teller" give it resonance rather than make it seem 
derivative. Mueller-Stahl will appear in person. 
</P>
<P>
 Information: (213) 466-FILM. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Actor Rob Morrow's graceful 28-minute "The Silent Alarm" begins Friday 
at the Westside Pavilion. With an almost total absence of dialogue, Morrow 
allows us to see through the eyes of a small boy (Jesse Lee Soffer) 
experiencing increasing dismay at the new man (Scott Renderer) in his mother's 
life.

 The stars and producers of the new sitcom "Monty" (premiering at 8 tonight on 
Fox, Channels 11 and 6) have taken considerable pains to explain ahead of time 
that, no, the show's namesake -- a right-wing commentator played by Henry 
Winkler -- isn't really modeled on Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that home viewers should have any trouble making this significant 
distinction.Limbaugh, after all, is funny. 
</P>
<P>
 What passes for cutting-edge conservative cracks from Winkler's Monty 
Richardson on his "Righttalk" show-within-a-show are toothless jabs on the 
safest of monologue subjects -- Janet Reno's looks, animal rights, those darned 
immigrants ("My wife can't bring back a pineapple from Hawaii, and we give 
these guys the key to a 7-Eleven!"). 
</P>
<P>
 His stuff is so topical, he makes Wally George look like William F. Buckley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And wouldn't you know it: Monty and his determined old-fashionedness are 
surrounded on all sides by potential antagonists, from his black female 
producer, who disses him as "white boy" (a big laugh line here), to his 
freer-thinking wife and kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's opener has his college-age son bringing home a fiancee who -- of 
course -- is a vegetarian performance artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a ring in her nose!" cries Monty, almost on first sight. "Are you 
getting married to a Pygmy?" Soon, like the Sally-Struthers-in-waiting that she 
is, the grungy newcomer (China Kantner) is returning every insult and referring 
to her future father-in-law as "you pompous, permanently-having-a-bad-hair-day 
fascist!" 
</P>
<P>
 Can the half-hour end in anything but hugs? 
</P>
<P>
 If the premiere's moldiness is any indication, "Monty" could be the tamest 
series ever to debut on Fox, with everyone on loan from Stereotypes R Us 
proving suitably gooey on the inside despite their daffy differences on 
nationally divisive issues such as spotted owls and body piercing. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be gone soon . . . no rush.

POTHOLE ALERT FOR THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY; COMMUNICATIONS: REQUIRING 
UNIVERSAL ACCESS WOULD BE PREMATURE AND A DRAG ON THE INTERACTIVE TV

 At the "superhighway summit" today in Los Angeles, Vice President Al Gore will 
unveil details of the Clinton Administration's new regulatory climate to 
promote the revolution in telecommunications. While the Administration deserves 
credit for the emerging consensus in favor of competition, deregulation and 
entrepreneurial dynamism, one aspect of its plan threatens to undermine the 
market aspects and severely dilute the economic benefits of the digital 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration appears to be urging that the vague and oft-misunderstood 
concept of "universal service" be applied to the wide range of new services 
about to become available because of the rapid advance of digital 
telecommunications technology. It would be a huge mistake for this dynamic and 
potentially competitive market to be shackled by the heavy government 
regulation needed to achieve anything resembling universal service. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit of history is instructive. Consider the classic case of universal 
telephone service. Universality has never been well-defined. In practice, the 
concept has simply meant requiring artificially low residential rates to 
increase subscribership. Residential rates have been subsidized by "loading" 
local telephone costs on long-distance, urban and business users.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, competition, the true agent of consumer protection, has 
threatened this regulatory shell game. Highly efficient new entrants to the 
local telephone-service market are taking away the high-margin customers, such 
as long-distance users, who now provide more than $20 billion a year to cover 
the costs of serving the lower-margin users. Now the Clinton Administration 
apparently wants to expand the concept of universal service to include 
interactive video, access to huge data bases and interactive shopping as well 
as basic voice telephone service. Gore recently said that the Administration 
wanted to avoid creation of a society of information "haves and have-nots," 
warning against "blind adherence to the dead hand of a free-market economist."  
</P>
<P>
 Before passively accepting the need for such a vast expansion of universal 
service, policy-makers need to examine how we are going to pay for it, how it 
will affect the economics of the digital telecommunications revolution and how 
many of us want or need all of these new services. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive video services cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be 
considered a necessity. Safety-of-life objectives are met by the current 
telephone system. Consider what interactive video services are likely to be 
viable and capable of paying for themselves: video on demand -- VCR rentals 
generate $12 billion a year, video games $6 billion a year and home shopping 
$51 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, while it would be unwise to bet against the ultimate success of 
interactive video services, whether -- or where and when -- they will prove 
popular with consumers is too speculative to require investors and customers to 
pay for building a universal two-way video network. An impressive roster of 
companies has already lost millions of dollars on the premature hope that 
consumers wanted interactive services: Time Warner, Knight Ridder, Times Mirror 
and IBM / Sears (Prodigy). A conservative estimate for upgrading the 
telecommunications system to provide interactive video services is $100 billion 
-- roughly equal to the combined current revenue of the cable and regional 
telephone industries.  
</P>
<P>
 A better approach would be to consider some more modest regulatory reforms for 
basic telephone service before creating a huge new regulatory entitlement. 
First, subsidies should be targeted to those who really need them. Many 
affluent people are now subsidized. Subsidies should be restricted to 
low-income customers or those in extremely high-cost areas. Second, the monies 
needed to fund universal service should be raised in ways that do not distort 
the competitive process or suppress demand. Third, new entrants must support 
the universal-service fund to avoid skewing the competitive process in favor of 
one technology or group of companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, universal service should not be extended to cover interactive 
video services before we have a better understanding of the economics and 
demand structure of the new services. The market will determine the level of 
demand and the economics of the new services more quickly and efficiently than 
the "dead hand" of government.  
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to nurture and maintain an information superhighway. It's quite 
another to force everyone to pay for a Cadillac to drive on it.

PERSPECTIVE ON FOREIGN POLICY; THE NEXT DEBATE: WHO LOST RUSSIA?; A MAJOR 
DEBACLE LOOMS ABROAD WHILE AMERICAN POLICY-MAKERS PONDER THEIR DOMESTIC NAVELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN R. GRAUBARD, Stephen R. Graubard is professor of history at Brown 
University and editor of the journal Daedalus. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the history of American-Russian relations in the years 1989-1993 comes to 
be written, one message will become crystal clear: The U.S. government, at the 
highest levels, interpreted every major turning incorrectly.  
</P>
<P>
 Given President Clinton's alleged inexperience in foreign affairs, the most 
recent U-turn in American foreign policy, with its abandonment of "shock 
therapy" -- pushing Russia toward rapid and instant economic reform -- may be 
ascribed, charitably, to insufficient knowledge at the top. If this is so, one 
may hope that it will be remedied soon. Still, there is little reason to be 
sanguine when one considers that comparable errors were consistently made by 
President Bush and his foreign-policy team for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the earlier Administration miscalculate Mikhail Gorbachev's survival 
possibilities? Why was it so churlish about Boris N. Yeltsin until his 
supremacy was obvious to all? Why did it not understand the trauma created by 
the sudden demise of communism and anticipate that the ensuing turmoil would 
continue for decades? Why, since the arrival of the new team, dominated by men 
and women whose experience was very largely in the Cold War service of Jimmy 
Carter, with a few journalists sprinkled in, has the situation not improved? 
For three reasons, principally. 
</P>
<P>
 First, with the West mired in economic recession, our allies, like ourselves, 
have not made Russian affairs a priority. Second, the so-called Russian 
experts, trained for decades in the arcane mysteries of Kremlinology, are not 
always the best persons to understand the political and social conditions that 
now prevail; many are biased and committed in ways that inhibit fresh thought. 
Finally, wrong analyses are being advanced by some historians, looking always 
at the 1920s and 1930s, discovering dubious analogies with the tragic events of 
the Weimar Republic and the rise of Nazism. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the economists, however, who have been in the saddle recently, vastly 
exaggerating the possibilities of an easy move to a market economy. Unaware of 
the turmoil that attended earlier transitions to capitalism, they rarely 
consider the major institutional changes that need to be made to achieve a 
modicum of social justice. Their relative unconcern with social discontent -- 
among the many unemployed in Russia, but also among its aged and impoverished 
pensioners, and all the others displaced by the new system, including the 
military -- is evidence of a failure to conceive what the destruction of a 
political system can mean when the outside world is otherwise engaged.  
</P>
<P>
 What is desperately required today is not a new and more ambitious Marshall 
Plan -- inconceivable at a time when even the rich nations claim to be poor -- 
but a new foreign policy suited to post-Cold War conditions, calculated to win 
consent at home, to make major industrial and commercial adjustment here and 
elsewhere possible. 
</P>
<P>
 We live too much in the recent past, too preoccupied with ourselves, led by 
men and women who have neither the energy nor the wit to rethink what they 
learned (or failed to learn) from the days of Stalin, Khrushchev, Brezhnev and 
Hitler. Lacking the historical knowledge that would allow them to consider why 
democracy and free markets failed to be successfully instituted at other times 
in this century -- in the Balkans, for example, only 70 years ago, following 
the disintegration of the Hapsburg, Romanov and Ottoman empires -- they trade 
in mythic folk tales that explain much less than they pretend. The times are 
indeed dangerous, and not only because of the sudden awakening of a somnolent 
beast carrying a deadly poison called nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The new respect for a revised concept of the "national interest," defined 
largely in domestic terms, preoccupied primarily with economic productivity and 
unemployment, conceals a deep aversion to accepting the proposition that 
domestic policy cannot be divorced from foreign policy. If 1989 is an even more 
significant date than 1945, the year of Hitler's defeat and the atomic 
explosion over Hiroshima, that simple lesson has yet to be learned. Yeltsin -- 
a mortal like all the other bipeds who sit in high places -- is someone to 
reckon with, but more important is the need to become more engaged with the 
Russian people.  
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is most urgently needed? A willingness to make foreign policy the 
central concern of an Administration that lives with the illusion that 
health-care reform is its most pressing political problem. To believe this is 
to evade a complex geopolitical and social reality that cannot be safely set 
aside for another day. Russia abroad, like race relations at home, cries out 
for immediate attention and intelligent action. In all of this, the United 
States has a role to play that the tired leaders of yesterday's Cold War world 
cannot even begin to conceptualize, let alone articulate. 
</P>
<P>
 In this intellectual vacuum, the dangers are real; if the situation continues, 
the next debate in this country may well be on who lost Russia.

SCOTT HARRIS: YOUR 29 CENTS WORTH -- AND THEN SOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SCOTT HARRIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lolly Hellman of Studio City writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Harris, I have to agree with Ron Yorke of Reseda, you are pretty much full 
of (expletive deleted) on this subject. . . . Do you honestly believe that if 
we had gun control, that this would actually help to deter violent crime in our 
City of Angels?. . . These people are heathens and guns or no guns, they're 
going to find a way to harm us and thank g-d for our constitutional rights that 
give me the right to bear arms which I do, and will continue to do so!  
</P>
<P>
 My g-d, I've fallen behind in my correspondence! 
</P>
<P>
 Lolly Hellman's letter, dated Dec. 8, was in response to my last column 
excerpting reader mail. If I've learned anything in my first year on this job, 
it's that gun enthusiasts have itchy keyboard fingers. Meanwhile, readers have 
also weighed in on such topics as the legacy of Frank Zappa and have inquired 
about the mysterious wording that explains my occasional absence from these 
pages. 
</P>
<P>
 If you take the trouble to write -- and invest 29 cents postage -- it seems 
only fair that your letters be quoted now and then. (Besides, it fills space.) 
</P>
<P>
 Allow me to correct the vociferous Lolly Hellman on one point: Ron Yorke of 
Reseda did not suggest that I was full of what Hellman thinks I'm full of. For 
the record, Mr. Yorke wondered about my choice of drugs. There's a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, I've yet to hear a good argument against stronger firearms regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 It's interesting, but some gun enthusiasts argue that society is too tough on 
guns already. They would have you believe that the root of gun violence is that 
our laws on firearms are already too tough. Some say society would be better 
off if just about everybody -- or at least every adult -- carried a pistol as 
routinely as car keys. 
</P>
<P>
 They mouth platitudes like "An armed society is a polite society" -- as if 
Miss Manners grew up in old Tombstone. They launch a recall campaign against 
state Sen. David Roberti because he advocates gun laws that, polls show, are 
supported by a vast majority of Americans. They complain about the Clinton 
Administration's plans for a nearly tenfold increase in fees for 284,000 
federally licensed gun dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 How lax have the laws been? Times staff writer David Freed, in a memorable 
1992 series on firearms in Los Angeles County, discovered that federally 
licensed gun dealers here included convicted felons, people with a history of 
mental illness and a "survivalist" who, according to friends, stopped speaking 
10 years ago for spiritual reasons. (Elsewhere, a permit was issued for a dog.) 
Moreover, hundreds of Los Angeles dealers ignored local laws requiring that 
they secure $300 city permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the sheer number of gun dealers overwhelms the ability of law 
enforcement to monitor their enterprise. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
contends the fee increase would weed out 80% of the gun dealers and make 
inspection more meaningful. Those who refuse to pay higher fees but persist in 
selling firearms would be outlaws operating in a black market subject to stiff 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Darn but Lolly Hellman, g-d bless her, wasn't the extremist I thought she 
might be. In a telephone conversation, she was enthusiastic about an idea 
suggested by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno: a safety test for those who wish to possess 
guns. If you need to pass muster with the DMV to acquire a driver's license, 
why not a test for gun owners? 
</P>
<P>
 The idea might seem especially appealing in Los Angeles County, where more 
people die as the result of gunshot wounds than auto accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of guns and violence, another letter concerned "Thugun and Natasha," 
a children's play written by Mary Mann. Loosely based on the videotaped slaying 
of Latasha Harlins by Soon Ja Du in a dispute over orange juice, Mann's play 
uses rap music to deliver a message on the danger of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacqueline Dorfman of Encino writes: 
</P>
<P>
 If what you state in your article is that Mann's play explores how racial 
animosity, poverty, fear and violence itself all conspired to help Du pull the 
trigger, then I have concerns about that message. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 MOST people who are racially bigoted, or who are poor or fearful or live in a 
violent world, do not kill or steal. So to try teaching young minds to put 
blame on poverty etc. is to raise the next generation to expect less of people 
instead of insisting on decency. If my children were of school age now . . . I 
would be trying to teach personal responsibility for their actions and not 
wanting them to look for excuses for indecent behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman allows that she had not seen Mann's play and that her commentary is 
based solely on my column. Having seen a videotape of the play, I don't share 
her fears about "Thugun and Natasha." The play, in acknowledging the social 
ills that provide the context of the Harlins slaying, doesn't minimize the role 
of individual responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorfman raises a valid concern about moral education -- how legitimate 
problems may be transformed into "excuses." 
</P>
<P>
 But in any case, I regret to report that so far the Synthaxis Theater Company 
of Burbank, which hoped to perform "Thugun and Natasha" in dozens of Los 
Angeles elementary schools, has been unable to secure funding for its project. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, just one last letter from a reader who has noticed something 
interesting about the Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays when, for some reason, my 
column isn't featured. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Horn of Winnetka writes: 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a code behind what the paper says as to why your column doesn't 
appear some days? I have seen it variously described as you were "on vacation," 
had "the day off" and, ominously it seems to me, that your column "does not 
appear today." In Soviet politics, for example, we Kremlinologists knew that 
differ e nt phrases were not used casually or accidentally but rather had 
specifically different meanings.  
</P>
<P>
 Readers may recall Bob Horn, the subject of a past column. An expert on the 
former Soviet Union, he was a member of the Cal State Northridge faculty before 
he was stricken with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Horn is virtually 
paralyzed, breathes with the aid of a ventilator and writes by nudging a 
computer mouse with his foot. He still has minor movement in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see. "On vacation" means just that. "The day off" may mean that I just 
pleaded for mercy. ("Had an off day" would perhaps be more accurate.) 
</P>
<P>
 As for the ominous "does not appear today," well, I'm afraid I'll have to 
leave that to the scrutiny of Timesologists. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Professor Horn, if I went into too much detail, my column would not 
appear today. 
</P>
<P>
 If I've learned anything in my first year on this job, it's that gun 
enthusiasts have itchy keyboard fingers.

RED WINGS SURGE PAST DUCKS WITH FOUR LATE GOALS, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings found a new way to torment the Mighty Ducks at Anaheim 
Arena on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of blowing them out of the building right from the start, as they had 
in the past, the Red Wings teased the Ducks by sleep skating through the first 
two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the game on the line, Detroit scored four third-period goals in a 6-4 
victory before a sellout crowd of 17,174. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks could have moved ahead of Winnipeg in the race for the Western 
Conference's final playoff berth and within two points of second-place 
Vancouver in the Pacific Division, but Sheldon Kennedy, Dino Ciccarelli and 
Steve Yzerman took care of all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Their third-period goals extended Detroit's unbeaten streak to eight and 
stopped the Ducks' three-game winning streak. It also was the Ducks' 13th loss 
in 19 games at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was suspecting we'd be out of gas in the third period, and I was right," 
Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "We were playing the best team in the league right 
now, and for two periods we played them pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Ducks killed off a two-man disadvantage early in the third 
period, they seemed to collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy scored at 5:39 to make the score 3-3. Ciccarelli scored a little more 
than a minute later. Yzerman scored at 16:00 and Ciccarelli added an empty net 
goal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit outshot the Ducks, 15-5, in the final period, one more measure of 
their superiority late in the game. Duck goaltender Ron Tugnutt made 26 saves, 
but didn't impress Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, Ron Tugnutt has played better games," Wilson said. "A team like 
Detroit takes advantage of mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings turned three giveaways in the Ducks' zone into goals and Troy 
Loney lost track of Kennedy, which led to a breakaway and the game-tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were even with the Red Wings, 1-1, after the first period, then led, 
3-2, after the second. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first two games against Detroit, the Ducks had trailed the Red Wings, 
3-0, after the first period en route to a 7-2 loss on opening night and fell 
behind, 2-0, in a 5-2 defeat at Detroit on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, defenseman Bobby Dollas' power-play goal with less than 3 
minutes left in the second period put the Ducks ahead, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Duck defenseman, Bill Houlder, had made the score 2-2 at 14:36 of the 
second period. It was Houlder's 10th goal of the season, third on the team 
behind Terry Yake's 15 and Bob Corkum's 13. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first period, Patrik Carnback scored his first goal since Nov. 26, 
giving the Ducks a 1-0 lead at 12:27. He swatted a backhanded pass from 
defenseman Alexei Kasatonov over the right shoulder of goalie Chris Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit's Ray Sheppard pried the puck away from Kasatonov, who was in front of 
the crease, turned and fired a shot past Tugnutt at 14:40. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>

 The 14-year relationship between Adidas and Indiana basketball Coach Bob 
Knight was ended by the shoe manufacturer last week because he failed to wear 
the company's apparel as required under his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adidas said it wasn't because Knight wore the wrong shoes. Nor did it have 
anything to do with Knight's recent one-game suspension for unsportsmanlike 
conduct when he appeared to kick his son, Patrick, during a game. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the rift? Adidas would not disclose what apparel Knight had not 
worn, or if he had worn any, but said the violation occurred on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real cut-and-dried step over the boundaries," Adidas' spokesman John 
Fread said. "It was not a personality thing at all." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bobby? Of course not.

 Add shoe biz: NFL players under contract to Apex One, Inc., have been applying 
an Apex logo over their Nike shoes all season long, a court-bound Nike claims. 
Ironically, Apex's advertising slogan is "You can't fake this." 
</P>
<P>
 Nike says the fakery came to light when Jim Kelly of the Buffalo Bills was 
caught in 1991. Most recently, they say, Thomas Everett of the Dallas Cowboys, 
who is featured in an Apex television spot, is faking it. Their list of 
culprits includes a number of Thomas' Cowboy teammates, as well as players with 
the New York Giants and Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nike sleuths say it doesn't take much to figure out who is wearing 
what. They maintain that one photo in their arsenal shows that William 
(Refrigerator) Perry had applied his plastic stick-on logos upside down.

 Shu business: Tennessee quarterback Heath Shuler, who announced Sunday that he 
would turn professional, was one of two players invited to New York to watch 
Charlie Ward receive the Heisman Trophy in early December. Shuler was widely 
known in Tennessee, but most outside the state had no idea what he looked like. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie Ward and I flew up together and no one in any airports or any place 
else recognized us," Shuler said. "But then after the (television) show it was 
unbelievable. I'm flying back through Pittsburgh and I was mobbed at the 
airport. I signed autographs for a solid hour, just waiting for my plane. I had 
no idea the show would make me that well known."

 What's the point? When the golfers at Rogala public links in Mattoon, Ill.,

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
 The meteorological technician for the National Weather Service in Buffalo 
chuckled when he was told that a sportswriter from Los Angeles was on the line. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The preliminary forecast is that Saturday will be a very cold day," Mike 
Pukajlo said with gusto. "It could dip into single-digit temperatures at 
kickoff time." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Just what the Raiders need. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the deep-freeze this season, they have been upset by Cincinnati, 16-10, and 
whipped by Green Bay, 28-0. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was a relatively mild 37 degrees last month when the Raiders upset the 
Bills at Rich Stadium, 25-24, and about the same on Jan. 20, 1991, when the 
Bills prevailed in the AFC championship game, 51-3. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There are eight to 10 inches of snow on the ground now," Pukajlo said. "It's 
too early to tell about more snow or freezing rain at the end of the week. The 
average temperatures for Jan. 15, the day of the game, are a high of 30 and a 
low of 14, but it looks as though it will be colder this year." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The late George Allen sometimes took his Ram teams east early so they could 
get acclimated, but the Raiders won't leave for Buffalo until 3 p.m. Thursday. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more important for us to get good practice time in, especially during 
such a short week," said Al Davis' right-hand man, Al LoCasale. "You can't get 
used to the cold in a few days, anyway. You just try to ignore the weather." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Both the Raiders and the New York Giants, who are matched against the 49ers at 
San Francisco, are faced with cross-country trips and Saturday games after 
playing on Sunday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will conduct a brief workout Friday, either at Rich Stadium or 
inside the Bills' practice bubble, depending on field conditions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Art Shell presented a game ball after the wild-card victory over Denver to the 
family of Robert Rosenfeld, the team orthopedic surgeon who died last week. . .

<P>
 Look-alikes: Tom White, the referee of the Detroit-Green Bay game last 
Saturday, and Alfred Hitchcock. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With all their firepower, and with Scotty Bowman behind the bench, the Detroit 
Red Wings have as good a chance as anyone to win the Stanley Cup. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Like Bowman, Glen Sather won't win many popularity contests, but the Edmonton 
Oilers are 10-6-3 with him as coach after going 3-18-3 under Ted Green. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley has moved his tack west in a style reminiscent of the days when 
Sandy Hawley got off to such a great start in Inglewood that they called it 
Hawleywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Antley is tied with Laffit Pincay for the Santa Anita riding lead with 12 
winners and has an average victory payoff of $25.53. A $2 wager on each of his 
65 mounts would give you a $176.40 profit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, Hawley, who had surgery for lung cancer Oct. 5 in Canada, will 
begin riding at Santa Anita next week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoter Bob Arum plans to invite those who fought at the Olympic Auditorium 
over the years to sit in a special section at various shows there, beginning 
with the double title-fight card March 5. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Tarkanian will do commentary on a Nevada Las Vegas game for the first 
time tonight when he is paired with Ross Porter on the Rebel-UC Irvine telecast 
on Channel 56. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and Wisconsin, those old Rose Bowl foes, are two of the six major 
unbeaten basketball teams in the nation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest records in Southland college basketball was broken recently 
when forward Blair Slattery surpassed the Occidental career scoring mark of 
1,336 points, set by Ted Tiffany in 1957. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Dallas settled for so little from New York in the Derek Harper deal 
is that the Mavericks want to clear salary-cap space for next season. when they 
plan to get into the free-agent market. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Miami Heat Coach Kevin Loughery's next victory will be his 600th in pro 
basketball, but, before putting him in the Hall of Fame, consider that he has 
lost 690. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I don't like Michael Jordan's chances of becoming a major league baseball 
player or a touring golf professional, but I still think he will return to the 
Chicago Bulls within a couple of years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The two Los Angeles NBA teams have combined for 22 victories this season. 
Seattle, Phoenix, and Houston each have more, and Utah, San Antonio, and 
Atlanta have as many.

O'KELLEY STEPS TO FOREFRONT FOR LONG BEACH STATE, 78-66

<P>
 Long Beach State lost another key basketball player Monday night, but once 
again got a standout effort from another to record its second consecutive Big 
West Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Terrance O'Kelley led the 49ers after the team's leading 
scorer, center Mike Atkinson, severely twisted an ankle with 11:19 left in a 
78-66 victory over Nevada at Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley finished with career highs of 21 points, 14 rebounds and seven 
blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkinson, who scored 29 points Saturday in an 89-70 victory over Utah State, 
had scored only nine on four-for-10 shooting Monday when he was carried from 
the court. The national leader in field-goal percentage is sidelined 
indefinitely. Atkinson was the second 49er in as many games to fall. Starting 
guard Brian Camper was declared academically ineligible before the Utah State 
game. He is appealing, but may be out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada (5-7, 1-3 in the Big West) trailed by 17 points two minutes into the 
second half, but had cut the deficit to 55-50 when Atkinson got entangled with 
Wolfpack reserve center Angel Castilblanque and fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Kelley provided some key blocked shots and several three-point baskets as 
Long Beach (7-3, 2-1) went on a 12-3 run after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Rod Hannibal came off the bench to score 19 points and grab 10 
rebounds. He had 16 points and eight rebounds in the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Moore of Nevada, the conference's leading scorer, was held to 13 points.

Pearl, who as a University of Iowa assistant coach tried to land Thomas as a

 The lawsuit contended that Pearl violated federal law in 1989 by secretly 
recording some telephone conversations he had with Thomas, then a high school 
senior in Chicago. During the conversations, Thomas seemed to confirm Pearl's

Houston Rockets, 115-100, Monday night at Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magic outscored the Rockets, 17-4, in the first eight minutes of the 
fourth quarter and became only the fifth team in 30 games to make at least 50% 
of its shots against the Rockets, who lead the league in field-goal defense. 
</P>
<P>
 After averaging 14 points in two games against Hakeem Olajuwon last season, 
O'Neal made 13 of 19 shots, grabbed seven rebounds and blocked one shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon had 26 points, 11 rebounds and five blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tree Rollins, a Magic assistant coach who signed a 10-day contract to come out 
of retirement as a backup for O'Neal, played eight minutes and had two points, 
two rebounds, one steal and one block. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 99, Boston 94 -- Jeff Hornacek scored 31 points and had 10 
rebounds as the 76ers overcame a rally by the Celtics at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Weatherspoon added 20 points and 12 rebounds for the 76ers.

</P>
<P>
 It was the first time the Rangers lost three consecutive games since Oct. 
16-19.It also marked their second straight loss at Madison Square Garden since 
a 16-game unbeaten streak at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam Creighton scored two goals for Tampa Bay. "The Rangers came out hitting 
and we didn't lay down," Tampa's Joe Reekie said. "I think that was a key."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; NOTHING MINOR ABOUT THIS FAN INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although many NHL teams are having trouble filling their arenas, hockey's 
minor leagues are enjoying an unprecedented boom. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Hockey League, in its 49th season, is on a pace to exceed 
last season's record attendance of 3 million. IHL attendance has jumped 150% 
over the last three years and 200% over the last five. Denver and St. Paul will 
join the league next season, swelling its ranks to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Hockey League is averaging about 6,100 fans a game, led by 
Oklahoma City's 10,000-plus average. The Blazers are challenging the minor 
league hockey attendance record of 9,400 set in 1991-92 by Cincinnati, then of 
the East Coast Hockey League. The 58-year-old American Hockey League, with an 
average of more than 4,100 a game, will probably exceed last season's record 
total of 2.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ECHL, whose 19 teams include Johnstown of "Slap Shot" fame and such 
unlikely hockey locales as Knoxville, Tenn., and Huntsville, Ala., is averaging 
4,700 and expects to total 3 million fans for the first time in its six-year 
history. The Columbus Chill has sold out 56 consecutive games at the 5,700-seat 
Ohio State Fairgrounds Coliseum, relying heavily on gimmicks, such as "Tie-dye 
Night" and having a fat woman in a Brunhilde costume stand up and sing "God 
Bless America" when the Chill is about to win a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said IHL Commissioner Tom Berry: "Our league has consistently improved its 
ownership and its buildings, and our games are an entertainment package that is 
very affordable for families. Mom and dad and a couple of kids come to a game, 
buy a couple of hot dogs and park for less than what one NHL ticket would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hockey isn't that far off from NHL caliber. Seventy-four IHL players 
played 25 or more games in the NHL last season. For a lot of people, it makes 
sense watching a game for $5 or $8 instead of $65, which is what a lot of NHL 
teams charge." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Price, director of operations for the ECHL, agreed that low admission 
prices are crucial to minor-league hockey's success. Most tickets cost $7 or 
$8, and many teams offer student or senior-citizen discounts. The ECHL is 
equivalent to double-A baseball, supplying players to the AHL and IHL. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its four expansion teams, the South Carolina Stingrays, might also 
break the minor league hockey attendance record. The Stingrays average 9,300 
and often sell out the 10,480-seat North Charleston Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, things are going quite well for us," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Berry: "The more people we can get into games, the more people who are 
exposed to hockey and the more youngsters get involved. This boom is wonderful 
for all of us." TAKE NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to Chicago Blackhawk Coach Darryl Sutter: You might want to reconsider 
your ideas about building a team of grinders, guys who play the way you did. 
There's nothing wrong with demanding hard work, but your skill players are 
suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Roenick has scored only two goals in his last 19 games and Patrick 
Poulin, a promising left wing who had 20 goals for Hartford last season, is 
afraid of being benched if he doesn't bang someone in his first shift. Brian 
Noonan is a plugger, but he gets more ice time than he probably deserves. 
</P>
<P>
 And Darryl, your loyalty to your brothers, Rich and Brent, is admirable, but 
aren't you taking this nepotism thing too far? You're letting Brent play when 
he would be better off resting his injured right triceps muscle. He has only 
four goals and his streak of 12 consecutive 20-goal seasons will probably end. 
As for Rich, you've got a half-dozen other players like him. Think about it. 
RISING STOCK 
</P>
<P>
 The recent world junior tournament was a showcase for Russian defenseman Oleg 
Tverdovsky. No Russian has been picked first overall in the NHL draft, but 
Tverdovsky, who plays for the Red Army team, might earn that distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really a good one," said Chuck Grillo, vice president and director of 
player personnel for the San Jose Sharks. "I think he's going to go No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case he does, Tverdovsky has hired Don Meehan as his agent. COMING AND 
GOING 
</P>
<P>
 Gee, what a surprise. It appears that Peter Pocklington will keep the Oilers 
in Edmonton after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman interceded in Pocklington's dispute with the 
commission that runs the Northlands Coliseum and Pocklington will get a lease 
that gives him more concession revenue. The taxpayers of Edmonton will pay for 
it and Pocklington justified that by saying that funding from the city "is not 
an expenditure but an investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. Let's call it what it is: extortion by Pocklington. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Cam Neely wants a guaranteed, three-year contract for $8-10 million from the 
Boston Bruins, who are reluctant because of his frequent injuries. . . . Brian 
Lawton has become an agent, and among his clients is junior defenseman Deron 
Quint of the Seattle Thunderbirds. Quint is projected to be a first-round pick 
in June, which could make Lawton the first former first-round pick -- he was 
No. 1 overall in 1983 -- to represent another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Stars will miss Mike Modano, out for a month because of a knee 
injury. . . . The Quebec Nordiques wouldn't let holdout defenseman Steve 
Duchesne play for the Canadian Olympic team. Duchesne met with General Manager 
Pierre Page last week in Los Angeles, but they didn't reconcile. The Nordiques 
are weighing offers for him.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: CIF CLOSE TO SIGNING WITH NEW SPONSORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The financially strapped California Interscholastic Federation, without any 
statewide corporate sponsors since July, is expected to sign several new 
companies to multiyear contracts in the next month or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifics are still pending in all cases, but the Vons grocery chain will 
reportedly be the first to sign. It has been in negotiations with the CIF for 
several months and will probably come up with several hundred thousand dollars 
over three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want to get into exact details, but an announcement of a new deal 
with the CIF is imminent," said Julie Reynolds, of Vons Cos. "Such a deal will 
be a step forward for our youth-in-education program." 
</P>
<P>
 Vons is the largest grocery chain in Southern California with more than 300 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF, which governs all high school sports in California, is represented by 
Marketing and Financial Management Enterprises of Woodland Hills in marketing 
endeavors. M&FM was hired last year to help the CIF get more corporate dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vons is going to be a big sponsor, but I don't see them being the biggest," 
said Bob Seagren of M&FM. "It may be a case where instead of them giving a lot 
of money to the CIF, that they do a lot of promotional programs for the 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Seagren said he is still hoping to sign a title sponsor for the CIF, but that 
the top billing may end up being shared by several corporations.  
</P>
<P>
 Reebok was the CIF's title sponsor from 1986 until July, when it terminated 
its contract. Pepsi-Cola also ended a three-year contract in July. The two 
companies provided the CIF with $700,000 annually, or about 10% of its budget.

 The Fontana boys' basketball team is coming off its biggest victory in several 
years, a 56-54 upset of Inglewood Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood was considered among the elite in Southern California with a 13-2 
record. But it struggled with the Steelers, trailing by as many as 14 points in 
the third quarter before mounting a comeback in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontana, 20-5 last season, improved to 14-1, its only loss against Dallas 
Lincoln in the semifinals of the La Verne Damien tournament last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy with our start to the season," said Fontana Coach Mike 
Southworth. "But like most other teams at this point, we've still got a ways to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Southworth said the program has improved the last few seasons primarily 
because of three-year starter Travon Carmichael. The 6-foot-5 senior forward is 
considered the top player in the Inland Empire, averaging 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Compton Dominguez girls' basketball team played too many games during a 
holiday tournament in Las Vegas last month and will have to forfeit its final 
three San Gabriel Valley League games as a result. Dominguez played seven games 
in the eight-team Las Vegas Holiday Classic, three more than allowed by section 
rules. . . . The Cerritos Gahr girls' basketball team is 1-14 after forfeiting 
10 games last week for using an ineligible player. Starter Nicki Oliver, a 
transfer, was not properly processed by Gahr administrators. The school 
corrected the matter and Oliver scored 12 points in a 48-43 loss to Lynwood on 
Thursday. . . . Armando Gonzalez, whose teams won three City Section football 
titles at Franklin in the 1980s, is returning as coach after a four-year 
absence. Gonzalez guided the Panthers to Division 3-A titles in 1986, '87 and 
'89. Franklin has not been a power since Gonzalez left. Times' Top 20

 Short-Term T-Bill Rates Fall: The Treasury Department sold $12.8 billion of 
new, three-month bills at an average discount rate of 3.02%, down from 3.10% 
last week. An additional $12.6 billion of new six-month bills was sold at an 
average discount rate of 3.18%, down from 3.29% last week.The three-month bill 
rate was the lowest since they sold for 2.96% on Oct. 4, 1993. The six-month 
bill rate was the lowest since they averaged 3.14% on Oct. 18, 1993. The new 
discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 3.08% for 
three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,923.70 and 3.28% for a 
six-month bill selling for $9,839.20. The discount rate reflects the price 
discount received when government securities are purchased at less than face 
value. T-Bill Auction

 Saturn Labor Pact Could Stand in Way of Second Plant: Saturn Corp.'s quest for 
a second car assembly plant could run into serious problems unless the General 
Motors Corp. unit modifies its Japanese-style labor agreement, a top United 
Auto Workers official said.GM has said it expects to decide by February whether 
to add another assembly "module" to boost production of the popular small car. 
UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich said he opposes using the current Saturn 
labor contract at a second plant, because it is causing problems at Saturn's 
Spring Hill, Tenn., complex. He also said he would press GM to put Saturn 
production in an existing GM facility.

REGULATORS APPROVE INTERSTATE BANK BRANCHES; FINANCE: A LEGAL LOOPHOLE ALLOWS 
REGULATORS TO GIVE BANKS A HEAD START ON ESTABLISHING BRANCH NETWORKS IN OTHER 
STATES. SMALLER BANKS ARE CRYING FOUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clinton Administration regulators used a legal loophole Monday to permit a 
Pennsylvania bank to operate branches in two states, getting a jump on Congress 
before it considers interstate banking legislation this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury Department's Office of the Comptroller of the Currency said it 
would allow First Fidelity Bank to have branch offices in both Pennsylvania and 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, by Comptroller Eugene A. Ludwig, was made under a legal 
provision that allows a bank to move its main office to another location within 
30 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation of a main office from one state to another has previously been 
permitted, but according to the comptroller's office, this is the first time 
the relocating bank is being permitted to keep branches in two states. 
</P>
<P>
 First Fidelity Bancorp., a holding company, currently owns separate banks, one 
headquartered in Newark, N.J., and the other in Philadelphia. It will move both 
headquarters to Salem, N.J., and combine the operations of the two banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect Monday's ruling to be just the first of many that will put 
increasing pressure on Congress to approve interstate banking legislation 
proposed in November by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationsbank Corp., the country's fifth-largest bank holding company, has a 
similar application pending to consolidate its Washington-area operations by 
moving its headquarters in the District of Columbia to Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank holding companies currently may operate across state lines only through 
separately chartered banks in each state, each with a separate corporate 
officers and boards of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts estimate that the industry could save as much as $10 billion a year 
by allowing the banks themselves, rather than just the holding companies, to 
have multistate branch networks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In an industry that's over-regulated and required to over-report, it's a good 
decision. It's the right thing to do and it means improved profitability," said 
analyst Anthony R. Davis of Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised Ludwig's decision not to wait for Congress to adopt the proposed 
legislation, likening it to the Federal Reserve's decisions that have allowed 
some banks to underwrite corporate stocks and bonds even though Congress has 
never repealed a Depression-era law barring banks from the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of paralysis in Congress . . . and the only progress the 
industry seems to make is on the administrative front," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But small, community-based banks are criticizing the move as an infringement 
on states' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "This underscores Eugene Ludwig's intention to use the law to promote 
interstate banking and branching. It is the full exploitation of loopholes that 
. . . were never intended to be used in this fashion," said Kenneth Guenther, 
executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Assn. of America.

 GM to Recall 700 Kansas Workers: General Motors Corp. will recall the 
employees Jan. 24 at its Fairfax plant in Kansas City, Kan., to step up 
production of the Pontiac Grand Prix, a plant spokesman said.The workers were 
laid off in March, 1992, when GM eliminated the plant's second shift because of 
sluggish sales. Production of the Grand Prix was reduced about 20% from the 
late 1980s. Last year, sales of the Grand Prix rose 9.3%, to 113,134 vehicles 
from 103,517 in 1992. The Fairfax plant also will build the Oldsmobile Cutlass 
Supreme beginning next fall.

 Though founded in 1975, the Tchaikovsky Trio, Moscow-born and Paris-based, is 
just getting around to making its United States debut, which took place Sunday 
afternoon in the Gold Ballroom of the Biltmore Hotel. As in the sports cliche, 
this ensemble came to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Seriousness of purpose would seem to be one of the group's chief 
characteristics. Its mainstream program of Mozart, Smetana and Shostakovich 
(sponsored by the Da Camera Society of Mount St. Mary's College) emerged 
meticulously prepared and executed and controlled in every detail, though 
beautifully so, as sleekness and tautness are not what these probing musicians 
appear to be after. There wasn't much whimsy or spontaneity in their playing, 
but they made that seem like a strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Even what for many ensembles would be a tuneful warm-up, Mozart's 
Divertimento, K. 254, became an opportunity for thoughtful, detailed music 
making, in a reading that found much underneath the work's surface charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, these musicians -- Konstantin Bogino, piano, Alexandre 
Brussilovsky, violin, and Anatole Liebermann, cello -- showed strong technique, 
taste and understanding throughout the afternoon. As an ensemble, they revealed 
pliancy and balanced sound, a comfortable give-and-take that allowed the 
musical discourse to flow unimpeded and therefore engrossingly. This despite 
Brussilovsky having joined the trio only a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Smetana's tragic and sweetly sentimental Trio, Opus 15, written after his 
daughter's death, the ensemble uncovered the full range of emotions without 
overstatement. Not a maudlin or sugary note besmirched the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the highlight had to be Shostakovich's Trio, Opus 67, its humor 
delivered dryly, its drama starkly. The measured tempo the ensemble chose for 
the finale made its work all the harder, but it paid off in a quietly sinister 
reading. TIMOTHY MANGAN

THEATER REVIEW; LE PETIT'S 'MERCI MAURICE': CHARMING BUT TAME OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gustav Vintas' song and spiel solo "Merci Maurice" at Le Petit Theatre conveys 
some of the charm of, and the lore surrounding, the legendary entertainer 
Maurice Chevalier. But c'est not quite magnifique.  
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by musical director Judy Balsam, the semi-chilly Vintas takes us 
through a string of 25 decently sung Chevalier tunes in both French and 
English, splicing the story of the singer's life in-between the numbers. The 
narrative is utterly straightforward -- of the he-did-this, he-did-that variety 
-- but that's only a minor loss, especially since the troubled Parisian's life 
was so colorful that it doesn't need embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintas is mostly in character as Chevalier when he's singing, and mostly out 
of the Chevalier character when he's telling the performer's life story. Yet 
there's little difference between the Chevalier and the narrator personas. More 
contrast between the guises would not only better illustrate Chevalier's 
genius, it would also help showcase Vintas' performing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vintas wisely underplays his hand with this material. Although the temptation 
would be to indulge in one of those drippingly saccharine Chevalier imitations 
often sighted at post-baby boomer New Year's soirees, Vintas chooses instead to 
merely suggest the outlines of the singer's style. He also keeps the Chevalier 
biography sketchy enough that we're left curious about the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the overall format is so pat and uninventive and the treatment so tame 
that "Merci Maurice," stiffly directed by Mark Madama, often feels like a 
lesson. It's just missing that certain je ne sais quoi . 
</P>
<P>
 * "Merci Maurice," Le Petit Theatre, Hotel Sofitel, 8555 Beverly Blvd., 
Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Runs indefinitely. $15. (310) 278-5444, ext. 7777.

CHANGING LIFESTYLES; THE CASE OF NIGERIA'S VANISHING MIDDLE CLASS; THERE'S 
PLENTY OF MONEY IN THE OIL-RICH AFRICAN NATION. BUT AVERAGE CITIZENS NO LONGER 
SEE MUCH OF IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Like so many millions here, Lizy Ute used to have new kitchen appliances. Her 
kids wore new clothes, and the family drove the latest-model car. But those 
days are long gone for her and the rest of Nigeria's middle class, once the 
largest in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to consider myself middle class, but now there is only high and low," 
said Ute, pausing from hard-nosed negotiations with a shoe salesman at a Lagos 
market the other day. 
</P>
<P>
 After securing the $2 discount she demanded, Ute put an arm on the shoulders 
of her 12-year-old and added: "Just to get this gentleman dressed from head to 
toe costs 3,000 naira (about $140). It used to be less than 500 naira ($25)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's middle class, born in the oil boom of the 1970s, has all but 
disappeared amid 65% annual inflation and nearly a decade of rampant government 
corruption. While a dwindling few continue to binge conspicuously on the finest 
of everything, most of Nigeria's 90 million people struggle in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 But the widening gulf between rich and poor, and the political upheaval of 
recent months, have had a curious side effect in Nigeria. For the first time, 
there is growing revulsion for the corruption that has long been a central and 
accepted feature of this society. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle class may have lost its cherished lifestyle, but in the process it 
has embraced at least one middle-class value -- deep anger at the government 
cheats who have looted the country's treasury and the unscrupulous business 
people who have damaged the nation's image. 
</P>
<P>
 That disquiet, fed by Nigerians' finely honed penchant for self-criticism, has 
become evident on the letters pages of dozens of newspapers and magazines, in 
the offices of lawyers and accountants, and even, increasingly, in the dimly 
lit offices of corrupt government officials themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fraudulent, corrupt, dishonest, selfish and hate the truth, to mention 
a few of our innumerable vices," wrote Babs Ologundudu in a recent letter to 
the Punch, a Lagos daily newspaper. "Right from home, the Nigerian is 
self-centered and selfish to the core." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a decade ago, most middle-class Nigerians were so worried about clinging 
to their lifestyles, then among the best in Africa, that they ignored 
allegations of high-level corruption. And the ability to get rich quickly, by 
whatever means, was a symbol more of status than of disdain. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are more angry about it now," said Olisa Agbakoba, a lawyer and 
chairman of the Civil Liberties Organization in Lagos. "And we're focusing 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the new obsession with corruption has been felt at the highest levels 
of government. Within days of taking power in a bloodless coup d'etat on Nov. 
17, Gen. Sani Abacha announced a "war on corruption and indiscipline" and 
promised to begin with government itself.  
</P>
<P>
 "Corruption is giving us a bad image abroad, which is unfair," explained 
Abacha's minister of information, Jerry Gana. "Basically, Nigerians are good. 
But this small group wanting to make money in a hurry is giving us a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, many believe Abacha is part of the problem rather than part of 
the solution. After all, Abacha helped lead coups in 1983 and 1985, the latter 
of which brought Gen. Ibrahim Babangida to power. And Gana acknowledges that 
the government does not intend to "waste our time with interminable probes into 
the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Bribes have become a permanent feature of life in Nigeria, and "dashing" or 
"settling" everyone from the lowest clerk to the biggest boss has become a 
permanent supplement to poor wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Government departments are often forced to bribe each other to transact 
government business. Police officers -- who earn less than $200 monthly when 
they're paid, and who haven't been for the past three months -- routinely must 
be "settled" by people reporting crimes and, later, by the suspects arrested 
for those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Clerks expect money to arrange appointments with their superiors or to locate 
a file. Their bosses collect a percentage on contracts with business people. 
Students bribe their way into college and then pay handsome "tips" to pass 
their exams. Telephone repair workers expect a tip to fix a customer's phone, 
and gasoline station attendants demand to be "settled" before they will open 
the pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers at the Lagos airport are asked at least a dozen times, on arrival or 
departure, for bribes by customs officials and police. The airport, ironically, 
is named for Gen. Murtala Mohammed, the last head of state to openly condemn 
corruption. He was assassinated in 1976 after a two-year rule. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight years in power, Babangida amassed untold millions, most of which 
he stashed in European banks, civil rights groups say. Before he stepped down 
in August, under pressure from Abacha, Babangida rewarded each of 3,000 loyal 
officers with a $21,000 automobile -- equivalent to five years' pay for a 
former member of the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 The country is by no means poor. Although the world price of oil has been 
falling steadily, Nigeria still pumps 2 million barrels a day, which amounts to 
about $10 billion in annual revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But that money has a way of mysteriously disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Isoladele Olashore, who was finance minister until last August, later told 
journalists that his department was subjected to "a never-ending pressure" from 
a variety of other government departments to overspend their budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 An ad hoc "Budget Monitoring Committee" reported in September that nearly $1 
billion had been siphoned off by the central bank and the national oil company 
for unspecified "priority projects." And Nigerians were stunned to learn last 
year that the country received $2 billion in extra oil revenue during the 
Persian Gulf War -- money that no one seems able to trace. 
</P>
<P>
 Where has all the money gone? 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Liberties Organization has identified 3,400 Nigerian officeholders 
with a total of $30 billion overseas -- equivalent to $8.8 million apiece, and 
altogether roughly equal to the country's external debt, which hasn't been 
serviced in two years. The rights group says it hopes to investigate those 
Nigerians for fraud if a democratic government comes to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone can see it," said Gani Fawehinmi, a 55-year-old lawyer and 
often-jailed government opponent. "You see it in their (government officials') 
houses, in their clothes, in their trips to Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 While factories are closing, banks have quadrupled, to 140. A license to buy 
dollars at the official rate of exchange -- which is less than half the black 
market rate -- is as good as a currency printing press. Traders and other 
middlemen are making a killing as a result, and white-collar crime, with 
foreigners often the victims, is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money makes everything happen here," said D. D. Odike, a senior editor for 
the News Agency of Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of buying and selling in Nigeria today," said Beko 
Ransome-Kuti, head of the Campaign for Democracy, a leading government 
opposition group. "But I don't see a lot being produced. Everybody is just 
trying to make as much as they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the market where Lizy Ute was shopping recently, 1,000 
well-heeled guests had turned out for a wedding on the terrace of the Lagoon, a 
fashionable restaurant. Three Rolls- Royces were parked out front, along with 
two dozen Mercedes-Benzes and BMWs. A table seemingly the length of a football 
field was brimming with roasted meats and peeled shrimp, and the sound of 
French champagne bottles being uncorked could be heard above the live band. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an awful lot of money here," one guest remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, a two-day Chic Afrique exposition was packed with well-to-do 
Nigerian women shopping for pricey cosmetics. Outside, chauffeurs waited with 
their motors and air conditioners running. 
</P>
<P>
 "While there is still a lot of wealth in Nigeria, it's held in the hands of so 
few people," said a Western diplomat with long experience in the country. 
"Ultimately, it's only a matter of time before you have a real mess. And I mean 
violence." 
</P>
<P>
 On the streets of Lagos, where traffic lights rarely work and traffic police 
battle day and night to unclog the highways, young boys run from car to car 
with an odd assortment of goods, many of which have been pilfered from ships in 
port. One motorist paused from his cellular phone conversation the other day to 
roll down his window and browse, creating a small riot of sellers hawking 
greeting cards, 21-piece ratchet-wrench sets, sterling silver dinner knives and 
peeled oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria's recent political troubles have exacerbated the sense of chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerians voted in their first free elections on June 12, but Babangida 
annulled those elections. Two months later, Babangida was forced to step down, 
turning over power to a puppet civilian government. That civilian government, 
beset by street protests over a gasoline price hike, lasted just 2 1/2 months 
before it was unseated by Babangida's former No. 2, Gen. Abacha. Like most of 
his predecessors, Abacha promised a new round of constitutional talks and 
democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need in this country," said Ransome-Kuti, "is just a straightforward 
ruler with a lot of common sense who can keep his fingers out of the till. It's 
not that difficult to rule. But once you have your hand in the till, everything 
becomes complicated."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Daniel Johnson, a fiscal conservative and a federalist, is to be sworn in as 
premier of Quebec today amid continuing speculation over his abilities to 
outmaneuver the province's perennial French-speaking separatist movement as 
successfully as his predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson succeeds longstanding Premier Robert Bourassa, a Liberal who was known 
for his canny handling of the situation but who stepped down last year because 
of ill health. Johnson is considered a cool and aloof technocrat, firmly 
committed to austerity measures that are unpopular with Quebec's potent unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's test will come this fall, when provincial elections are to be held. 
Currently, opinion polls show Johnson and the Liberals trailing the separatist 
Parti Quebecois, led by Jacques Parizeau.

 Russia has a whole new parliament, operating under a new constitution and in 
different chambers, but as the Federal Assembly opens its first session today, 
it promises to present many of the same problems that led President Boris N. 
Yeltsin to dissolve the old Supreme Soviet last September. 
</P>
<P>
 At most, only between one-quarter and one-third of the new lawmakers are seen 
as solid supporters of Yeltsin's tough, free-market reforms. The remainder are 
largely Communists, their sympathizers or backers of ultra-nationalist 
demagogue Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Initial attempts at forming a pro-Yeltsin 
coalition appear to have failed.

 The European Parliament, meeting in plenary session beginning next Monday, 
plans to discuss expansion of the European Union, formerly known as the 
European Community. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision may still be months away, but the proposal to add four new 
members to the 12-nation body -- Finland, Austria, Norway, and Sweden -- 
already has been the subject of negotiations and controversy on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some EU members, such as Spain, worry that addition of the prosperous quartet 
will upset the delicate north-south balance of the organization. And, even 
within the borders of the new candidates, membership has been controversial.

 Under the bridge in Klong Toey's massive slum and around Bangkok's railway 
station, Thai boys gather nightly. Preteen labor is illegal in Thailand, but 
these kids work in shoe factories, gas stations or fisheries, even heavy labor. 
Others are child prostitutes or live off petty crime. Many are homeless.  
</P>
<P>
 The boys roughhouse, play with popguns and wait for "tricks," victims or 
employers who look for cheap labor at the rail station. Sniffing glue and paint 
thinner is now chronic in this age group. 
</P>
<P>
 Child labor has long been a problem in Asia, but social workers claim figures 
are soaring, despite government efforts, as Thailand presses to join the list 
of newly industrialized countries, or NICs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming an NIC is destroying the social fabric of this society. And the kids 
are paying the highest price," said Rotjana Phraesrithong of the Foundation for 
Slum Child Care in Klong Toey. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Latvia, the children show up in Riga's quaintly restored old town in the 
late afternoon. None looks older than about 7. Among a group of four boys, one 
has no socks and all wear only light sweaters, despite the cold in northern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 With their hands outstretched, the boys trail people leaving Latvia's new 
privatized hotels, boutiques and restaurants. Late at night, they loiter under 
the bright lights of a new casino. Both Latvian and Russian children now beg on 
Riga's streets, explained Dmitri Yeryomin, a young interpreter, with 
embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all new to us. We didn't have beggars in the past. In the Communist 
days, the state took care of everyone," Yeryomin added. "Now it's everyone for 
himself." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For all of its scientific and technical advances, the world at the end of the 
20th Century is producing millions of children who have little hope of normal 
life, much less of leading the world into the 21st. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of the underlying causes today are otherwise-heralded forces of 
global change: new free markets, new political systems and new rights of people 
to speak, act or associate freely, and of nations to determine their own 
destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view that the Cold War has gone out with a whimper rather than a bang, 
and that one side has won with hardly a shot being fired, is the first and most 
dangerous placebo of the new age," according to "The State of the World's 
Children 1994," the yearly survey of the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF). (See 
chart on Page 5.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cold War has been more destructive than any war in human history; it has 
been a war in which there have been no winners and a war of which the severest 
consequences may yet be to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is not all bleak, of course. Unprecedented breakthroughs were made 
during the Cold War. Indeed, until the late 1980s the 3 billion children 
worldwide had never been better off by many measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since World War II, deaths of children under 5 have been halved. The number of 
Third World children who start school has risen from less than half to more 
than 75% -- despite a doubling of the population. And 60% of rural families now 
have access to safe water -- up from less than 10%, UNICEF said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just since the mid-1980s, the largest peacetime collaboration in history has 
provided child immunization throughout the developing world. The program saves 
about 10,000 lives a day, more than 3 million a year, UNICEF reports. Deaths 
from measles, for example, dropped from 2.5 million in 1980 to about a million 
a year now. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 70% to 80% of all children now have their basic needs in health and 
sanitation met, according to Save the Children. Laws on issues such as 
maternity leave and working conditions are also giving new attention and weight 
to children's rights worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most progressive is Norway's law allowing a mother to take a year 
off work at 80% pay after birth -- or the same conditions for a father if the 
mother opts to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made more global human progress in the last 50 years than in the 
previous 2000. Three-quarters of the world's population now enjoy the basics of 
a life of dignity, productivity and health," said James P. Grant, UNICEF's 
executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, many changes since the great, global, 
sociopolitical upheaval that began in 1989 are seriously threatening progress. 
The new world order is turning out to be particularly hard on the young. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, children are increasingly victims in a growing pattern of 
internal urban conflict on four continents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia-Herzegovina, the plight of 5-year-old Irma Hadzimuratovic, her body 
torn by shrapnel in an attack that killed her mother, inspired an airlift last 
summer -- though not until after hundreds of other children died. (Despite 
treatment in London, Irma was paralyzed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Post-Cold War turmoil is also leaving deep scars on children from tiny 
Tajikistan in the former Soviet bloc to huge Zaire in the belly of Africa, from 
exotic Kashmir to mountainous Afghanistan.  
</P>
<P>
 After the superpowers stopped exploiting its territorial and tribal divisions 
for surrogate conflict, Angola's civil strife grew even nastier, reputedly 
killing about 1,000 children monthly in 1993. Since the Soviet demise, children 
have been hostages in the conflict between Christian Armenians and Muslim 
Azerbaijanis over Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the dreams of the post-Cold War era were put on hold as rivals in a 
host of countries pursued ethnic, religious, territorial and political 
differences at the point of a gun. Children were among the first to suffer," 
UNICEF warned in a recent report. Victims of War  
</P>
<P>
 The dangers in post-Cold War hot spots aren't just physical. For children, 
"the psychological damage caused by war can be even more devastating," UNICEF 
added. About 70,000 children remain in Sarajevo, while a million refugees from 
Yugoslavia's multifaceted conflict are under 18. Whether injured, threatened or 
forced to flee, all face trauma from loss of health, family, home or country. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-1993, the rape of Bosnian women by Serbian forces -- atrocities 
redefining the term "child victims" -- led to the births of hundreds of babies, 
nearly all of whom face life as outcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of 18 million refugees, post-Cold War upheavals have led to the 
displacement of about 25 million people within their own countries. At least 
half in both categories are children, according to Judy Mayotte, chairwoman of 
the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Internally displaced children are a glaring problem that has grown with 
global change since the 1980s. But they don't have the recognition as refugees 
because they're supposedly protected by a government -- which is often party to 
the problem," Mayotte said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be the situation in a lot of places in the post-Cold War 
world, as other uprisings and internal conflicts break out, and as countries 
refuse or turn back refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled northern Iraq after a failed 1991 uprising 
against President Saddam Hussein -- only to be held at the Turkish and Iranian 
borders. Children particularly succumbed to malnutrition, disease and 
frostbite. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to problems from societal breakdowns, UNICEF spent $170 million in 1992 on 
humanitarian aid in more than 50 states -- the most since the post-World War II 
emergency and three times the 1990 level. No More Safety Net  
</P>
<P>
 Abrupt political transitions are also weakening or eliminating the safety net 
of state protection. Economic reforms are unleashing cutthroat competition, an 
intense new version of survival of the fittest. And social transformations are 
altering rules of the game. Again, children often bear the brunt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet bloc, transitions from socialist rule 
have removed everything from guaranteed incomes to state health and welfare 
services, affecting children the most. 
</P>
<P>
 Many now face problems virtually unknown during seven decades of socialist 
rule, from medical neglect allowing old diseases like polio to make big 
comebacks in Bulgaria to the homelessness forcing children to camp out and 
panhandle in Russian subways. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1989 revolution, poverty has become so pervasive in Romania that 
most families spend 80% of their income on food, and about 4,000 children were 
left at orphanages in 1992. After years of declines, the rate of infant 
mortality rose 3% -- and is now more than double the European average, the 
Health Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The post-Cold War world is not better for millions of children. They're less 
protected than before, and they're more vulnerable due to political and 
economic transitions," said Horst Habenicht, who runs the International Labor 
Organization's (ILO) new International Program on the Elimination of Child 
Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The transition from planned economies to private market economies often means 
the social framework no longer exists in these countries, so there's little 
protection for people in general, and often none for children at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Transitions from right-wing rule in Latin America, much of which became 
democratic for the first time in 1991, have also marred children's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Peru is a classic case. New freedoms have not resulted in greater prosperity. 
Foreign debt, privatization and stiffer economic competition from free-market 
forces have instead increased poverty. Five million children, nearly a quarter 
of the entire population, now live in extreme poverty, UNICEF reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "A major challenge in the 1990s is to find ways to make structural adjustments 
with a human face to cushion the vulnerable parts of society from the drastic 
effects of economic transitions," said Ken Kloten, executive director of 
Defense for Children International. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want these adjustments to ensure a free citizenry and for continued growth 
of democracy around the world -- which is good for kids. But it will require 
resources, and we're living at a time that dollars are increasingly scarce for 
development aid." 
</P>
<P>
 One byproduct is a growing class of uneducated outcasts who prey on the system 
to survive. The magnitude is numbing. In Latin America, a record 40 million 
children are abandoned or homeless. Seven million are in Brazil, the World 
Health Organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nairobi's young street population rose from 16,000 in 1989 to 25,000, the U.N. 
Development Program reported. In Manila, 75,000 children are homeless, while 
Bombay, Calcutta and New Delhi each have 100,000. Numbers are also soaring in 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 As numbers grow, public sympathy wanes and backlash widens. "Street children 
are automatically regarded as criminal suspects by many law officers and are 
often subjected to harassment, threats or violent attacks," Amnesty 
International reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, eight Brazilian boys, ages 11 to 17, were shot in cold blood in Rio 
de Janeiro. Four police officers were arrested for their murders. Since 1990, 
about 4,600 street children have been killed in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children are a product of the breakdown of family support systems that 
come with population growth and migration to cities. As grim as life was in 
many villages, at least children had an extended family to rely on and a 
traditional way of life that gave meaning to their existence," said Dr. Charles 
MacCormack, president of Save the Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil isn't alone. As part of an anti-crime campaign by vigilantes, Colombian 
posters announced the "extermination of delinquents" and invited Bogota's 
10,000 vagrant children to attend their own funerals in 1993, according to 
Amnesty International. In 1991 alone, about 2,800 children were murdered in 
Colombia, Amnesty added.  
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, according to Defense for Children International, youngsters were 
victims of extrajudicial or arbitrary executions in 22 states last year. Back 
to Work  
</P>
<P>
 Another characteristic of the new order is that after declining for decades, 
the frequency of child labor is again on the increase, particularly in the 
developing world. The ILO estimates that one in four children between the ages 
of 10 and 14 now work in Third World countries. The total is in the hundreds of 
millions. 
</P>
<P>
 On a still-sweltering winter day, Klong Toey's clay dirt alleys were empty of 
children. Only toddlers, some with childhood pigtails, played outside. Mothers 
were in short supply, too. At least 5 million Thai children, beginning at age 
7, now work, said Chira Hongladarom, executive director of Bangkok's Human 
Resources Institute. More than 60% of Thai mothers also work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic growth over the past seven years has had a negative impact on the 
social system, particularly family structure. Children, now part of the 
productive process, are treated as economic goods rather than society's 
future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is happening despite -- or perhaps because of -- the modernizing 
process of international trade and investment," added Robert Sensor in a 1993 
Freedom House report. In many NICs, human rights are secondary to economics in 
the name of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Children reportedly constitute 18% of Brazil's work force. Child labor is 
widespread in Africa, particularly in agriculture. An estimated 12 million 
children work in populous Nigeria.  
</P>
<P>
 But Asia has the most child labor. In India alone, 44 million children work, 
the ILO estimates. One of four Indian workers is under age 14.  
</P>
<P>
 In Indonesia, conservative figures claim that 2.4 million children between 
ages 10 and 14 work. Along China's eastern provinces, site of an economic boom, 
children have left school in droves for jobs in new factories, Sensor said. The 
problem was illustrated dramatically in a 1992 fire at a fireworks factory: 
most of 20 workers killed were between 9 and 14 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not just age, but conditions and pay. In Thailand, girls work 
12-hour days in textile shops. They earn as little as 5 cents for sewing on 100 
buttons, or 10 cents for wrapping 100 silk flower stems, according to Bangkok's 
Foundation for Child Development. One-third work for less than minimum wage, 
Hongladarom added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Child labor is the single most important source of child abuse and child 
exploitation in the world," according to Michel Hansenne, ILO director general. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, new freedoms have contributed to the problem. "In socialist systems, 
the state organized work and excluded children. Now, free markets and private 
employers try to get the cheapest labor. With the state's role diminished, and 
no social protection or legislation in place, child labor is growing," 
Habenicht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many countries in transition still haven't finished new constitutions or basic 
reforms, so meaningful legislation codifying children's rights, treatment and 
living or working conditions is a decade or more away. Enforcement will take 
even longer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem of child labor, however, has an even darker side. In the late 20th 
Century, 200 million child laborers work in slavery, forced child labor or debt 
bondage, an ILO study reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Slave raiders in Asia, Africa and Latin America kidnap or buy children into 
lifelong bondage, it charged. Slaves as young as 6 work up to 18 hours a day. 
In Haiti, more than 100,000 children, known as restaveks, have been sold or 
given away to work as domestics. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common form of slave labor is child prostitution. India reportedly 
has up to 400,000 child prostitutes, Brazil a quarter of a million, the 
Philippines 60,000 and Sri Lanka 30,000, many sold by families or trapped by 
debt bondage. In Thailand, at least 800,000 girls, some as young as 8, work as 
prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan has up to 7.5 million children in modern slavery, the ILO reported. 
In India, several million children between ages 5 and 14 are in "chronic 
bondage" in agriculture, a million in construction, brick-making and quarry 
work, and several hundred thousand in carpet and jewelry industries, according 
to Kailash Satyarthi, chairman of South Asia Coalition on Child Servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, escravidade branca, or white slavery, is common in rural areas, 
while debt bondage -- enganche or "the hook" -- is a problem in Peru's mines, 
the ILO said. Treated as "expendable," child slaves worldwide often get 
dangerous jobs. Education or prospects of betterment are nonexistent. Any 
semblance of childhood disappears. Technology and Disease  
</P>
<P>
 Technological developments and new health plagues in the late 20th Century are 
also leaving a lasting impact on children. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the worst manifestations was the 1993 birth in Moldova of a baby with 
two heads, two hearts, two lungs, two spinal cords but one set of limbs. 
Doctors blamed it on radiation from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster 
in neighboring Ukraine. Doctors in the area reported up to a 30% increase in 
birth defects as well as a dramatic rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer 
among children after Chernobyl.  
</P>
<P>
 Because technology now discerns gender, children elsewhere don't have a chance 
at life; thousands of Chinese and Indian women abort female fetuses in 
societies favoring boys.  
</P>
<P>
 The AIDS pandemic, spread globally in a relatively short time thanks to modern 
transportation, is both killing children and creating orphans. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the offspring of HIV-positive pregnant women, one out of three babies is 
likely to be infected and eventually die of AIDS; two will be orphaned when the 
mothers die, said Mechai Viravaidya, chairman of Bangkok's Population and 
Community Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Uganda has produced 1.5 million AIDS orphans in the past decade. In Thailand, 
10,000 pregnant, HIV-positive women in 1992 were expected to eventually produce 
6,500 orphans -- doubling in a year the total number of orphans under state 
care for other reasons. In 1993, pregnant and HIV-positive Thai women doubled 
to 20,000, Viravaidya said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of AIDS' most lasting legacies may be a world awash with a generation of 
orphans. A UNICEF report, "AIDS: The Second Decade," estimates nearly 10 
million children will be orphaned by AIDS by 2000 -- a prediction some experts 
now believe to be conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet children's problems at the close of the 20th Century are most distinctive 
because they're largely preventable. Most of the 13 million child deaths in 
1992, for example, could have been avoided.  
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere between 500 million and 1 billion children are still facing 
malnutrition, disease and death, mainly because we can't mobilize what we need 
to help them," MacCormack of Save the Children said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was understandable when we didn't have solutions. But now we know what to 
do. One of the greatest frustrations is to know technology and management are 
there to eliminate 60% to 70% of remaining child poverty at a reasonable cost, 
but the political will and public knowledge aren't there to make it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 And dangers grow as nations both big and small engage in economic and social 
triage. In 1993, for example, Washington eliminated aid to 21 states, many 
where children endure the worst conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hit a plateau in our ability to reduce many problems because we're 
using the same or fewer resources than in the past," Kloten said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Between resource problems and global change, the situation in many places 
will get worse before it gets better."

MARKET SCENE; BULLS RULE SLOVENIA'S NEW STOCK EXCHANGE; IT BEGAN WITH A 
SCOREBAORD AND A FEW CHAIRS IN 1991. NOW, MANY PREDICT A BOOM AS THE COUNTRY 
GOES CAPITALIST.

<P>
 The "Big Board" lit up. Traders slipped out of down parkas that covered 
business suits. A guard stoically took his place by the sliding glass doors. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at the stroke of 10:02 a.m., the floor leader chimed a brass bell, the 
traders huddled around the board, the television crews took their positions and 
spectators in the upper gallery pressed their faces against the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Just another Tuesday at the Ljubljana Stock Exchange: Lights! Camera! 
Capitalism! 
</P>
<P>
 Though it meets but two hours a day, twice a week, and would be dwarfed by the 
massive New York Stock Exchange, Slovenia's Ljubjlana Stock Exchange Inc. is 
one of the former Yugoslav republic's most visible efforts at instituting a 
free-market economic system. In charge are a slew of westward-leaning yuppies 
like Boris Snuderl, the 34-year-old chief executive of what the Slovenes call 
the "Borza."  
</P>
<P>
 "C'mon," he said, leaning back into a plump leather chair. "This is a small 
country. There is no advanced technology. There are no oil wells, no coal 
deposits. So what (else) is there to invest in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Central and East European nations trying to jettison communist 
economics, this Alpine nation of 2 million hopes to use the exchange to spur 
investment and growth. And, thanks in part to its record as the most prosperous 
of the former Yugoslav federation's republics, economists figure it has a 
better chance than many of pulling through the financial transition to 
capitalism now taking place among its former East Bloc neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnover at the exchange grew from 200 million German marks in 1991 to 1.9 
billion marks last year, and there are 28 companies and 35 securities being 
traded. With the debut in December of computerized trading, and the country's 
plans to privatize the economy, observers believe the market is on the verge of 
a boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Slovenia's trading history dates to 1924, when currency and commodity 
transactions were the primary lines of business. The market closed in 1941 
because of World War II and was abolished in 1953 as Yugoslavia's Communists 
took charge. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed when Slovenia declared its independence in 1991. The exchange had 
humble beginnings -- a room with a scoreboard and a few chairs -- but it soon 
evolved into a genuine enterprise, with a swank trading floor that features a 
marble inlaid counter snaking its way through a basketball-court-sized room. 
</P>
<P>
 The glitzy setup seemed designed to tempt people to taste the trappings of 
capitalism. But economists like Joze Mencinger of Ljubljana counter that in 
real terms, the exchange itself is nothing more than a good show. "It's very 
well furnished. They've got nice lights, etc.," Mencinger said. "(But) my 
impression is that the stock exchange is not a reflection of the economy. It's 
not providing investment resources." 
</P>
<P>
 Small groups of traders are exchanging securities back and forth, Mencinger 
said, rather than having the market operate as a source of capital for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Slovene system also seems to be designed by default to attract as much 
domestic investment as possible. Unfavorable tax laws, complicated regulations 
and ever-changing economic reform legislation discourage outside capital, 
insiders claim. 
</P>
<P>
 And with unemployment estimated as high as 15%, and a war raging in nearby 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, potential foreign investors are all the more reluctant to 
put their money down. 
</P>
<P>
 But Snuderl argues that the exchange has learned from mistakes of other 
fledgling East European markets and has patterned Slovenia's exchange on the 
successful U.S. and Canadian models. That will help, he said, as the market 
braces for what may be dramatic growth. Privatization laws, which will give 
many workers shares in the companies in which they labored under communism, 
will make 2,600 companies eligible to be traded, Snuderl said. Those companies 
include some of Slovenia's biggest corporations, such as Krka, a 
pharmaceuticals company, and Emona, a hotel conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a stockholders' nation. Everybody's going to be a 
stockholder," said the smiling Snuderl. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock watchers, like Gavin Gray, former editor of Central European, a 
business monthly, remain cautious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would see the industrial structure becoming like Germany's," he said, "and 
that means that the bulk of the industrial structure comes from privately held 
companies, which is bad news for a stock exchange." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Slovenes are seemingly enthusiastic about a market that trades 
mostly municipal bonds and government and short-term securities. An upsurge in 
the market during the late summer spurred what exchange watchers fear may be 
false hopes that money can be made easily.  
</P>
<P>
 Exchange workers talk constantly about creating educational and promotional 
material, items that will explain stocks, securities and municipal bonds. "They 
(Slovenes) want to buy shares like apples in the market," said Vesna Likar, a 
trader with the Nika d.d. brokerage house. "But they don't know anything about 
what a share can offer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slovene television is also heightening interest in the market with extensive 
thrice-weekly reports on the trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders say television's spotlight is turning them into celebrities. Hermina 
Krt, 30, also a trader for the Nika brokerage house, said people on the street 
recognize her and stop to ask for investment advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for business," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, young Slovenes like Alain Al Soufi, a student, regularly show up at 
the exchange to watch the action and dream about the day they'll cross from the 
visitors box to the floor. The 23-year-old from Novo Mesto, about 40 miles 
south of Ljubljana, has already passed the needed exams and shyly swears he'll 
make money "in time."  
</P>
<P>
 "We're booked for visitor tours until May of next year," boasted Lidija 
Gabrijelcic, a public relations representative for the bourse.

PROFILE; DELHI'S NEW MASTER; FOR ONLY $32 A MONTH, MADAN LAL KHURANA IS TAKING 
ON THE CHAOS OF INDIA'S CAPITAL. WHY IS THIS MAN SMILING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 8 p.m., and a goodly part of the Indian capital's nearly 2 million cars, 
trucks, scooters, rickshaws and buses are still lurching homeward from one 
bottleneck to another, horns tooting shrilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bony cows amble through dim side streets, pausing to browse in fetid garbage 
piles. The chilly evening air is heavy with smog that grows so dense that 
landings and takeoffs from Indira Gandhi International Airport may have to be 
postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity blinks off as demand overwhelms supply. Shanties have sprung up 
around the modern telecommunications facilities at Nehru Place, and executives 
coming to work must pick their way through slum dwellers' excrement. 
</P>
<P>
 Delhi's public transportation is so dangerously dicey that more than 100 
people perished last year in bus accidents. The Yamuna river, a stream 
considered holy by Hindus, is a sewer by the time it flows past Delhi on its 
way to joining the equally sacred Ganges. 
</P>
<P>
 The question that comes to mind after a survey of the problems of India's 
capital -- "Is anybody in charge here?"  
</P>
<P>
 Meet Madan Lal Khurana, a former high-school economics teacher born in 
Pakistan and a garrulous lover of badminton and Hindi film romances, who swept 
last month into the new post of chief minister of this chaotic, troubled 
metropolis of more than 10 million souls. 
</P>
<P>
 It was long a truism of Indian life that "he who rules Delhi, rules India." 
And ruling India one day is the dream of Khurana and his party, the Hindu 
nationalist group called the Bharatiya Janata (Indian People's) Party.  
</P>
<P>
 But history also shows that Delhi has often served as the graveyard of the 
powerful, including the viceroys and sahibs of the now vanished British raj. It 
is a double-edged lesson for Khurana to ponder as he is ferried about in his 
Indian-built white Ambassador sedan with chase cars of policemen armed with 
automatics. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, he's smilingly confident. For taking on Delhi's headaches (and 
grabbing a prominent spot on India's political scene) Khurana, 57, will be paid 
a base salary of 1,000 rupees -- about $32 -- a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes no secret of his belief that he can so change things in Delhi that it 
will prove to Indians at large that the BJP is fit to govern their dazzlingly 
diverse country; that it is not simply a mouthpiece for disgruntled Hindus in 
the north who feel dispossessed in their own land. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delhi is a mini-India," Khurana, charming and raffishly elegant in a Nehru 
jacket of raw brown silk, declared over plates of sweets during an interview at 
his Delhi home. "There are people of all religions: Hindus, Muslims, Parsis, 
Christians, from all states. The majority are from outside Delhi. In Delhi, 
there is no casteism -- because this is a mini-India, no caste is dominant 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Khurana is "chief minister" in name only. The government decision 
that revived an elective assembly in India's capital after a hiatus of 37 years 
and gave the city a semblance of democratic rule leaves him -- at least for now 
-- with minimal powers, even less than those enjoyed by the mayor of 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 This remains the National Capital Territory of Delhi, and it is far from 
having attained true home rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means the federal government still governs Delhi," said Sunderao 
Narendra, principal officer of the Indian government's press information 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gov. Prasanabhai K. Dave, an appointee of India's president, still has 
full control over policy decisions, law and order, taxes, finance and the 
budget -- even over whether somebody's telephone is to be disconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who know Khurana and his abundant energy doubt things will remain so 
simple.  
</P>
<P>
 A postgraduate student of economics at the University of Allahabad, he was 
general secretary of India's students union for two years. Zeroing in on Delhi 
as a springboard for his political ambitions, he served as a city executive 
counselor and won election from the capital to two terms in the Lok Sabha, the 
lower house of India's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his victory at the polls in November, Khurana has been to see Prime 
Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, India's home minister and top police officials. 
"They have assured me that in practical purposes, they will obey my orders," 
Khurana said. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Dave has publicly reassured Khurana and his six-member Cabinet 
that he intends to consult them even about matters that legally are under his 
purview. Nevertheless, the prospects for conflict seem boundless. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Khurana and his party swept 49 of the 70 seats in Delhi's assembly in 
Nov. 6 elections (he took office Dec. 2), he has been going out of his way to 
show he isn't just another mantra-chanting BJP hothead. He has spoken of the 
need to ensure equal respect for all religions and allied himself in particular 
with Sikh concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of taking office, Khurana set up an advisory panel on how to 
bring to justice the instigators of the November, 1984, riots in Delhi in which 
more than 2,000 Sikhs were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers of the Indian political scene say Khurana is hardly all 
sweetness and light. "He's a bully," Hindustan Times columnist Khushwant Singh, 
a Sikh and one of his country's most famous newspapermen, said.  
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, BJP gangs combed South Delhi, Singh recalls, going from house 
to house hunting for Bangladeshi refugees who are mostly Muslim. Indian Muslim 
residents were terrified. "It was a sort of an 'ethnic cleansing' of the area," 
Singh said. "They were Khurana's gangs, and he went to the localities with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed about his own relations with the more than 1 million Muslims who dwell 
in Delhi, the normally effusive Khurana is vague. He won't even say whether he 
will follow a grand tradition of Indian politicos and hold a sumptuous 
reception at the end of the monthlong Muslim fast of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason may lie in his childhood: Like countless Hindu families who lived 
in Punjab, the Khuranas fled to India after Punjab was vivisected and Pakistan 
was created as a separate Muslim state. No one really knows how many Muslims, 
Hindus and Sikhs died in the bloodshed that accompanied the Indo-Pakistani 
partition. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other official Indian offices, Khurana's vast chamber at the Old 
Secretariat in downtown Delhi does not have a portrait of the emaciated and 
kindly face of Mohandas K. (Mahatma) Gandhi, the "Great Soul" of nonviolence 
and tolerance.  
</P>
<P>
 Khurana says that's simply the way the office was given to him. But Delhi's 
BJP-led assembly provoked a nationwide furor when its Speaker, Charti Lal Goel, 
said he did not consider Gandhi "the father of the nation." Hindu militants 
have long felt that Gandhi, slain in 1948 by a Hindu, was too conciliatory to 
Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Dilli Ki Awaz" -- the Voice of Delhi -- by admirers, Khurana vows that 
within a year his will be the most beautiful city in the world. He personally 
showed up to whitewash a section of curbstones to kick off a beautification 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Khurana says, all schools are to be furnished with drinking water, 
clean toilets and a dependable supply of electricity. "I can say that I will 
give the maximum results, although in some areas I have limited power," the 
chief minister promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Delhi's government set up a public complaint department on its first day of 
existence. Department heads are supposed to open their doors to the citizenry 
each day from noon to 1 p.m. Starting this month, top municipal officials will 
drive to neighborhoods throughout Delhi's 572 square miles, empowered to solve 
problems on the spot.  
</P>
<P>
 Khurana has announced a new tax system to give middle-class merchants a break 
and courted the votes of Delhi's most disadvantaged by announcing that existing 
shack cities built in violation of local codes will be provided with utilities 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's creating 'vote banks' for himself," Singh objects. "He's going to be 
part and parcel of making things worse." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say one thing to the people of Delhi: Next time when we face the 
people, we will ask them to vote on our performance," Khurana says. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief minister's most immediate problem looks like it will be finding 
enough water for his constituents to drink. He is already at war on this score 
with the neighboring state of Haryana, which lies upstream on the Yamuna. 
</P>
<P>
 Haryana, Khurana claims, provided Delhi an extra 50 million gallons of water a 
day during the summer in an unsuccessful attempt to get Khurana's archrivals 
from the Congress Party elected. 
</P>
<P>
 When the BJP won instead, Khurana says, Haryana's leaders simply turned the 
tap off. Biography

ENVIRONMENT; SOUTH AFRICANS MAKE WAVES OVER MINE PLAN; 300,000 HAVE SIGNED 
PETITIONS TO PROTECT WETLANDS, ENERGIZING THE NATION'S TINY 'GREEN' MOVEMENT.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The provincial parks board offers the following words of warning about some of 
the residents here in one of Africa's largest and most diverse estuaries.  
</P>
<P>
 In a pamphlet titled "How Not to Be Eaten by a Crocodile," for example, is 
this helpful hint: "Do NOT paddle, swim or play about in rivers or other areas 
where there are likely to be crocodiles."  
</P>
<P>
 And if confronted by a hippopotamus, be prepared to make "an instant 
decision." Either stand perfectly still or run as fast as you can. 
"Alternatively get up or behind a tree -- not a bush or a sapling, but a tree." 
Hippos, it turns out, kill more tourists in Africa than lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from hundreds of hippos and countless crocs, St. Lucia Park and Game 
Reserve is crowded with vast flocks of pelicans, flamingos, eagles and 483 
other species of birds. Most feed on fish -- some found nowhere else -- that 
teem in a shallow, 25-mile-long brackish lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Endangered black rhinos, leopards, wildebeests, zebras and other large game 
roam in rolling hills covered in acacia and thornbush. There are 47 species of 
frogs alone in the meandering rivers and swamps that drain into the Indian 
Ocean. The surf, in turn, crashes over a rich coral reef onto mile after mile 
of deserted golden sand beaches crowned by towering dunes, some hundreds of 
feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Lucia, about 150 miles north of Durban on South Africa's eastern coast, is 
one of the nation's largest, oldest and most popular conservation areas. It is 
even a candidate for designation by UNESCO as a World Heritage site, which 
guarantees international recognition and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the St. Lucia wetlands are also the focus of one of South Africa's biggest 
and most bitter environmental controversies. Over the last four years, more 
than 300,000 people have signed petitions to oppose plans by Richards Bay 
Minerals, a multinational mining company, to dig up about 10 miles of coastal 
dunes inside the park to extract titanium oxide slag, a material used in paints 
and other pigments. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute probably won't be settled until a new national government is 
elected in April and decides whether to issue a mining permit. But St. Lucia 
has already produced one obvious winner: It has energized the country's tiny 
environmental movement and sparked one of the first mass protests among South 
African whites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mining has been king here, and the environment has been way, way down the 
line," said David Lindley, conservation ecologist at the Wildlife Society of 
Southern Africa. He cites his group as an example: The Sierra Club clone has 
only 20,000 members -- but is South Africa's largest conservation group by far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are probably 20, 25 years behind the states and 15 years behind Europe as 
far as environmental law is concerned and as far as environmental opposition is 
concerned," Lindley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the furor over St. Lucia may change that, he said. "Never before has an 
environmental issue gotten so much public support. It has set a precedent for 
future environmental problems in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the precedent is a disaster, insists Barry N. Clements, a well-known 
conservationist and former park ranger who was hired by Richards Bay Minerals, 
or RBM, to repair what has become a public relations nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the greatest hoax that has ever been perpetrated in the history of 
conservation," Clements complained. He blamed "a green left wing who are 
opposed to any development whatsoever" and a mining company totally unused to 
considering public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "These headlines are normally used for world wars," he said with evident 
disgust as he pointed out some of the local media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In his view, environmentalists and reporters have misrepresented the facts. 
The 3,500 acres that RBM wants to mine are no "ecological wilderness," he said. 
More than half the area is covered by dense government-owned commercial pine 
forests that will be logged whether the dunes are mined or not, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is the rest of St. Lucia pristine. Early settlers slaughtered so much game 
that several species became extinct. Rivers have been diverted, swamps drained 
and dams built to make way for vast sugar cane and pine plantations. The lake 
is choking with topsoil from overgrazing and poor farming practices. Until 
recently, there was even a military missile testing range nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 So RBM wants to use massive floating dredgers to suck up 30 feet per day of 
coastal dunes for the next 17 years. After valuable minerals are extracted and 
pumped away in a buried pipeline, the company says, the sand will be spit back 
out so the dunes can be rebuilt, covered with topsoil and replanted.  
</P>
<P>
 Clements said most park visitors will "hardly know" a huge mining operation is 
under way and that the replanted dunes someday will appear identical to the 
natural ones. But he concedes that could take decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we can leave (the area) as good as it was," he said. "Mining 
is dirty, dangerous and destructive." 
</P>
<P>
 RBM, which is half owned by the South Africa-based Gencor and half by the 
London-based Rio Tinto Zinc, is the world's largest supplier of titanium slag. 
The company operates dredging and smelter plants for 42 miles up and down South 
Africa's Natal coast, processing 3,000 tons of sand an hour and producing 1 
million tons of slag a year.  
</P>
<P>
 And that's the problem: They are running out of sand to mine. Adding the St. 
Lucia dunes would add five years to the company's local reserves -- and 
hundreds of millions of dollars to company coffers and the country's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would find it lunacy not to mine here in a cash-strapped South Africa," 
Clements said angrily.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ricky Taylor, chief estuary ecologist with the Natal Parks Board, which 
administers the area, says St. Lucia "is priceless and irreplaceable," while 
titanium slag mining is neither. And he doesn't buy Clements' claim that the 
vegetated dunes, supposedly the world's highest, won't be damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no proof that the rehabilitation process would be 
successful," said Taylor, who has been a leader in the anti-mining fight. He 
laughs at Clements' claim that visitors won't see the mining. "You'll be able 
to see it from large portions of the lake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a lanky bearded man in shorts and knee socks, warns that the rest of 
Africa is watching to see how the continent's richest country regards its 
critical natural habitats. "If the precedent is set here for mining in 
conservation areas, the rest of Africa will follow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the odds appear to be against the company. After months of often 
acrimonious hearings, a five-member official review panel unanimously voted in 
December to recommend that the government reject the mining license. The 
recommendation is not binding, but it does carry considerable weight.  
</P>
<P>
 "Because of its special value, St. Lucia is too precious to risk," the 
142-page report said. The mining, it added, "would cause unacceptable damage to 
a place which is special because of its rich history, ecology and biological 
diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel also recommended that the government help St. Lucia's original 
inhabitants. Several thousand subsistence farmers once lived on the narrow 
strip of land that separates the huge lake from the open ocean. But over the 
decades, the white government forcibly evicted these black residents, with 
little or no compensation, to create the game reserve and pine plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is no restitution for what the original inhabitants lost because of 
apartheid, St. Lucia would effectively be a special place for only the elite to 
enjoy," the report said. But it rejected a suggestion that the displaced 
families be returned to the area.

 Their lives are not what they could be. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the world's progress in providing education and health care to children 
has been greater during the last 50 years than in the previous 2,000, says a 
recently released U.N. report. But that progress falls short of technology's 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, immunizations could eradicate most childhood scourges, such as 
polio, measles and diphtheria. But millions of children are not immunized. 
Poverty also exacts a toll. Malnutrition stunts the body and mind of one in 
three children living outside industrialized nations, says the report, "The 
State of the World's Children 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the state of health and education among the young varies widely 
region to region. Malnutrition 
</P>
<P>
 Malnutrition is a factor in one-third of the annual 13 million deaths of 
children under 5 years old. It is the most damaging in the mother's last 
trimester of pregnancy and in the first year after birth, when brain 
development is nearing completion and the immune system is weak. Poorly 
nourished mothers tend to give birth to underweight, malnourished babies.

other skills. There have been greater gains here, but disparities persist by

 Infant mortality has dropped, often dramatically, throughout the world. 
Immunizations and the technique of oral rehydration (continuously providing

CULTURE; GURKHA SOLDIERS LOSING BATTLE AGAINST EXTINCTION; FAMED FOR THEIR 
CURVED KNIVES AND DO-OR-DIE SPIRIT, THEY ARE BOWING TO BUDGET CUTS AND NEW 
TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MAGGIE FARLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lance Cpl. H.K. Ghale, a Gurkha soldier, runs his fingertips along the edge of 
a long, curved sword and explains the art of decapitation. "It must be done in 
one clean stroke," he says. "Only a few people can still do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gurkhas used to bring this skill to war, but Ghale says that he would rather 
use a gun. As for decapitation, "I can only do a chicken," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Ghale may be part of the last generation of some of the world's most 
legendary fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gurkha fighting men of Nepal are a colorful legacy of Britain's colonial 
era -- soldiers whose predecessors fought in battles from Gallipoli to the 
Falklands. While the British army still makes annual recruiting trips into the 
Himalayan hills to help fill out its ranks, the Gurkhas' old-fashioned martial 
talents may soon be outpaced by modern technology and reduced military budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittled away by the empire's decline, the British army is scaling down. In 
1997, Britain will return one of its last colonies -- Hong Kong -- to China, 
and the Gurkhas stationed there will move to Britain, their numbers reduced 
from 5,000 to 2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the end of an era," says British army spokesman Arthur Murray. "You saw 
the technology used in the Gulf War. There's less of a place for the Gurkhas in 
modern warfare." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent autumn day in Hong Kong, machine-gun-toting Gurkhas crawled 
through the brush during a mock battle. Four British bankers who wandered into 
the war games during a country walk were taken prisoner and interrogated as 
"spies." 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the exercises, Murray poked a few holes in the Gurkha myth. "They 
take twice as long to train as the average British soldier," he said. "They 
can't march -- they don't high-step, they sort of shuffle. They hate water, and 
of course you have to teach them English." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, raised on the terraced slopes of the world's mightiest mountains, the 
Gurkhas have an age-old reputation as invincible fighters. Their motto: "It's 
better to die than be a coward." 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're ready to go into battle, their eyes turn red," says an old 
veteran, Capt. T. B. Gurung, reciting an oft-told legend. "Then they keep 
coming. They can never be stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The British discovered the Gurkhas' ferocity the hard way, in a war in 1814 
over territory in northern India, not far from here. The British outnumbered 
the Gurkhas and won, but they were so impressed by their foes' fighting spirit 
that they later incorporated four battalions of Nepalese soldiers into 
Britain's East India Co. army. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1815, the Gurkhas have fought alongside the British in colonial 
conflicts and world wars. In World War II, 250,000 Gurkhas -- nearly every man 
of fighting age in Nepal -- joined the British Gurkha regiments fighting in 
Burma and Italy. Almost 10% of them were killed, but they received more 
Victoria Crosses -- the award for extraordinary valor -- tahan any other 
regiment. The Gurkhas also participated in the Persian Gulf War and in U.N. 
peacekeeping efforts in Cyprus. 
</P>
<P>
 Nepal's young men still compete to join the Gurkha ranks -- the one job in 
this developing country that promises a decent living and a place in local 
lore. Recruiting to fill 153 vacancies ended in November; about 45,000 hopefuls 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Cpl. Ghale says late-night stories of a relative, Havildar Gaje Ghale, 
one of Nepal's 26 Victoria Cross winners, inspired him to join. While fighting 
against the Japanese in Burma in World War II, Ghale was wounded in the arms, 
chest and leg by a grenade, but he went on to kill several enemy soldiers in 
hand-to-hand combat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleet Street gushed over his accomplishments. "Hurling hand grenades, covered 
in blood from his own neglected wounds, he led assault after assault, 
encouraging his platoon by shouting the Gurkha's battle cry," the now-defunct 
London Gazette reported in 1943. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts like this inevitably grow and are woven into myths of Gurkha courage, 
passed from village to village in Nepal and beyond. In the Falklands conflict, 
when the news came that a battalion of Gurkhas was on the way to cut heads, 
many Argentines reportedly surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the tales is the kukri -- the razor-sharp curved knife every Gurkha 
keeps tucked in his belt. It doubles as a lethal boomerang.  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Col. Paul Gilham, chief of staff in Katmandu, recalls the legend of the 
Gurkha who lashed out at an enemy with his kukri.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hah! You missed," the enemy soldier exults. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you sure?" the Gurkha asks. And as the soldier begins to nod his assent, 
his head falls off. 
</P>
<P>
 The legends of the Gurkhas are reinforced during a recruiting season each 
year, when former soldiers go up into the hills to cull the first batch of 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very difficult job," says Color Sgt. Sing Rab Gurung, who directed 
hill selection in villages in central Nepal for four years. "I needed 10 
recruits; 1,000 came." Gurung says the physical requirements help with the 
winnowing. Nepalese are tough but small, and those who don't stand the minimum 
5 feet 3 inches, weigh at least 115 pounds or puff out their chests to 33 
inches or more are immediately sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest are stripped to their shorts and marked with a number on their 
chests. Some recruiters mark the boys with secret symbols to keep track of 
their merits and faults and to heighten the tension and mystery of the 
proceedings. Then come extensive physical and mental exams and strenuous 
competitions -- running up a mountainside, for example, carrying 125 pounds of 
rocks on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they already pass the physical test, then I select on my own general 
knowledge," says Gurung. "When I was in the army, I knew what it took to be a 
good soldier. I can look in his eyes and know if he can fight."  
</P>
<P>
 The final, roughly 150 chosen candidates spend another few months learning how 
to march and bulking up on spicy Gurkha stew and goat meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gurkhas are trying to modernize along with the rest of the British army. 
Ghale and his peers may not be able to behead an enemy with one stroke, but 
some of them have learned to operate satellites and computers. They also bring 
those skills, as well as their pension money, back to Nepal after they retire. 
Gurkha-connected income is Nepal's fourth-largest source of foreign exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Some worry that the Gurkhas may be losing their unique skills. Capt. T. B. 
Gurung, 65, helped repress the Communist insurgency in Malaya during the 1950s 
and fought in Borneo. Now he runs a lodge for trekkers at the base of 
Annapurna, one of the world's tallest mountains. His small inn boasts tidy rows 
of marigolds and "24-hour hot running showers." A former hill recruiter, he 
thinks today's soldiers aren't as good as his comrades in old times. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my time, we fought very well in a very difficult war. We went blindly 
through the jungle, and there were many snakes and elephants and tigers," he 
says. "Nowadays, there's a very good salary, very good accommodation, but the 
soldiers are not so good." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Gurkhas retain enough of their martial mystique to keep them in high 
demand after they leave the British forces. The latest fashion in 
status-conscious Hong Kong is to have a Gurkha bodyguard. Some former soldiers 
are guarding diamond mines in South Africa and protecting embassies in the 
Middle East. The Sultan of Brunei has his own personal battalion. Most, though, 
return to Nepal with their medals and their memories and, with the help of 
British army resettlement programs, try for a second career. Whole villages of 
ex-Gurkhas have sprouted on the mountainsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandfather was a soldier. My father was a soldier. Of course I am a 
soldier, " says Ghale, looking at his kukri. "I don't have a son yet, but I 
don't think he'll have the chance."

POSTSCRIPT; POST-MORTEM FAME CATCHES UP WITH LATIN AMERICAN WRITER; A NEW 
EDITION OF A VOLUME OF ESSAYS BY JORGE LUIS BORGES IS CLIMBING THE BEST-SELLER 
LISTS.

<P>
 "The Size of My Hope," a small volume of essays published in 1926, soon 
disappeared from bookstores and seemed destined for oblivion. After a few 
decades, only a few specialized scholars showed any interest in the book; the 
author himself disowned it. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 67 years, a new edition of "The Size of My Hope" came out last 
November with a flurry of critical fanfare and soon began climbing best-seller 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's revival is one sign -- among many -- of renewed interest in Jorge 
Luis Borges, whose stature as one of Latin America's great writers has 
increased and solidified since he died in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He never wrote a novel, and his short stories and poetry received sparse 
international attention until the 1970s. Although he was a perennial candidate 
in his latter years for the Nobel Prize, he never won it. 
</P>
<P>
 But his stories, precise gems of compressed creativity, are now widely 
regarded as incomparable classics. Many of the best ones use fantastic vehicles 
-- a man who remembers every moment of his life, a secret society that writes a 
vast encyclopedia about an imaginary planet -- to explore metaphysical and 
philosophical themes in a limpid, authoritative style. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me he's right up there in the top ranks with Garcia Marquez and Milan 
Kundera," said Kathryn Court, editor in chief of the Penguin U.S.A. book 
publishing company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from New York, Court said Penguin and its subsidiary 
Viking plan a major re-edition in English of Borges' works, starting with a 
complete collection of his short fiction in fall, 1995, followed by his 
complete poems and a selection of essays and prose. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Borges' work has been published previously in the United States by 
Dutton, now a subsidiary of Penguin. Court said the planned books will give 
American readers better access than ever to a major writer who has been 
"under-published" in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the work will be retranslated for the project. Bonifacio del Carril, 
an Argentine publisher, said previous English versions were not always faithful 
to the original Spanish because the author himself helped with the translation 
and probably tended to "give a new version." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Carril's Emece Editores has been Borges' main publisher in Argentina. 
Emece is bringing out new editions of at least 15 Borges books in colorfully 
illustrated paperbacks. When Borges was alive, he preferred his books 
unillustrated, with plain covers. 
</P>
<P>
 Borges' most popular books are short-story collections titled "The Aleph," 
with about 300,000 copies sold in Argentina through the years, and "Ficciones," 
with about 225,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a short-story writer to attain those figures is formidable," Del Carril 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Carril characterized Borges' appeal as more intellectual than popular, 
which may have had something to do with his failure to win the Nobel. Or 
perhaps it was politics. Borges sometimes stirred up trouble with sharp-tongued 
statements "that went against the current," including criticism of a literary 
colleague or praise for a military dictatorship, Del Carril recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, "The Size of My Hope" (El Tamano de Mi Esperanza) was one work 
that Borges apparently considered insignificant, so Emece never brought out a 
new edition, Del Carril said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maria Kodama, Borges' widow, decided to print a new edition last year with 
another publishing house, the Argentine subsidiary of Spain's Seix Barral. In a 
foreword to the collection, Kodama tells how Borges once denied that the book 
existed. 
</P>
<P>
 Written when he was a young man, "The Size of My Hope" explores themes -- such 
as the infinite potential of language and the inspiring vastness of the 
Argentine pampas -- that Borges would elaborate on throughout his career. But 
it also included colloquial language and sentimentality. Borges, "in his 
pursuit of perfection, was unfair to this book of his youth," writes Kodama in 
the foreword. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama also has signed a contract with Seix Barral and its Argentine sister 
publisher, Espasa Calpe, to publish a huge "critical edition" of Borges' 
complete works. It would include previously unpublished articles, 
correspondence and other writings by Borges. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Carril of Emece declined to discuss the project, but he hinted that his 
company was questioning Espasa Calpe/Seix Barral's right to works that are 
published by Emece. "It is a question in which there are lawyers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Schavelzon, general director of Espasa Calpe/Seix Barral, said his 
company sees no complications in its right to publish the critical edition 
because "50% of the material is very different" from what Emece has published. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the publishing contract is with Kodama. Borges' longtime assistant, 
she married him only months before he died but later won a legal dispute with 
other relatives over his estate. Borges had no children. 
</P>
<P>
 Kordama said the critical edition will be mainly of interest to scholars. 
"It's another kind of work that has nothing to do with what Emece has 
published," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All the interest in Borges keeps Kodama busy. Besides the business of 
publishing his works, she often is asked to meet Borges scholars and admirers, 
make speeches, attend ceremonies and give interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent day, she met with local government officials to talk about plans 
for building and landscaping a labyrinthine park designed especially for the 
blind. Borges was blind in his last years, and the labyrinth was a frequent 
metaphor in his stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Kodama also spent time that day working on plans for remodeling a house as the 
new headquarters of the 5-year-old Jorge Borges Foundation, which she heads. It 
will include a memorial museum and library. "We are growing," she said.

 HOMEBUYING EASIER: Despite all the talk about plunging real estate prices, 
Ventura County remains one of the least affordable areas for home buyers (D2). 
. . . But things are looking up: Two years ago, only four urban areas 
nationwide were less affordable than Ventura County. Now, it's 18th from the 
bottom, out of 188 areas studied. A median-income family would be able to buy 
51.7% of homes sold in recent months, up from 15.4%. . . . "A lot of people who 
couldn't qualify in the past don't realize things have changed," said Bob 
Edward, president of the Oxnard-Harbor Assn. of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 LIBRARY FUND: Since the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library opened outside Simi 
Valley in 1991, admirers of the former President have been debating what to do 
next. Now they've announced plans to raise $20 million for exhibits and 
conferences at the library's Center for Public Affairs (B4). . . . Republican 
contributors may face a tough decision on which ex-President to honor: On Jan. 
20, the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda will announce plans 
for a Center for Peace and Freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 BACK TO SCHOOL: After a 12% drop in fall enrollment, Ventura County community 
colleges added more than 80 classes to spring schedules to lure students back. 
The strategy seems to be working (B1). . . . It better succeed: If spring 
enrollment declines too much, the district could lose $1 million. . . . Classes 
start Jan. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 TWIN DEMAND: The story of Donald Anderson -- the Ventura man who did three 
jail stints and military duty for his twin brother, Ronald -- just might become 
a movie of the week. Donald Anderson has been deluged with calls from producers 
and talk-show hosts since the twins' history of switching places came out last 
week. . . . "If it were both of us, we could do two shows at once," he said. . 
. Brother Ronald, however, is serving a 14-year prison sentence, which for 
Donald takes some of the thrill out of their newfound notoriety. "All this fame 
and fortune, we should be sharing it together."

D.A.'S MOTIVE IN SEEKING DEATH PENALTY QUESTIONED; CRIME: LAWYERS FOR MAN 
ACCUSED OF KILLING A NURSE CITE THE TIMING OF BRADBURY'S DECISION IN ALLEGING 
THAT HE IS DOING IT FOR POLITICAL GAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for a 19-year-old Thousand Oaks man facing the death penalty charged 
Monday that Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury appears to be 
seeking the maximum sentence in the case for his own political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers noted that Bradbury's decision to pursue a death-penalty 
conviction against Mark Scott Thornton came one day after the district attorney 
went public with his reelection plans. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors strongly denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin J. McGee said the decision in the 
Thornton case was delayed for several weeks because defense attorneys needed 
more time to provide Bradbury with information on why their client should not 
face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's regrettable that they feel the decision has political overtones to it," 
McGee said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the defense attorneys had not requested the extra time, McGee said, the 
decision in the Thornton case would have been made in December -- or way before 
Bradbury made known his reelection intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 After entering not-guilty pleas to a 14-count indictment against Thornton on 
Monday, the defense attorneys also said outside the courtroom that Bradbury 
appears to be trying to capitalize on the public's heightened fear of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defenders Howard J. Asher and Susan R. Olsen said many Ventura 
County residents have become more afraid of crime in the aftermath of a deadly 
December shooting spree by a chronically unemployed man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to prosecute aggressively. It's another thing when a district 
attorney has sole discretion (whether to seek the death penalty) and abuses 
that discretion," Asher said. "A significant portion of the community thinks 
that seeking the death penalty means getting tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury was en route to Sacramento for a statewide prosecutors' conference 
and unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGee said it was coincidental that the decision to seek the death penalty 
against Thornton came a day after Bradbury's reelection announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 He said prosecutors had planned to decide the matter earlier, but the defense 
team's request for a delay put it off by several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton kidnaped and fatally shot Westlake nurse Kellie 
O'Sullivan, the mother of a young son, on Sept. 14. Her body was found in the 
Santa Monica Mountains 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was arrested in Reno on Sept. 19. He was in possession of 
O'Sullivan's car. Thornton has admitted to police that he stole the car and 
used it to abduct his ex-girlfriend, who he then drove to Reno. But Thornton 
has denied killing O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors announced their death-penalty decision in the case on Jan. 5, the 
day after Bradbury announced he would seek a fifth term as district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In his reelection announcement, Bradbury issued a statement that said crime 
will continue to increase at "an alarming rate" in the 1990s. "I want to 
continue to send the strong message that criminal activity will not be 
tolerated in Ventura County," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Monday that they traditionally make a decision on 
death-penalty cases shortly before a defendant is arraigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the two events are related," Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. 
Kossoris, who is trying the case, told reporters after the arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asher and Olsen said they suspect just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys said the crimes for which Thornton are charged do not 
compare with the deeds of the seven other men from the county who are on Death 
Row. Those defendants were convicted of either multiple murders, having 
committed murder more than once, murder during a sexual assault or murder that 
involved the torture of a child, Asher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark Thornton's case, while tragic, doesn't fall into any of those 
categories," Asher said. "Mark Thornton's criminal history does not hold a 
candle" to the others. Thornton has twice been convicted of burglary -- once as 
a juvenile and once as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys also said they will ask that Thornton's trial be moved from the 
county because of heavy publicity surrounding the case. Superior Court Judge 
Charles R. McGrath said he would hear the motion for a change of venue on June. 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath set an Aug. 1 trial date. The trial is expect to last about four 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's decision to seek the death penalty in the case 
effectively ends any chance of a plea bargain in the case, defense attorneys 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to negotiate when someone is seeking the death penalty," Asher 
said.

COUNTY DELIVERS AN URGENT PLEA FOR BLOOD DONATIONS; HEALTH: SUPPLIES ARE SO LOW 
THAT ELECTIVE SURGERIES COULD BE CANCELED, OFFICIALS WARN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Rows of empty shelves have prompted Ventura County health officials to issue 
an urgent call for blood donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at United Blood Services, the nonprofit agency that delivers blood 
to medical centers across the county, said Monday that supplies are so low that 
elective surgeries may be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't have enough blood on the shelves," said Patricia Hunt, who 
coordinates blood deliveries from United. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running to take blood from one hospital to another, and then running 
back to fill the first hospital from the blood coming out of the lab that day," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt said her agency needs 100 or more pint-sized donations each day just to 
stay even with the demand in Ventura County. However, she said, the blood bank 
is already more than 300 pints below normal reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood-supply center fell even further behind on Monday, drawing just 90 
donations from its offices and bloodmobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't generate support from the community and the donors, the next step 
is to start canceling elective surgeries," said Hunt, who predicted that such a 
move is only weeks away if the slump continues. 
</P>
<P>
 A post-holiday shortage is not unexpected, officials said. But so far this 
month there have been even fewer donors than in winters past. 
</P>
<P>
 "January is a notoriously high usage month, because people typically put their 
surgeries off until after the holidays, " said Carolyn Tyner, associate 
executive director at United Blood Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of illness or over-drinking by donors, the number of unfit donors and 
unusable donations also rises this time of year, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a woman in today who wanted to donate, but she had a small cough," 
Tyner said. "I had to send her away." 
</P>
<P>
 The would-be donor, Judy Johnson of Oxnard, said she would return to donate 
blood as soon as she was over her cold. "I am a rare blood-type, and there is a 
need," said Johnson, an A-negative. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Blood Services' call Monday echoed a similar plea by American Red 
Cross officials, who said last week that supplies were lower than expected 
across the country. The Red Cross collects and delivers roughly half of the 
blood supply in the United States, although not in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura auto mechanic Randy Gaumond heard about the shortage over the weekend. 
First thing Monday, he was at the United Blood Services office in Ventura with 
his shirt sleeve rolled up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friend's dad needed blood for an operation back when I was 18," said 
Gaumond, 38. "I've been doing it ever since. I've probably given away several 
gallons by now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital administrators said Monday the low blood supply was a concern, but it 
had not yet hurt medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is really bad," said Daniel Zia, the blood bank supervisor at Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Zia said, Los Robles on Monday had just four units of O-negative 
blood on its shelves -- less than half the normal reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every inventory they are below their par level," Zia said. "Even though 
they are able to supply us, if we have a bleeder, they'll use up all of their 
reserves." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 United Blood Services has offices in Thousand Oaks, Simi Valley and Ventura as 
well as a roving bloodmobile. To donate blood, call 654-8104. Donors face no 
health risk because every instrument used is disposable, officials said. The 
donated blood is put through an extensive series of tests to make sure it is 
safe for the recipient.

FUND DRIVE TO PROVIDE NEW EXHIBITS FOR REAGAN SITE; FOUNDATION: THE CAMPAIGN TO 
RAISE $20 MILLION FOR LIBRARY PROJECTS WILL BE CO-CHAIRED BY THE FORMER 
PRESIDENT'S WIFE AND MALCOLM S. FORBES JR. OF FORBES INC.

<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation on Monday announced a $20-million 
fund-raising drive to help pay for new exhibits at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library and planned conferences at the library's Center for Public 
Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legacy Campaign will reach out to the 40,000 people nationwide who have 
already donated to the 8-year-old foundation and will also seek funds from 
corporations and other potential donors, Reagan associates said. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign also calls for creation of a local "friends of the library" group 
to lead a grass-roots fund-raising effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an endowment that is specially designed to create certain kinds of 
programs that will be public-oriented as much as possible," said Richard Norton 
Smith, director of the foundation and Center for Public Affairs. "We do not 
want to create an ivory tower here, and I have always believed that it is 
possible to create programs that combine intellectual substance and popular 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 At Reagan's request, the campaign will be co-chaired by his wife Nancy and 
Malcolm S. (Steve) Forbes Jr., chief executive officer of Forbes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that Steve and Nancy have accepted this important challenge 
for the foundation," Reagan said in a prepared statement. "It is my hope that 
the library and museum will examine the past, weigh the present and play an 
important role in shaping the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Reagan foundation raised $60 million to build the 153,000-square-foot 
library and museum on a hilltop overlooking Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, the Reagan foundation turned over most of the library to 
the National Archives and Records Administration, which is responsible for the 
storehouse of presidential documents accumulated during Reagan's eight years in 
the White House. The federal agency also operates the museum and exhibits at 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hands are tied by our limited funds," library spokeswoman Stefanie Salata 
said. "So we're thrilled to have them step in and help us do what we want to do 
badly, which is put on more programs and exhibits." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, Reagan's private, nonprofit foundation has focused on 
establishing the library, Smith said. It has been only in the past year or so 
that the group has looked to the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to get one chapter behind them in terms of building the building 
and paying for the building before they could begin the next chapter," Smith 
said. "Basically, the last year has been spent in a kind of internal debate 
over what we want to be, what next?" 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the foundation has planned a number of special events and conferences 
in the coming year that Smith said will help establish the library and Center 
for Public Affairs as a tourist and cultural destination with broad appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 28, noted author and syndicated columnist George Will is scheduled to 
appear at the library to inaugurate a new speakers' series known as The Reagan 
Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, former Secretary of State George Shultz will be the keynote speaker 
at a seminar titled "The Perils of Democracy." The program will focus on the 
transition to democracy in the nations of the former Soviet Union and Eastern 
Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The library in November will open another major exhibit: "World War II: 
Personal Accounts," featuring an extensive collection of historic memorabilia, 
much of it never before displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said other changes planned at the library include a remodeling of the 
popular Oval Office display so visitors can enter the room and hear Reagan's 
tape-recorded recollections on working in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials are also considering a project that would add a replica of 
the Geneva boathouse, where Reagan and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev 
had their historic arms-reduction summit in November, 1985. Smith said he hoped 
the exhibit would open in time for the 10-year anniversary of the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we want the Reagan library and museum and Center for Public 
Affairs working together to become the finest institution of its kind in 
existence," Smith said. "That means becoming a major cultural, educational and 
historical resource to the people of Southern California."

LONG COLLEGE SIGN-UP LINES RETURN TO 2 AREA SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: AFTER A FALL 
WHEN ENROLLMENT DROPPED 12%, DISTRICT OFFICIALS ARE PROJECTING SPRING 
REGISTRATION THAT MATCHES OR EVEN SURPASSES THAT OF SPRING, 1993.

 Registration lines snaked around buildings Monday at Oxnard and Ventura 
colleges, leaving a visible testament to official projections that the 
enrollment decline is slowing in the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fall semester when class enrollment dropped by 12% contrasted with the 
previous year, district officials are projecting a spring enrollment that 
matches or even surpasses that of spring, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," said Jeff Marsee, the district's vice chancellor for 
administrative services. "I think we're stopping the decline." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials launched a countywide advertising campaign last fall to 
entice students back to Moorpark, Oxnard and Ventura colleges after higher fees 
and a reduced selection of classes sent registration numbers plunging. So far, 
the effort seems to be working. 
</P>
<P>
 With mail-in registration completed, the number of classes students have 
signed up for is down only 1.8% from last spring, though the actual number of 
students enrolling is down 4.4%, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The class enrollment figure is the one officials worry most about because it 
determines state funding. At this point last fall, class enrollment numbers 
were already down about 5%, Marsee said.

 Community college enrollment fell across the state this fall as student fees 
rose from $10 per unit to $13. District officials say they hope they will not 
lose state money, despite the colleges' enrollment decline, because so many 
other districts have lost students as well this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In-person registration began Monday at Ventura and Oxnard colleges, and starts 
Wednesday at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Students registering at Oxnard and Ventura colleges Monday said they resent 
last fall's fee increase and are angered by Gov. Pete Wilson's proposal Friday 
to raise fees even further next fall, to $20 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fees are too much already," said David Dalton, 18, registering at Oxnard 
College. "If they raise them further, I can kiss my college education goodby." 
</P>
<P>
 Marisa Bentley, 18, beginning her second semester at Ventura College, was 
outraged at the mere idea of another fee increase. "That's terrible," she said. 
"Here I am, trying to get an education without asking my parents for help, and 
this will just make it take longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students at both colleges said the classes they wanted were still open on 
the first day of registration, though a few registering at Oxnard College were 
disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawuntiel Johnson, for instance, found that the one math class she had hoped 
to take at Oxnard College was already closed by Monday afternoon. "Well, I'm 
going to sign up at Ventura College tomorrow," said Johnson, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning students, many of whom have followed the faculty's battle for higher 
salaries, said they hope their spring classes are not interrupted by a strike. 
Some faculty members have threatened to walk off the job if their contract 
negotiations remain stalled, as they have been for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be mad" if teachers strike, said Dennis Witzke, 27, a sailor with the 
Navy who will finish his degree work at Ventura College this spring. "I've 
already had to cancel a few semesters because the military sent me away. I'd be 
really bummed." 
</P>
<P>
 Many first-time students, however, were unaware of the issue and just were 
excited to be on a college campus registering for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm nervous," conceded David Hickok, 34, returning to school for the first 
time since high school graduation. Hickok, a tool-and-dye maker, registered for 
one class in mechanical blueprint reading at Ventura College. He chose the 
class because he already knows the subject and thought it would be a good way 
to ease back into academics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make my job a little better, make more money, move on," he said. 
"I'm coming here hopefully to have a better future."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CREWS REPORT TO NEW MUNICIPAL SERVICE 
YARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' street maintenance, landscaping and water crews reported to 
work Monday at the new municipal service yard, a $4.3-million complex that 
replaces an aged, inefficient facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to the new service yard, on a 10-acre lot at the end of Rancho Conejo 
Boulevard, comes just as the city is merging the public works and utilities 
departments under the direction of Donald Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 170 employees who work out of the service yard belong to one of 
the two departments. They use the yard as a home base for maintenance, repair 
and other field work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfect timing," said Mel Henson, a superintendent at the service yard. 
"It's all coming together at once. I think we will be a more efficient 
operation once we get past the transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks' new service yard features an emergency power generator, a 
single warehouse for both the utilities and public works departments, a 
leak-proof storage site for hazardous waste and a more-secure parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an opportunity here to design a facility looking forward to our 
needs over the next 15 to 20 years," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-tech features includes an eight-pump natural gas fueling station -- 
moved to the new yard from the DeHavilland Drive site -- to serve the city's 
five clean-burning pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 By September, when the city is due to receive two more trucks and four 
Thousand Oaks Transit buses that run on natural gas, the fueling station will 
be upgraded, said Robert Miller, fleet services supervisor. The new technology 
will allow staff members to fuel the natural-gas vehicles in five minutes, 
instead of leaving them plugged into the fueling stations overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen, the massive biotechnology firm, gave the city land for the new service 
yard and paid $3.1 million toward construction. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Amgen took over the old municipal service center, situated near 
the firm's main campus on DeHavilland Drive. Amgen plans to build new research 
facilities, office space and parking structures on that land and other nearby 
parcels. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; DETAILS OFFERED ON SEX EDUCATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents on Monday night got their first chance to hear details 
of a controversial plan to add birth control information to sex education 
curriculum in city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of two evening information-only meetings was held at Sequoia Junior 
High School to give residents the chance to ask questions about the sex 
education recommendations issued in December by a committee that studied the 
issue over three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Burke, a parent and registered nurse, asked committee members if they 
reviewed studies showing that sex education decreases teen-age pregnancies. 
Burke said she is aware of studies that only show an increase in teen-age 
sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are studies on both sides of the issue," said Leslie Crunelle, director 
of secondary education who lead the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee member Marge Chamberlain added, "We looked at the needs of the 
students, not the studies." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of community members on both sides of the debate had an opportunity 
to voice their opinions to board members of the Simi Valley Unified School 
District on Dec. 14 when the committee's report first was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 22, the school board will again listen to public testimony before 
voting on the proposal to add birth control information to the curriculum in 
seventh and 10th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to adding birth control information, the committee recommended 
expanding lessons on overcoming peer pressure to have sex and practicing 
abstinence to avoid disease and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The second informational meeting is set for Jan. 20 at 6:30 p.m. at Berylwood 
Elementary School. Officials stressed that the Jan. 20 meeting is designed to 
inform the community about the proposal and is not set up to take public views.

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Concilio del Condado de Ventura will honor four Ventura County Latino 
leaders and a Latino band for outstanding contribution in the areas of cultural 
arts, business, youth, education and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The honorees, selected by the Oxnard-based Latino advocacy group from among 30 
nominations, are Gabino Aguirre of Santa Paula, Mary L. Barreto of Oxnard, 
Rodney E. Fernandez of Santa Paula, Jesus (Chuy) Reyes Rangel of Fillmore, and 
an Oxnard-based musical group called the Conjunto Hueyapan. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, 46, principal of Moorpark Community School, was chosen for his 
community work with youths in Our Town, an organization that helps youths 
develop a positive image of themselves and improve their lives in the 
community, El Concilio officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barreto, 58, a licensed counselor who serves on the board of trustees for the 
Oxnard School District, was selected for her outstanding work in education, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, 48, executive director of the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., 
was chosen for his contribution in business. He has played a pivotal role in 
creating affordable housing for several hundred farm workers in Ventura County, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel, 22, an activist and art student at Moorpark College who is considered 
a role model for youths, was selected for his volunteer work teaching art to 
"at-risk" youths and for being a leader in several youth organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate Latino cultural arts, the Conjunto Hueyapan, which performs 
Mexican folk music, was chosen for promoting Latino culture. The group has 
played all over the world, including at the Inaugural Gala for President Ronald 
Reagan in Washington, and in the International Harp Festival in Paris.  
</P>
<P>
 The recipients will receive the awards at a dinner Jan. 28 at the Doubletree 
Hotel in Ventura. Residents interested in attending the dinner should call 
983-2336 for reservations. The cost is $35 per person. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PERMANENT OFFSHORE OIL, GAS BAN SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria) has introduced 
legislation that seeks to create a permanent ban on offshore oil and gas 
development in California waters. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved as submitted, Assembly Bill 2444 would make permanent an already 
existing oil and gas leasing moratorium that is set to expire in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Under O'Connell's proposal, oil leases in existence before the Legislature 
issued its temporary moratorium in 1991 would still be allowed to be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 State Lands Commission officials said there are 79 oil and gas leases in an 
estimated 106,000 acres of water. If no additional leases are developed, about 
2.8 million acres would be protected by the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people believe the only way to prevent these kinds of environmental 
disasters is to prevent oil development in sensitive waters altogether," 
O'Connell said. "Our society needs oil, but it should not be produced at the 
expense of our coastal development and quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 But Terry Covington, a spokeswoman for the Western States Petroleum Assn., 
said O'Connell's bill would further the country's dependence on imported crude 
oil, among other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our consumption of oil is not dropping," Covington said. "Every barrel of oil 
that's not produced in California is supporting some other state or country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's more, at a time when the state economy is in a downturn, the bill 
would shut off new oil and gas royalties to the state and limit the number of 
jobs that could be opened." 
</P>
<P>
 Covington added that the state's offshore oil and gas companies have had an 
excellent safety record since Unocal's 1969 platform blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 That blowout spilled millions of gallons of crude oil on beaches throughout 
the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which was introduced by O'Connell on Jan. 4, would cover oil and gas 
leases in state waters, which run from the mean high tide line to three miles 
out. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HEARING TO ADDRESS HEALTH CLINIC PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County officials will accept public testimony today on a plan to buy a 
building owned by Texaco for the new home of the west Ventura public health 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed two weeks ago to tentatively move forward with 
plans to purchase the building at 133 W. Santa Clara St., but decided to hold 
another public hearing on the matter today. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is set to begin at 10 a.m in the board hearing room at the County 
Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 County Public Works Director Arthur Goulet said the county intends to purchase 
the site for $1.3 million if Texaco removes asbestos ceiling tiles and cleans 
up soil contamination from underground fuel tanks. As of Monday, an agreement 
on the cleanup had not been reached, Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still waiting to hear from Texaco to whether they will accept our 
offer," Goulet said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent public hearing on the proposal, several community leaders and the 
county's doctor in charge of emergency services urged the supervisors to 
purchase the building, saying the clinic would be a cornerstone of health 
services for the poor in west Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Ventura Family Care Clinic is now run from cramped quarters at 110 N. 
Olive St., Ventura. TINA DAUNT

 A stretch of Harbor Boulevard near Oxnard that has been closed for six hours a 
day since an oil spill on Christmas Day should reopen Wednesday as cleanup of 
the contamination ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Hatch, a spokesman for Bush Oil Co., which is responsible for the spill, 
said crews will continue to work this week at McGrath Lake, where 84,000 
gallons of oil leaked from a pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Christmas, drivers on Harbor Boulevard have had to detour between 
Gonzales Road and Olivas Park Drive between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we've had to detour them a couple miles," Hatch said. "But it's sure 
made it a safer (cleanup) operation." JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CUT IN DEVELOPER FEE IS CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to attract more growth to Ventura County's most populated city, the 
Oxnard City Council today is scheduled to consider cutting by 50% the fee it 
charges developers for traffic mitigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kinney, the city's economic development director, is recommending the 
council approve a resolution that cuts the $348-per-trip cost to just under 
$174 per daily vehicle trip generated by new projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinney said the one-time fees, which have more than tripled since 1988, are 
inhibiting development within the city in a weak economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern is that this level of fee serves as a distinct barrier to 
attracting new industry to Oxnard at a time when that very objective is a top 
priority to the city," Kinney wrote to council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the reduction would cost the city an estimated $43 million over the 
next 27 years, including $675,000 this year alone, the proposal has some 
support among council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Michael Plisky said cutting the fee in half would be "correcting 
bad policy" approved by earlier councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said the reduction would spur growth. "The amount we're 
charging is so high that in today's economy it kills everything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan concerns Eleanor Branthoover, chairwoman of the Rio Lindo 
Neighborhood Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm all for attracting good, clean manufacturing jobs, not retail jobs that 
pay minimum wage," she said. "I would like to see jobs that pay a livable 
salary, so people can afford the homes here." 
</P>
<P>
 Branthoover also said the council should make sure levels of service do not 
suffer because of any fee reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area suffered for so many years with bad traffic conditions, and we 
still haven't rectified all of the problems," she said. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; DISTRICT TO PAY PART OF NEW COST FOR CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tab for building the new Oxnard High School campus has risen a 
half-million dollars above the initial price tag, but the Oxnard high school 
district will have to cover only a fraction of the added cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District board on Wednesday will consider 
requested changes to its contracts with two of the three builders working on 
the $33-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 C.A. Rasmussen Inc. of Simi Valley, which did the grading and other ground 
preparation of the site, is charging the district $451,160 above its original 
contract price of $1 million to cover the costs of bringing in additional dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And W.M. Lyles Co. of Camarillo has asked to be paid an additional $59,982, 
bringing its total contract to nearly $715,000. Lyles' new charges primarily 
cover the cost of importing sand for filling in the school's new sewer line. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Oxnard school district is responsible for paying the amount owed 
to Lyles, the state has agreed to cover the additional charges by Rasmussen, 
district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state had previously agreed to pay for nearly all of the new campus, which 
is being built on a site near Gonzales and Patterson roads to replace the 
existing Oxnard High School campus on Fifth Street. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials agreed with Oxnard school officials that the new 
school is necessary because the existing high school is in the flight path of 
Oxnard Airport, posing a danger to students. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Rasmussen and Lyles, a third contractor -- Shirley Brothers Inc. of 
Pasadena -- is doing the actual construction of the school for $25.5 million. A 
fourth contractor is expected to be hired to put finishing touches on the 
school. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; WATER RATE PLAN BENEFITS BIG BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeowners and small businesses in Oxnard would pay more for water while large 
users would see their bills slashed nearly in half under new water rates to be 
considered today by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new rates would help attract large industries to the city and 
help stop large employers from leaving, according to a report submitted by 
Benjamin Y. Wong, the city's utility director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Staff believes that Oxnard's water cost for high-water-use industries may in 
some instances already be knocking Oxnard out of the competition for attracting 
new industries," Wong said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, single-family residences have received a 16% 
"unintended subsidy" in the actual cost of water through higher payments by 
large apartment houses, businesses and industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rate structure would eliminate the subsidy and create an incentive for 
large businesses by dropping Oxnard's tiered rate structure -- which charges 
more for higher water use -- for all customers except single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the city would adopt a reduced rate for large apartments and 
commercial customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect would mean modest rate increases for 25,639 of the city's 
customers and significant rate reductions for 3,319 large users. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly water rates would rise 1.5% for a typical single-family home, 21% for 
small apartment houses and between 40% and 145% for small businesses. That 
translates to a monthly rate increase of about 23 cents for most homeowners to 
between $4 and $8 for most small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Larger businesses would benefit, with the rates declining by one-third for 
large apartment buildings, by 40% for large businesses and 42% for large 
industrial firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Monthly savings would average $42,000 for the city's largest industries.

 The odds were too high to figure. Their score on the hole, however, was as low 
as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Shanahan and Mark Munoz each recorded a hole in one Monday at River Ridge 
Golf Club in Oxnard -- on consecutive shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the odds on that would be," said Bill Parry, an assistant 
pro at River Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan, who lives in Redondo Beach, stepped up to the 146-yard fifth hole 
with a nine iron and recorded an ace. Munoz, playing in the same threesome, 
duplicated the feat with the next swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz, the Oxnard city champion as well as the River Ridge men's champion, 
used an eight iron. Munoz, who lives in Ventura, is a maintenance worker at 
River Ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither player knew of their feats at the time. A knoll on the fifth hole runs 
through the middle of the green, obstructing a view of the bottom of the 
flagstick from the tee box. 
</P>
<P>
 "We walked up and I said, 'Where the hell is (my ball)?' " said Shanahan, 30. 
"I had an eight iron because I figured I was going to have to chip." 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan and the third member of the group, Robert Casey of Ventura, finally 
checked the hole and found both balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, who parred the fifth hole, had the last laugh. He finished with a 
five-over 77, while Munoz and Shanahan shot 81 and 82, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Munoz, 36: "We're going to sneak out the side door. Otherwise, we have to 
buy a round for the whole men's club." STEVE ELLING

VENTURA COUNCIL DEBATES PROPOSED BAN ON SMOKING; ORDINANCE: MEMBERS WEIGH 
HEALTH CONCERNS WITH INTERESTS OF RESTAURATEURS WHO SAY COMPLIANCE WOULD BE TOO 
COSTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Weighing health concerns of secondhand smoke against business interests, the 
Ventura City Council continued to debate late Monday night over a proposed 
ordinance that would ban smoking at all businesses and restaurants, with the 
exception of bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were trying to formulate a law that would satisfy nonsmoking 
advocates who argue that a ban is necessary to protect residents' health, and 
restaurateurs who say complying with a ban would be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson offered a compromise that would give restaurants 
a year to comply with the proposed smoking ban. The law would be implemented in 
three months for all other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Carson's plan, it would also be easier for restaurants to be considered 
as a "bar" as defined by the proposed law and thus be exempt from the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said restaurateurs have persuaded him that the smoking ban would cause 
financial hardship because they would lose customers and it would be costly to 
wall off bars and install separate ventilation systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it as easy as possible on them," he said before the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 nonsmoking advocates, business owners and city residents joined in 
the debate Monday night, taking turns to present their views to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows it's bad for you. No nonsmokers should have to endure 
anyone's smoke," said Gary Yanez, 35, a musician from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynette Flores, who owns Tony's Steak and Seafood on Thompson Boulevard, said 
the smoking ban would hurt her restaurant dramatically because 60% of her 
customers smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there are enough nonsmoking restaurants in Ventura to accommodate 
nonsmokers," Flores said. "I think it is the business person's right to make 
the decision" on banning smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the council gave preliminary approval to a strict smoking ban that 
would compel restaurateurs to comply within three months. Exempted bars were 
defined as establishments that receive less than 25% of their gross receipts 
from food sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But after restaurateurs mounted a lobbying campaign, Carson suggested 
exempting more establishments from the ban by changing the definition of a bar. 
Under the Carson compromise, a business that serves alcohol and receives less 
than 35% of its gross receipts from food sales would be considered a bar that 
is exempt from the smoking ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsmoking advocates said they were disappointed by Carson's compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing the percentage is a way to exempt a lot of restaurants," said Fred 
Bysshe, a Ventura attorney who heads the Smoking Action Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Some restaurateurs said they were happy with the compromise; others said the 
ban would hurt them financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Rome, manager of the King and I Restaurant on Main Street, said he would 
prefer no ban at all, but noted that his restaurant qualifies as a bar under 
the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be exempt," Rome said before the meeting. "I still don't like it. I 
don't need Big Brother running my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed ban prohibits smoking in all workplaces and restaurants except in 
outdoor seating areas. Restaurants with bar areas would have to wall off the 
bar and install a separate ventilation system if smoking is to be permitted at 
the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday also debating whether to waive building permit fees for 
constructing walls and air-conditioning systems in restaurants that want to 
allow smoking in their bars. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the council was considering exempting restaurants from laws 
requiring the building to be upgraded to all city standards. Usually, once 
renovations begin in a building, property owners are required to upgrade other 
parts of the building to meet stricter seismic safety codes and other new 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they would not be able to waive state and federal 
requirements once construction begins. Restaurateurs said they are worried 
about the costs of potential upgrade requirements, such as providing access for 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar anti-smoking laws have been adopted by Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Ojai 
and Ventura County.

ANTI-VIOLENCE GROUP CHANGES ITS NAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To reflect its expanded services and programs, the Ventura County Coalition 
Against Household Violence has changed its name to Coalition Against Domestic 
and Sexual Violence. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ventura County Rape and Sexual Assault Center closed last year, the 
coalition was awarded a three-year grant for $76,000 annually by the California 
office of criminal justice to provide services for rape victims.Using the money 
from the grant, the coalition hired Norma Henderson, who had been working as a 
client advocate for the coalition, to answer legal questions frequently asked 
by victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson's duties include helping clients understand restraining order 
applications and the reporting and prosecution of domestic or sexual crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other services provided by the coalition include a child-abuse hot line and 
anger management hot line, which was created primarily for men who have a 
history of battering women. 
</P>
<P>
 To recognize the work of those who assist domestic violence and sexual assault 
victims, the coalition will honor Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. 
Bradbury during a dinner and Valentine dance Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents interested in attending the dinner, which will be held at the Colony 
Harbortown Resort, should call 654-8141. The deadline for reservations is Jan. 
28. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition's 24-hour hot lines include Domestic Violence/Sexual Assault, 
656-1111; Anger Management, 656-4861, and Child Abuse/Listening Line, 656-4810.

SIMI SCHOOL PANEL TO DISCUSS CHARGING FOR BUSING SERVICE; EDUCATION: BOARD WILL 
ALSO DEBATE MOVING ATHLETICS FROM SIXTH PERIOD TO AFTER SCHOOL SO PLAYERS CAN 
BE CHARGED FOR OUT-OF-TOWN GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Faced with the need to cut $2.5 million from next year's budget, Simi Valley 
school board members tonight will discuss becoming the second district in 
Ventura County to charge parents for home-to-school busing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, parents would pay $300 per year to bus one child and $200, 
$100 and $50 for subsequent children. The move would reduce busing's nearly 
$500,000 drain on the general fund by $194,250, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation fees will be considered among several proposed changes. 
Another significant proposal would move athletics from sixth period to after 
school so officials could legally charge those students extra for 
transportation to out-of-town games. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing varsity sports from the regular school day would save the district 
$175,000 in teacher costs. Requiring parents or booster clubs to pay for 
extracurricular busing would shave another $98,500, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members have been holding special budget meetings in the last few months 
to come up with reductions that a majority could support. More proposals will 
be brought to regular board meetings as they are hashed out, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we're taking it in bite-size pieces," said board member Judy 
Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 The district needs to cut about $2.5 million to refill its empty savings 
account and balance next year's general fund budget at $77.1 million. Reserves 
have been depleted because the state has not granted cost-of-living increases 
for four years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are difficult choices to make, but it's a matter of determining 
priorities," Supt. Mary Beth Wolford said. "We would like to keep doing all of 
the things we're doing now, but we can't. That's where the frustration comes 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the board agrees on cuts tonight, the proposals would be brought back for a 
formal vote at the next regular meeting Feb. 1, said Assistant Supt. Ralph 
Wilson. He said anyone interested in the budget cuts up for review is 
encouraged to speak to the board tonight, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This board discussion is basically to give the community a chance to react a 
little bit," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cuts up for review would eliminate the student welfare and attendance 
counselor, a position created this school year to work with students who have 
unexcused absences or are on the brink of dropping out. The cut would save 
$61,456. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal would cut teacher advisers, who spend one or two class 
periods a day working with students showing behavioral problems. If all teacher 
advisers positions were eliminated, the district would save about $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If the transportation fees are approved, officials estimate that ridership 
would drop from 1,439 students to 1,150 as parents choose to car-pool or find 
less expensive alternatives to busing. However, a survey several months ago did 
not show significant community opposition to busing fees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If too few students pay to ride the bus, officials might have to consider 
eliminating transportation, said board member Doug Crosse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this as a first step," Crosse said. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts are mandated to bus special education students to school. In 
addition, officials say a legal challenge to bus fees for athletes could be 
made if sports stays part of the regular school day, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students could argue that they cannot be charged for bus trips to athletic 
games because they are entitled to a free public education in all subject areas 
studied during school hours, Wolford said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Unified School District is the only other school system in 
the county to charge parents for bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional cuts are being explored in negotiations with various employee 
groups, including early retirement and a cap on overtime, Wolford said. Future 
proposals could call for reducing office workers at junior high and high 
schools; lowering salaries and cutting counselors and psychologists.

SIMI SENIOR CITIZENS FIND THEIR BIT OF PARADISE AT NEW COMPLEX; HOUSING: 
RESIDENTS OF THE LOW-INCOME APARTMENT FACILITY SAY THEY LIKE THE VIEWS, 
COMMUNITY ROOM AND CAMARADERIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The bedrooms at Heywood Gardens are barely large enough for a bed and small 
dresser, the kitchens are too small for a table, and sofas make the narrow 
living rooms seem cramped. 
</P>
<P>
 But the residents of the long-awaited Simi Valley apartment complex for 
low-income seniors don't seem to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I was before I came here doesn't even come close," Edward Sandouk, 80, 
said. "When I found out I got in here I dropped on my knees and thanked God." 
</P>
<P>
 More than eight years in the planning, apartments in the $6.4-million, 75-unit 
complex were awarded last month by lottery from a pool of 350 applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some were living in subsidized housing but were still paying a lot, some were 
in trailers, one was living in a car," said Bob Lippman, chairman of the Simi 
Valley Council on Aging. "Heywood Gardens has gone a long way in meeting our 
most urgent need." 
</P>
<P>
 The completion of Heywood Gardens boosts the number of low-income rental units 
for senior citizens in Simi Valley by more than 25%, to 289. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal law requires that subsidized housing not be limited to residents 
in the immediate area, so about half the tenants are from Simi Valley and half 
are from other parts of Ventura County and from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, developed by the nonprofit Atlanta-based Christian Senior Housing 
Foundation, was funded with a loan from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development and $877,000 from the Simi Valley Community Redevelopment 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city doesn't normally put such a large amount of money into a development 
project," said Dulce Conde-Sierra, deputy director of housing and special 
projects. "But the city felt there was a need to help low-income seniors, so 
they gave it everything they could." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the three-story, four-acre complex proudly point out their views 
of the neighboring Rancho Simi Community Park, with its bike trails and 
duck-filled lake. 
</P>
<P>
 They enthuse over the large community room, with its upright piano and Queen 
Anne-style furniture, overlooking a field of poppies. They speak thankfully of 
the camaraderie of the tenants and of the lenient rules which allow them to 
keep a cat or small dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last place I lived had walls around it that were eight feet high," Sylvia 
Rosenzweig, 72, said. "I felt like I was in a prison." 
</P>
<P>
 At Heywood Gardens, the retired hairstylist enjoys sunsets and sweeping 
mountain vistas from the balcony of her third-floor corner apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my biggest pleasure," Rosenzweig said, gazing out at the view. "I take 
pictures of it because it's so beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Arcos, 73, moved to Heywood Gardens from an apartment in Thousand Oaks. 
"I lived there three years and my neighbors barely said hello to me," the 
retired medical assistant said. "Here, you're not lonely because there's always 
someone around you can talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Heywood Gardens tenants pay one-third of their income in rent, Conde-Sierra 
said. Residents with no income pay nothing, while others who make as much as 
$18,000 a year pay up to $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these people are on a fixed income and were paying half of it in 
rent," Lippman said. "Now they have enough to eat a little better, buy new 
clothes, that sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 There are still many seniors in need of affordable housing, Conde-Sierra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city closed its waiting list for a federal rent-subsidy program three 
years ago. The names of 57 seniors remain on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 The city in 1989 implemented its own senior rent-subsidy program with funds 
from the redevelopment agency. The program, which helps about 50 seniors pay 
for their housing, was designed specifically to give financial aid to seniors 
waiting for federal assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, "we don't really have an accurate gauge of the need," Conde-Sierra 
said. "But we know it's more than we can accommodate." 
</P>
<P>
 A tightening of federal housing subsidies may make it difficult to fund future 
developments, Conde-Sierra said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Heywood Gardens is celebrating its completion with an open house on Jan. 21 
from noon to 2 p.m. at 1770 Heywood St. in Simi Valley. The public is invited, 
but please call 722-2122 in advance.

RED WINGS SURGE PAST THE DUCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Detroit Red Wings found a new way to torment the Mighty Ducks on Monday 
night at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of blowing them out of the building right from the start, as they had 
in the past, the Red Wings teased the Ducks by sleep skating through the first 
two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the game on the line, Detroit roared by the faltering Ducks with four 
third-period goals in a 6-4 victory before a sellout crowd of 17,174. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks could have moved ahead of Winnipeg in the race for the Western 
Conference's final playoff berth and within two points of second-place 
Vancouver in the Pacific Division, but Sheldon Kennedy, Dino Ciccarelli and 
Steve Yzerman trashed all that. 
</P>
<P>
 Their third-period goals extended Detroit's unbeaten streak to eight and 
stopped the Ducks' three-game winning streak. It also was the Ducks' 13th loss 
in 19 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was suspecting we'd be out of gas in the third period and I was right," 
Duck Coach Ron Wilson said. "We were playing the best team in the league right 
now, and for two periods we played them pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the Ducks killed off a two-man disadvantage early in the third 
period, they seemed to hit the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy scored at the 5:39 mark to tie the score at 3-3. Ciccarelli scored a 
little more than a minute later. Yzerman scored at 16:00 and Ciccarelli added 
an empty net goal in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they got their first goal in the third period it seem to elevate their 
(spirits) and they just took off," Duck winger Terry Yake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciccarelli wasn't particularly worried, simply waiting for better things to 
happen in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you've got to find a way to win the game," said Ciccarelli, who 
scored the 501st and 502nd goals of his career. "We brought it back with the 
goal by Kennedy, then the goal I scored. Our game plan is to attack them and 
try to frustrate them. We're able to frustrate a lot of teams that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit outshot the Ducks, 15-5, in the third period, one more measure of 
their superiority late in the game. Duck goaltender Ron Tugnutt made 26 saves, 
but it didn't impress Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, Ron Tugnutt has played better games," Wilson said. "A team like 
Detroit takes advantage of mistakes. We made a few mental mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings turned three giveaways in the Ducks' zone into goals and Troy 
Loney lost track of Kennedy, which led to a break-away and the game-tying goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were even with the Red Wings, 1-1, after the first period, then led, 
3-2, after the second. 
</P>
<P>
 That was no small victory considering the Ducks' staggering starts in their 
first two games against Detroit. They trailed the Red Wings, 3-0, after the 
first period en route to a 7-2 loss on opening night and fell behind, 2-0, in a 
5-2 defeat at Detroit on Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, defenseman Bobby Dollas' power-play goal with less than 3 minutes left 
in the second period put the Ducks ahead, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Duck defenseman, Bill Houlder, tied the score at 2-2 at the 14:36 mark 
of the second period. It was Houlder's 10th goal of the season, putting him 
third in scoring on the team behind Yake (15) and Bob Corkum (13). 
</P>
<P>
 In the first period, Patrik Carnback scored his first goal since Nov. 26, 
giving the Ducks a 1-0 lead at the 12:27 mark. He swatted a backhanded pass 
from defenseman Alexei Kasatonov over the right shoulder of goalie Chris 
Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Ladouceur suffered a contusion on his right thigh after Detroit's Darren

<P>
 The Newport Harbor boys' basketball team dominated the third quarter and went 
on to a 67-52 Sea View League victory over Tustin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (9-6, 2-1 in league) outscored Tustin, 16-6, in the third quarter, 
including a 13-0 run, and took a 52-37 lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That third quarter is what I'm happiest about," Newport Harbor Coach Richard 
Smith said. "We usually struggle in the third quarter, but today I didn't say 
much at halftime and we came out a little early and really played well." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also was pleased that his team played well without 6-foot-7 senior 
center Ramy Shoukry for most of the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoukry got his fourth foul in the first minute of the third quarter and sat 
out the rest for the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Shoukry finished with 19 points, scoring seven in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Danny Pulido helped in Shoukry's absence; he finished with four 
points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny really played well tonight when we needed him to," Smith said. "He 
handled himself really well for a freshman in a Sea View League varsity game." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams got off to a fast start, and Newport Harbor took a 37-31 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Paul Tayyar and Juan Orellana also played well for Newport Harbor. 
Orellana had 13 points. Tayyar finished with 15, including a last-second, 
half-court shot to end the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 For Tustin (9-6, 2-1), point guard Doug Gottlieb scored 17 points and forward 
Aaron Kraus had 10. PETER BARZILAI

 Chris Yard, Cal State Northridge's leading scorer and top rebounder, will miss 
tonight's game against St. Mary's because of a cartilage tear in his right 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, a 6-foot-6 forward, incurred the injury while going for a rebound about 
seven minutes into Northridge's game Saturday against UC Irvine.He left the 
game but returned after trainers taped his knee. He finished with 14 points and 
11 rebounds, helping the Matadors to a 68-66 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard, a senior from Las Vegas, is averaging 13.2 points and 6.4 rebounds. 
Shane O'Doherty, a 6-11 junior from Riverside, is expected to start tonight in 
Yard's place. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge practiced Monday morning before the team left by bus for Moraga, 
Calif., the site of tonight's game. Neither Yard nor point guard Andre 
Chevalier participated in the workout. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier played against Irvine with a broken bone in his right hand. He is 
expected to start against St. Mary's. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard did not make the trip north. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our feeling is that he should stay and take treatment," Northridge Coach Pete 
Cassidy said. "You don't want to mess with knees. You don't want to end up 
hurting it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 The cartilage tear was discovered during a Monday morning examination by Dr. 
Eric Sletten, the Northridge team physician. MIKE HISERMAN

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; SANDOZ'S FIRST IMPRESSION IS DECEIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Sherise Sandoz made her first appearance on campus, Coach Colleen 
Matsuhara worried that it might be her last. And some members of the women's 
basketball team were hoping she was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz, who averaged 25 points and 16 rebounds last season at Downey Pius X 
High and was The Times' Southeast player of the year, also was considering Long 
Beach State and Hawaii when she arrived at Irvine for a recruiting visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was kind of standoffish and we were puzzled," Matsuhara said. "We 
couldn't tell if she was having a good time that weekend. I thought maybe she 
wanted to go home. She had verbally committed before the recruiting trip and 
she stuck by her word, but after her visit, I was keeping my fingers crossed 
that nothing was going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz has heard all about her unimpressive first impression and laughs about 
it now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody liked me when I first came here," she says, giggling. "They said I was 
so quiet and stuff, but that's just how I am when I don't know people. I'm shy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we get along great and I talk all the time. Now, it's like, 'Do you 
ever stop talking? Shut up sometimes.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz, who says she chose Irvine because she thought she could play right 
away, is making some noise on the court as well. When junior forward Jinelle 
Williams was sidelined with tendinitis in both knees late last month, Sandoz 
moved into the starting lineup for games against Drake and No. 5 Colorado and 
collected 25 points and 14 rebounds. Williams is back and Sandoz is no longer 
starting, but she has played in every game and is averaging six points and four 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuhara's original plan was to convert Sandoz from a post player to a 
perimeter player, but Williams' injuries waylaid those intentions for the time 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to renege on what I promised her when she came here, but it's been 
out of necessity that we've been having to use her inside," Matsuhara said. 
"And she's been doing a great job playing in the post. She's been very 
aggressive going to the basket and she's been rebounding with reckless abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had to find a place for her to play, but she's only 5-7, so in the 
post she's usually up against players who are 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. But she hasn't 
backed down at all, so I think that's a really good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz is hardly pouting about a decision that sets her smack in the middle of 
her comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be able to play both inside and outside," she said. "But really, I 
wish I could stay on the post. I like it much better. I guess I can't play 
there forever because of my height, but I wish I could. What's a couple of 
inches?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz, who played for the Cerritos Dynasty club team and has traded elbows 
with some formidable opponents during her travels, says she really hasn't been 
awed by the prowess of Division I college players. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest adjustment for me has been the workouts," she said. "In high 
school, we didn't really do that much conditioning. Here, we never stop 
running. And I never lifted weights before this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's helping my game, though, my strength and my endurance. And, once 
the workouts are over with, you feel really good about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 When the games are over, however, there usually aren't too many women wearing 
blue and gold feeling very good about themselves. Irvine is 1-10, 0-3 in the 
Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we were going to play a lot of really good teams during the 
nonconference season and I think we'll be a lot better in conference," Sandoz 
said. "If not this year, then next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People take us lightly. Back home, they say, ' Irvine? Is that a Division I 
school?' But I think we're getting better. I'm glad I picked this school and 
I'm going to work as hard as I can to help stop people from taking us lightly."

 Sandoz is a criminology major who wants to become a parole officer, return to 
the community where she grew up to try to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Sandoz said. "When I was growing up in Lynwood, it was so much 
better. Now, when I go home, we just have to stay inside." 
</P>
<P>
 So Sandoz is trying to apply the tenacity and intensity that makes her a 
success on the court to the challenges of the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for me, with basketball and all the studying, because you get 
really tired," she said. "But you've got to keep working hard at it and I make 
myself do it because I don't want people saying, 'Oh, she's just here to play. 
She's dumb.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to know that I'm a student-athlete. Both parts of it."

 Flat performance: Bombardier Chris Brown, one of those pure shooters whose 
shots almost always seem to be on target while in flight, made only two of nine 
three-pointers during Saturday night's loss to Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has no qualms about casting off from NBA three-point territory and 
usually shoots the ball as effortlessly as he would from 15 feet, but Saturday 
night some of his shots appeared to have lost their normal trajectory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed it earlier and asked if he felt like he had his legs under him," 
Coach Rod Baker said after the game. "I don't think he got a good look at the 
basket but maybe one or two times, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's complaining, however. Since becoming academically eligible Dec. 10, 
Brown has taken 60 shots from the floor that have netted a total of 66 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's volleyball team beat University of La Verne, 15-5, 15-10, 15-13, 
Saturday to open its season. Junior Leland Quinn led Irvine with 15 kills. The 
Anteaters play three matches Friday in the first round of the two-day 
Collegiate Classic at UC Santa Barbara. Irvine faces Colorado, Menlo University 
and the host Gauchos on Friday. . . . Gwen Yoshizumi was the top finisher for 
the Irvine women's swimming team in the UCI Invitational, taking sixth place in 
the 200-yard backstroke. Jeff Hoskinson was the top male, with a fifth-place 
finish in the same event.

EXECUTIVE SUITE: SONY'S MUSIC DIVISION PROMOTES KEY EXECUTIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sony Music Entertainment President Thomas D. Mottola announced a batch of 
appointments Monday aimed at rewarding his team of senior executives with 
bigger titles and responsibilities as well as accelerating the development of 
Sony's worldwide music companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Key among the changes will be elevating three Sony presidents to chairmen of 
their respective units. Don Ienner is now chairman of Columbia Records Group, 
David Glew is chairman of Epic Records Group and Mel Ilberman will be chairman 
of Sony Music International. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Bowlin will assume the title of president of Sony Music 
International, a title Ilberman held before he was elevated to chairman, while 
Richard Griffiths is the new president of Epic, gaining the title formerly held 
by Glew. Ienner will retain the president title at Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Mottola named Michele Anthony, one of the key executives under him, 
as executive vice president of Sony Music Entertainment, a job that will 
involve her in managing all divisions within the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Mottola said the moves represent a "giant message that Sony 
Music will be making big moves forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's music business has been booming, thanks to sales from such artists as 
Pearl Jam, Mariah Carey and Barbra Streisand. 
</P>
<P>
 Mottola, whose role was expanded last year to oversee Sony's international 
music business, is making a big push to boost the company's foreign business as 
reflected by the recent establishment of a company in Turkey. Among the areas 
listed by Mottola as having major growth potential are Southeast Asia and 
Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Anderson has been named executive vice president of former Paramount 
Pictures Chairman Brandon Tartikoff's Moving Target Productions, a film and 
television production firm with offices in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who will oversee strategic planning and all key administrative 
duties, worked under Tartikoff at Paramount as vice president of corporate 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson most recently worked as senior vice president at Sitrick & Co., a 
media relations firm in Century City. Anderson also spent more than 18 years at 
The Times, where he was deputy business editor and wrote a weekly column. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Ryan has been named president of DIC Entertainment's international 
sales division. 
</P>
<P>
 Journalist Steve Chagollan and music publicist Jerry Brown have joined Lee 
Solters Co. as account executives handling entertainment and corporate clients.

 Television and Video: The late Sammy Davis Jr. still has it, babe. Davis' 
daughter, Tracey,is said to have recently signed a multiyear deal with Four 
Point Entertainment to develop a batch of projects based on the entertainer and 
his life that would include a network television special, home video releases 
and even an interactive CD-ROM production.The projects had been on hold pending 
the resolution of an Internal Revenue Service problem stemming from a 
$5-million debt Davis owed the federal government when he died in 1990. An IRS 
spokesman confirmed that the dispute has been resolved. The programs are 
expected to include footage and exclusive clips from Davis' personal archives. 
Four Point is best known for the hit syndicated television program "American 
Gladiators." JAMES BATES

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: SONY, MATSUSHITA RIDE MULTIMEDIA BALLOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anyone who still doubts the wisdom of the Hollywood forays made by Sony Corp. 
and Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. might want to take a look at the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 With their core consumer electronics business stranded in a deep funk, the 
companies are trading at or near two- to three-year highs on the Tokyo and New 
York exchanges. Both conglomerates also have outperformed the Japanese stock 
market as a whole, which analysts say is at least partly due to the fervor for 
entertainment companies in the wake of the Paramount Communications bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that fervor is directly focused on Sony and Matsushita, with 
persistent rumors that they are courting investments in their Sony Pictures and 
MCA Inc. units to capitalize on the multimedia boom. Lisbeth R. Barron, an 
analyst with S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York, suggests that Sony and Matsushita 
may be late to the party because of their foreign ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole entertainment group is just trading up and up and up," Barron said 
on Monday. "Since investors have already exploited the domestic stocks, they 
may be looking around for other stocks that haven't made their run." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while the Japanese stock market has risen just 9% since the end of 
1992, Sony's stock in yen has leaped 53% from its 1993 low. Matsushita is up 
57% in yen from the time it bottomed out in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. stocks have in part tracked the strong rally by Sony and Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Stock Exchange, Sony's American Depository Receipts closed at 
$52.625 Monday, up 87.5 cents, after trading at a new 3-year high of $52.75. 
Matsushita gained 87.5 cents to $139.38, just under its 1993 high of $141.50 
and well up from a low of $87 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the surges also have a lot to do with the dollar's weakness 
versus the yen in 1993: As the yen buys more dollars, Japanese stocks owned by 
U.S. investors automatically appreciate. But if entertainment holdings have 
played any significant role in strengthening the companies' stock values, it 
would represent a dramatic turnaround in public perception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony and Matsushita have come under steady criticism in the past for their 
entertainment investments: Sony on grounds that it paid too much for Sony 
Pictures (as much as $6 billion when debt and other costs are considered), even 
though its purchase of CBS Records is considered a steal; and Matsushita on 
grounds that it paid more than $6 billion for MCA just as that company's 
Universal Pictures unit went into a slump, which was only recently broken by 
"Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies have also been pummeled by the global downturn in their 
bread-and-butter business, consumer electronics. A Japanese newspaper on Monday 
said Matsushita will report that operating profit is down 46% in the coming 
quarter. Its consolidated pretax income fell 14%, according to the newspaper 
report, which says the one bright spot was MCA's revenue as a result of 
"Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 For the three months ended Sept. 30, Sony also reported bad news. Operating 
profit fell 57.8% to $116 million. Sales dropped 8.7% to $8.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say both companies have gone to great lengths recently to ensure 
they're not stranded on the information superhighway. There's been more 
emphasis placed on exploiting their synergies -- the melding of hardware and 
software. And Sony sources recently confirmed that the company is more than 
tripling its new technology division budget for the coming fiscal year -- to 
$80 million. In another nod to entertainment, Matsushita last week announced 
plans to build a $1.5-billion Universal Studios theme park in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the subject that's generated the most heat in entertainment circles is the 
possibility that the companies will sell a stake in their divisions to an 
outside investor. Sony went so far as to openly solicit interest in such a deal 
late last year, through the remarks of Sony of America chief Michael P. 
Schulhof. Matsushita has played it closer to the vest, though some outsiders 
speculate that the broad outline of such a plan is on the table this week, 
during meetings between MCA and Matsushita executives in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, there is some speculation that Sony will do something in 
the M&A arena," said Jeff Logsdon of Seidler Cos. in Los Angeles. "That might 
encourage people to be owners of their stock. You hear the same thing about 
Matsushita." 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies formally declined comment on the matter on Monday, as did cable 
TV kingpin John C. Malone. Malone is most often mentioned as a possible 
investor, but sources say talks on all fronts -- including those involving 
other partners such as telephone and video game companies -- are moving slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all sorts of discussions going on," said one source. "But there's 
nothing imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both companies are said to be aware that the air could go out of 
the multimedia balloon any time. The tide of opinion already says Paramount has 
been bid up too high, and technology titans have started to make more 
conservative predictions about their futures, in response to the frenzy that 
greeted their initial pronouncements about the multimedia future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with reality," one trader said Monday of the Sony and 
Matsushita stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because people are building in value, largely based on the anticipated 
price for Paramount. But the big question is, what happens next?" 
</P>
<P>

NFL PLAYOFFS; RAIDERS FINALLY A FORCE THAT CREATES FEAR AGAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: 
BUT THEY SAY THEY STILL AREN'T RECEIVING THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE FROM THE REST 
OF THE LEAGUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Respect. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Raiders have long sought from opponents, whether those 
opponents were on other teams, in the league hierarchy or in various 
courtrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all well and good for the Dallas Cowboys to drape themselves in the 
flag, seek love and devotion across the nation and become "America's Team." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not for the Raiders, thank you. They draped themselves in black 
long before the L.A. Kings or Atlanta Falcons ever thought of it, put a pirate 
on their logo and fashioned an image of terror -- terrifying speed, terrifying 
hits and terrifying results to those who opposed them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an easy sell when the Raiders were truly terrifying the league, running 
up impressive records and winning Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Raiders used their image, their mystique and the respect they had 
earned to win a few psychological battles before they ever stepped on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 But it only works when you are winning. There is nothing terrifying about a 
loser. Teams that sit home when the playoffs start don't get any respect. 
</P>
<P>
 And after winning Super Bowl XVIII at the end of the 1983 season, the Raiders 
ran into a long dry spell. They had only won two division titles and one 
postseason game in the ensuing 10 years until Sunday's 42-24 wild-card victory 
over the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, the image is back. Suddenly, the Coliseum is filled again and 
the mystique is casting a dark shadow across the league. 
</P>
<P>
 True, it was only one victory. True, the Raiders still have a tough road 
through frigid Buffalo ahead of them on Saturday and would find a third-round 
opponent in their path to the Super Bowl should they survive against the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if they don't win another game, the Raiders seem to have won the 
grudging respect of those who had given up on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Point made? Goal at least partially achieved? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders still feel underappreciated. They still feel the respect isn't 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver Tim Brown talked about it after Sunday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let people keep saying, 'They can't do it. They can't do it,' " Brown said. 
"Before you know it, we'll be lined up in Atlanta for the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Jeff Hostetler touched on the same theme while still enjoying the 
glow of his greatest Raider victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we get a lot of respect from the media," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His words were echoed Monday by his coach, Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have respect," he said. "For whatever reason, we haven't 
gotten the kind of respect that we think we deserve. . . . We're a good team 
and, as long as we know we're a good team and I feel we're a good team, I'm not 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell himself did not always get respect when the team was losing. When the 
Raiders went 7-9 last season, he was accused of allowing internal dissension to 
eat away at the club. When the team struggled until the closing weeks of this 
season, he was accused of not getting enough out of his talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel vindication now that he has returned to the winner's circle with 
a club that seems to be peaking at the right point? 
</P>
<P>
 "Vindication?" he said. "I'm not looking for vindication. I'm just looking for 
wins. That's not important to me to get vindication or revenge. . . . When you 
win, all those other things become secondary." 
</P>
<P>
 But much as the Raiders used the respect they earned in earlier days as a 
psychological tool against the opposition, are Shell and his players now using 
what is perceived as a lack of respect -- never specified -- as a psychological 
weapon for their own players? By circling the wagons against the enemy, real or 
perceived, and bemoaning the lack of respect, are the Raiders being brought 
closer together? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain things that turn people on to win," Shell said. "The march 
toward the Super Bowl. It's (fueled) by either money, or the ring, or the idea 
of being called a world champion. Whatever it takes to turn you on and get you 
motivated to play, that's great." 
</P>
<P>
 So let the Cowboys be America's Team. Shell is perfectly satisfied with the 
Raiders being portrayed as the team America loves to hate. 
</P>
<P>
 True or not, if it works for some of his players, Shell won't dispute the 
image. 
</P>
<P>
 He's only interested in winning the Super Bowl. The respect will follow.

BASKETBALL SCHOLARSHIPS STIR DEBATE AT NCAA CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY ROBBINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Debate over a relatively small issue -- restoring a single scholarship in 
men's basketball -- became the catalyst for a round of emotional speeches and 
back-room discussions Monday at the 88th annual NCAA convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the NCAA's Division I schools rejected a proposal that 
would have raised the scholarship limit in men's basketball from 13 to 14, but 
not without fanning the flames of disillusionment that burn in many black 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed, and I personally find (the negative vote) offensive," 
said Dennis Coleman, legal counsel for the Black Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship debate drew the convention spotlight on a day when delegates 
approved a relatively routine series of proposals dealing with gender equity 
and cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate also highlighted the concerns of the BCA, which has become 
increasingly critical of NCAA policies that it believes limit the participation 
of black athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The BCA scored a victory when NCAA leaders added a resolution to the 
convention agenda calling for further study of tighter academic requirements 
for entering freshmen. The legislation is due to take effect next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution received overwhelming approval from delegates Monday, but the 
convention's rejection of the basketball scholarship proposal was seen by 
Coleman and others as a slap in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "The BCA is obviously upset about the results (of the vote)," he said. "Our 
leadership had dealt with (NCAA Executive Director) Cedric Dempsey and others. 
We thought (the proposal) would pass. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a terrible message to the youth of America, particularly in inner 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship limit in men's basketball has dropped from 15 in 1991-92 to 14 
last season and to 13 this season -- one facet of cost-containment legislation 
developed by the NCAA Presidents Commission. The scholarship limit in women's 
basketball has remained at 15 as a result of gender-equity concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, this all comes down to what deserves greater weight: cost reduction or 
minority opportunity," said Jim Haney, executive director of the National Assn. 
of Basketball Coaches. "We thought the minority issue deserves greater weight." 
</P>
<P>
 A lineup of high-profile college chief executive officers, including UCLA 
Chancellor Charles Young, spoke out against restoring the scholarship in men's 
basketball -- their argument based, in large measure, on the notion that 
approving the proposal would be a retreat from the presidents' push for reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world will not forget how we vote," Thomas Hearn, Wake Forest University 
president, told delegates. "The money is relatively small, but the price is 
large." 
</P>
<P>
 Countered Coleman during his turn before the delegates: 
</P>
<P>
 "These 330 scholarships are critically important to our community. There's 
going to be some Reggie Lewis somewhere -- some young kid in South Boston -- 
whose only access (to higher education) is through a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue was resolved, several CEOs attempted to cool down the 
controversy by huddling with Coleman, Haney and others. The CEOs hinted that 
legislation adding a scholarship in men's basketball could be considered at 
next year's convention if the measure is tied to cost reduction in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've made some progress in cost containment, but not always the 
right kind," said University of Colorado President Judith Albino, who will 
become chair of the Presidents Commission at the conclusion of the convention. 
"We've focused too much on (eliminating slots for) people. There might be 
dollars to cut in other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach George Raveling, who has been outspoken in support of BCA concerns, 
had little to say Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to conduct a conference call soon (to discuss the NCAA's 
ruling)," he said. "There will be no public statement made by the BCA at this 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett, attending the convention, said the 
delegates' willingness to reconsider the tighter academic standards was far 
more significant than their rejection of the scholarship proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about access for minority youth across the board," he said, 
assessing the impact of the tighter academic standards, "not 300-something. 
We're talking about millions (of prospective student-athletes) across the 
country who need access." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, USC abstained from voting on the scholarship proposal out of respect 
for Raveling's views, Garrett said.

HE'LL GLADLY STATE HIS CASE; LAKERS' VAN EXEL PROVES THAT HE IS MORE THAN TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he went to Seattle early last summer for a pre-draft workout with the 
SuperSonics, point guard Nick Van Exel of the University of Cincinnati, a 
projected first-round pick, was told to start at the baseline and run to the 
far free-throw line six times. 
</P>
<P>
 He jogged the first one. George Karl, the SuperSonics' coach, told Van Exel he 
could do better than that. Coach, Van Exel replied, my next one is a cool-down. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I did the exact same thing, the same way," Van Exel said. "He came over, 
kind of chewed me out a little bit, and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel figured there was no point in going all out because the SuperSonics 
were already loaded at point guard and wouldn't draft him. He would try hard 
for somebody else. And so, when it came time for the 23rd pick, Seattle grabbed 
6-foot-11 Ervin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Came the second round and Van Exel, surprisingly, was still available. So who 
was frantically trying to move up for another quick selection, jostling for 
position with several other teams who had a similar move in mind, hoping for 
the same draft-day steal that the Lakers would eventually get at No. 37? 
</P>
<P>
 George Karl and the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Few things better illustrate the case of Van Exel, who some think is a case, 
period. Here was a 22-year-old, who had shot all of 38.6% as a senior, telling 
an NBA coach where to get off -- and that coach still wanted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw an individualist," said Karl, who already had more than his share with 
the SuperSonics. "But we also saw a winner. There's that thin line." THE 
INDIVIDUALIST 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel has two diagonal marks shaved in his eyebrows, something he started 
in ninth or 10th grade while growing up in Kenosha, Wis. Last spring, friends 
wanted him to go and watch the draft in person in Auburn Hills, Mich., where 
all the action was that day, but he chose to stay in Cincinnati and have 15 or 
so friends over for a party. By the time Laker General Manager Jerry West 
called to say they were going to take him, Van Exel was drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is his attitude, the one that earned him the nickname Nick Van 
Smack from Jim Rome of XTRA radio and ESPN2. 
</P>
<P>
 A taunting, erratic-shooting, flight-missing, take-that bravado. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm not talking, (and) just going through the motions, that's when I'm 
not having fun," Van Exel said. "But when I'm out there talking, to other teams 
and my players, that's when I'm having fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He was five games into his first exhibition season when he was taunting Gary 
Payton. He mouthed off to the Suns in the regular-season opener. And when a 
Laker threw down a slam in the face of some Trail Blazer a few games later, Van 
Exel shouted, "Way to dunk on his gluteus maximus" -- or something to that 
effect. Portland's Clifford Robinson fired back, "You gotta get some game or 
something before you come here talking." 
</P>
<P>
 But the swagger never stops. When agent Tony Dutt said he could get a two- or 
three-year deal last summer, the ultra-confident Van Exel told Dutt to instead 
take one season at the league minimum of $150,000. Then he could become a 
restricted free agent next summer, when they could get a new contract from the 
Lakers at first-round money. 
</P>
<P>
 So when the ultra-competitive Van Exel starts to have his playing time cut, to 
the point that he is averaging 22.5 minutes the last six games and hasn't 
exceeded 30 in three weeks, and he begins to get frustrated, it's hard to hide 
that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm not having much fun out there playing," he said. " . . . I 
don't know what I can put the blame on. I'm just going to have to go out there 
and get into my old ways, but right now it's hard because we're losing and my 
minutes kind of went down." 
</P>
<P>
 One more thing about Van Exel -- his image: 
</P>
<P>
 It's only half true. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the court, he is quiet and unassuming, happy to stay home and watch 
television, preferably sports. Even before games, not long before transforming 
into the motor mouth looking for an on-ramp, he is nervous during chalk talks 
as the Laker coaches go over final scouting reports. He hates that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that he is really covering feelings of being nervous and insecure? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," Van Exel said during a quiet moment, "I think it is." THE WINNER 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't even get noticed in Kenosha by the nearby big school, Marquette, 
and got only two letters from Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of signing with Ball State or Kent or some other smaller school, Van 
Exel went to junior college, hoping to build his stock for one of the major 
schools. He chose Trinity Valley Community College in Texas, lured by the 
chance to play with another recruit, Shawn Kemp. A week later, Kemp declared 
for the NBA draft and Van Exel endured two years of what he called "the worst 
experience of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 He got into fights, had some academic difficulties, a bad relationship with 
Coach Leon Spencer and almost got kicked out of school. But he did get the big 
schools to take notice. Arkansas and Tennessee, among others, came calling, 
before Van Exel chose Cincinnati, largely because the Bearcats had moved into 
the Great Midwest Conference, and that meant playing at Marquette and DePaul, 
both close to Kenosha. 
</P>
<P>
 His dream was to play on television, and he got his wish. Cincinnati went 18-2 
after he took over at point guard as a junior and went to the Final Four, then 
reached the regional finals in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 During that senior season, some said he could be drafted as high as the teens. 
Then came the well publicized botched workouts with the Charlotte Hornets, when 
he missed one flight because his girlfriend had been in a car wreck, and 
another when there was a miscommunication with Dutt's secretary, and things 
went into a tailspin. 
</P>
<P>
 On draft day, the teens became the 20s and the 20s became the 30s and Van Exel 
was still available, by that time hanging out in the kitchen drinking beer and 
not even watching the proceedings. One guy was crying with disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers really wanted another point guard, Lindsey Hunter. When Detroit 
grabbed Hunter two picks ahead of them, the Lakers chose George Lynch of North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they got Van Exel in the second round, No. 37, then watched him make the 
rest of the summer league sorry before the season had started. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Van Exel is the only Laker to have started every game, is 
second only to Orlando's Anfernee Hardaway among rookies in assists, is tied 
with teammate Sedale Threatt for second place among all players in 
assist-to-turnover ratio and is certain to be voted Thursday to the first 
rookie all-star game, to be played Feb. 12 in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me to be playing basketball for a job, that's the best thing in the world 
that could happen to me," Van Exel said. "I live basketball. I dream 
basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 He lives it, he dreams it, he walks it, he talks it. He does it for all to see 
. . . and hear.

JIM MURRAY: LATE-BLOOMING BROWN SIMPLY SPECIAL NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Raiders drafted Tim Brown in the first round in 1988, a lot of people 
thought they had made a mistake. Brown had several strikes against him: He was 
a Heisman Trophy winner, he was from Notre Dame and, although he wasn't slow, 
neither did he have blazing speed.  
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, he didn't really have a position. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, a Heisman in the trophy case is no guarantee a pro 
career will be a cup winner, too. The ranks of guys who looked can't-miss and 
missed anyway are legion. For every Roger Staubach who made it big, there is a 
Joe Bellino who didn't even make it small. For every O.J. Simpson, there was a 
Johnny Rodgers. You might get a Jim Plunkett at quarterback, but you might get 
a Pat Sullivan, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, many a great one went overlooked by the Heisman balloters -- John 
Unitas, Dan Marino, Franco Harris, even Bob Griese. Can you believe the highest 
Jim Brown rose in the voting was fifth?  
</P>
<P>
 Quite apart from the Heisman hoodoo, the Raiders didn't quite know what to do 
with Tim. He was a wide receiver but he also returned punts and kickoffs. 
Stumped, they put him on special teams. In football, special means suicidal. 
</P>
<P>
 He caught 43 passes his first season for 725 yards. But he returned kickoffs 
1,098 and ran back punts 444. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim didn't much care how he got his hands on the ball, so long as he did. So, 
he picked up 2,316 yards altogether in his rookie season. But he was a little 
bit like a star playing the butler.  
</P>
<P>
 He was on a team famous for its receivers. Cliff Branch had duped cornerbacks 
for a decade. So had Fred Biletnikoff, and, for lesser periods, Kenny King and 
Willie Gault. The fastest guys in uniform ran Raider patterns. Owner Al Davis 
combed the Olympic start lists for prospects. Gold medalists, state sprint 
champions, world-class runners were picked by Al. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Davis could never abide that plodding, strong-arm, circle-the-wagons, 
three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust football. His heroes were military men who 
specialized in quick far-reaching demoralizing strikes.  
</P>
<P>
 Al's teams got touchdowns from all over the place, not merely the one-yard 
line. Good field position to the Raiders was wherever they had the ball. His 
plays had the defense in the proverbial position of trying to look over both 
shoulders at once. He didn't want to take 10 plays and a penalty to score a 
touchdown. Al wanted the 10-second TD. The knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 His quarterbacks were known as mad bombers, blitzkriegers. His teams didn't 
need the ball much. Let the other guys push it up through the mud. Davis' teams 
struck like cavalry.  
</P>
<P>
 They kept telling him that didn't work anymore, that football had become 
trench warfare. Al listened -- and went out and signed up some more speed 
merchants, guys who could run 50 yards as fast as a football could fly through 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 They had some trouble seeing Tim Brown in this scheme. Tim is not going to 
anchor the Olympic relay team. 
</P>
<P>
 They liked his moves -- with kickoffs and punts. They were less sold on fly 
patterns. Brown returned 37 to 49 punts a year. One year, 1991, he started only 
one game as a wide receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 But gradually, one thing began to dawn on the Raider brain trust: When he was 
in there -- usually on third and long -- Brown would be as wide open as Dodge 
City on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 But the other half of touchdown-pass receiving is touchdown-pass throwing. For 
most of his career, Tim had some of the most inconsistent deliverers of the 
football the league has ever seen. Gone were Lamonica, Stabler, Plunkett and in 
the irons were guys who would have been better trying to deliver touchdown 
passes by junk mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brown perfected his craft. He studied defenders the way a pitcher 
studies hitters, but mostly he studied coverages. He found the soft spots, the 
open spaces in the opponents' zones. He exploited them. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, they say of a player that he never becomes a pitcher till he 
stops being a thrower. And in football, you never become a receiver till you 
stop being a mere runner. Olympic speed is nice, but even Jerry Rice has to get 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same people who questioned Davis' bringing Tim Brown to the team 
-- Tim was their first-round pick, but the sixth man taken overall -- 
questioned his bringing Jeff Hostetler in even more vehemently. To their minds, 
Hostetler was just Phil Simms' backup, which is about as prestigious as being 
Mike Tyson's sparring partner. 
</P>
<P>
 But 80 times -- a Raider record -- Hostetler found Tim Brown open this year. 
Of the 14 regular-season touchdown passes he threw, seven were to Tim Brown.  
</P>
<P>
 In the season finale against Denver, the combination put the Raiders in the 
Super Bowl hunt when Hostetler completed 11 passes for 173 yards and two 
touchdowns to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 And, then, in the first playoff game Sunday, Hostetler-to-Brown accounted for 
a first-quarter, 65-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
 They might not be able to make the world forget Isbell to Hutson, Waterfield 
to Fears, Van Brocklin to Hirsch, Unitas to Berry, Plunkett to Branch, or 
Montana to Rice, but Hostetler to Brown is reviving that old-time Raider 
football that spreads the defenses, gives cornerbacks headaches and safeties 
high-blood pressure.  
</P>
<P>
 And Tim Brown is striking a blow for Heisman winners everywhere, besides 
reviving "Raider football," the object of which is to surprise the opponent, 
not bore him to death.

PARAGLIDER FACES VARIETY OF CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 If law enforcement has its way, James Miller, the pilot who flew his 
motorized-paraglider over the Los Angeles Coliseum during Sunday's 
Raider-Denver Bronco wild-card playoff game, prompting a delay, will not be 
dropping into any more sporting events for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 6, the Henderson, Nev., man crashed into the ring ropes during the 
Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe heavyweight championship fight at Caesars Palace 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Clark County District Attorney's office, charges have been 
filed against Miller accusing him of operation of an aircraft in a reckless 
manner, an offense that carries a maximum penalty of a year in the county jail, 
a $2,500 fine, or both. There is a warrant out for Miller's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 After flying over the Raider game Sunday, Miller landed in an adjacent field 
and was taken into custody by Los Angeles police. According to LAPD spokesman 
Arthur Homes, Miller is being charged with unlawful disruption of a sporting 
event, a misdemeanor. Apparently, LAPD was unaware of the Nevada warrant for 
Miller's arrest and Miller was released on his own recognizance after booking. 
Holmes says that LAPD is holding Miller's motorized backpack as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges against Miller by the Federal Aviation Administration are also 
pending. The FAA has advised Miller that he is under investigation for the 
Caesars Palace incident. The FAA has also begun an investigation of Sunday's 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said the agency might ask a federal judge for an 
injunction against Miller's interrupting other events. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest Sunday, Miller told police, "Just wait until the Super Bowl." 
An NFL spokesman laughed Monday at the idea that the NFL would hire Miller to 
soar above Super Bowl XXVIII at Atlanta's Georgia Dome.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; SMITH IS FIRST COWBOY VOTED MVP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys narrowly beat last year's winner, Steve 
Young of the San Francisco 49ers, to become the Associated Press' NFL most 
valuable player in voting by 81 national media members. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the league's leading rusher for the third consecutive season, received 
26 votes, while Young, the top passer in the NFL, had 21. Smith is the first 
Cowboy to win the award. He rushed for 1,486 yards this season, with nine 
touchdowns, and caught 57 passes, with one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the third running back since 1980 to be selected MVP, Smith held out 
through training camp and the first two games of the season, which Dallas lost 
to Washington and Buffalo. The Cowboys (12-4) also lost at Atlanta when Smith 
suffered a bruised right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 With Smith available for an entire game, the Cowboys were 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Rice, selected offensive player of the year last week, was third in the 
MVP balloting with 15 votes. He was followed by Denver quarterback John Elway 
with 10. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan, defensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers, promised that he 
won't offer any further public criticism of Oiler offensive coordinator Kevin 
Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am through discussing anything or anyone related to the Oilers except those 
things which pertain to my specific responsibilities as defensive coordinator," 
Ryan said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Mike Holovak met with Ryan on Monday, a day after Ryan's 
latest derision of Gilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to run over me the way he runs over some people," Ryan told 
the Philadelphia Inquirer. "He's a wimp. He's got no business coaching in the 
pros." 
</P>

 Ernie Stautner, 68, the oldest position coach in the NFL, announced his 
retirement after three seasons as the Denver Broncos' defensive line coach. 
Stautner said he had been pondering retirement "for about a year." RAIDERS 
</P>
<P>
 Shell Predictably Gets Point Across 
</P>
<P>
 Through much of the season, the Raiders' offense struggled. And through much 
of the season, Coach Art Shell predicted that his team was ready to break out. 
</P>
<P>
 His powers of prognostication have been matched by his team's sense of timing. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with postseason elimination in the closing weeks of the season, the 
Raiders have come up with a bigger offensive performance in recent weeks, 
equaling or surpassing their season-high point total in four of the last five 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders scored a season-high 27 points in beating the Seattle Seahawks in 
their 13th game, 27-23. They equaled that mark in their next game by defeating 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 27-20. After getting shut out by the Green Bay 
Packers in their 15th game, the Raiders edged the Denver Broncos, 33-30 in 
overtime. They beat Denver again in Sunday's wild-card playoff game, 42-24. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trend continues, the Buffalo Bills could be in trouble in Saturday's 
second-round playoff game against the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said there is a good chance that receiver-returner Rocket Ismail will 
play Sunday against the Bills. Ismail was inactive last Sunday because of a 
sprained neck. STEVE SPRINGER

DESHIELDS ARRIVES, PEDRO MARTINEZ DEPARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers brought in Delino DeShields from Florida for Monday's traditional 
media workout at Dodger Stadium, hoping to help acquaint him with his new 
teammates before spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 But the one player they didn't count on seeing was reliever Pedro Martinez, 
who unexpectedly stopped in to clean out his locker and say a few goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, spotting DeShields in a somewhat empty Dodger clubhouse, yelled, 
"He's the guy! He's the reason I'm not here anymore!" Then he and DeShields 
shook hands, DeShields saying, 'You'll be fine up there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers traded Martinez to the Montreal Expos in November for DeShields, a 
young, speedy second baseman who batted .295 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Martinez excelled in the setup role for Jim Gott, who had 25 
saves filling in for the oft-injured Todd Worrell. For the trade to work to the 
Dodgers' benefit, not only does DeShields have to continue his fine play, but 
Worrell has to be injury-free, allowing Gott to return to the setup role. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like I don't feel (any discomfort) when I throw, but I have been 
playing catch, I'm on schedule to go into spring training three-quarters ready 
and will be ready for the season," Worrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers still don't have a left-handed starter, or a left-handed reliever 
they can depend on, although they have assembled a group of six relievers they 
will look at in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 The other big question mark is Darryl Strawberry, whom the Dodgers have 
unsuccessfully tried to dump. Strawberry, who says his injured back is better, 
believes his performance this spring will generate interest among other clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a showtime for me to show what I can do," Strawberry said. "And 
when I do, there will probably be a lot of questions asked."

FORMER NL PRESIDENT FEENEY DIES; BASEBALL: AT 72, HE HAS A HEART ATTACK. LEAGUE 
OFFICIALS CALL HIS DEATH 'A GREAT LOSS' TO THE SPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Chub Feeney, a former National League president and general manager of the New 
York and San Francisco Giants, died from a heart attack Monday at California 
Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney had suffered a mild stroke at a game at Candlestick Park on July 27 and 
was hospitalized last Tuesday after a heart attack. He suffered another on 
Monday, a hospital spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a close and dear friend who loved the game and was always full of 
life," former Dodger general manager Buzzie Bavasi said. "I'll miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 A nephew of the late Giant owner Horace Stoneham, Charles Stoneham Feeney 
attended Dartmouth College and Fordham law school and was general manager of 
the Giants for 20 years starting in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 The club won National League pennants in 1951, '54 and '62 after joining the 
Dodgers in the 1958 move to California. Feeney succeeded Warren Giles as the 
league president in 1970 and retired when the late Bart Giammati became 
commissioner on Dec. 31, 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 A traditionalist who believed negotiations were best conducted over drinks and 
dinner, Feeney led the NL's 1973 opposition to the designated hitter rule 
adopted by the American League, and was influential in the 1969 decision to 
split each league into two divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney went on to serve briefly as president of the San Diego Padres, 
resigning shortly after making an obscene gesture at two fans parading around 
San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium with a sign reading "Scrub Chub," but he was 
regarded as the NL president emeritus and "of immeasurable help" to current 
president Bill White. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chub's passing is a great loss to baseball," White said. "He signed me to my 
first professional contract." 
</P>
<P>
 A director of the Hall of Fame, Feeney also was involved in the early 
development of the Angels while still general manager of the Giants. He 
provided close friend Bill Rigney, the Angels' first manager and a former Giant 
manager, with access to the Giants' scouting files, enabling the Angels to 
select Jim Fregosi, Buck Rodgers, Dean Chance and several other young prospects 
in the 1961 expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passing of Chub Feeney is a great blow to the entire baseball community," 
interim Commissioner Bud Selig said. "I'll personally miss his expertise, his 
humor and above all, his friendship." 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney is survived by his wife, Margaret Ann, and their five children, one of 
whom, Katy, is the NL's vice president of media and public affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral plans are pending.

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; OREGON STATE COACH CALLS FOR SUSPENSION OF USC'S LESLIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Aki Hill of the Oregon State women's basketball team called for a 
two-week suspension of USC's Lisa Leslie on Monday, after viewing videotape of 
a punching incident last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, a 6-foot-5 senior All-American, hit Oregon State's Kristina Lelas with 
a backhanded punch that Oregon State officials said resulted in Lelas' losing a 
tooth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa backhanded (Lelas) and used her arm in a very deliberate manner," Hill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to stop. She used her elbow like this on one of our players two 
years ago. We've sent the video to the Pac-10. I'd like to see her suspended 
for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred with 2 minutes 34 seconds to play in USC's 63-56 victory 
at Corvallis, Ore. A video recording of the telecast shows Leslie and the 6-5, 
240-pound Lelas jostling for rebound position on an Oregon State shot. Lelas, 
from Croatia, is shown grabbing Leslie's right forearm with her right hand. She 
continues to hold Leslie's arm after the shot misses and the ball bounces away. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie is then seen jerking her arm away from Lelas' grasp and hitting her in 
the face with the back of her right hand. Lelas falls on her back and stays 
down as the play goes to the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Whatford, an official standing under the basket, six to eight feet away 
and facing the play, made no call. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie indicated that she reacted impulsively when Lelas grabbed her arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a rebounding position . . . and she grabbed my right arm," she 
said. "When the ball bounced away from us, she still held on to my arm, and she 
was scratching me with her fingernails. And I just reacted to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Muldoon, a Pacific 10 Conference assistant commissioner, indicated that 
any punishment of Leslie was unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one here will see the tape until (today), and it's not normally under our 
purview to officiate from afar," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the official was in proper position and made no call, and we took action 
on this, where do we stop? Do we reverse traveling calls?" 
</P>
<P>
 The incident didn't end with Lelas falling on her back after the punch. She 
was helped to the locker room, but was back on the court minutes later to join 
a confrontation between her teammates and USC players and coaches.  
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Miller, USC's first-year coach, said Leslie reacted to four years of 
frustration. "I feel bad about it, that the girl was injured, but Lisa has been 
patient about this stuff for four years," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the same thing. When you're a high-profile player, you don't 
get the calls other players do. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, Lisa has been too passive, too timid about this stuff, and I 
told her that when I came here. The important thing is, this wasn't a 
premeditated thing. If it was, why didn't the official make a call?"

TRADE IS A DREAM COME TRUE FOR NEWEST KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His first practice as a King on Monday was enough to nearly render Dixon Ward 
speechless, and not because he was tired after flying from Toronto to Vancouver 
to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward had certainly seen enough of the Kings in his rookie season with the 
Vancouver Canucks -- nine games in the regular season and six more in the 
playoffs. But up close and in person was something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was part of some fantasy camp," Ward said. "I grew up watching 
Wayne (Gretzky) and Jari (Kurri) doing all the things they did in Edmonton. To 
be able to sit in the same (dressing) room with them is something else. Then 
there's Luc Robitaille and Tomas Sandstrom. Legends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just met them. I didn't say much." 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nothing but a blur of activity since Ward was getting ready for a 
game in Toronto on Saturday and was told he had been traded to the Kings for 
center Jimmy Carson. He returned to Vancouver to pack his things and showed up 
Monday, practicing with the players he'd grown up watching as a kid in Leduc, 
Canada, near Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 He might even play on Gretzky's line tonight in San Jose against the Sharks. 
Ward practiced with left wing Warren Rychel and center Pat Conacher, but King 
Coach Barry Melrose is never hesitant to juggle lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might play him with Gretz," Melrose said. "But he's going to play 
everywhere. We'll experiment with him. He can play both wings. We knew he had 
good hands, but after watching him in just one practice, we're very happy with 
his hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps a change of scenery will help Ward, who had a promising rookie season 
with 52 points, including 22 goals, and led all rookies in plus-minus with a 
plus 34. He had seven points in 33 games and is a minus-14 this season, but has 
played sparingly on the fourth line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, I had more of an opportunity to play," Ward said. "If you get the 
chance to play with talent, that's 99% of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 25, considers himself a late-bloomer and was able to develop his game in 
college while earning a journalism degree at the University of North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a long way from Grand Forks," Ward said, laughing.

FERNANDEZ IS COLLEGE FEMALE ATHLETE OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UCLA's Lisa Fernandez was honored Monday night for her spectacular softball 
career when she was announced as the 1993 collegiate female athlete of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, a four-time All-American and conceivably the best female collegiate 
softball player ever, received the Honda-Broderick Cup at the 17th annual 
women's awards dinner, held in conjunction with the NCAA convention. 
</P>
<P>
 She beat out 10 other candidates who had been voted tops in the country in 
their respective sports: Dee Foster of Alabama in gymnastics, Mia Hamm of North 
Carolina in soccer, Holly Hyche of Indiana State in track and field, Kelli 
James of Old Dominion in field hockey, Janel Jorgensen of Stanford in swimming, 
Lisa Raymond of Florida in tennis, Charlotta Sorenstam of Texas in golf, Sheryl 
Swoopes of Texas Tech in basketball, Natalie Williams of UCLA in volleyball and 
Carole Zajac of Villanova in cross-country. 
</P>
<P>
 Others honored at the dinner, attended by an estimated 1,300, were Division II 
winner Christie Allen, a distance runner at Pittsburg (Kan.) State, and 
Division III winner Jennifer Carter, a swimmer at Kenyon (Ohio) College. The 
annual inspiration award winner was Jennifer Mead of Providence College, who 
recovered from surgery on a congenital heart defect to compete in both 
basketball and soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, Fernandez is among the "Who's Who" of college softball. Among 
other things, she is the first to lead the nation in both hitting, with a .510 
batting average, and earned-run average, 0.25. She did that last season, when 
she was 33-3 and had six no-hitters, while also collecting 12 doubles, 11 home 
runs and 45 runs batted in. During Fernandez's four years at UCLA, she had a 
93-7 record and led her team to two NCAA titles and two second-place finishes.

VALLEY ROUNDUP; BUENA'S KEIAHO SAYS HE'LL ATTEND WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Keiaho of Buena High -- the state's second all-time leading rusher -- 
has verbally committed to attend Washington, he said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-feet, 9-inch, 200-pound tailback returned Sunday from a recruiting trip 
to the Washington campus in Seattle.He also was being recruited by Arizona, 
Hawaii, USC and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington -- a perennial Pacific 10 Conference power -- shared the national 
championship with Miami in 1991. The Huskies also won three consecutive Pac 10 
titles (1990-92) to tie USC for the conference record. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies were 7-4 in 1993, their first of two seasons on probation for 
violation of NCAA rules. Washington is ineligible to participate in a bowl game 
until the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho, however, said his decision was not based solely on football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the school facilities and the people are cool," Keiaho said. "There's 
a real big support group for the players and there are a lot of tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is available for you (academically)." 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho as a four-year starter rushed for 6,585 yards and scored 81 touchdowns 
-- 80 of those rushing. He finished seventh in the state in rushing this 
season, gaining 2,248 yards with 30 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 An all-state selection, Keiaho was named the Cal-Hi Sports player of the year 
as a freshman and sophomore. Buena Coach Rick Scott on Dec. 12 retired his 
jersey No. 35. JASON REID

DOW HITS 4TH STRAIGHT RECORD CLOSE ON INVESTORS' ROSY ECONOMIC VIEWS; MARKETS: 
EXPECTATIONS OF STEADY GROWTH AND LOW INFLATION FUEL U.S. BUYING TREND. 
POLITICAL FEARS UNDERCUT MEXICO'S BOLSA.

<P>
 U.S. blue-chip stocks zoomed to new highs on Monday, pulling the broad market 
upward as investors acted on their increasingly rosy view of the American 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some recently red-hot Third World markets continued to slide, led 
by the Mexico City market, which plummeted more than 6% in the aftermath of 
spreading civil unrest over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average leaped 44.74 points to a 
record 3,865.51 in heavy trading, eclipsing a previous peak of 3,820.77 set 
last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among broader market indexes, the Standard & Poor's 500 index also hit a new 
high, as did the New York Stock Exchange composite index. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks surged as well. The Nasdaq composite index of 4,000 mostly 
smaller issues jumped 3.75 points to 786.69, just below the all-time high of 
787.42, set last Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the wave of money that has poured into U.S. stocks over the last 
few weeks is from investors betting on a healthy economy in 1994, without a 
significant increase in inflation or interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bull market, which started more than three years ago, shows no signs of 
letting up," said Charles Blood, director of financial market analysis at 
investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that there is a growing confidence in the economy and in 
corporate earnings, as well as a good outlook for inflation," said Alfred 
Goldman, analyst at brokerage A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial stocks, which should have the most to gain from an improving 
economy, were once again the market leaders on Monday, as they have been since 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors, for example, leaped 1 3/8 to a record 59 1/4. Other industrial 
leaders were farm equipment maker Deere, up 2 3/4 to 76 5/8; chemical giant 
Monsanto, up 2 1/4 to 77 1/8; and forest products company Weyerhaeuser, up 1 
1/2 to 48 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, rising stocks outnumbered losers 13 to 8 on the NYSE, as volume 
remained heavy at 319.49 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dec. 31, the Dow has advanced 111.42 points, or nearly 3%. Experts say 
the rally has been partly fed by a seasonal increase in the amount of cash held 
by big investors such as pension funds, which have quickly turned around and 
pumped those funds into stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's government report of a smaller-than-expected increase in the number 
of jobs nationwide in December helped the stock market's bullish tone, Wall 
Streeters say: Many investors believe that the best possible backdrop for the 
stock market is a moderately growing economy in which interest rates and 
inflation remain low. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. stocks also may be getting unwitting help from Third World stock markets, 
many of which stumbled over the last week after dramatic rallies in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As investors pull funds from what are perceived to be overpriced foreign 
markets, some of that money may be flowing into U.S. stocks because they're 
viewed as safer issues, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, for example, the Mexico City stock market's Bolsa index plunged 
165.92 points, or 6.32%, to 2,459.11, as the 10-day-old peasant insurgency in 
southern Chiapas state apparently sparked car bombings in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit-takers also slammed stocks in Bangkok, Manila and Seoul. In Hong Kong, 
the Hang Seng index rose 365.46 points to 11,366.94 Monday, but at midday today 
it was off 226.41 points. 
</P>
<P>
 For U.S. stocks, a major test of the bull market's resiliency will come over 
the next few weeks, as fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports are released. 
Investors are expecting hefty gains, thanks to the economy's rapid growth in 
the last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stock winners included Ford, up 2 5/8 to 67 1/4; Chrysler, up 1 
5/8 to 58 3/4; Superior Industries, up 1 1/8 to 45 5/8; Alcoa, up 1 7/8 to 74 
1/8; Eaton, up 2 7/8 to 53 3/4; Ingersoll-Rand, up 1 to 41; and Dover, up 1 3/8 
to 60 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline and rail stocks followed industrial issues higher. AMR, parent of 
American Airlines, soared 1 3/8 to 70 7/8, Delta added 1 1/4 to 56 1/4 and 
Norfolk Southern jumped 1 3/8 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many telecommunications and technology stocks rose on renewed optimism about 
capital spending for the much-ballyhooed information highway. Oracle Systems, 
for example, jumped 1 3/8 to 33 1/8 after it won a contract to supply 
multimedia gear and software to Bell Atlantic, which gained 1/2 to 56 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Other winners included Newbridge Networks, up 3 to 65; Comcast, up 1 3/8 to 33 
3/8; DSC Communications, up 1 3/8 to 67 5/8, and General Instrument, up 7/8 to 
60. 
</P>
<P>
 * Health-care stocks rose as investors reacted to new signs of consolidation 
in the industry, with the planned merger between HMOs Takecare and FHP 
International. Among other medical services, U.S. Healthcare gained 1 5/8 to 58 
3/4 and Pacific Physicians jumped 1 3/8 to 26 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telmex slid 1 1/8 to 65 1/2 on the NYSE, as Mexican stocks traded in the 
United States fell broadly. Other losers were Grupo Tribasa, down 2 to 32; 
Grupo Radio Centro, off 1 1/4 to 26 3/4; and Coca-Cola Femsa, which fell 1 3/4 
to 31 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In other foreign markets, Toronto stocks posted a new high, with the TSE-300 
index surging 32.36 points to 4,453.02. In Tokyo, the Nikkei average continued 
to rebound, adding 319.43 points, to 18,443.44. 
</P>
<P>
 In Frankfurt, the DAX average rose 22.15 points, to 2,233.79, but London's 
FTSE-100 index eased 5.4 points to 3,440.6. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields closed somewhat higher as investors traded 
cautiously ahead of inflation figures due out this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year T-bond inched up to 6.24% from 6.22% Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields had plummeted on Friday on news of slower-than-expected job growth 
in December. But some investors fear that recent commodity price increases have 
raised the possibility of a short-term inflation surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will report on December wholesale inflation on Wednesday and on 
December consumer inflation on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The modest, two-week rally in oil prices ended with a bang, as the market 
gave up hope of OPEC agreeing on production cuts soon. February crude tumbled 
65 cents a barrel, to $14.67 a barrel on the New York Merc. 
</P>
<P>
 The Middle East Economic Survey reported that, despite the world oil glut, it 
is highly unlikely that OPEC will push up its scheduled March meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold eased. On the New York Comex, gold for current delivery closed at $385 
an ounce, off $1.40 from Friday. Silver closed at $5.04 an ounce, up 3.7 cents.

FHP SEEKS TO ACQUIRE RIVAL HMO TAKECARE; HEALTH: THE $829-MILLION MERGER WOULD 
FORM THE SECOND LARGEST COVERAGE GROUP IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing a wave of health care mergers that have reshaped the industry in 
recent years, FHP International Corp. said it has agreed to acquire a competing 
health maintenance organization in Northern California for $829 million. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP's proposed acquisition of Takecare Inc., based in Concord in Contra Costa 
County, is the biggest takeover of a managed-care company to date and would 
create the second-largest HMO in California and about the fifth largest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategically, the acquisition would allow FHP, which has 851,000 members, to 
expand its Medicare market into Northern California and Colorado, where it has 
been struggling to establish itself. Takecare, which has 742,000 members, is 
already strong in both regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be a competing bid in the wings. Pittsburgh's wealthy Hillman 
family, which controls 16% of Takecare's 13 million outstanding shares, will 
oppose the FHP deal because "there's another offer available to Takecare that 
would offer greater value to shareholders," said Lawrence M. Wagner, president 
of Hillman Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner would not comment further, and executives of Takecare or FHP would not 
disclose the identity of the potential suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Keaney, an analyst with the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus in St. Louis, 
said a second offer could derail the FHP bid. "This really is a long way from a 
done deal," Keaney said. "There is the risk that the deal will not be 
completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the deal has strong support among other shareholders, 
however, and they expect it to be finalized by the end of June. The transaction 
would also require regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal comes amid a frenzy of health care mergers in recent months, fueled 
in part by the expectation that national health care reform will favor larger 
health care companies that offer a range of services and cover broader 
geographic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately on Monday, Nashville-based Healthtrust Inc. said it will buy 
Dallas-based EPIC Holdings Inc. in a deal valued at $1 billion. Upon completion 
of the acquisition, Healthtrust said it will operate 115 acute care hospitals 
in 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the largest health care merger proposal was the planned union 
of Blue Shield of California and Unihealth America. But that deal, which would 
have created the second-largest HMO in California behind Kaiser Permanente, 
unraveled two months ago over differences in "corporate culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the FHP-Takecare deal is not comparable to the defunct Blue 
Shield-Unihealth proposal, and predicted smooth sailing for FHP, which would 
pay $62 a share for the smaller firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In over-the-counter trading Monday, Takecare's stock shot up $6.50 a share to 
close at $58.25. FHP's stock, also traded on the Nasdaq market, closed at 
$26.50 a share, unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good deal for both parties," said Jack Massimino, an FHP 
executive vice president. "It is a great strategic fit for both organizations, 
and we are very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also lauded the tentative agreement -- which caught them by surprise 
-- saying each side would complement the other by creating a new, powerful 
company that would be a formidable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP is already the nation's largest provider of managed-care services to 
Medicare patients. Under its Senior Plan, about 300,000 Medicare patients 
receive comprehensive medical benefits. FHP officials would like to increase 
that number in the competitive, highly profitable Medicare market. 
</P>
<P>
 But FHP needs to boost its regular membership first, analysts noted, 
especially in Northern California and Colorado, where the company now has only 
a small presence. Federal law requires that for each Medicare member that an 
HMO signs up in a region, it must also sign up a regular member. 
</P>
<P>
 Takecare President R. Judd Jessup said that his company's large number of 
regular members in the Bay Area and Colorado mean that the merged entity would 
be able to add new Medicare recipients quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will be great going forward together," Jessup said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have about 1.6 million members in California, Colorado, 
Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Guam, New Mexico and Nevada, and would have a 
combined annual revenue of $3.5 billion, company officials estimated.

PARENT OF CARL'S JR. PLANS TO OPEN 300 BOSTON CHICKEN OUTLETS IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to cash in on growing consumer demand for healthier restaurant food, 
Carl Karcher Enterprises said Monday it plans to open as many as 300 Boston 
Chicken Inc. restaurants in Southern California and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, under which Anaheim-based Karcher Enterprises is buying Boston 
Chicken franchise rights for an undisclosed amount, is designed to augment 
flagging profits at the parent company of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain by 
giving it a strong presence in what is arguably the nation's fastest-growing 
restaurant segment. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Boston Chicken, a Naperville, Ill.-based rotisserie chicken chain that 
set records when it first offered stock to the public last November, the deal 
is a major piece in its ambitious plan to expand nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken said it was attracted to the real estate held by Karcher 
Enterprises. "Carl's has some of the highest-quality real estate in the 
Southern California market, and we needed a substantial player in the market to 
get our concept going strong." said Mark Stephens, Boston Chicken's chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises President Donald E. Doyle said the company will convert 
some Carl's Jr. stores to Boston Chicken locations. At the same time, the 
company will continue experimenting with new menu items at its Carl's Jr. 
restaurants in an attempt to regain market share from larger, 
better-capitalized competitors in the burger business. 
</P>
<P>
 In planning to open separate chicken restaurants, Karcher Enterprises is 
joining several competitors -- including longtime king Kentucky Fried Chicken 
-- that are rushing to meet the demand for products that are perceived as 
healthy and relatively inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the food concept of the 1990s," said Janet Lowder, a restaurant 
consultant in Rancho Palos Verde. "You've already got an awful lot of 
competition in that non-fried chicken segment, and this deal suggests it's 
going to heat up even more." 
</P>
<P>
 KFC Inc., the Louisville, Ky.-based parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
turned up the heat last summer by spending more than $100 million to roll out 
its new Colonel's Rotisserie Gold chicken line. The company's rotisserie sales 
totaled $175 million for the second half, leading KFC to project that they will 
equal those of fried chicken by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 KFC controls about half of the nation's $7-billion market for fried chicken. 
But investors nonetheless embraced Boston Chicken when the company made its 
first public stock offering in November. Its shares more than doubled in 
first-day trading to close at $48.50, up from $20. Restaurant industry analysts 
were stunned because the chain had fewer than 200 locations nationwide and had 
recently reported a $5.9-million loss on annual revenue of $8.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement pushed Boston Chicken's stock up $3.75 to close at $41 
in Monday's Nasdaq trading, while Karcher Enterprises, also traded on the 
Nasdaq market, surged $2 to $13.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises President Doyle described the Boston Chicken franchise 
purchase as a long-term investment that won't make a significant contribution 
to his company's bottom line until 1995 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a modestly positive effect in the second year, with (profits) 
improving after that," Doyle said. Karcher Enterprises will create a separate 
division to run the chicken business, Doyle said. Currently, Karcher 
Enterprises has 649 Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurants in California, Nevada, 
Oregon, Arizona and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken is moving into Southern California and Sacramento as part of a 
national strategy that calls for more than 400 locations to be open by year's 
end. The company recently agreed to pay $22.3 million for 87 Philadelphia-area 
Roy Rogers restaurants that will be converted to Boston Chicken eateries. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken isn't the only chain eyeing California. Kenny Rogers Roasters, 
a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., chain with 100 units nationwide, plans to add "several 
hundred locations in the next four or five years in the state," spokesman David 
Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken also faces stiff competition from El Pollo Loco, an 
Irvine-based chain with 210 locations in California, Nevada and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, we're a direct competitor," said Ray Perry, El Pollo 
Loco's president. "We've been expecting their arrival, and we have some things 
planned to blunt their arrival. We've got 200 restaurants out here, and they've 
got none, so we think we have a good chance of performing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Doyle said he doesn't expect Boston Chicken to be a direct competitor of the 
649-unit Carl's Jr. chain because "Boston Chicken is clearly positioned as 
takeout meal replacement. It's not part of the day-to-day fast-food 
environment. It almost has the feel of a take-out deli." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens agreed: "The vast majority of our customers say they used to cook at 
home. The next-largest group is consumers who used to order pizza. You have to 
go way down the survey to find fast food." 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers are warming up to chicken because of perceived and real health 
benefits, said Kenneth Berg, chairman of Koo Koo Roo Inc., an eight-unit Los 
Angeles chain that serves broiled, skinless chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rotisserie chicken is healthier than fried foods, obviously, and it's a 
little healthier than beef or pork," Berg said. "But it's not really considered 
a healthy food unless you take the skin off before cooking it, which is what we 
do." Hamburgers Still Rule 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, fast-food chicken restaurants run a distant third to hamburgers 
and pizza.

A DATA ROAD TO SCHOOLS; ON SUMMIT EVE, PLANS FOR FREE INFOHIGHWAY HOOKUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tele-Communications Inc. and Bell Atlantic Corp., which have agreed to merge 
in a $30-billion deal, on Monday unveiled a plan to hook up 26,000 schools to 
the coming information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, which came on the eve of the national information highway 
summit conference to be held today in Los Angeles, appears designed in part to 
blunt rising government concern that the much-ballyhooed, 500-channel universe 
will be accessible only to the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the summit on the UCLA campus, Vice President Al Gore is expected to call 
on an all-star gathering of media and entertainment industry executives to 
ensure that the rapidly converging cable television and telephone operators 
provide easy and affordable access to the myriad informational services over 
their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the participants: Time Warner Chairman Gerald R. Levin, Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner, QVC Network Chief Executive Barry Diller and News 
Corp. Chairman Rupert Murdoch, in addition to Bell Atlantic Chairman Raymond 
Smith and TCI Chief Executive John C. Malone. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable giant TCI and Bell Atlantic, a regional phone company, said their plan 
to wire schools with free access to emerging telecommunications services such 
as the Internet took shape after lawmakers warned them not to let the 
information highway bypass the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the TCI-Bell Atlantic plan, elementary and secondary schools within 
their widespread service area -- about 25% of the schools in the nation -- will 
be given free access to the interactive network that the companies said they 
would spend $15 billion building over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information superhighway has the ability to change the way Americans 
learn," Smith said. "The social benefits of this system can be profound." 
</P>
<P>
 But to what extent the access to TCI and Bell Atlantic's "full-service 
network" will actually be free remained unclear. TCI and Bell Atlantic 
officials said that, while access may be free, usage may not. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, students may not be charged to send electronic mail to their 
teachers, but many of the educational programs on the network may be accessible 
only for a fee. Smith and Malone said there are commercial benefits as well as 
social considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in our enlightened self-interest to make sure the schools are introduced 
to this technology," Malone said. "When a generation of kids learns how to use 
the stuff, that will drive the rest of our business." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone would not say how much it would cost TCI-Bell Atlantic to wire all the 
schools but indicated it was a negligible part of its $15-billion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI and Bell Atlantic appear to be working hard behind the scenes to quell 
concern among lawmakers that there will be costly tollbooths along the 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 In a glitzy, five-city electronic press conference Monday, TCI and Bell 
Atlantic showed off pilot programs of interactive computers in the classroom, 
where students were able to conduct lessons from home with their teachers and 
view each other on a primitive video phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies already seemed to have won the unbridled enthusiasm of one 
potential foe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Edward Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Telecommunications 
Subcommittee, via a live video hookup from Boston, hailed the TCI-Bell Atlantic 
project as "visionary." A TCI official said a letter last December from Markey 
prompted the initiative, and he hoped other cable TV and telephone companies 
would soon follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 While educational programs are frequently trumpeted as one of the benefits 
from the new technology, there is still no consensus on how the electronic 
superhighway will be structured, who will own it and how much it will cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The past year has seen hundreds of announcements from companies -- whether 
they are mega-mergers, like TCI and Bell Atlantic, or software developments 
from "garage programmers" -- as they jockey to position themselves for what is 
expected to be one of the biggest economic markets of the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Still unresolved is how the 35% of U.S. households that do not get cable TV 
will participate in the benefits of the electronic superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 While phone companies are moving ahead to knock down regulatory battles that 
prohibit them from providing many of the same services offered by cable 
companies, they are nonetheless expected to resist the kind of regulations that 
force them to serve low-income and rural customers at a loss.

QVC'S DILLER JUST SAYS NO TO HIGHER BID; MERGERS: DESPITE AN INCREASE IN 
VIACOM'S OFFER, THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK'S CHAIRMAN SAYS HE'LL STAND PAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 QVC Network Chairman Barry Diller said Monday that he does not plan to 
increase his bid for Paramount Communications Inc., despite Viacom Inc.'s move 
last week to boost the cash portion of its offer for the entertainment company. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC is still in the lead, with a cash-and-stock offer valued at $500 million 
more than Viacom's bid at the close of trading Monday. But Wall Street traders 
said they expect Viacom to improve the non-cash portion of its bid before Jan. 
21, when the current tender offers are set to expire. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-month battle for Paramount has taken a toll, Diller acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the process is wildly enervating, I still think Paramount is a 
great opportunity. But the bids are in, and let the public decide. As for me, 
I'm finished," Diller said in an interview in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is, it has gone on much too long," he added. "I think all this 
noise obscures the issue that is most important, which is getting on with the 
management of the business." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Viacom spent much of the day defending its plan to acquire both 
Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. and Paramount in the face of harsh Wall Street 
reaction to its plans. Viacom A shares tumbled $4.25 to $41.875, while Viacom B 
dropped $2.75 to $38.25.  
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Wall Street was exhilarated by the news Friday that Viacom would 
boost its cash offer for 50.1% of Paramount to $105 per share. But traders 
later were vexed to learn that Viacom was reducing the securities offered for 
the remaining 49% of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 One analyst said the maneuver was "just not cricket," adding that he thought 
it hurt Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone's credibility in the financial 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 But other traders happily predicted a higher bid will come from Viacom, now 
that it has reached a merger agreement with Blockbuster. "They bought 
themselves another two weeks," said one stock speculator. "This isn't a winning 
bid."  
</P>
<P>
 Neither QVC nor Viacom are expected to take dramatic action this week, while 
they wait to see how their shares are valued by Wall Street -- and how 
Paramount's board reacts at a scheduled Wednesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, sources in the Viacom camp discouraged the notion 
that they would boost their bid, but they worked hard Monday to defend their 
actions at a media conference hosted by Smith Barney Shearson, Viacom's leading 
investment banker. 
</P>
<P>
 In a presentation at the conference in La Quinta, Viacom Chief Executive Frank 
Biondi Jr. said Viacom and Blockbuster could save about $100 million in 
overhead expenditures through a merger and increase their future revenue by an 
estimated $150 million. If Paramount is acquired, Viacom would expect to reduce 
overhead by an additional $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call with analysts and investors, Blockbuster Chairman H. 
Wayne Huizenga said there was nothing to prevent a third party from bidding for 
Blockbuster, although he doubted that would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga said he and other Blockbuster executives would vote their 22.5% stock 
holdings in Blockbuster in favor of a merger with Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster shares eased 25 cents to $28 Monday, after trading as low as 
$26.25. Paramount slid $1.875 to $77.375, while QVC lost $1.375 to close at 
$39.25. Under the rules of the Paramount auction, the tender offers must expire 
by Feb. 14. Those rules -- accepted by both QVC and Viacom -- effectively 
require the companies to make their final offers by the end of January, since 
securities laws require an extension of 10 business days if a tender offer is 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Diller, Redstone previously has expressed a great reluctance to bid more 
for Paramount. But Redstone could not be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Redstone, however, Diller had never participated in a takeover battle 
until he made QVC's unsolicited bid last September, with initial backing from 
Tele-Communications Inc. Chief Executive John D. Malone. After antitrust 
regulators objected to TCI's role, Malone withdrew, allowing BellSouth Corp., 
among others, to step in as an investor.

 Sega of America to Stop Distributing 'Night Trap' Game: In an unprecedented 
move for the video game industry, Sega's U.S. division said it will stop 
distributing a controversial game that challenges players to save scantily clad 
women from a gang of hooded killers. The company said it will pull the CD 
version of "Night Trap" from the market, re-edit it, and release a new version 
when an industrywide ratings system is in place.As the $5-billion video game 
industry strives for inclusion in the more conventional entertainment industry, 
lawmakers, consumer groups and the companies themselves have begun to call for 
a games rating system and withdrawal from the market of the most graphically 
violent games. In "Night Trap," the player tries to thwart black-hooded killers 
who are intent on capturing sorority sisters. When the women are captured, the 
killer drills through their necks and drains their blood.

 World Sales of Independent Films Off Slightly: Independent film companies 
generated $1.3 billion in sales in the international marketplace for the 
licensing of English language films in the year ended June 30, an American Film 
Marketing Assn. survey showed. The figure is down slightly from $1.3 billion in 
gross revenue earned in the previous fiscal year, but nonetheless was the 
second highest in the association's 14-year history. Revenue from cinemas in 
Europe and Asia were strong, but sales to video, pay and broadcast television 
fell slightly.

 Another Aide Gets Probation in Lincoln S&L Collapse: A bookish computer expert 
swept up in Charles Keating Jr.'s empire was rewarded with probation for 
helping convict Keating of looting Lincoln Savings and swindling investors in 
Lincoln's parent American Continental Corp. Robin Scott Symes, the latest in a 
series of plea-bargainers to get probation, once held the title of Lincoln 
chief executive. He testified, though, that Keating kept powerful control over 
the savings and loan, which failed in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of $3.4 
billion, the costliest bailout ever. Symes, who was put on probation for three 
years, declined to address the court or to comment on his sentence outside.

 American Car Sales Rise in Japan: Sales for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. 
surged in 1993, evidence that American cars are gaining acceptance among 
Japanese motorists.After a lengthy slump in the Japanese car market, Chrysler's 
sales jumped more than 255% last year, to 5,699 cars. Ford's sales rose 50.2%, 
to 5,111 units. "Foreign car makers posted gains in 1993 due to the 
introduction of new models and right-hand-drive vehicles, as well as price 
cuts," said Kunihiko Ono, a vice chief secretary for the Japan Automobile 
Importers Assn.

 Ford Raises Vehicle Prices: The U.S. auto maker raised prices on 11 car lines 
and six truck lines, for an average increase of 0.5%, or $97 a vehicle, across 
all of its model lines.Ford was the second of the Big Three auto makers to 
raise prices for a second time since the 1994 model year began last Oct. 1. 
Industry leader General Motors Corp. said last month that, as of Jan. 3, its 
U.S. car prices would go up an average 0.8%, or $164 a unit, from the 
introductory 1994 prices announced last July. GM also raised its truck prices a 
further 0.6%, or $131.

 MIT Gets $6.5-Million Endowment to Spur Invention: Jerome Lemelson, the most 
prolific living inventor in the United States, set up a $500,000 annual prize 
-- the biggest of its type in the world -- to reward U.S. inventors and 
innovators for their creativity.The prize will be overseen by the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology as part of a $6.5-million program endowed by Lemelson. 
The first prize will be awarded early next year. Last year, Lemelson year gave 
$3.2 million to Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., to support a series of 
projects intended to encourage inventions that could be bases for starting new 
businesses.

CITADEL CITES PROBLEM LOANS IN $37-MILLION QUARTERLY LOSS; THRIFTS: THE PARENT 
OF FIDELITY FEDERAL BANK FACES REGULATORY RESTRICTIONS ON OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF 
ITS SHRINKING CAPITAL BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Citadel Holding, parent of troubled Fidelity Federal Bank, said Monday that it 
expects to report a loss of more than $37 million for the last three months of 
1993 because of large write-offs in its growing portfolio of problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale-based thrift holding company also revealed that the Office of 
Thrift Supervision will soon impose restrictions on its activities because of 
diminishing capital -- moves that federal regulators typically take when a 
thrift is in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions include limits on Citadel's asset growth and give banking 
regulators veto power over new directors and senior executives. The news drove 
down the value of Citadel's stock $2 a share to close at $8 on the American 
Stock Exchange. The stock traded as high as $24 a share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While Citadel's capital still exceeds regulatory minimums, the OTS is 
concerned that the financial institution will be in danger if its losses 
continue at their present pace, said Andre Shih, Citadel's chief financial 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Marginally profitable in recent years, Citadel lost $29.8 million the first 
nine months of 1993. It expects to release its fourth-quarter losses later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel also reiterated a previous announcement that the 42-branch financial 
institution is for sale. But it now says that it wants to transfer about $450 
million in problem assets to a new subsidiary in an attempt to make it more 
attractive to prospective buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the holding company would manage the sale of the problem 
assets, but such a reorganization would occur only if a buyer is found. Citadel 
said the transfer would probably require the financial institution to add 
another another $150 million to loan-loss reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel's problem loans ballooned to $355 million -- or 7.9% of its 
$4.5-billion assets -- on Sept. 30, a figure that was basically unchanged on 
Dec. 31, Shih said. A large percentage of Citadel's loans are secured by 
apartment buildings and commercial real estate, most of which are clustered in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are hit by double whammy," said financial analyst Charlotte Chamberlain 
at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "Their portfolio is concentrated 
in multifamily and commercial projects in the part of California that's at 
ground zero for the recession. That's tough to work your way out of."

 Attorneys Ask Judge to Reject Prudential Settlement: Lawyers representing 
about 1,000 investors have asked a federal judge in New Orleans to reject a 
proposed $120-million settlement between Prudential Securities Inc. and its 
energy-partnership investors. U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais has 
scheduled a Jan. 19 fairness hearing on the settlement between the brokerage 
firm and 137,000 investors who accuse Prudential Securities, a unit of the 
Prudential Insurance Co. of America, of fraud and misrepresentation during the 
1980s. The lawyers contend that the settlement negotiated by class-action 
attorneys would leave only $90 million for investors after the legal fees are 
paid. Moreover, they contend that investors are entitled to at least $780 
million for out-of-pocket losses and 6% interest that would have been earned if 
the money had been invested elsewhere.

CABLE EXECUTIVES OK VOLUNTARY RATINGS; TELEVISION: THE AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE 
ALSO CALLS FOR AN INDEPENDENT MONITOR FOR VIOLENT PROGRAMMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN EDWARDS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Representatives from the cable TV industry have agreed in principle to develop 
a voluntary rating system for their programs and to establish an outside 
monitor for violent content. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Monday that the agreement is very preliminary, with no details 
worked out and nothing on paper. It came at a meeting Friday with Sen. Paul 
Simon, D-Ill., who has been the most vocal congressional advocate of 
self-policing on the part of the industry. He has warned broadcasters that 
failure to take action themselves will very likely lead to legislative 
solutions, and a number of his colleagues have introduced a wide variety of 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon met separately the same day with the heads of the three major broadcast 
networks -- CBS President Howard Stringer, Capital Cities/ABC Chairman Thomas 
Murphy and NBC President and CEO Robert Wright. With cable taking this 
initiative, the networks may be under greater pressure to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable leaders attending their meeting included Turner Broadcasting's Ted 
Turner and Turner's head of legislative affairs, Bert Carp; HBO Chairman and 
CEO Michael Fuchs; Time Warner Senior Vice President Tim Boggs; and Showtime 
Chairman and CEO Tony Cox. They are part of a committee of the National Cable 
Television Assn., which meets regularly to discuss issues that cut across the 
industry. Last fall the committee announced an agreement to join over-the-air 
broadcast networks in airing advisories for programs with violent content. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings were held at Simon's request. Through a spokesman, the senator 
Monday described the meetings as "positive and constructive." Sources said 
Simon told the industry representatives that he would leave the selection of a 
monitor and the establishment of a rating system to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Torie Clark, a spokesman for the National Cable Television Assn., said Monday 
that it had been a "very good meeting" and that the discussion of the use of an 
outside monitor was part of a continuing conversation between the industry and 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rating system and outside monitor were the key elements of a 10-part 
proposal put forth by representatives of the cable industry. The other eight 
elements were described by one source familiar with the proposal as "window 
dressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said other ideas under discussion included the use of more 
advisories, the placement of promos for violent programs during times when 
children would not be watching, and the use of creative possibilities of the 
industry to address the question of violence in society at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While sources say the networks were taken a bit by surprise by the cable 
industry proposals, the networks have told Simon they will meet with their 
cable counterparts to discuss them. In the past, they have resisted any such 
ideas. Now, however, they are beginning to change. ABC is said to be the most 
receptive to the cable plan, with NBC following and CBS the least enthusiastic. 
If the networks decide not to go along with the proposal, cable representatives 
will have to decide whether to go it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case the problem would be that the networks hold 60% of the viewing 
audience, and an agreement that didn't include them would carry far less 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Network representatives have said it is "difficult to be paired with cable," 
contending that the broadcast networks have already cleaned up their schedules 
and that cable is a far worse offender. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest potential stumbling blocks will be advertiser reaction to a 
rating system, which one source described as "a very tricky issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The rating system could be used much as the movie industry uses its voluntary 
rating system -- to warn parents of content that is unsuitable for certain age 
groups. Or it could work in consort with the so-called "V-chip," a technology 
that would allow the owner of a television set to block out programs that have 
certain ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that any system that was developed would take into account the 
difference between premium channels and basic service.

US WEST ADDS FOUR MORE SITES TO VIDEO PLANS; TELECOMMUNICATIONS: THE REGIONAL 
PHONE COMPANY, SEEKING FCC APPROVAL, PLANS ANOTHER 15 LOCALES BY END OF '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 US West identified four more sites Monday for its proposed multimedia network 
that would bring movies, home shopping, games and pay-per-view video into phone 
customers' homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional phone company said it will add Denver; Minneapolis-St. Paul; 
Boise, Idaho, and Portland, Ore., to the information superhighway already under 
construction in Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 US West said it plans to ask the Federal Communications Commission to approve 
its expanded plans and said about 15 more cities will be added to the 
construction list by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is committed to spend at least $750 million over the next two 
years toward construction of the system. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of next week, US West will file applications with the FCC covering 
292,000 homes and businesses in Minneapolis-St. Paul and 132,000 homes and 
businesses in Portland, said Gary Ames, president and chief executive of US 
West Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on how quickly the FCC acts on its applications, the company hopes 
to begin construction in Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Portland this year 
and complete construction in the neighborhoods included in the upcoming filings 
by the end of next year, Ames said. The company is still reviewing the 
timetable for construction in Boise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers eventually will be able to link their phones and televisions to 
participate in meetings, shop at their favorite stores and choose from hundreds 
of movies and TV programs whenever they want. 
</P>
<P>
 Video classrooms and phone calls also will be possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Work already is under way on the company's multimedia network in Omaha, where 
US West launched the project. In late December, the FCC approved US West's 
application to try out video dial-tone service there.  
</P>
<P>
 The first multimedia services, including home shopping, movies on demand, 
interactive games and enhanced pay-per-view video programs, will be available 
to as many as 2,500 Omaha homes and businesses in a technical trial beginning 
during the second quarter of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial will be expanded to a market trial involving 60,000 homes and 
businesses by late summer or early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took six months to obtain the FCC's approval for Omaha," Ames said. "We 
can't afford to wait for completion of the Omaha trials to submit the next set 
of applications.

AMERICAN BLOOD INSTITUTE FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gerant Companies Inc. said Monday that its commercial blood bank subsidiary 
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week and has ceased operations 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 American Blood Institute, a subsidiary of Beverly Hills-based Gerant, was a 
major supplier of blood to Southland hospitals and had an estimated 13% share 
of the region's blood market, Gerant officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryle Babbitt, director of donor services for American Red Cross Blood 
Services in Southern California, said ABI's withdrawal from the market has had 
a significant impact on local blood supplies, particularly during the usual 
holiday season shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt said ABI supplied about 40,000 units of blood a year to Southern 
California, compared to about 300,000 annually for the Red Cross. Since ABI 
halted its local operations on Dec. 6, the Red Cross has been supplying an 
additional 1,000 units of blood each week beyond its normal 7,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerant said it has implemented an orderly transition of ABI's operations to 
other blood banks in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Moran, Gerant's president and chief executive, said California's high 
operating costs made it too expensive for ABI to collect blood here. ABI had 
revenue of $7.4 million in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerant also said it was unable to obtain support from creditors for a 
restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 California is the only state in the nation that requires licensed personnel, 
such as medical technicians, registered nurses or doctors, to draw blood, 
Babbitt said.

 Standard & Poor's to Rate Bond Mutual Funds: The credit-rating company known 
for its grades on individual bonds is planning to start rating bond mutual 
funds for market risk. S&P's service comes as savers continue to pour money 
into "fixed-income" mutual funds in search of higher yields, sometimes under 
the belief that their principal is always safe. The new ratings will try to 
account for changes in interest rates, the value of the dollar and other 
factors that might hurt the prices of bonds and the mutual funds that buy them.

PENSION FUND MANAGERS HOPEFUL U.S. WILL LIFT EMBARGO AGAINST VIETNAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of U.S. pension fund managers held talks with Vietnamese officials 
here Monday, and their leader said they hope the U.S. economic embargo against 
Vietnam will be lifted soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Aldrich, president of Boston-based Aldrich, Eastman & Waltch, said they 
are investigating investment prospects for when the embargo is lifted, "which I 
believe everyone in this group hopes happens very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 "The prospects of collaborating in future economic ventures are very 
attractive," Aldrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Vietnam is growing economically, "and that suggests to all of us who 
are long-term investors that there should be ample opportunity to invest." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, on a week's visit to Vietnam, includes pension fund managers from 
Atlantic Richfield, American Telephone & Telegraph, General Motors, BellSouth, 
Eastman Kodak and IBM. They said in a statement they represented investment 
capital of more than $140 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among officials they met was Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap, 81-year-old architect of the 
Vietnamese communist victory over U.S.-backed South Vietnam in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Their visit added pressure on President Clinton to lift the embargo and 
establish diplomatic relations with Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Five U.S. senators, the majority of a seven-man Energy Committee delegation, 
said in Hanoi on Sunday that they would urge Clinton to end the sanctions and 
normalize relations now that Vietnam is cooperating fully in efforts to account 
for more than 2,000 U.S. servicemen listed as missing in action in Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Command chief Adm. Charles Larson is due here next Sunday to assess 
progress in the MIA hunt, which Clinton says is his top priority in ties with 
Vietnam. He will be the most senior U.S. military officer to visit Vietnam 
since the war.

ARCO WILL TAKE $450-MILLION CHARGE FOR REORGANIZATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little to the surprise of Wall Street analysts, Atlantic Richfield Co. said 
Monday that a companywide reorganization announced last fall would result in an 
after-tax charge of $450 million against the firm's fourth-quarter earnings, 
which will be announced Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of the charge representing an outlay of cash -- $60 million -- 
will be used for severance pay, insurance and other costs associated with 
layoffs, according to Al Greenstein, spokesman for the Los Angeles-based firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Monday's announcement, Arco also raised its estimate of jobs to be 
eliminated in the reorganization to as many as 1,300 by early next year. The 
company previously had estimated that 900 to 1,000 jobs would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco announced in October that it essentially would end its hunt for oil in 
the Lower 48 states in its most extensive restructuring since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arco has always been aggressive on a financial basis," said Andrea Esposito, 
a director in corporate finance and an analyst at Standard & Poor's who follows 
the oil and gas industry. "The charge is not a surprise to me, not even the 
size of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Arco shares slipped 37.5 cents to $107.625 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, after trading as low as $106.50.

SUIT CHALLENGES OIL DRILLING IN ALASKA RECREATION AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists, commercial fishing groups and the Ninilchik Traditional 
Council have filed suit to stop a controversial oil-lease sale in Alaska's Cook 
Inlet, where several U.S. oil companies have hoped to find new petroleum 
reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lease sale is offshore of the most popular recreation area of the 
state," said Ann L. Rothe, executive director of Trustees for Alaska, the 
nonprofit law firm that filed the suit Friday in Alaska Superior Court in 
Kenai. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the largely offshore tract is along the coast of famed Kenai 
Peninsula, which some commercial fishermen refer to as "the breadbasket of 
Alaska." 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs want an injunction blocking the state's sale Jan. 25 of an area 
designated Lease Sale 78.  
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Assistant Atty. Gen. Kyle Parker, who said the state is in a revenue 
"crunch," described the action as a general attack on Alaska's oil-lease 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 New revenues from oil leases, Parker said Monday, are of increasing importance 
as the state's tax income dwindles. Fully 85% of the state's revenue comes from 
taxes on existing oil production, but that income is declining as North Slope 
production slows. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Atlantic Richfield Co. struck promising amounts of oil at its Sunfish 
site in 1991, several energy companies have expressed renewed interest in the 
Cook Inlet area, which first was explored in the 1950s. The Sunfish discovery 
-- which Arco of late has described as less promising than it once seemed -- is 
about six miles from part of the proposed leasehold. 
</P>
<P>
 The lease sale area is the sole tract in Cook Inlet to be offered for lease in 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only game in town until 1996," Parker said. "And the state's in a 
crunch. The state is going to have to look to areas (for oil exploration) where 
they haven't looked before. And people (in Alaska) will have to recognize that 
the schools and buses that they depend on come from oil." 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs, who have attempted to stop oil lease sales in other areas 
around Alaska, are skeptical of state claims that restrictions on drilling 
during fishing season and a requirement that oil companies use horizontal 
drilling techniques could make oil production in the tract safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This lease is ill-advised," Rothe said. "The state is so focused on bringing 
in oil dollars that they aren't taking a careful look at the impact on local 
economies."

MALONE: DAVIS HAS BROUGHT ABOUT HIS OWN DOWNFALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's pay-back time in mogul land. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Paramount Communications Chairman Martin S. Davis trashed cable TV 
executive John C. Malone in an interview in Vanity Fair magazine, saying: "He 
believes in nothing, he stands for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Malone has responded, saying: "I'm told that it was an old man venting his 
spleen basically." Malone, chief executive of Tele-Communications Inc., also 
said in an interview Monday that he thought Davis had brought about his own 
downfall at Paramount, where he has no guarantee of a job after the bidding war 
between QVC and Viacom/Blockbuster is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a tragedy for Marty because I think he could have had everything 
he wanted," he said. "He could have stayed independent and all that. I think he 
panicked. He thought (QVC Chairman Barry Diller) was going to come get him, and 
if he had never done the deal with (Viacom Chairman) Sumner (Redstone), which 
was an incredibly stupid deal for Paramount, Barry probably never would have 
been able to come get him." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone also expressed confidence that Diller will prevail on Paramount, 
saying: "Barry can have it if he wants it. . . . Because the market thinks that 
Viacom stock with Blockbuster is a turkey. Barry has the deep pockets in this 
game, so he can win it if he wants." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Malone criticized the planned merger between Viacom and 
Blockbuster Entertainment, which was engineered by Redstone and Blockbuster 
Chairman H. Wayne Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wayne offered to merge with my little Liberty Media this summer," Malone 
said. "He is looking for anybody willing to trade real long-term stock for his 
short-term paper, and he found the guy. At a 20% premium. Now Sumner is all of 
a sudden saying gee, maybe someone will come and outbid me for Blockbuster. He 
should be so lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone last October sold TCI to Bell Atlantic Corp. in a $30-billion deal. At 
the time of the deal, Malone said he was "going fishing," although he would 
retain the title of vice chairman and serve as a director of the newly merger 
Bell Atlantic-TCI. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Malone said he intends to remain active in the company, acting as a 
kind of super-consultant, strategist and scout for joint ventures and new 
businesses. However, Malone says that independent of Bell Atlantic-TCI he may 
become a venture capitalist investing in technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Malone said he may become involved in some spinoff technology-based 
manufacturing companies owned by TCI that Bell Atlantic cannot acquire because 
of government prohibitions against allowing the Baby Bell in the equipment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think those rules will go away in three to five years but in the interim I 
think that is something I would enjoy messing around with," Malone said.

TROUBLING TIME FOR THE ARBS (POOR BABIES!); SPECULATORS: THE PARAMOUNT AFFAIR 
HAS BEEN NOTHING LIKE THE LUCRATIVE DEALS OF THE '80S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was late Friday afternoon. A fierce winter storm was closing in on 
Manhattan, and Viacom Inc. had just ended weeks of speculation by making a new 
bid for Paramount Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 As the news flashed across the Dow Jones ticker, the speculators of Wall 
Street at first were ecstatic: $105 a share! A merger with Blockbuster! "Wow!" 
panted one arbitrager who asked not to be identified. "Awesome! Unbelievable!" 
</P>
<P>
 Soon enough, though, it became clear that Viacom's latest bid wasn't so strong 
after all. The cash amount outdistanced QVC's offer, but the accompanying 
passel of stock watered it down to a smaller sum per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecstasy turned to irritation, then to anger. This Paramount deal was really 
becoming a dog. Too much time and trouble. Too much wimpy bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "An insult," snapped another arbitrager -- especially since it had kept him 
from beating the storm home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people would sooner sympathize with Joey Buttafuoco than with stock 
arbitragers, or "arbs," whose profession was made infamous a decade ago with 
the conviction of swindler Ivan Boesky. 
</P>
<P>
 While conventional arbitrage is simply a technique for taking advantage of 
price anomalies in the stock market, so-called risk arbitrage -- popularized in 
the 1980s and exercised energetically amid the Paramount deal-making -- is 
short-term speculation, plain and simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbs don't care about long-term value or sound management or -- that dreaded 
buzzword -- synergy. They have a simple agenda: get more money now. Dozens of 
arbitrage funds and other short-term investors are believed to control about a 
fourth of Paramount shares, so they are an important constituency for would-be 
buyers Viacom and QVC. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in part to woo this constituency that Friday's Viacom/Blockbuster bid 
included a much higher cash component than Viacom's earlier offers, but less 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this deal has not worked out as the arbs had hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, it looked golden: Viacom and Paramount announced a merger, and then 
QVC came forward with a hostile bid of a much higher value. Even now, anyone 
who bought Paramount shares right after the original merger announcement -- or 
who listened to the rumors and bought before -- is sitting pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Things started getting ugly, though, as Viacom and QVC launched competing 
tender offers with different expiration dates and hard-to-value stock 
components. The bidders' stock began to fall, as investors worried about a 
Paramount acquisition's impact on earnings. That pushed down the price of the 
offers. The arbitrage game grew complicated as traders hedged their positions 
in all three stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the battle moved to the courtroom, with QVC challenging the Paramount 
board's attempt to stick by Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 If QVC won in court, it seemed, a full-fledged auction would drive Paramount's 
price much higher. And QVC, indeed, got its victory -- in a decision, handed 
down the night before Thanksgiving, that created turmoil in the markets once 
again. A couple of weeks later, an appellate court upheld the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 But QVC upped its offer only a tiny bit. The bidding war was fizzling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started out as a real fireplug, but it hasn't finished that way," said 
Mathew Greco, editor of the newsletter Mergers and Corporate Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 All through the holidays, the arbs waited impatiently for Viacom to respond. 
There was no hard information -- only guesswork masquerading as informed 
opinion. As the Jan. 7 deadline approached, it seemed Viacom might walk away 
from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, on Friday, Viacom announced its merger with Blockbuster, along with a 
new offer for Paramount -- one that turned out to be lower than the QVC bid on 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot remember a situation where two guys were so hungry for a company and 
ended up playing this kind of chicken," said Curtis Schenker, an arbitrager 
with Scoggin Capital Management in New York, with more than a hint of 
frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, for the glory days! In '80s deals, such as RJR Nabisco and Revlon Inc., 
short-term traders made a killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many arbs are still hoping Viacom will come back with a higher offer this 
week, to reinvigorate the all-too-tepid bidding war, but some are ready to get 
out: about 22% of Paramount shareholders, including an unknown number of arbs, 
already have tendered their shares to QVC.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: PAST SUPER BOWL ADVERTISERS BECOME NO-SHOWS IN '94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Super Bowl is a marketer's haven -- or so goes the super hype. But Subaru 
is still smarting -- if not shaken -- from its super flop during last year's 
big game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese car maker -- which aired five new TV spots during the 1993 Super 
Bowl -- woke up the following day to discover that its commercials were 
chastised by an independent panel of consumers in USA Today, which rated the 
ads as the very worst aired the entire Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers won't hear a peep from Subaru this year as it joins a growing list 
of advertisers who believe that a no-show on Super Bowl Sunday can be a wise 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've since concluded that is a game we're not well-suited for," said Richard 
Marshall, a Subaru spokesman. Besides saving the company $2 million in 
broadcast time -- it might also save it some humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the ugly possibility of national ridicule is hardly stopping some of the 
nation's biggest marketers from spending $900,000 for every 30 seconds of TV 
commercial time they buy. NBC will rake in more than $50 million in ad revenues 
from the big game on Jan. 30 at Atlanta's Georgia Dome. Only three ad slots are 
still available, said an NBC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But marketing experts warn that placing a TV spot on the Super Bowl guarantees 
just one thing: a super bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody gets their money's worth in ad value -- only in ego satisfaction," 
said Walter A. Woods, a Carrollton, Ga.-based marketing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advertisers aren't even reaching people who are listening to them," said 
Katharine D. Paine, president of the Portsmith, N.H.-based Delahaye Group Inc. 
During commercials most viewers are typically "going to the bathroom, opening 
beer or replenishing the chip dish." 
</P>
<P>
 And if, by some miracle, all 1.3 billion Super Bowl TV viewers worldwide watch 
the same 30-second TV spot, that doesn't mean they're going to rush out and buy 
the product, said Tom Collins, a New York-based author and marketing 
consultant. Collins suggests that the money might be better spent on 
advertising that actually cultivates purchases by new customers -- like direct 
mail ads or TV infomercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, unless an advertiser's Super Bowl commercial is a real humdinger, 
"they might as well be giving their money to the Red Cross," said Scott Purvis, 
president of Gallup & Robinson Inc., a Princeton, N.J. marketing research firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason why several other companies are joining Subaru in not 
returning for the 1994 Super Bowl, including Ford, Lee Apparel, Gillette, 
Miller Brewing Co., Coopers & Lybrand and Servistar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not worth all that money if you're not introducing a new product," said 
Gerry Donnelly, advertising manager for Ford's Lincoln/Mercury division, which 
advertised a new model on last year's telecast. "There are other ways to spend 
that kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Coca-Cola, which has snubbed the Super Bowl as an ad forum for several years, 
is passing again this year. "It doesn't fit into our marketing strategy," 
company spokesman Ben Deutsch said. 
</P>
<P>
 But such skepticism doesn't bother most major advertisers -- especially those 
that plan to introduce new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler -- which hasn't advertised in a Super Bowl for eight years -- is 
betting big time on this Super Bowl as the best place to introduce the Neon, 
its new, highly touted compact car. Chrysler will air four 30-second ads -- 
created especially for the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But auto makers in particular have received very poor consumer reaction to 
Super Bowl advertising. Over the past three Super Bowls, not a single 
automotive advertiser registered more than 10% recall among consumers the day 
after the game, said Gallup's Purvis. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't bother Chrysler. "We want to make as much noise as we can -- as 
quickly as we can -- across America," said Jim Julow, director of marketing 
operations at Chrysler Corp. "You can't find a better place to do it than the 
Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 One advertiser, Frito-Lay, will introduce two new products. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we were panned for our ads -- which we won't be -- we're still going 
to accomplish what we want in terms of awareness of our new products," said 
Brock Leach, vice president of brand marketing at Frito-Lay, which will air ads 
for new Wavy Lay's potato chips and for recently introduced Doritos brand 
Tortilla Thins. 
</P>
<P>
 Frito-Lay will sponsor the Super Bowl's country music-themed halftime show. 
The Doritos ad features Chevy Chase -- on network TV for the first time since 
his short-lived Fox Television talk show was dumped. And the Lay's ad will be a 
new twist on the comical "Lay's Challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Three major sneaker makers have also bought broadcast time for this year's 
Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Converse will introduce its $110 "Backjam" basketball shoe in a new TV spot -- 
a "Wizard of Oz" take-off -- featuring basketball star Larry Johnson as the 
ever-silly "Grandmama" 
</P>
<P>
 "No single event can get you this kind of exposure," said Joanna Jacobson, 
senior vice president of marketing at Converse. "The picking and panning of 
Super Bowl commercials has become a sport in itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Super Bowl advertiser Nike has two ads in the hopper -- both about 
the "unsung heroes of basketball," said Keith Peters, a Nike spokesman. The ads 
-- filmed on basketball courts across the country -- will also feature Michael 
Jordan and other Nike sports heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reebok, meanwhile, will air a one-minute ad featuring basketball sensation 
Shaquille O'Neal singing a song from his new rap album. "Remember, this is the 
Super Bowl of advertising," said Reebok spokesman David Ropes. "You've got to 
show up if you want to be a player." Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Three veteran Southern California advertising executives have joined forces to 
form Ground Zero in Venice and have already landed their first client, the 
Daily Grill restaurant chain. . . . Creative Images, a full-service ad agency, 
has opened in Burbank. . . . The Long Beach car audio systems firm Kenwood 
U.S.A. has selected San Francisco-based Citron Haligman Bedecarre to handle its 
$5-million ad account formerly handled by Kresser/Craig of Santa Monica. . . . 
It will be slim pickings for new jobs in the public relations field in 1994, 
with PR firms expected to hire fewer than two entry-level employees per office, 
according to a survey by the BohleCompany, a Los Angeles-based PR firm. . . . 
Marketers are showing strong interest in the Southern California Gay and 
Lesbian Exposition 1994, to be held Jan. 28-30 at Santa Monica Airport. Not 
This Year A number of advertisers that bought into last year's Super Bowl have 
begged off the event this year. Here are what advertisers said are the reasons 
they aren't returning: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lee Apparel: Committed broadcast money instead to upcoming Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ford: No new product to introduce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gillette: No new product to introduce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Subaru: Dissatisfied with results from last year's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miller Brewing: Shut out when Anheuser-Busch became exclusive beer sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Servistar: Reallocating ad budget. Super Hype 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers are paying $900,000 for each 30-second segment of commercial time 
on NBC's telecast of the Super Bowl. Some of the major Super Bowl advertisers 
and the contents of their spots: 
</P>
<P>
 * Anheuser-Busch: Bud Bowl ads feature former coaches Mike Ditka and "Bum" 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chrysler: Four ads to introduce the Neon compact car. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike: Ads promoting "unsung heroes" of basketball -- and Michael Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reebok: Shaquille O'Neal as basketball star-turned-rap singer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Converse: A new line of shoes to be introduced by "Grandmama" hoopster Larry 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * McDonald's: Two NFL field goal kickers square off in an exaggerated 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Frito-Lay: An ad introducing Wavy Lay's potato chips and Chevy Chase for 
Doritos. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pepsi: Several flashy, new ads to promote Pepsi and Diet Pepsi brands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Master Lock: One ad promoting durability of lock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 7-Up: The animated 7-Up "spot" returns for another adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Express, Goodyear and Alamo Car Rental will also be advertising, but 
information about their ads was not available.

 Amgen Inc. said Lowell Sears, its acting chief financial officer and senior 
vice president for Asia-Pacific operations, plans to resign March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, 42, said in a statement last week that he was leaving Thousand 
Oaks-based Amgen, the nation's leading biotechnology concern, to explore new 
challenges. Amgen spokesman David Kaye added that Sears also quit because he 
thought that he was unlikely to become Amgen's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears joined Amgen in 1986 and was its chief financial officer full-time 
between 1988 and 1992, when he assumed the additional responsibility for 
Amgen's Pacific Rim business. Amgen expects to name a new chief financial 
officer in a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding Sears as head of Amgen's Pacific Rim operations will be Daryl Hill, 
48. A 10-year Amgen veteran, Hill was previously the company's vice president 
for quality assurance, a post he had held since 1988. Plasma & Materials 
Technologies Inc., a Chatsworth-based supplier to the semiconductor industry, 
named John A. Rollwagen, former acting deputy secretary of Commerce and chief 
executive of Cray Research Inc., as chairman of its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen was nominated by President Clinton last year as Commerce deputy 
secretary. But after doing the job on an acting basis for five months, 
Rollwagen concluded that he could better serve industry and government in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to being tapped for the Commerce post, Rollwagen served as a trade 
adviser to former Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen headed supercomputer-maker Cray, based in Mendota Heights, Minn., 
from 1977 to January, 1992. During his tenure, Cray grew from a start-up 
operation with fewer than 100 employees to a Fortune 500 company with nearly $1 
billion in sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollwagen said he saw similarities between Cray in its early days and Plasma & 
Materials, especially the latter's "entrepreneurial culture. You can sense 
success." S. Jesse Stancarone has been appointed vice president and chief 
information officer of Leslie's Poolmart. Chatsworth-based Leslie's sells 
swimming pool supplies and related products through 158 retail stores in 26 
states, including a nationwide mail-order catalogue.

PROPERTY VALUES: MISTAKEN FORECLOSURE LIST AT FAULT FOR HOMEOWNERS' WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GALPERIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year ended in confusion and frustration for Warren and Norma Becker of 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before the new year, the Beckers received a letter from a Sherman 
Oaks attorney, Steven A. Wolvek, which said: "I noticed that your home is 
involved in a foreclosure processing. . . . If you do not have an attorney, 
then please feel free to contact my office so you can set an appointment for a 
free consultation." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, another letter came in the mail -- this one from Basic Mortgage 
Group Inc., a California mortgage lender.  
</P>
<P>
 The letter was written in longhand and photocopied to make it look nice and 
personal. It urged the Beckers to call so that they could deal with their loan 
default and start sleeping better at night. "I understand the pressure and 
stress you must be under at this time, but take 5 minutes to call me . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The Beckers were certain that they couldn't possibly be facing foreclosure on 
any of their residential or commercial properties, but they were nervous. "When 
I got the first letter, I felt a pit in my stomach," Warren Becker recalled. "I 
knew that everything was paid up, but it makes you feel real low. I was worried 
about the experience of going through a lawyer and about having future problems 
with lenders. It's really scary." 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the Beckers are current on all their loans. A check by them 
with Stewart Title in Glendale confirmed that everything was OK, but the 
letters kept coming. After some research, the Beckers discovered that one of 
the state's largest publishers of foreclosure lists had mistakenly printed a 
notice of default with the Beckers' name and address. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beckers now know firsthand just how easy it is for a mistake to make its 
way through various information services and potentially cause headaches for 
property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Trust deeds are basically three-party legal instruments which are created to 
secure real estate loans. In California, when a property owner (called the 
trustor) borrows money from a lender (called the beneficiary), they do so by 
signing a promissory note to repay the debt. The borrower also signs a trust 
deed giving a neutral third party (called the trustee) the power to foreclose 
and sell the property if the borrower doesn't make good on his or her loan 
obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 After two missed payments (about 30 days late), most lenders generally report 
the default to credit bureaus. If nothing is done to correct the situation 
within about 75 days, the lender files an official notice of default (NOD) -- 
which begins the foreclosure process. Once a notice of default has been filed, 
there's a 90-day period between the notice of default and the recording of a 
notice of trustee's sale. The borrower has up to five business days before the 
date of sale to catch up on their loan payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are several steps in the process where a mistake can happen," said 
Ronald M. Frumkin, publisher of Redloc Information Services in Santa Ana, which 
published the Beckers' mistaken notice of default for its own subscribers, and 
for readers of the Los Angeles Daily Commerce. Attorneys, lenders, property 
investors and some credit companies use these lists to generate new business, 
Frumkin explained, but there's no way these foreclosure listings can be 100% 
accurate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each month Redloc publishes about 20,000 notices of pending trustee sales and 
of completed sales in 13 California counties. Los Angeles County alone has 300 
to 400 notices daily. Mistakes happen several times a week, Frumkin conceded. 
People call up surprised to find themselves on a list of defaulting borrowers. 
"Sometimes they're irate and we have to calm them down," Frumkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 NODs that are filed with the Los Angeles County recorder don't have to include 
a legal description or property address. The NODs merely reference an original 
deed of trust and the name or names of the borrower, or trustor. Redloc 
compiles lists of NODs and then looks up the original deeds of trust on 
microfilm to get the legal description of the property. Then, from the county 
assessor, Redloc gets the street address of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 A clerk may look up the wrong deed of trust, the legal description may be 
copied wrong, the legal description may be matched with the wrong parcel or an 
error in entering all this information into the computer may occur, Frumkin 
said. When this happens, a retraction is published. "It would definitely be a 
better system if the trustees printed an address or legal description on the 
NOD," Frumkin said. "It would eliminate a lot of errors." 
</P>
<P>
 While Frumkin's idea may be a good one, the California Trustee's Assn. doesn't 
agree with him. "If you require a legal description on NODs, it will often be 
wrong," said Phillip Adleson, corporate counsel to the association. "We have a 
very complex system. There are so many problems," he said. The system won't get 
any better by adding more requirements, Adleson argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is making people who are in default aware of their situation," he 
said, and that is being accomplished with NODs being sent to wayward borrowers 
by both regular and certified mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Beckers were never really facing foreclosure, they never got any 
official notice of default. They did get plenty of other letters, though. It 
seemed to the Beckers that the vultures were circling. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Becker said that when he tried to contact attorney Wolvek about the 
letter, Wolvek didn't return his calls and his office declined to say where 
they had gotten the Beckers' name and address. 
</P>
<P>
 And Wolvek did not return any of my calls seeking a comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted that attorneys are presumed to be violating the rules of 
their own profession if they send out a solicitation letter to a non-client, 
"unless the envelope bears an 'advertising' notation to enable the recipient to 
distinguish such advertising from legal correspondence," according to the 
California State Bar. There was no such notation on the Beckers' correspondence 
from Wolvek. 
</P>
<P>
 One also can't help but wonder about attorneys who don't return phone calls. 
Becker said his own attorney didn't return his calls about the "foreclosure" 
letters. Warren Becker said he's now scratched that attorney's name off of his 
list. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the letters the Beckers received in the mail were disturbing. A firm 
called Homesavers Unlimited offered for $395 to "get your home out of 
foreclosure today" -- probably with a bankruptcy filing. Another letter offered 
to provide the Beckers with a new loan or, if they prefer, to offer their 
property for sale through the multiple listings. Yet another letter said that, 
"If the responsibility has fallen on your shoulders to save your family's home, 
give me a call right now. I can help you get back on your feet with a loan. . . 
. P.S. If I'm out helping someone when you call, please leave me a message." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's looking for some business. That's the way it is," said Jonathan 
Byron, a loan representative with Basic Mortgage Group Inc., which was one of 
the Beckers' solicitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes in transcription and in the compiling of foreclosure lists occur 
frequently, said Claudia Queen, vice president and residential sales manager 
for Stewart Title in Glendale. She was recently perusing the listings of 
defaults and noticed one valuable property in default on a $470,000 loan. In 
fact, Queen said, the publisher of the listing was off by two digits -- the 
default was a whopping $47 million. "That's quite a mistake," Queen said. "I 
have a sense that it happens very often."

 BACK OF THE BUS: If Don Roth's legal troubles hadn't forced him to resign as a 
county supervisor, he would have become vice chairman at ceremonies today and 
then chairman in 1995. But that does not mean his appointed successor, William 
G. Steiner, will step into his place. Steiner learned recently he must go to 
the bottom of the rotation. . . . The beneficiary: Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez, 
who becomes vice chairman today when Supervisor Thomas F. Riley takes over as 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE'S 41: Clare Walker was twice named the most valuable girls' basketball 
player of the Sunset League, and tonight in a ceremony before its 7 p.m. 
tip-off against fifth-ranked Fountain Valley, Huntington Beach will retire her 
jersey No. 41. . . . During her senior season, Walker averaged 20.7 points and 
14.7 rebounds per game and helped the Oilers win the league title. Now a 
redshirt freshman at Pepperdine, she is sitting out this year because of a knee 
injury but expects to make a full recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 REAL PEACE? General Ariel Sharon, above, hero of the Yom Kippur War and still 
politically active in Israel, will speak to local Jewish groups at the Hyatt 
Regency Hotel in Irvine Thursday night. His topic: the latest Middle East peace 
agreement. "He's not happy with it and neither are many of us," says Rabbi 
David Eliezrie from the North County Chabad Center. . . . Sharon, who's on a 
national tour, will hold other meetings that day with local Jewish leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 HOT TALK? "Subversity," a public affairs program at UC Irvine radio station 
KUCI, kicks off its new season today, and for the first time it's a call-in 
show. Host Daniel C. Tsang expects strong reaction to the first guests: Members 
of the Fountain Valley Student Alliance, the gay support group at the high 
school. . . . The Huntington Beach Union High School District board will 
discuss tonight whether the group should be allowed to meet. "It's a hot 
topic," says Tsang, "but we're hoping for a reasonable discussion."

 GIMME SHELTER: If applicants for low-income housing status find it tough to 
get in Burbank (A1), just check out Los Angeles. L.A. requested applicants four 
years ago, got 80,000 . . . and closed the books. "We've worked about halfway 
through that list," said a Housing Authority spokesman. "Doesn't look like it's 
going to open again before the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 BUYER'S MARKET: The news was slightly better for Valley home-sellers last year 
. . . but buyers still rule. Sales of single-family houses rose 15% above 1992, 
but the average sales price dropped 11% to $252,633 -- lowest since 1988. 
Realtors foresee a 5% increase in homes sold this year. See Valley Business, 
Page 5 
</P>
<P>
 SICK BUSINESS: Pressured by HMOs, Medicare and hard times, most of the 
Valley's 29 hospitals are losing money. With the Clintons' health plan mandates 
looming, executives such as Panorama Community Hospital's David Green (above) 
are slashing costs, merging, consolidating and competing for managed-care 
patients. See Valley Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 STILL ALIVE: Live Entertainment Inc. hit a bumpy road after CEO Jose Menendez 
was slain by his two sons in 1989 (A1), but it emerged from bankruptcy last 
spring. Now CEO Roger Burlage hopes to cure the videocassette distributor's 
troubles. See Valley Business, Page 4 
</P>
<P>
 LOCAL ROCKY: It's the stuff of rousing movie climaxes -- the ex-champ returns 
to the ring at 41 against a 25-year-old hotshot fit to knock his block off. Or 
kick it off in the case of Benny (the Jet) Urquidez of Sherman Oaks, a movie 
fight director who once held five kick-boxing titles but hadn't been in the 
ring in 4 1/2 years when he fought for the world light-middleweight crown. If 
you missed the Dec. 4 fight, a bruiser, it will be on Showtime Jan. 21. . . . 
Maybe you don't want to know how it comes out. Hint: classic movie ending. T.

FOUNDER OF SHONEY'S CHAIN STARTED SMALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alex Schoenbaum usually arrived at his little restaurant at dawn to make sure 
the bread was baking. He often drove employees home after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't culinary fascination. It was bread and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenbaum's $10,000 Parkette drive-in restaurant in Charleston became the 
first Shoney's in 1951. That was the hatchling of what would become an empire 
of more than 1,800 restaurants in 36 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoney's Inc. is considered the popularizer of the family restaurant, the 
place that welcomes children, touts all-you-can-eat salad bars and offers menus 
that cover everything from steak 'n' eggs to fried shrimp to pie a la mode. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shoney's name is a derivation of Schoenbaum's name, which he chose because 
he thought it sounded family-friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 78, Schoenbaum no longer plays a management role in Shoney's. But he is 
immensely wealthy as one of the biggest shareholders in the company. He sat on 
the board of directors until 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is an active philanthropist, dividing his time between his hometown of 
Charleston and a home in Florida. He still is considered one of the wise old 
men of American restaurateuring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My philosophy always was to give the most food of quality for the least 
amount of money," he said in an interview, speaking as though he was still 
baking in the kitchen or sweeping the floor. "We are still doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Son Jeff Schoenbaum, 46, said his father's edict on strawberry pie set the 
tone: The pies always must have fresh strawberries, even if it means a special 
air shipment from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customer doesn't understand the problem. They just understand you don't 
have strawberry pie. That's the way they did things," he said, recalling his 
father's words. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenbaum spent years on the road, rifling through receipts at Shoney's 
outlets every day to see what people ordered. If an item was not popular, he 
scrapped it from the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenbaum started in his dormitory room at Kiskiminetas Springs School in 
Saltsburg, Pa., during the Depression. He bought cold cuts for 5 cents and sold 
10-cent sandwiches to earn spending money. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you bought something for a nickel and sold it for a dime, it sounded 
awfully good to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Schoenbaum helped define Shoney's in its early years, the company in 
its current form is largely the work of Raymond Danner, a hard-driving 
entrepreneur who bought the franchise rights for some of Schoenbaum's 
restaurants in 1959 and eventually became Schoenbaum's partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoney's merged with Danner Foods in Nashville, Tenn., to become Shoney's Big 
Boy Enterprises in 1971. Schoenbaum and Danner sold the Big Boy trademark to 
Marriott in the mid-1970s and renamed the company Shoney's Inc. in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Danner also is considered responsible for a chapter in the Shoney's story that 
the company hopes it has successfully put to rest: an alleged history of racial 
discrimination against black employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of them sued the company in 1989, accusing Danner and the company of 
restricting black workers to kitchen jobs and weeding out black applicants. 
Danner denied the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shoney's settled the suit in November, 1992, which required the company 
to impose a strict affirmative action program and set aside more than $100 
million to compensate bias victims. Danner also relinquished management control 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of progress in remaking its image, last September Shoney's was named 
"Corporation of the Year" by the Nashville Minority Business Development 
Center.

FAMILY GOES INTERACTIVE BUT WITH RESERVATIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 In these wired '90s, the Katsiroubas family is keeping up with the 
techno-flow. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-inch Mitsubishi television anchors a multimedia living room.Naturally, 
there's a VCR. A Sega Genesis game recently replaced a Nintendo. Kids and mom 
quickly admit the outdated Apple IIGS personal computer needs upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 At school, 12-year-old Torry and 13-year-old Ted use the Prodigy on-line 
service, CD-ROM, Apple Macintosh computers and laserdiscs. Their mother, 
Debbie, belongs to the town's cable advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no surprise the family of four is the first on the block to go 
interactive -- paying $9.95 a month for a menu of educational materials, games, 
news, shopping, money management and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Their verdict on two-way television: We like it, we'd buy more of it but it 
has to improve. 
</P>
<P>
 The service at hand is GTE Corp.'s Main Street, consisting of text, pictures, 
graphics and audio. About 600 households in six mostly wealthy Boston suburbs 
subscribe, fewer than half of what GTE's local computer system could 
accommodate.

 Reviews are mixed. In an age of full-motion video on CDs and personal

 "It's really no more than a sophisticated information slide show," said Carl

JURORS DEADLOCKED IN ERIK MENENDEZ TRIAL; COURTS: FOREMAN SAYS HE SEES 'NO 
HOPE' FOR A VERDICT. JUDGE ORDERS PANEL TO SEE IF A DECISION CAN BE REACHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The jury weighing murder charges against Erik Menendez announced Monday that 
it was deadlocked after three weeks of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. Weisberg ordered the jurors to keep 
trying for a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been no sign of trouble in the deliberations until Monday morning, 
when the Erik Menendez jury -- in its 16th day -- passed a note saying there 
was absolutely no progress toward a verdict in the case of the younger of the 
two Beverly Hills brothers charged in the Aug. 20, 1989, shotgun slayings of 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are deadlocked," said the note written by the foreman, a chemist and dean 
at Cal State Northridge. "Positions have essentially not changed after three 
weeks of discussion and debate. I see no hope for reaching agreement on any of 
the counts." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury did not indicate how it was split on any charge or how many votes it 
had taken. Before deliberations began, Weisberg gave jurors four possible 
verdicts to consider in the slaying of each Menendez parent, ranging from 
first-degree murder -- which could carry the death penalty -- to involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible deadlock in the Erik Menendez panel was revealed while a separate 
jury considering the charges against Lyle Menendez deliberated for its 18th 
day. Those jurors listened Monday as a court stenographer read back hundreds of 
pages of testimony, covering the brothers' accounts of the day they killed 
their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking the Erik Menendez panel to return behind closed doors Monday 
afternoon, Weisberg said he wanted to find out if more deliberations could lead 
to the "reasonable probability" of a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 As jurors filed back into the jury room, Erik Menendez, 23, showed no emotion. 
Just moments before, when he walked into the courtroom, he wore a big smile -- 
apparently alerted by his lawyers to the content of the jury note. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside court after the hearing, one of those lawyers, Leslie Abramson, 
sharply criticized the judge for prodding the jury to try to resolve its 
deadlock without first giving her an opportunity to review his instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is outrageous," Abramson told reporters. "He knows those kinds of 
instructions are very controversial. This is the most highhanded, obnoxious 
judge I've ever tried a case before." 
</P>
<P>
 In a case in which Weisberg ruled that jurors should not be given the option 
of an outright acquittal, a hung jury could be seen as a major victory for the 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said that if there is a hung jury, they will definitely retry the 
case and push for a full murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not over," said Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who arrived at the Van Nuys 
courthouse shortly after the hearing to meet with his two prosecutors on the 
case, Deputy Dist. Attys. Pamela Bozanich and Lester Kuriyama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have a hung jury than a manslaughter verdict because this is a 
murder case," Garcetti said, adding later: "If it's a hung jury, regardless of 
how it's hung, it will be retried as a murder case -- because that's what it 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 Erik and Lyle Menendez, who turned 26 Monday, are charged in the slayings of 
their wealthy parents, Jose Menendez, 45, and Kitty Menendez, 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries are hearing the case because some evidence was admitted against 
only one brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred and greed. But Lyle 
and Erik Menendez testified that they killed in fear after years of physical, 
emotional and sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocative defense -- suggesting that the brothers were the real victims 
in the Menendez household -- has polarized debate outside the courtroom during 
the five-month trial. It drew the fervent support of some spectators touched by 
the brothers' tearful tales of being molested. But skeptics were outraged, 
viewing the brothers as coldblooded killers now fabricating a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The note from the foreman Monday suggested that the same dynamic may have been 
at work in the jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 After gathering the jurors in court at 3:42 p.m., Weisberg urged the panel not 
to give up, saying: "The question I would ask you is whether there is a 
reasonable probability the jury might arrive at a verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge did not set a deadline for the jury to report back to him. The 
jurors met in private for 40 minutes after Weisberg's appeal, then went home 
for the night. They are not being sequestered. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for jurors to tell a judge they are having trouble reaching 
a verdict, or for the judge to ask them to keep at it. If the panel continues 
to report a deadlock, Weisberg would have to order a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Abramson asked the judge to find out at least if the jury had ruled 
out some of the "greater" charges, starting with first-degree murder. If the 
jury reached consensus on that much, Erik Menendez would not face the death 
penalty at a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although legal experts had anticipated lively debate in the jury room, jurors 
have never shown any signs of tension during their periodic appearances in 
court and their breaks from deliberation when they often walk around the 
courthouse. In fact, they have seemed steadfastly cheerful. 
</P>
<P>
 The two juries deliberate on separate floors and have been instructed not to 
mingle with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury reported its interest in reviewing a mass of testimony 
-- more than 400 pages -- in a note sent to the judge Friday, Weisberg 
disclosed in court Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 That note, the judge said, asked for every word of the brothers' testimony 
about the events of Aug. 20, 1989, from "the time they woke up to the time of 
the 911 call," in which Lyle Menendez called police near midnight to say they 
had discovered the bodies of their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said the jury was entitled to hear whatever it wanted. But re-reads 
take about one page per minute, the judge said, meaning that it would take 
nearly seven hours to read those pages -- so jurors were scheduled to still be 
listening to the material today. 
</P>
<P>
 The material read back Monday included Lyle Menendez's testimony that he had a 
sense of dread on the afternoon of the 20th, when he said hello to his parents 
-- who were watching tennis on TV -- and got no response. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling like a ghost, like we were already dead," Lyle Menendez 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also heard again how Lyle Menendez "freaked out" that night, after the 
parents closed the door to the TV room. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure that the closing of the door was a sign of imminent death, Lyle Menendez 
testified, he and his brother raced outside to their car, loaded their 12-gauge 
shotguns, dashed back into the house and into the TV room. "We just burst in 
the doors and started firing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the testimony included lengthy cross-examination about what happened 
after the shootings, such as how the brothers constructed an alibi and disposed 
of guns, shotgun shells and bloody clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the note sent Friday to Weisberg, jurors also asked for one other snippet 
of testimony from Lyle Menendez -- about how the brothers, worrying about 
fingerprints, scooped up expended shotgun shells after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please have the (stenographer) read this section slowly," the jurors ordered. 
It was read back, slowly, before the stenographer launched into the 400-plus 
other pages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jury's appearance in court, its first in a week, also 
revealed that one alternate juror was missing, apparently dismissed after 
secret hearings last week. Only one alternate remains of the six who began the 
trial in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg ordered lawyers not to discuss the alternate's absence with 
reporters.

UKRAINE AGREES TO GIVE UP ITS NUCLEAR ARSENAL, CLINTON SAYS; SUMMIT: PRESIDENT 
HAILS THE ACCORD AS A BREAKTHROUGH, BUT IT FACES PARLIAMENTARY OPPOSITION. NATO 
ENDORSES THE U.S. 'PARTNERSHIP FOR PEACE' PLAN TO BROADEN ALLIANCE. 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday announced agreement with Ukraine and Russia to 
dismantle Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal, hailing the long-sought accord as 
"a hopeful and historic breakthrough that enhances the security of all three 
participants." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, disclosed at the NATO summit here and scheduled to be signed in 
Moscow on Friday, must survive potentially serious opposition by nationalist 
factions that oppose elimination of the weapons and control the Ukrainian 
Parliament. But if it survives attack, the accord will represent a substantial 
step forward for the U.S. policy of curbing nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, politically and economically unstable since it became an independent 
state after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, has 176 intercontinental 
missiles armed with some 1,240 nuclear warheads -- all aimed at the United 
States. It also has 592 nuclear warheads aboard bombers, which would be covered 
by the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaos in Ukraine, while possibly threatening the ability of Ukrainian 
President Leonid Kravchuk to carry out the agreement, also underscores the 
pact's potential importance. It would allay Russia's fear of a hostile nuclear 
neighbor and answer concerns that Ukraine's nuclear weapons could wind up in 
the hands of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the United States, Russia and Britain will provide 
security assurances for Ukraine when it gives up its weapons and becomes an 
adherent of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Ukraine also will get 
financial assistance in dismantling the weapons as well as compensation for 
surrendering the highly enriched uranium in the warheads, which can be 
converted into fuel for civilian nuclear reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has offered at least $175 million to help pay the actual 
cost of dismantling the nuclear weapons. The White House said the pact could 
also lead to a doubling of U.S. economic aid to Ukraine, from $155 million this 
year to $310 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials said the payments for uranium would be 
substantial. And the agreement provides that, in effect, Ukraine will receive 
fuel rods it needs for its power reactors from Russia now and Russia will be 
repaid out of the proceeds from the sale of warhead uranium later -- another 
strong incentive for the economically desperate government in Kiev to go 
forward with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as expected, the NATO summit, initiated by Clinton to revitalize 
the 45-year-old military alliance and redefine its mission in the aftermath of 
the breakup of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, endorsed the 
President's "Partnership for Peace" plan Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan provides for enhanced North Atlantic Treaty Organization cooperation 
with former adversaries of the old Soviet Bloc and for gradually extending NATO 
membership to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO leaders, in a draft of a declaration to be released today, propose 
that "peacekeeping field exercises" be held beginning later this year with 
those countries that join the plan. To coordinate joint military activities 
within the partnership, NATO will invite participating states to send permanent 
liaison officers to the alliance's headquarters in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does not guarantee expanded NATO membership. Nor does it set a 
timetable for admitting new members. As a result, it falls far short of 
realizing the hopes of Poland, Hungary and some other East European countries 
for immediate membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But Secretary of State Warren Christopher said the compromise blueprint was 
endorsed enthusiastically by all NATO members. Based on signals from countries 
in East and Central Europe, he said, he expects "a very high degree of 
acceptance" by the former Communist countries as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that NATO also had endorsed another Clinton initiative placing 
non-proliferation at the core of the alliance's effort, Christopher said that 
sitting in the room with other summit participants "one could see and feel the 
re-emergence of U.S. leadership in this post-Cold War era. This was President 
Clinton's summit. He called the summit. He developed the three initiatives, 
which were enthusiastically and unanimously endorsed." 
</P>
<P>
 While the Ukrainian Parliament has balked on nuclear arms control issues in 
the past, Christopher and Clinton said there are strong reasons for Ukraine to 
endorse the trilateral agreement. And the secretary said the United States 
believes Kravchuk can implement it through executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said, "We have no reason to doubt the ability of the president 
(Kravchuk) to keep the commitment that he is prepared to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk's press service announced Monday night that an agreement had been 
reached to hold a "consultative meeting" between Kravchuk and Clinton in Kiev 
on Wednesday and a trilateral summit with Clinton, Kravchuk and Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin in Moscow on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement said nothing about a substantive nuclear agreement, noting only 
that the Moscow session would focus on "the completion of recent trilateral 
negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials in Ukraine suggested the final terms of the accord had yet to 
be determined. "From a legal standpoint, a final agreement and the end of talks 
are two completely different things," said Anton Buteiko, Kravchuk's top 
foreign policy adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentyn Lemysh, head of Parliament's military affairs commission, said 
Kravchuk is empowered to conduct negotiations on Parliament's behalf. "The 
president is entitled to sign accords, but if there are any contradictions with 
the conditions imposed earlier, then the pact must be put to ratification," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of Kravchuk signing a nuclear accord with Russia and the United 
States immediately came under fire from Ukraine's nationalist opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Kravchuk has no authority to sign an international document on 
nuclear weapons," opposition leader Vyacheslav Chornovil told the 
Interfax-Ukraine news agency. "Nuclear policy is to be worked out by 
Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander A. Shalnev, a columnist for the Russian newspaper Izvestia, 
expressed doubt about Kravchuk's ability to win parliamentary support. "It is 
very unlikely that Kravchuk will succeed in lobbying for the agreement in the 
Ukrainian Parliament," he said. "In his efforts to reach an understanding with 
the United States, he is always having to make concessions to the opposition. I 
am not sure this attempt will be much more successful than the previous ones." 
</P>
<P>
 On another issue, Clinton reaffirmed that Washington remains ready to help 
NATO implement a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina if one is reached by 
the warring parties. He expressed confidence the U.S. Congress would support 
such a move if the operation were clearly under NATO command, the means of 
carrying out the mission were equivalent to its purposes and the purposes were 
clear in scope and timetable. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he welcomed inclusion in the final declaration at the end of this 
summit a reaffirmation that NATO is prepared to carry out air strikes if 
necessary to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other 
threatened areas in Bosnia. Clinton said NATO had better not be engaging in 
rhetoric but be prepared to take military action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us gathered here must understand, therefore, if the situation does 
not improve, the alliance must be prepared to act," he declared. "What is at 
stake is not just the safety of the people in Sarajevo and any possibility of 
bringing this terrible conflict to an end, but the credibility of the alliance 
itself. And that, make no mistake about it, will have great ramifications in 
the future in other contexts." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing both the Partnership for Peace plan and the trilateral agreement 
with the Ukraine and Russia, Clinton said, "we have taken two giant steps 
toward greater security for the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union the most crucial 
non-proliferation challenge facing the world, he pointed out that when the 
Soviet Union dissolved, four of its countries were left with nuclear weapons -- 
Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that by working to eliminate Ukraine's arsenal -- the world's third 
largest after the United States and Russia -- he was seeking to assure that the 
breakup of the Soviet Union does not result in the birth of new nuclear states, 
which could raise the chances for nuclear accident, nuclear terrorism and 
nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, after a year of U.S. diplomacy, both Kazakhstan and Belarus agreed to 
accede to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is scheduled to leave here today when the summit ends and go to the 
Czech capital of Prague to meet with leaders of Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and 
the Czech Republic to discuss the Partnership for Peace plan and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the opening session of NATO, Clinton said: "The size of the 
reactionary vote in Russia's recent elections reminds again of the strength of 
democracy's opponents. The ongoing slaughter in Bosnia tallies the price when 
those opponents prevail. If we don't meet our new challenge, then most 
assuredly we will, once again, someday down the road, face our old challenges 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics have viewed Clinton's Partnership for Peace as an empty halfway step 
between East European leaders' demands for full NATO membership now and the 
reluctance of Moscow and some European capitals to see any expansion of the old 
Cold War alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton declared, "This must not be a gesture."

CHARGES EXPECTED AGAINST 'FINDER' OF MISSING BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said Monday they have developed enough information to bring 
criminal charges in the abduction of a 4-year-old boy against Enrique Palma 
Lopez, a day laborer who was hailed last month as a hero for "finding" the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who was arrested Sunday in San Diego on an unrelated fugitive warrant 
as he tried to leave the country, is also under investigation for the 
disappearance and recovery of a 3-year-old boy in the Downtown area, said Lt. 
Louis Trovato. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five weeks ago, Lopez, 31, was declared a hero and received hundreds of 
dollars from the public after he reported finding 4-year-old Matthew Vera 40 
hours after he had vanished from the Downtown Greyhound bus station Dec. 3. The 
boy was unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Trovato said Monday that police have spoken to at least four witnesses who saw 
Lopez with the boy in several locations during the time the child was missing. 
In one instance, witnesses told police the two were seen in a food line at a 
homeless shelter in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who identified himself to police at the time as Jose Jimenez, told 
detectives that the first time he saw the child was when he found him Dec. 5 at 
the corner of Broadway and 6th Street Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that we have enough on him to file unlawful detention charges," 
possibly as early as today, Trovato said. Kidnaping charges cannot be filed 
against Lopez because there are no witnesses who saw him forcefully take the 
child, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives will meet with officials in the district attorney's office this 
morning to determine which charges should be filed, Trovato said. If convicted 
of unlawful detention, Lopez could face a maximum of four years in prison, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew's mother, Rosa Sanchez, said Monday she had become suspicious of Lopez 
ever since it was reported that he found 3-year-old Andrew Rodriguez on Jan. 3, 
nine days after the child disappeared from a Downtown video arcade. A medical 
examination showed that Andrew, like Matthew, had not been sexually molested or 
otherwise harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird that the same person would find two kids," Sanchez said Monday. 
"But right now I cannot say he is guilty. I can't accuse him of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's aunt, Carmen Sanchez, said the family had shown Matthew pictures of 
Lopez and that he had referred to him as "El Patito," the mysterious figure who 
Matthew earlier said had bathed and fed him and took him to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed him pictures (of Lopez) and asked him: 'Is that El Patito?' And he 
would say, 'Yes, yes,"' Carmen Sanchez said. Lopez has told police he is not El 
Patito. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives interviewed Matthew again Monday for any details that might help 
them in the case, but Trovato said he did not know if the boy had identified 
Lopez as El Patito. He said police would continue to interview both children 
for clues about the circumstances surrounding their disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But neither child is real articulate," he said. "They have problems with 
concepts of time and place." 
</P>
<P>
 In Andrew's case, Trovato said police have been unable to locate any witnesses 
who may have seen Lopez with the boy during the nine days he was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trovato said police did not know what Lopez's motive may have been for taking 
either child, except that Lopez had received money after recovering Matthew 
"and perhaps he thought he could get money a second time." 
</P>
<P>
 An extradition hearing is scheduled this week for Lopez in connection with the 
arrest warrant issued by Alaskan authorities. But Trovato said if charges are 
filed against Lopez in Los Angeles, the case here would take precedence. Also, 
he said that the Immigration and Naturalization Service has requested that 
Lopez, who is being held at the Parker Center jail, continue to be held until 
it completes its investigation into his activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was arrested about 3 p.m. Sunday in San Diego after attempting to cross 
the border on a passenger bus, Trovato said. Border Patrol agents were 
questioning Lopez about his immigration status when they discovered that a 
warrant had been issued for his arrest by authorities in Juneau, Trovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez was convicted there in 1989 on a charge of petty theft, and while in 
custody, for attempted bribery of a police officer and for attempting to take a 
gun from a police officer, Trovato said. Lopez had served time for the last 
conviction, but an arrest warrant was issued because he violated terms of his 
probation, Trovato said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not learn about the arrest warrant earlier because it had been 
filed under the name Enrique Lopez Palma, Trovato said. Lopez's use of a number 
of aliases has hampered their investigation, he said.

COLUMN ONE; TAKING AIM AT EXOTIC BULLETS; LAWMAKERS MOVE TO REGULATE THE 
AMMUNITION INDUSTRY, AS THE MARKET GROWS FOR VICIOUS ROUNDS LIKE BLAMMO AMMO. 
BUT SOME GUN EXPERTS AND POLICE SAY SUCH CONTROLS COULD BE DUDS.

 In the low green hills that flank Wood River Creek, the largest U.S. 
manufacturer of shells and cartridges maintains a proud, 1,700-acre complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the buildings, corrugated metal interspersed with 1890s brick, are a 
company brass mill -- the source for all the nation's coins as well as for 
shell casings -- a company fire station, a company target range. Down Powder 
Mill Road, instructors at the company gun club teach employees and their 
children how to aim and shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall effect is one of grand American tradition. After all, the Olin 
Corp.'s Winchester Ammunition plant has churned out multiple millions of rounds 
a year, unquestioned, for a century. Its lineage dates back to 1892 when 
Franklin Olin moved here from New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, one of the company's products is making history of a very different sort. 
Winchester's Black Talon is an early, highly visible casualty of a growing 
sentiment to regulate ammunition in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Talon, which forms razor-sharp barbs upon impact, is described in a gun 
magazine review as a shell that "penetrates soft tissue like a throwing star -- 
very nasty." Late in November, under heavy political pressure, Winchester 
announced that the Talon would no longer be available to the public and would 
be sold only to law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Washington has ammo as well as weapons in its cross-hairs. The 
images evoked are not of the pioneers, but of Colin Ferguson, who last month 
allegedly used Black Talons and a 9-millimeter handgun to shoot 23 commuters, 
killing six, on the Long Island Rail Road. "Guns don't kill people," Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) has grown fond of repeating. "Bullets do." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress will entertain measures this year from Moynihan and Rep. Charles E. 
Schumer (D-N.Y.) to effectively ban several vicious types of rounds. Already, 
deep in the details of last year's federal crime bill, a Swedish bullet that 
penetrates protective police vests was outlawed. The bullet slipped through a 
loophole in a 1986 law that banned the manufacture and importing of 
armor-piercing ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of physicians have begun writing their congressmen urging creation of a 
federal commission to regulate which shells can be sold. Going even further, 
Democratic Sens. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Patty Murray of Washington and 
Moynihan have each introduced bills to raise taxes significantly from the 
current 11% up to anywhere from 25% to 50%, on most rounds, with revenue 
earmarked for emergency treatment and construction of trauma centers. Rep. Mel 
Reynolds (D-Ill.) is pondering similar legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where, by and large, it takes only a driver's license to buy the 
means to load a gun, "it is time we began a responsible mode of licensing and 
reporting" ammunition sales, Moynihan said recently on the Senate floor. The 
current crop of bills, he said, "is a beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time there has been such widespread talk of restricting 
ammunition during the debate over gun control that has waxed and waned for 
years. The industry has kept a low profile, aided by its makeup of many small 
companies, with the biggest players mere divisions of huge conglomerates, such 
as Olin or Du Pont. 
</P>
<P>
 The long, close look now is the result of a growing market in exotic 
cartridges with names like Dragon's Breath and Blammo Ammo, combined with a new 
upsurge in fear of violent crime and the need to finance health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale is that even if gun control were to take effect tomorrow, 200 
million weapons are already in private hands and would remain so, effective for 
many decades more. By contrast, federal officials estimate that there is only a 
three- to five-year supply of ammunition in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rationale that is "patently ridiculous," said Kevin Steele, editor of 
Guns & Ammo magazine. "For the politicians, it's an easy way out. They're 
looking at symptoms rather than causes." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all share the concern about crime," said Robert Delfay, executive director 
of the Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute, a consortium 
formed by 15 ammo companies. "We understand what may have been the inspiration 
for all this and we sympathize, but it doesn't seem very well thought out." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the law enforcement figures who have led the charge have their 
doubts about how effective the new proposals would be. The bills take 
half-steps, they say, which try to mollify the substantial numbers of hunters 
and believers in armed self-defense. The compromises that may be necessary to 
win passage, they say, will not stop criminals from using loaded pistols to 
threaten, maim and kill. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the bills would exempt .22-caliber ammo, the "plinking" shot meant for 
toppling tin cans, from tax increases. In deference to hunters, rifle ammo also 
would be left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxing or banning some ammunition and not others "isn't too practical," said 
Monty Lutz, a respected ballistics expert with the Wisconsin State Crime Lab in 
Milwaukee. Even target-shooting ammo can kill a human being. Many handguns can 
use rifle rounds to accomplish deadly goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one ammunition used in crime," said Doreen Music, supervisor of 
the Los Angeles Police Department firearms lab. "It tends toward the less 
expensive, not that exotic stuff. It's generally whatever's on sale at Big 5." 
For boxes of 50 rounds, prices can range from $1 for .22 caliber bullets to $50 
for the most exotic cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The other options -- high taxes on all makes or a total ban -- are 
problematic, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Raymond's Guns and Ammo, just across the town border in Alton, the 
regulars gather around the register and vie to explain why. 
</P>
<P>
 If higher taxes are imposed on all factory-made shells, "the average citizen 
won't be able to afford to practice," said Earl Smith, a 61-year-old hunter and 
target shooter who lives nearby. "I'm not sure that having people with handguns 
and no practice is all that good of an idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "The criminals wouldn't care, though," interjected owner Donald Page. "All the 
times someone's broken in for ammunition, they never do leave any tax money." 
</P>
<P>
 Higher prices would simply mean more people would assemble their own 
ammunition at home, predicted Tom Hill, a spokesman for the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Old casings can be recycled with a 2 1/2-foot-tall device, which can cost 
under $100. It requires drawing three levers and pulling out two buttons to 
outfit a shell with new primer, powder and slugs. A novice can complete the 
process in 35 seconds -- and can soon work up to a speed of 150 shells an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginners can even learn stove-top lead melting techniques and mold the 
projectiles themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 With a little experimentation, "you can make a handmade bullet that does 
anything you want it to do," Lutz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The specialty shells account for a small fraction of the market, but it was 
their rise in the intensely competitive ammunition industry that made police, 
doctors and, ultimately, politicians take note of a previously overlooked part 
of the gun-control equation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli Desert Eagle is a .50-caliber bullet fired from a specially 
tailored handgun, packing a powerful punch that Lutz termed "devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Glaser Safety Slug contains bird shot pellets, causing multiple wounds. 
(The "safety" portion of the name refers to the projectile's tendency to stay 
lodged in a target rather than continuing through to inflict still more 
unintended damage on someone or something else.) 
</P>
<P>
 Distributors advertise their wares with a variety of lethal claims. In most 
states, it is possible to mail-order Blammo Ammo, which explodes upon impact 
into hundreds of small shards -- "naturally, life threatening trauma and shock 
occur immediately." The Bolo delivers little balls, connected by piano wire, 
that whirl around inside -- "it slices, it dices." Dragon's Breath ignites 
miniature magnesium fireballs -- "also known as the three-second flamethrower. 
Use with extreme caution! Will not harm your shotgun barrel." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do they need these things for?" asked Dewey R. Stokes, a Columbus, Ohio, 
detective who is national president of the Fraternal Order of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 "These aren't for hunting," said Stokes, a gun owner who also has armed his 
daughters. "Do they want to shoot the bird, defeather it and cook it all at 
once?" 
</P>
<P>
 Though many discount the spicy names as mere marketing tools, Stokes has 
monitored gun magazines and catalogues with increasing alarm. As the ammunition 
market became saturated and then increasingly competitive, new specialties 
"have just become bolder and bolder over the last five years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard in 1992 that the Pentagon planned to distribute the Swedish M39B 
to the National Guard, he mobilized officers nationwide in protest. The 
cartridge had slipped through a technical loophole in 1980s legislation 
prohibiting import of so-called "cop-killer" hollow-point bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ammunition disappears from (Guard) armories all the time," Stokes said. "This 
would have made its way to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly, Congress prohibited import of the M39B. 
</P>
<P>
 The Black Talon, which arrived on store shelves two years ago, was a matter of 
greater, more public concern. "It was being marketed widely to a civilian 
population," said Jerry Hancock, the liaison on law enforcement issues to the 
Wisconsin attorney general. Winchester ads trumpeted "a truly revolutionary 
bullet design" and gun writers, including one granted a rare visit inside the 
plant, wrote glowing reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutz informed Hancock and a Milwaukee trauma center physician, Stephen 
Hargarten, about the Talon's new technology, a series of serrations around a 
hollow-point bullet that would consistently unfold into a pattern of petals 
once inside a victim. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing led to another: Hargarten began to worry about getting infected with 
HIV or hepatitis from an encounter with the jagged bits while retrieving a 
bullet from a wound. A surgeon's glove could be easily punctured. "It's like an 
Osterizer with blades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a colleague wrote an editorial for the Journal of Trauma and called on 
other emergency room physicians to campaign against the Talon. Over the summer, 
faxes and letters streamed into Moynihan's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The mail from doctors gave Moynihan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, 
a connection between bullets and health care. The Clinton Administration had 
been making much of the cost of violence to the overwhelmed health care system, 
and Moynihan made his only demand of the package so far: a tax on ammunition 
should help fund the reform. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended a tax of 10,000% on the Talon -- which would raise the price 
from $20 to $2,000 a box -- and on the Desert Eagle. For every other handgun 
ammunition, except for .22-caliber cartridges widely used for target shooting, 
he suggested that the 11% tax levied in 1954 be increased to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said he was willing to consider the concept but added that he 
did not think the tax would generate much money and that health reform could be 
financed otherwise. He preferred the idea, he said, for its crime-fighting 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days, Winchester had declared the Talon off-limits to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision . . . " said a Winchester spokesman who requested anonymity "was 
made in the best business interests of the company and the ammunition industry 
because Black Talon had become the focal point for issues beyond the control of 
Winchester." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Moynihan and other aspiring ammo-regulators praised the move, workers 
here were stunned. Still, even those whose livelihoods depend on ammunition 
have argued, sometimes bitterly, over the notion of bullet control. 
</P>
<P>
 The raucous noontime crowd at a tiny tavern near the plant was filled with 
Winchester workers recently, and they fell clearly into two camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we did was manufacture a bullet that was outstanding," said a 
leather-jacketed Vietnam vet assigned to Black Talon production. Indeed, the 
bullet had been designed to perform well on FBI tests, and it did. More than 
400 police departments use the Talon. (Los Angeles is not among them.) 
</P>
<P>
 It apparently did well on the open market, too. Company officials would not 
say how many Black Talons have been sold, but the production worker said 36 
million rounds had been ready for general distribution at the time the firm 
changed its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stops a person," the man said. "That's what you want, is something that 
stops 'em." He had his own box of Talons at home, he said, in case an intruder 
breaks in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shut up," the woman on the next stool retorted loudly. "Winchester was 
greedy. That was made for law enforcement and should have stayed there in the 
first place." 
</P>
<P>
 They agreed on only two things: They did not want their names published and 
they were certain that Winchester's decision had come too late to stave off 
further anti-ammo action. 
</P>
<P>
 Winchester officials said they oppose any added taxes but support limiting 
access to ammunition for people with criminal records or unstable mental 
histories. So far no federal legislation has been proposed to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, all the employees are very anxious about the situation," said 
David Hatfield, business agent for Plumbers and Pipefitters Union Local 555, 
which represents 80 people at Olin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty steady here," Hatfield said, and while Winchester refuses to 
divulge sales figures, a Standard & Poor's analyst said ammunition is 
responsible for about $300 million of Olin's annual business. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, employment in small-arms ammunition manufacturing is declining, 
from nearly 11,000 in 1987 to about 7,000 in 1992. Much of the drop-off appears 
to be related to defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the company (also) feels foreign competition," Hatfield added, especially 
from China. "And if taxation makes ammunition cost even more, then people may 
not buy, and Olin won't be manufacturing as much. And that could affect jobs 
around here."

TROUBLED FIRMS SEEN MISUSING PENSION FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pension savings and health coverage of thousands of workers are at risk 
because financially troubled small-business owners increasingly are diverting 
funds earmarked for employee benefits to other corporate purposes, federal 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranking officials in the U.S. Department of Labor say they have discovered a 
growing problem involving small, ailing companies misusing worker contributions 
to the highly popular 401(k) pension plans as well as health insurance 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 While labor officials pledge to pursue all such violations, pension experts 
maintain that official sanctions often come too late to help workers, who may 
find serious shortages in their retirement savings or discover -- after filing 
a claim -- that their health insurance was canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm out thousands of dollars," said one Los Angeles employee, who asked not 
to be identified for fear of reprisal from his former boss. "But we didn't know 
there was a problem until the company filed bankruptcy. Then it turns out 
there's something like $150,000 missing from our 401(k) plan and no one has the 
money to pay it back." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is particularly acute in economically troubled parts of the 
country, such as Southern California and part of the Northeast. The Department 
of Labor's Boston office has filed numerous civil lawsuits that allege such 
pension and heath care violations, while officials at the Los Angeles office 
say they are investigating numerous claims as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor officials cannot discuss specific companies under investigation. 
However, a labor official notes that the Los Angeles office is investigating a 
private school that has used workers' health premium money to buy books and pay 
teachers, and a manufacturer that agreed to restore "borrowed" pension funds to 
workers' accounts but has yet to pay interest on the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with a handful of cases in relation to the thousands of plans 
operating in Los Angeles," said David Ganz, regional director of pension and 
welfare benefits administration at the Department of Labor in Los Angeles. "But 
we are concerned. We have seen more situations recently because companies are 
in financial distress, and they take the 401(k) money to keep operating," Ganz 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowingly diverting workers' funds is a felony, but few cases are prosecuted 
because the financial loss in individual cases is relatively small, and it is 
difficult to prove criminal fraud. Instead, the Labor Department relies mainly 
on civil suits aimed at returning diverted funds to the employees and barring 
offending company officers from serving as plan trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious violations are rare at large firms -- those with more than a few 
hundred employees -- because this type of fraud requires top officers to agree 
to an illegal act. The larger the company, the less likely that top officers 
will conspire to divert funds, government officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other types of pensions, there is no government guarantee fund for 
so-called defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)s. Nor is there government 
backing for health plans gone awry. Unless the company, its managers or pension 
plan trustees have the money to repay funds borrowed, "diverted" or stolen from 
401(k)s and health premiums, workers are simply out of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can happen all too frequently, and when it does, it has particularly 
tragic consequences," said Alan Lebowitz, deputy assistant secretary of pension 
and welfare benefits with the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Pension and health care fraud is not new. There have been isolated incidents 
of labor fraud -- perpetrated by both companies and labor unions -- since 
health and pension benefits were first instituted. But industry observers say 
this kind of fraud has become far more common in the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem appears to be the result of three factors working in concert -- a 
sluggish economy, a credit crunch that has made it hard for smaller companies 
to borrow and the rising popularity of benefit plans, such as the ubiquitous 
401(k). 
</P>
<P>
 The latest recession was unusually tough on small businesses because it lasted 
longer than usual, hit hardest at service industries dominated by small 
business and came as bank lending standards were tightened, said William J. 
Dennis Jr., senior research fellow with the National Federation of Independent 
Business Foundation in Washington, D.C. That made it virtually impossible for 
ailing businesses to borrow their way through bad times, Dennis adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had run into financial difficulties, and I was unable to get a loan," said 
a company owner who was sanctioned by the Labor Department for siphoning off 
worker pensions to pay the company's bills. "It's not something that I'm proud 
of. But when you've got to pay your light bill and make your payroll and your 
bank is telling you to find some other form of financing, you don't have a lot 
of alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 While no statistics are compiled, Labor Department officials say the amount of 
pension and health insurance fraud is small compared to the 2.5 million plans 
in operation. But the incidence is high enough among ailing small businesses 
that labor officials suggest that employees carefully monitor their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the way health and 401(k) plans are administered, some managers saw 
the growing employee contributions as an easily accessible source of cash that 
they could tap to tide them through bad times. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees contribute their own money to the plans, but the contributions are 
made through employer withholding. Employers then forward the money to a 
trustee or health insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that trustees and health insurers rarely communicate with 
workers -- or even with so-called "plan administrators," who disseminate 401(k) 
information to employees, said Bruce Ashton, a labor attorney with the Los 
Angeles law firm of Reish & Luftman. As a result, the company can tell workers 
and "administrators" that contributions are being made but fail to forward the 
money. Unless the trustee or the health insurer objects, no one is the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, workers don't know there is a problem until the company files for 
bankruptcy court protection or fails to pay several health claims, said 
Lebowitz. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, employees of Imperial Millwork of West Bridgewater, Mass., found 
out their health insurance was canceled after the company failed to pay claims 
for several months, labor officials say. Last summer, the company's insurance 
agent -- which had failed to tell workers about the terminated coverage -- was 
ordered to pay employee's four- and five-year-old medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, labor officials acknowledge that many violations may go undiscovered 
because there are no regular audits of pension plan trust accounts nor regular 
review of health insurance coverage. Labor officials have a computer program 
that they use to ferret out pension fraud, and they get tips. But, frequently, 
official action is late. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the Labor Department barred officials of Southern Architectural 
Woodworks Inc. from serving as fiduciaries of any qualified pension plan last 
summer. Owners of the Raleigh, N.C.-based company had diverted more than 
$29,000 of pension contributions to the company's general account, labor 
officials said. However, the company was liquidated more than three years 
before the labor complaint was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Labor Department sued Voloshin Cadillac-Pontiac Co. of New 
Haven, Conn., for "improperly loaning" plan assets to the company. Voloshin, 
which had $84,313 in its 401(k) plan to cover 40 workers, is liquidating under 
Chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. The Labor Department would not say how much 
of that money was missing nor what the prospects were for recovering worker 
funds. Company officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, there is a year or two lag before there is an enforcement action" 
because companies have about eight months to file plan reports and then it 
takes time to discover the problems and investigate, says Gloria Della, a Labor 
Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, experts maintain that workers must try to protect themselves by 
keeping an eye on their own company's financial picture and asking questions 
when things seem amiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your company is in financial trouble, you should do a cursory check of the 
401(k)," said the Labor Department's Ganz. "Call the plan administrator to 
check whether their records (of your account balance) match with your own. And 
call the trustee and ask whether there has been any problems with contributions 
being forwarded. If the answer is yes, call us."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S AGILITY MAKES UP FOR INEXPERIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TYLER MARSHALL and PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opening session of President Clinton's first full-scale meeting of the 
Western Alliance was just getting under way, and the young American leader was 
trying a bit of banter with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking of you last night, Helmut," said Clinton, who has little 
experience on the crags of world summitry. He began to describe a Brussels 
television broadcast he had seen about sumo wrestling, the pastime of 350-pound 
Japanese men. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl, 290 pounds and conscious of his weight, looked up quickly, but Clinton 
danced back from the edge of the diplomatic cliff by turning a seeming blunder 
into a graceful compliment. "You and I are the biggest people here, and we are 
still 100 pounds too light" for the practice of sumo, Clinton clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl laughed heartily, and the NATO alliance breathed a collective sigh of 
relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the opening rounds of the summit, Clinton has repeatedly displayed 
that ability to overcome inexperience with agility. In the process, he has done 
more than avoid embarrassment and repair his previously frayed relations with 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 He has summoned forth a surprisingly unified and hopeful attitude among 
members of the sometimes fractious alliance as they pass through a historic 
transition: With the Cold War over and other concerns surging to the fore, this 
has turned out to be the summit at which Europe for the first time emerged as a 
full and equal partner instead of the valued but subordinate gaggle of allies 
it had been for more than four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The transition was laden with risks. Europeans were uncertain about Clinton's 
ability and commitment, fearful that the end of the Cold War meant an end to 
American involvement on the Continent. At the same time, they well remembered 
the stubborn reluctance of past U.S. Presidents to share their pride of place 
at the head of the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Clinton, in no small part through strength of personality and a knack for 
not rubbing his partners the wrong way, has led the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization through the process of adopting new policies that recognize 
Europe's new place in the alliance -- even its right to take the lead -- 
without friction or fractiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 And this at sessions that some predicted would be marred by open discord among 
NATO's 16 members over policy on Bosnia-Herzegovina, the entry of new members 
from Eastern Europe and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Clinton has been eager to accommodate the Europeans because of a 
convergence of interests. Americans, preoccupied with domestic problems and 
yearning to shift defense costs, want the Old World to shoulder more of the 
work of collective security. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, others might not have eased into the Americans' new role with as much 
grace as Clinton has shown, the European leaders said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Clinton's open, uncomplicated, upbeat style seemed almost visibly to 
pull together the 16 leaders in a way that has been distinctly lacking in an 
alliance prone to transatlantic strain in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were lingering doubts before the summit about Clinton's "Partnership 
for Peace" initiative offering eventual NATO membership to East European 
countries, the President appeared to clear them up in his comments to the 
opening session Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't heard a single critical word this morning," said a senior German 
official, himself surprised by the amity of the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton gave America's blessing to independent European defense planning -- an 
idea called the European Security and Defense Identity that will permit 
European NATO members to plan and take military action independently of the 
United States if they wish. 
</P>
<P>
 The warmth he displayed in welcoming the initiative seemed to surprise several 
veteran European defense specialists who recalled the deep suspicion with which 
the United States once viewed such ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by some of America's NATO allies to revive the long-dormant Western 
European Union (WEU) defense group during the mid-1980s were actively 
discouraged by the Ronald Reagan Administration and, later, accepted only 
reluctantly by former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brussels on Monday, Clinton welcomed a strong WEU and even proposed 
offering NATO equipment and logistics support to independent European 
operations if they should be required. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a change in policy and a change in spirit that can only be welcomed," a 
German official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting these developments, along with Clinton's reaffirmation of a pledge to 
keep 100,000 U.S. troops in Europe for the foreseeable future, British Foreign 
Secretary Douglas Hurd bubbled to reporters, "NATO is clearly alive and well 
and taking up a new lease on life." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, Clinton has been lucky that the timing of his initiatives seems to 
fit well with the interests of America's European partners. But his team also 
seems to have sold his policies well and his infectious optimism has worked to 
enhance this success. 
</P>
<P>
 In deferring to the seniority of elder statesmen such as French President 
Francois Mitterrand and Kohl, Clinton also appears to have avoided the friction 
experienced by some American leaders who had to overcome initial rejection by 
more experienced European leaders quick to sense a "we know better" attitude in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand's spokesman, Jean Musitelli, for example, noted that during a 
bilateral meeting Monday, Clinton personally thanked the French president for 
his cooperation during the final phases of the difficult world trade talks -- a 
gesture that came despite the fact that the final days of those negotiations 
were characterized by bitter French resistance to several U.S. initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's abilities could face a more severe challenge this week in Moscow, 
though that is not considered likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, by most accounts, this President has masterfully used his 
abilities as a quick study, his personal charm -- and the low expectations that 
must accompany a President who fiercely proclaims his domestic agenda as his 
first priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent summitry is brokerage and personal relationships, he can do 
well," said Michael Beschloss, a diplomatic historian. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, as he heads into back-to-back meetings with some of his European 
counterparts, Clinton enjoys a relatively strong domestic position compared to 
the other leaders. Although in Washington questions nag about Clinton's 
investments in an Arkansas land deal, the U.S. economy is stronger and 
Clinton's personal popularity is higher than that of Kohl, Mitterrand or 
British Prime Minister John Major. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, it is Clinton's youth and his image of openness that most seem to 
have captivated the European public. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brussels taxi driver, John Callewaert, realizing he had landed an American 
passenger, announced that his 13-year-old son had shaken Clinton's hand Sunday 
evening in the city's majestic Grand' Place and now wanted to write the 
President a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton goes to the people, he has a young family, he knows my problems," 
Callewaert said. He pulled a piece of paper off the dashboard of his car, 
asking: "Is this right? Is this right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully printed on the paper was an address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., 
Washington, D.C., U.S.A.

WAYS SOUGHT TO LEAD POOR ONTO INFORMATION HIGHWAY; COMPUTERS: TECHNOLOGY ACCESS 
CREATES A DIVIDING LINE. GORE TO DISCUSS 'SAFETY NET' IN L.A. TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The computers were humming on the third floor of Bethel African Methodist 
Episcopal Church in South-Central Los Angeles as programmers busily tested 
software -- part of a fledgling experiment to bring the computer to an area 
known more for high crime than high tech. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poverty-plagued city of Cudahy to the east, a learning center has been 
given pricey portable computers to use for lesson plans and other take-home 
projects. The Elizabeth Learning Center, whose student population is 90% 
Latino, has access to laser disc encyclopedias -- replete with film, sound and 
color graphics -- and other high-end tools, thanks to the Los Angeles 
Educational Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way of the world now," said Anola Hubbert, who has been teaching 
at the school for nine years. "It can only help." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be, but access to newfangled technology by the poor and disadvantaged 
is seldom seen in urban or rural America beyond the odd exception of the Bethel 
church or the Cudahy learning center. 
</P>
<P>
 As computers become as common as the electric typewriter a generation ago, 
another invisible line is being drawn between those with the power of the 
computer and those who would not know a megabyte from a Big Mac. The poor are 
barely on the service road of the much-vaunted information highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem may only worsen in the short term, as a combination of poverty and 
shrinking school funding exacerbates a widening technology gap that separates 
the computer literate from those who reside in what is increasingly described 
as the nation's "information ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that many people do not have a clue about what is happening in 
high tech," said Kamal Al-Mansour, whose Los Angeles-based Afrolink Software 
caters to subjects of interest to African-Americans "There are a vast number of 
people who are going to be cut out of the loop." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is the first to acknowledge the computer's 
importance in the daily lives of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In their 1992 campaign manifesto, President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore 
promised to build a national information network that would connect every home, 
business, library, lab and classroom by the year 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 In a December policy speech, Gore called for a "regulatory safety net" to make 
sure the nation is not split into a society of "information haves and 
have-nots." The vice president is scheduled to give a more detailed explanation 
of how to construct that safety net when he visits Los Angeles today for a 
"superhighway summit" at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence continues to mount that a problem exists. A 1992 study by the 
Brookings Institute estimated that computer use in school is strongly related 
to income -- that the child from a well-to-do family is twice as likely to use 
a computer as a child from a poor one. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you give anyone the tools, they can become successful in that field. The 
inner city has not had access," said Chet Holmes, whose Positive Technology 
Inc. is operating in the Bethel church. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, even the most menial jobs are in some way connected to the 
computer. Warehouse workers, for example, may be routinely asked to follow a 
computer's instructions, or may be fired for failing to meet computerized 
productivity goals. One recent estimate is that 38% of all American workers use 
computers on the job, and that future workers will require sophisticated 
knowledge beyond merely pushing computerized buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who don't have a background in computers will end up using 
computers, but they are usually cash registers or bar-code readers" said 
Charles Piller, an editor at MacWorld Magazine, published by MacIntosh Corp. 
"It's no different than an assembly line." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the workplace, having a computer and a telephone is a way to link up 
with vast electronic data bases that experts say will become the primary 
information resource system in the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 The world has shrunk, but not evenly, said Michael Stricklin, a communications 
professor at the University of Nebraska and long a student of the computer age. 
Instead, he said, it is a place of peaks and valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who are on the peaks have access. The ones in the valley don't," he 
said. "The poor will always be with us and that is true with the information 
highway." 
</P>
<P>
 American Visions, the magazine of the African-American Museums Assn., is 
sponsoring a computer symposium later this month in Washington to discuss how 
high-tech tools can be used to help minorities in the next century and perhaps 
extract them from those information valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Publisher Timothy Jenkins said minorities must focus on high tech to maintain 
an even footing in today's world. He said the issue has been overlooked by the 
traditional black leadership in favor of the conventional civil rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason, he said, is that black leadership is made up mostly of 
older men who did not grow up in the age of computers. But he also laid some of 
the blame on the lack of focus by computer companies on the minority community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry has not exercised itself to adopt any of its outreach or 
software to the minority community," said Jenkins. "All of the images are 
little white kids with standard names and suburban life. I do not see anything 
from computer companies in the black media, no effort to reach the inner city 
with laboratories." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenkins said he began to have concerns as he attended several large technology 
shows around the nation. He said that of the thousands of people who attended, 
almost all were white. And most of the minorities in attendance worked for the 
larger corporations, rather than for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the kind of alarm that sounded in my head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Jenkins called for the American Visions symposium, saying it 
would serve as a "cultural brain trust, enabling us to collectively think 
through how we can ensure the long-term value of this revolutionary 
breakthrough in technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the widening chasm, there are notes of hope. The computer is being 
touted as a major tool that, over the long haul and with access for all, could 
help break down the learning barriers in education. 
</P>
<P>
 In an article published by the Aspen Institute last year, Francis D. Fisher, a 
fellow at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in Austin, Tex., 
created a scenario in which a disadvantaged, Spanish-speaking family of the 
21st Century, using a television equipped with a computer chip, could obtain 
everything from language lessons to health care information. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, for instance, could connect to her daughter's school and hear from 
the girl's teacher what sort of homework had been assigned that day. She could 
keep track of the family application for an apartment in a public housing 
complex, and her son could work on his English lessons at his own pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real power is that it permits individual instruction," Fisher said in an 
interview. "It won't be like having a class that will bore the bright ones and 
be over the head of those at the other end." 
</P>
<P>
 However, experts stress that high tech is worthless in the hands of an 
illiterate, and that basic skills such as the ability to read are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 MacWorld's Piller said the onus is on the American teaching system to make 
sure that computers in classrooms become more than glorified typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first computer in each classroom should be on the teacher's desk," he 
said. "There should be sophisticated in-service training, not four hours a 
semester. If the teacher doesn't get it, the kids won't." 
</P>
<P>
 What will happen in the near term is very much up in the air as the pace of 
technology moves forward at a speed that is at times dizzying while educational 
funding is woefully lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 California, despite being the home of the computer chip, ranks 44th in the 
ratio of computers to students in its public school system. The state spends 
slightly more than $2 a child on technology, compared to the leader, Texas, 
which has committed to spending $35 per student per year. Gov. Pete Wilson 
recently likened the state's schools to being "stuck in the age of the Pony 
Express." 
</P>
<P>
 "California is so abysmally behind, it's a joke," said Andy Dunau, whose Dunau 
Associates is directing the technology for the Los Angeles Learning Centers, 
one of nine nationwide projects charged with developing a "break-the-mold" 
vision for American schools. 
</P>
<P>
 William Padia, assistant superintendent of the state Department of Education, 
said little progress will occur soon because less than 5% of the state's 
classrooms are wired for computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are talking about the way kids learn through technology and we only 
have 2% to 4% of the classes that are wired, it can't happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that context, the fear among those who speak for the disadvantaged is that 
a lack of computer knowledge will mean an ever-narrowing field of job 
possibilities, with minimal skills translating into such low-paying employment 
as word processing or fast food counter work. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Winbush, an assistant provost at Vanderbilt University and director of the 
Johnson Black Cultural Center there, likened the computer to the advent of the 
automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want blacks to be able to just drive the auto. We want them to be 
able to understand the auto, to fix the auto and design new autos" he said. "I 
don't want to just see a bunch of black word processors." 
</P>
<P>
 Winbush and others contend that technology should be used to close some of the 
gaps that now exist in education, that children unresponsive to traditional 
methods of teaching might benefit from machines that allow them to work at 
their own pace and, in many cases, be more interesting than a teacher standing 
in front of a class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to regain some of the lost ground that has occurred 
between blacks and whites in education," Winbush said. "We have the golden 
opportunity to erase what has not worked and start at ground zero. I simply 
want black and brown kids to be a part of that process." 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Parga, who runs the Elizabeth Learning Center's program in Cudahy, 
concurs: "Access is the key. And the kids are hungry for it." 
</P>

OFFICIAL QUITS IN WAKE OF MEXICO STRIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco Garrido, a former 
governor of the embattled Chiapas state, Monday became the first political 
casualty of the deadly Indian uprising that has jolted the government of 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying he was acknowledging "that which did not work," Salinas announced that 
he had accepted Gonzalez's resignation and replaced him with Atty. Gen. Jorge 
Carpizo MacGregor, a former human rights ombudsman. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was governor in Chiapas, Gonzalez's regime was implicated in some of 
the numerous human rights abuses and conflicts over land that many Mexicans 
believe contributed to the New Year's Day uprising by largely Indian 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 The new interior minister, Salinas said, will be in charge of "quickly 
restoring tranquillity to Chiapas and maintaining (peace) elsewhere in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas is faced with a widening political crisis following the rebellion by 
guerrillas claiming to fight for indigenous rights in the impoverished hills of 
southern Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days after the uprising began, the Mexican army is still fighting pockets 
of rebel resistance, while violence in the form of bombs and sabotage has 
spread to the capital. At the same time, national and international protests 
over alleged abuses committed by the army are growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are no longer talking about a local confrontation but a national problem 
that has exposed the profound tectonic fractures that run through Mexico's 
social fabric," columnist Rodolfo Stavenhagen said Monday in the independent La 
Jornada newspaper. "So far, the government has simultaneously used a hard line 
while proposing, without much credibility, the soft line (negotiations). 
Undoubtedly in the highest spheres of government, they are debating both 
alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas ousted Gonzalez as part of a larger overhaul of his Cabinet, which 
included the naming of a new foreign minister. Manuel Camacho Solis, the 
previous foreign minister and a popular former Mexico City mayor, was named to 
head a reconciliation commission for Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has come under considerable criticism both before and after the 
Indian insurrection, the worst outbreak of violence in Mexico in more than two 
decades. It has claimed more than 100 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 As interior minister, Gonzalez was in charge of national security, the 
efficiency of which is now in doubt because of the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Gonzalez repeatedly denied Mexican press reports of the existence 
of guerrilla groups in Chiapas; the government late last week was forced to 
admit it knew about the group for months but did not act. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Gonzalez was governor of Chiapas for five years until he was named 
interior minister a year ago. During his governorship, conflicts escalated 
between landless peasants and well-off farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups have accused Gonzalez of using violence to put down 
peaceful Indian protests. They also cite the case of Father Jose Padron, an 
outspoken advocate of Indian rights; as part of Gonzalez's running battle with 
pro-left priests, Padron was jailed illegally for 50 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repression was so harsh," said Querubin Mayorga Penagos, an opposition 
politician from Chiapas, "that we began calling him Gov. Latrocinio" -- a word 
in Spanish that rhymes with Gonzalez's first name and means "thievery." 
</P>
<P>
 "When he took office he said he would only act according to the law, but he 
always denied justice to the poor of countryside, where the only thing that 
counted was the money of the caciques (political bosses)," Mayorga told the 
magazine Proceso. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a well-connected, longtime member of the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, has always insisted he acted only by the letter of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to replace Gonzalez with Carpizo, a veteran of human rights 
issues, appeared to be Salinas' attempt to counter growing condemnation here 
and abroad of excesses allegedly committed by the army. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the National Human Rights Commission formed by Salinas in 1990, 
Carpizo won praise as a tireless advocate as he denounced police torture, 
extortion and even murder. Last year, Salinas named Carpizo attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas have threatened a wider war -- threats that seemed real after 
bombs exploded over the weekend at electrical transmission towers, in parking 
garages and at a Mexico City military base. 
</P>
<P>
 Deep in Chiapas, guerrillas were pulling back Monday into the jungle around 
Las Margaritas, one of the towns invaded on New Year's Day. Ninety hospital 
workers, whom the guerrillas had seized Dec. 30 in the town of Guadalupe 
Tepeyac, were released along the road as the guerrillas moved out. Edmundo 
Angulo, a truck driver, said the rebels had used Guadalupe Tepeyac as a transit 
point to move their troops from Las Margaritas, which they abandoned Jan. 2, to 
a town called La Realidad, farther back in the jungle.

WOMEN, MINORITIES OUTPACE WHITE MEN FOR JUDGESHIPS; JUDICIARY: AMONG CLINTON'S 
PICKS, 23% ARE BLACK, 35% ARE FEMALE AND 6% ARE LATINO. MANY VACANCIES REMAIN.

<P>
 President Clinton literally is changing the look of the federal judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 During his first year in office, more than half of Clinton's nominees for 
federal judgeships were women or members of racial and ethnic minorities, a 
proportion dramatically higher than during any previous Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush named white men to 82% 
of the available judgeships over their 12 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, only 39% of Clinton's first 48 nominees were white men. And 
Administration officials predict that pattern will continue throughout 
Clinton's term. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first President who will appoint a majority of his judges who are 
women or minorities," said Ronald Klain, the associate White House counsel in 
charge of screening candidates for the federal appeals court and the Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the elected branches of government, the federal judiciary has been slow 
to change and remains the province mostly of white men. Among the 837 judges 
who sit on the federal bench, 5% are black and about 10% are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Clinton's first judicial nominees, 23% are black, 35% are women and 6% 
are Latinos. No Asian-Americans have been nominated. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the changing complexion of the judicial branch, Administration 
officials point with pride to individuals who have broken barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith W. Rogers, the first black woman to graduate from the Harvard Law 
School and the well-regarded chief judge of the District of Columbia's highest 
non-federal court, has been nominated to the influential U.S. Court of Appeals 
in Washington. Rogers, 54, is only the second black woman ever chosen for a 
federal appeals court seat and the first since 1980, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton selected Martha A. Vasquez, 40, as a U.S. district judge in New 
Mexico. She is the first Mexican-American woman to join the federal judiciary, 
Justice Department officials said. They also anticipate naming the first Native 
American judge this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's sole pick for the Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is the second 
woman to serve there and the first Jewish member of the court since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 This unprecedented push for diversity on the federal bench has won praise from 
liberal groups that monitor the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 Nan Aron, executive director of the Alliance for Justice, a liberal advocacy 
group that monitors court nominations, noted that more of Clinton's nominees 
have worked as public defenders and in providing legal aid to the poor than did 
the judges appointed by previous presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton judges "will have a greater understanding of the problems 
confronting ordinary Americans," Aron said. She called his appointments "a 
welcome change from the wealthy corporate concerns of most of the Reagan-Bush 
judges." 
</P>
<P>
 But a conservative analyst derided Clinton for "catering to the bean 
counters." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are obviously taking the politically correct approach and trying to 
please the diversity crowd," said Thomas Jipping, a legal analyst with 
Coalitions for America, a conservative group that also monitors nominations to 
the judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 Among previous presidents, only Jimmy Carter made a significant effort to 
increase the percentage of women and minorities on the bench. Even so, 66% of 
his nominees were white men. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter drew criticism for selecting some judges with relatively thin 
qualifications. Several of his appointees have been accused of legal and 
ethical violations on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton has won early plaudits for the high caliber of his selections. 
</P>
<P>
 "They appear to be extraordinarily well qualified," said Prof. Sheldon Goldman 
of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who tracks judicial selections. 
"Their ABA ratings so far have been superior to Bush and Reagan (appointees)." 
He was referring to the evaluations of each nominee done by a committee of the 
American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not seen a tension between excellence and diversity," said Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Eleanor D. Acheson, who screens candidates for the district courts. 
Because of the growing number of women and minorities in the legal profession, 
"we have a very rich field to pick from," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Reagan and Bush years, critics accused executive branch officials 
of imposing an ideological "litmus test" on potential judges. For example, 
those who supported abortion rights or affirmative action were vetoed, it was 
alleged. But Republican officials steadfastly denied the charge and insisted 
that they sought only talented lawyers who would follow a course of "judicial 
restraint." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Clinton's advisers say that ideology does not figure 
significantly in their selection process, although they readily note that 
nominees typically come recommended by Democratic officeholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeking people who have intellectual ability and energy, people who 
are interested in the law and have a good judicial temperament. There are no 
litmus tests," said Acheson, whose grandfather, Dean Acheson, served as 
secretary of state under President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 The "no litmus test" pledge is undergoing something of a test itself, as the 
Administration considers judicial vacancies in Wyoming and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 In those states, both U.S. senators are Republicans. As a result, the 
Administration received recommendations instead from two Democratic 
officeholders, Wyoming Gov. Mike Sullivan and House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). Both proposed local attorneys known as critics of legal 
abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting strongly, abortion rights leaders in Washington protested to the 
White House, insisting that Clinton not follow in the footsteps of Reagan and 
Bush by appointing more abortion opponents to the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been debated hotly in the White House and Justice Department, 
but no decision has been announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a slow start, Clinton has yet to put a real dent in Republican 
dominance of the federal judiciary. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to office facing a record number of judicial vacancies, attributable 
in part to a prolonged dispute between the Bush White House and the 
Democrat-dominated Senate Judiciary Committee. Angry that the FBI report 
involving sexual harassment charges against Supreme Court Justice Clarence 
Thomas had been leaked to the press, Bush blocked giving the committee further 
access to FBI reports on its judicial nominees. In response, the committee 
blocked approval of Bush's court nominees during much of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's aides were unable to fill the vacancies quickly. Key Justice 
Department posts went unfilled for months last year. Another complication 
reflects a selection process that begins with recommendations from Democratic 
senators, some of whom, such as California Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara 
Boxer, were newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 By year's end, however, Clinton had nominated slightly more new judges during 
his first year than had either Reagan or Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a record 118 seats remained vacant as of Jan. 1. Reagan and Bush 
appointees still hold a clear majority in 11 of 13 federal appeals courts, 
according to the Alliance for Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has yet to nominate anyone for vacancies in Southern California. There 
are four seats vacant in Los Angeles and two in San Diego. The U.S. 9th Circuit 
Court of Appeals also has two vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 The first judicial confirmation fight of the Clinton era is likely to come 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative activists have targeted Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice 
Rosemary Barkett, a 54-year-old former nun and trial lawyer who has been 
nominated for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals based in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Jipping and other conservatives accuse her of being soft on crime and an 
opponent of the death penalty. In several murder cases, Barkett dissented from 
imposing a death sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She shows a special empathy for convicted murderers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Acheson called these charges "ridiculous" and "overblown." She cited an 
analysis showing that Barkett cast votes more than 200 times to uphold death 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think they have another Rose Bird on their hands. But they don't," said 
another Administration official, referring to former California Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Rose Bird, who was ousted by voters based on charges that she 
opposed the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Barkett drew the ire of conservatives in Florida, she won a statewide 
vote in 1992 and received the endorsement of Republican Sen. Connie Mack of 
Florida.

LAWYER RESIGNS AFTER PROBE OF BEQUESTS; LAW: JAMES D. GUNDERSON, WHO ALLEGEDLY 
WAS THE BENEFICIARY OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM HIS LEISURE WORLD CLIENTS, HAD 
FACED CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CHARGES FROM THE STATE BAR. 
</P>

<P>
 James D. Gunderson, the target of a State Bar investigation for allegedly 
making himself the beneficiary of millions of dollars in bequests from the 
estates of his elderly Leisure World clients, has surrendered his license to 
practice law, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 State Bar prosecutors said Gunderson agreed to resign after they told him that 
they were prepared to file conflict-of-interest charges against him that could 
have led to his disbarment. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our profession, the worst (punishment) is to be disbarred, and a 
resignation with charges pending operates the same way," said Robert Heflin, 
the State Bar's chief trial counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Heflin would not disclose details of the charges that were to be filed against 
Gunderson, citing state laws that protect the confidentiality of some 
disciplinary matters involving lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's attorneys issued a statement noting that Gunderson "is 69 years of 
age, and has long planned to retire at this point in time. For 38 years, his 
conduct has been unblemished and he has never before been disciplined," said 
Allan H. Stokke, a Santa Ana lawyer who represented Gunderson during the State 
Bar investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of the Laguna Hills lawyer came 14 months after The Times 
published articles detailing how Gunderson inherited millions of dollars in 
cash, stock and real estate from clients whose wills and trusts were prepared 
by him and other members of his law firm. The inheritances are still being 
investigated by the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Gunderson's resignation was welcomed by an influential group of Orange 
County lawyers, as well as by the two California legislators who were prompted 
to introduce reform legislation in the wake of The Times' disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblymen Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) and Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) 
co-sponsored legislation, which became law Jan. 1, generally prohibiting 
attorneys from preparing wills that made them beneficiaries of their clients' 
estates, and also barred them from acting as trustees of trusts they create for 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg called the resignation "the best for all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow was more blunt in his assessment, saying "Mr. Gunderson saw the 
handwriting on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Trial Lawyers Assn., a group of about 600 attorneys, also 
issued a strongly worded statement. "This should be a message to all 
professionals that they absolutely will be held accountable for their conduct 
and they are not above the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Eisenberg, the group's president, said that if it can be established 
that some heirs were victimized, he hoped that they would seek "fair and just 
compensation for their losses." 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation almost certainly ends Gunderson's probate law career, which 
began 38 years ago when he established a practice in Long Beach. When Leisure 
World Laguna Hills opened in the early 1960s, Gunderson moved there to begin 
offering his services to the thousands of retirees who were then moving to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 A yearlong investigation by The Times revealed that Gunderson, who boasted of 
representing more than 7,000 elderly clients, had inherited substantial assets, 
in some cases where he or his law firm had arranged for the preparation of 
wills and trusts for the deceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson accepted the inheritances -- including a $3.5 million bequest from 
the estate of Merrill A. Miller -- despite a longstanding California Supreme 
Court ruling that says anything more than a "modest" gift from a client to that 
client's attorney raises questions of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit expected to go to trial soon in Orange County Superior Court, 
Miller's relatives have accused Gunderson of taking advantage of 98-year-old 
Miller to secure the bequest. 
</P>
<P>
 Other heirs have made similar allegations in a case where Gunderson inherited 
$250,000 in AT & T stock from a Canadian woman who had been declared senile 
five months before Gunderson prepared her last will and testament, making 
himself the estate's major beneficiary. The other heirs sued and Gunderson 
reached a confidential out-of-court settlement with them, which included a 
payment by Gunderson of $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson and his lawyers vigorously denied any wrongdoing in these cases and 
throughout the lengthy State Bar investigation. Gunderson defended the 
inheritances as freely offered gifts from clients who became friends over the 
usually long periods of time that he handled their affairs.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PESSIMIST WILSON NOW A PITCHMAN; LEADERS: GOVERNOR TOUTS 
CALIFORNIA TO BUSINESSES IN NATION'S HEARTLAND. THE MESSAGE IS A FAR CRY FROM 
THE ONE HE WAS SPREADING UNTIL RECENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, legislative leaders in tow, arrived here Monday for a 
whirlwind, three-day tour of the nation's heartland, during which he intends to 
tell the captains of American industry to forget all those awful things he was 
saying about the state's business climate until a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip that may be designed as much for the consumption of voters back home 
as the corporate executives that Wilson and his entourage will call upon in 
Minneapolis, Chicago and Dallas, the governor says he hopes to convey a simple 
message: 
</P>
<P>
 "California is back in business with an enormously improved jobs climate, with 
terrific opportunities for companies to grow and expand, to create new jobs in 
our state," Wilson told reporters in Sacramento as he prepared for the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a far cry from the message Wilson was spreading until recently. 
California, he told all who would listen, was bad for business. With burdensome 
taxes and regulations and a workers' compensation system that drained profits, 
the state, Wilson said, was a virtual job-killing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Republican governor and his new-found Democratic friends in the 
Legislature, bitter political enemies in 1992, got together to enact a package 
of laws they said would blow away the dark clouds that had been ruining the 
state's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 They overhauled workers' compensation with reforms expected to shave about 10% 
from its cost. They gave tax breaks for investment in small businesses and 
factory equipment. They reduced levies on worldwide corporations. And they took 
the first steps toward simplifying the state's regulatory labyrinth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skeptics say the changes pale in comparison to the huge tax increase 
Wilson and lawmakers enacted in 1991. Others say Wilson overstated the problem 
and now is exaggerating the solution for political reasons. But the governor 
insists the state's economy is about to turn around, thanks to the work he and 
lawmakers did in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, say Wilson and the legislators who are with him on the trip, is 
that many business leaders may not have gotten the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perception always trails reality," said Assembly Republican leader Jim Brulte 
of Rancho Cucamonga. "The reality is we've made some significant changes. We 
want to make sure that reality becomes the perception." 
</P>
<P>
 Also with Wilson are Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno and Assembly 
majority floor leader Tom Hannigan of Fairfield. Assembly Speaker Willie Brown 
was scheduled to go but canceled Monday because he has an ear infection and was 
advised by doctors not to fly. Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys), preoccupied with an attempt to recall him from office, did not make the 
trip, and sent Sen. Dan McCorquodale (D-Modesto) in his place. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Roberti and Brown, the bipartisan trip is an unprecedented show 
of unity for a California governor and the leaders of the Legislature. It 
wasn't long ago, in 1992, that Wilson and top Democratic leaders did not speak 
to each other for weeks while the state went without a budget and was forced to 
pay its bills with IOUs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy said it is about time that California leaders began hunting down jobs in 
other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very highly competitive world," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that governors from other state have toured California "gleefully 
trying to pick off our businesses." Among those who visited in recent months 
were North Carolina Gov. James B. Hunt, who talked to Taco Bell officials about 
moving their corporate headquarters to that state, and Massachusetts Gov. 
William Weld, who courted film industry officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time we turned the tables," Maddy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group will meet today with the chief executive officers of 3M Corp., 
Target Stores, National Computer Systems and General Mills, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in Chicago, executives from Sears, Household International Inc., 
Kraft General Foods and Quaker Oats Co. will be among those playing host to the 
Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dallas on Thursday, the contingent hopes to meet with officials from EDS, 
Frito Lay and AMR Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the task ahead is "more than cold canvas" -- the sales term for 
calling on customers with no idea whether they will be interested in your 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some hot leads," he said. "We have some people we think are likely, 
if not now, at some point in the foreseeable future, to have need to expand, 
and we want them to know the full story." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Wilson aides caution that the governor is not likely to announce the 
creation of any new jobs during the trip, as he did on the 17-day, eight-city 
tour he took of Asia around Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the firms the governor will call on already do business in California. 
Wilson and the lawmakers said they will ask the executives what else the state 
can do to make conditions more hospitable for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our perception of regulatory reform and how magnificent we were may not track 
with what they claim is ailing them," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Wright, Wilson's secretary for trade and commerce, said the goal is not 
to "pirate" companies from the states the group is visiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these companies have a significant presence in California and our 
goal is to see that presence expanded," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Wilson and the others wouldn't mind persuading some corporate 
executives to move their headquarters west. 
</P>
<P>
 So amid all the talk of the business climate, the other kind of climate -- the 
one not subject to the whims of politicians -- might get a little attention as 
well. The California delegation departed Monday -- on a private corporate jet 
provided by Federal Express -- after another day of sunshine in Sacramento, 
while in Minnesota, the forecast was for single-digit temperatures and snow.

HIKERS FIND BODY OF MAN SUSPECTED IN DEATH OF WIFE, GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hikers in a secluded area south of Mt. San Jacinto have found the body of an 
aspiring Los Angeles movie-maker who was suspected of killing his estranged 
wife and daughter last month, sheriff's deputies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on personal effects and other items found near the body, authorities 
said they believe that Aziz Ghazal shot and killed himself. Ghazal probably 
committed suicide within hours of killing his wife, Rebecca Vollstedt Ghazal, 
38, and the couple's 13-year-old daughter, Khadijah Ghazal, said Riverside 
County Sheriff's Deputy Mark Lohman. Ghazal's body was discovered by two hikers 
Sunday afternoon, and authorities found a handgun nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was removed from the mountainside Monday afternoon for identification 
and an autopsy by the Riverside County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz Ghazal, who lived on Los Angeles' Westside, was last seen Dec. 1, running 
from the family's cabin in the mountain community of Pine Cove after it erupted 
in flames. Firefighters found the bodies inside the home. Aziz Ghazal's car was 
found abandoned several hundred yards away. Blood in and around the car 
indicated that he was injured. His body was found several miles from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 After the murders, a number of people involved in the film industry and 
students and staff at USC where he had worked said they feared for their safety 
because Aziz Ghazal had displayed volatile behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Aziz Ghazal was fired in October from USC's School of Cinema-Television, 
reportedly after a dispute over a missing camera. He managed the school's 
equipment room and controlled the use of cameras, lights and other equipment 
borrowed by student filmmakers. His nurturing of students wanting to produce 
low-budget films -- and his display of temper for those who abused the 
equipment -- was well-known in the tightknit school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was mercurial -- charming and gregarious, supportive and eager for the 
students, and then quite bitter and volatile and explosive," said USC student 
Josh Kafka. "If you didn't do something right, he was intolerant. He had a 
great knowledge of filmmaking and equipment, but I found him personally too 
difficult to bear." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife sued him for divorce last year, and, according to court records, she 
said he was abusive during most of their 16-year marriage. In one incident last 
year, witnesses said Ghazal attacked his daughter in front of the school where 
she had been elected to the cheerleading squad on the same day she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Ghazal had won custody of the couple's three children -- including two 
boys who were away from the cabin at the time of the attack. The couple bought 
the cabin as a getaway, but his wife and children lived there full time after 
she won a restraining order against her husband last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghazal had produced the critically acclaimed alternative film "The Natural 
History of Parking Lots," and filmed a low-budget horror film, "Zombie High." 
Most recently he was pitching a film called "The Brave," to Jodi Foster, Oliver 
Stone and Touchstone Pictures. The script involved an impoverished man who was 
willing to become the victim in a "snuff film" so his family would reap the 
financial benefits.

STUDENT LOANS JUMP RECORD 50% AT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES; EDUCATION: FINANCING 
TOTALED $1.24 BILLION IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 1993. THE INCREASED 
INDEBTEDNESS IS LINKED TO RISING TUITION AND OTHER CAMPUS COSTS, PLUS RELAXED 
FEDERAL ELIGIBILITY RULES.

<P>
 Faced with spiraling costs, California college students have been going into 
debt at a record pace to get through school, taking out a staggering 50% more 
in loans during 1993 than the year before, state financial aid officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last six months of 1993, students took out $1.24 billion in new 
loans -- compared to $822.5 million for the same six months of 1992. Meanwhile, 
the number of students taking out loans jumped 28%, from 249,000 to 319,000, 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen an increase like this," Samuel M. Kipp, III, executive 
director of the California Student Aid Commission, said Monday. The commission, 
a relatively obscure state agency, keeps track of and guarantees the so-called 
Stafford loans, which are made by private lenders but are backed by federal 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kipp said students are being forced to go deeper into debt because other forms 
of financial aid have not kept pace with soaring college costs, including a 
succession of stiff fee increases imposed at California campuses in the past 
few years. Since 1989, annual fees have jumped 103% -- to $1,440 -- at Cal 
State, and 128% -- to $3,727 -- at the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the federal government last year made it easier for 
California students to borrow money by relaxing eligibility requirements while 
raising the annual limits for the loans. Graduate students can now borrow an 
additional $1,000 a year, and juniors and seniors can get $1,500 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's quite clear that more students are having to borrow to attend 
college and they are borrowing substantially more to meet college costs," Kipp 
said. "People are going to be emerging from college, with or without their 
degrees, with a more substantial debt burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who chaired the Assembly Higher 
Education Committee for several years: "There couldn't be a more clear example 
of robbing from the future of the next generation in order to support the 
special interests of people in power." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the increasing necessity and burden of student loans could 
discourage low- and moderate-income students from going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the point of getting a degree, they ask, if you're going to spend 10 
years paying it off?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rutter, director of financial services at the 17,000-student UC San Diego 
campus, said ever-increasing amounts of student loans skews life decisions for 
those who do graduate. They may forgo graduate school or buying a home and 
bypass public service work because they worry about paying off the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are carrying around debt, they can't do volunteer or low-pay work, 
like being a school teacher," Rutter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutter said student loans at UC San Diego -- where fees, books, and on-campus 
dorms cost a student nearly $13,000 a year -- nearly doubled in two years, to 
$20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, student loans also increased, from $30 million in 1990 to $47 million 
in 1993, said Larry Burt, financial aid director. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said the growing need for loans to keep up with college costs, which 
average $11,283 a year for undergraduate students living on the Westwood 
campus, may force them to lower educational expectations and stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be all they could be, they won't go to the most challenging 
academic institution because they have to go to a cheaper one," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, the prospect of taking on increased debt does have one 
advantage. "We're beginning to see students graduate more quickly. It just 
costs too much money."

POPE URGES ITALY CATHOLICS TO KEEP POLITICAL UNITY; ELECTIONS: HIS LETTER TO 
BISHOPS IS SEEN AS A RALLYING CRY FOR THE DISINTEGRATING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATIC 
PARTY. OPPOSITION IS CRITICAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pope John Paul II stuck an oar into the troubled waters of Italian politics 
Monday in a controversial pre-electoral appeal urging Roman Catholics to 
reaffirm their political and cultural unity. 
</P>
<P>
 A papal letter to Italian bishops was immediately seen as a rallying cry for 
the decaying Christian Democratic Party, long a Vatican -- and American -- 
favorite but now fast disintegrating in a welter of corruption after nearly 
half a century as the country's dominant political force. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Pope's spokesman called "an appeal to conscience" came at the start 
of a week in which Prime Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi faces a confidence 
debate in Parliament and President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro is expected to set a 
date for unpredictable, landmark elections. 
</P>
<P>
 March 27 or April 10 seems the most likely date for the renewal of a 
Parliament many of whose senators and deputies are among about 3,000 Italian 
politicians, business leaders and bureaucrats so far implicated in a two-year 
investigation into a multibillion-dollar nationwide kickback scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the need for "profound political and social renewal," the Pope 
nevertheless urged Catholics to "bear witness with courage their faith in God . 
. . and their love for Italy through a united and coherent presence and an 
honest and disinterested service in the social and political field." 
</P>
<P>
 Dishonest politicians should be punished, the Pope said, but he warned against 
confusing the "abuse of power . . . and the normal and healthy functioning of 
institutions for public good." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that the decisions affecting the future of a well-ordered society 
should not be put only into the hands of judicial authority alone," John Paul 
said. Magistrates in Milan and other major cities are expanding the scandal 
investigations despite calls for a political solution to an apparently 
bottomless chronicle of institutionalized corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Splintered by scandal, the Christian Democrats are seeking to rebuild their 
credibility as the political center in time for the elections, in which the 
former Communist Party looms as the nation's strongest political focus. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not a pleasing prospect, John Paul made plain, noting the Christian 
Democrats' "great merit of having saved liberty and democracy" from communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presence of lay Christians in social and political life not only was 
important to oppose various forms of totalitarianism, beginning with 
communism," the Pope said. "It is still necessary to express the Christian 
tradition and culture of Italian society at the social and political level." 
</P>
<P>
 In postwar decades, the Vatican openly supported the Christian Democrats, but 
Monday's papal letter had no precedent in John Paul's 15-year reign, said his 
spokesman, Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro called the papal remarks "an appeal to responsibility. . . . This 
message is not political but cultural and ethical. It is his intention to go 
deeper than tactics or politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The Polish Pope's partisan sortie into politics became immediate fodder for 
protest from political groups expecting to oust the Christian Democrats from 
power for the first time since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Pope is a citizen of another state and should not concern himself with 
Italian politics," said Sen. Francesco Speroni, a leader of the separatist 
Northern League. 
</P>
<P>
 Without mentioning them, the Pope scolded both the Northern League, which 
wants to make Italy a federal republic with three regional governments, and

JAPAN PANEL RECOMMENDS END TO SEXIST JOB PRACTICES; EMPLOYMENT: FEDERAL 
COMMITTEE SAYS CUTBACKS OF FEMALE WORKERS SHOULD BE BANNED, FOR EXAMPLE. 
DISCRIMINATION HAS WORSENED LATELY.

<P>
 Japan should strengthen its equal-employment law by banning firms from 
selectively hiring men over women and easing restrictions on women's overtime 
and late-night work, a Labor Ministry committee said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations tackle the most visible signs here of sexist employment 
practices, which have become even more conspicuous during the recession. In an 
effort to cut costs, many firms have drastically scaled back new hiring -- in 
large part by cutting back on female workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike American firms, many Japanese companies hire a new crop of employees 
each April and announce before then their hiring targets, often by gender. But 
in the past year, as the recession has deepened, female applicants have been 
told openly, "We're not hiring women this year." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the report found, many firms have sent out recruitment material 
to male college graduates but not females, excluded women from introductory 
meetings, given separate application tests to each group and hired more men 
than women. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also found several instances of men who were promoted faster than 
women, even though they entered the company at the same level at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese firms defend their practices by saying that men are a better 
investment: Women tend to quit when they have children or marry. 
</P>
<P>
 But women's groups counter that companies often pressure them to quit in order 
to avoid having to pay their escalating salaries. Instead, firms shoo them out 
to bring in new hires at starting pay, many women argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also urged changing government regulations originally designed to 
protect female workers from exploitation -- but which have come to be seen as 
discriminatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Under those rules, most women are barred from working more than 24 hours of 
overtime a month, with some exceptions such as those for doctors and lawyers, 
while men are allowed to work as many as 43 overtime hours. Women are also 
barred from working between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m., with exceptions for flight 
attendants, tour conductors and some others. 
</P>
<P>
 The subcommittee report of the Deliberative Council on Women and Juvenile 
Problems advised easing the female overtime restrictions for non-manufacturing 
jobs and expanding the list of jobs in which night work is allowed. It also 
urged prohibiting gender-based hiring targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the full committee accept the proposals later this month, the Labor 
Ministry is expected to begin implementing them in April. But the report has 
already drawn fire from female workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women's protective regulations should not be abolished or deregulated," said 
Yuiko Matsumoto, vice secretary general of the women's division of the Japan 
Federation of Labor Unions. She added that Japan should first settle the issues 
of scaling back work hours overall and improving child-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Women interviewed on television expressed doubts that the changes would 
visibly improve their working conditions. Japan's Equal Employment Law has no 
significant enforcement power or penalties and simply asks firms to "endeavor" 
to eliminate sexist practices. The proposed changes would also ask for 
corporate cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other women said they have no desire to work like dogs -- or their male 
colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The changes would be fine for women who want to work hard, but personally, 
I'd rather not have to work a lot of overtime," one said.

POSTAL PROOFREADERS MAKE ROYAL MISTAKE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proofreaders at Canada's postal service let a royal error slip through in the 
production of a souvenir stamp book -- a reference to "the Prince of Whales." 
</P>
<P>
 Much to Canada Post's chagrin, the book was printed with a passage describing 
a visit by "the Prince of Whales" to the snowy shores in 1860.That prince 
eventually became King Edward VII, the great-great-grandfather of the present 
Prince of Wales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, it's just something that went through a number of people and 
got missed," Canada Post spokesman Jim Phillips said of the incorrect spelling 
of "Wales." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a human error and there was no intended slight to the Royal Family or 
to Prince Charles." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Canada Post will not pull the book from the shelves since the 
1994 edition is already in production.

ABUSE KNOWS NO GENDER, SAYS MEN'S SHELTER FOUNDER; ALTHOUGH FEW MEN ARE

 Calling himself a defender of the invisible victims of domestic abuse, a 
Minnesota man with a mission -- and an assault record -- has opened what may be 
the first battered men's shelter in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gilliland Sr. and a group of volunteers are busy painting, carpeting 
and furnishing the Men's Shelter of Minnesota in a Victorian house in the 
city's working-class East Side. Operating on donations and a sliding fee scale, 
by month's end they expect to have readied seven bedrooms for battered men and 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland understands that some people may have a hard time imagining a man 
fleeing to a shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unfortunate part is that rather than concentrate on all victims of abuse, 
the thrust of (public) attention is all slanted toward women and battered 
women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland, 53, says that not only are men victims of domestic violence, but 
they are also more frequently on the receiving end of physical assault than are 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that that's what happened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was innocent of assault and domestic abuse," he said. "Thousands of guys go 
to jail every year who are innocent of domestic abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 That denial rankles his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland said he often gets calls from men complaining of broken noses and 
slash wounds that they say were inflicted by wives and girlfriends. Many are 
too ashamed to speak out or get help, fearing ridicule and loss of home and 
children, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaine McCutchan, a volunteer working at the house one recent weekend, said he 
lost everything after an 18-year marriage went bad. Arguments over religion 
escalated to the point where he was kicked down the stairs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutchan said he lost his kids, his house and later his job because of 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988 Gilliland formed the Domestic Rights Coalition, a men's rights, 
referral and support organization that has made many enemies among women's 
rights advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland said he knows firsthand how the system is stacked against men. In a 
1988 incident, he said, he called police to de-escalate an argument with his 
now ex-wife. When he was arrested, Gilliland claims, his attorney advised him 
to plead guilty to misdemeanor assault and he spent a month in jail. He 
maintains he was not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "One time she took a small board with a nail in it and hit me in the 
forehead," Gilliland said, adding that the nail barely missed him. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims he was tossed out of their home and had to live in the back of his 
station wagon with his dogs for three days. "A shelter like this would have 
been ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland has so infuriated some women's advocates that a spokeswoman from the 
Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women refused to be interviewed for an article 
unless it portrayed Gilliland as a "charlatan." Some women's rights' supporters 
see Gilliland as someone who stands up for abusers in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland acknowledges his troubled past. "Back in my drinking years, I got in 
fights in bars. But I've been sober 18 years and I have had no problems." In 
addition to the 1988 domestic abuse incident, Gilliland's girlfriend in 1992 
obtained a protection order against him, which she later withdrew. He also was 
found guilty that year of disorderly conduct in an incident at St. Paul's 
Ramsey County family court building. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gilliland's message has persuaded dozens of companies to donate furniture, 
food, lumber, labor, used appliances and toiletries to the home. The shelter 
has drawn an estimated $7,000 in cash donations and $15,000 in furnishings and 
other goods. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on family violence says research is often misunderstood or 
misrepresented. "Women are about as likely to hit men in a relationship as vice 
versa . . . but the most accurate measure is who gets hurt," said Richard 
Gelles, a professor at the University of Rhode Island and director of the 
Family Violence Research Program. 
</P>
<P>
 For every five men hurt by women, 95 women are injured by men, he said. In 
addition, the numbers must be put into the context of a slap versus a punch, 
and patterns of behavior over time, which overwhelmingly show men as 
perpetrators of violence, Gelles added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gelles said he has never heard of another battered men's shelter in the 
country and predicts that it will be used more as a place to cool off and a 
center for resources and referrals than as a traditional shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Jan. 1, the Men's Shelter of Minnesota had accommodated three men 
overnight, but they didn't enter the door injured. Gilliland said they were 
dropped voluntarily at the shelter by the St. Paul police, who had responded to 
domestic calls but didn't make arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't bother Gilliland, who sees the house offering various services. 
If the shelter can help defuse potentially violent situations, then it's 
performing an important service, Gilliland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilliland says he wants to work with the police, courts and therapists to help 
domestic abuse victims. "I think it's important to acknowledge the fact that 
there are thousands of battered women, but let's not let that overshadow the 
fact that many thousands of battered men also need help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some who work in the field agree that the system needs to break through 
stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Griffith, who coordinates volunteers in the Hennepin County domestic 
abuse office in Minneapolis, said advocates for men and women must learn to 
work together to stop the cycle of domestic abuse.

NEW BAN ON RADAR DETECTORS DRAWS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Highway Administration will start cracking down this month on most 
truckers and bus drivers who use radar detectors. Beginning Jan. 20, the 
practice will violate a new federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major Washington lobbies that concern themselves with safety are pleased, 
saying the statute will cut down on speeders who have tried to evade police 
radar with impunity. But the law will not affect private motorists because the 
highway administration only regulates commercial vehicles. And studies show 
that very few passenger cars use them, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The new prohibition against use of radar detectors will only apply to trucks 
and buses in interstate commerce -- trucks weighing 10,000 pounds or more and 
buses carrying at least 16 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Hamilton of the highway administration says the law will have particular 
relevance to California, which has more trucks than most states but has no 
state regulation against radar detectors. Virginia and the District of Columbia 
already outlaw the detectors for all motorists, and New York prohibits them in 
most commercial vehicles. Connecticut last year dropped its ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Radar detectors are compact electronic boxes, some as small as a pack of 
cigarettes, that act as radio-frequency receivers to pick up signals emitted by 
police radar. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipped onto a sun visor or a special windshield bracket, they are designed to 
alert vehicles to "speed traps" by signaling drivers when radar is being beamed 
at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton says the highway administration has established fines of $500 to 
$1,000 per infraction but that enforcement of the law will be borne chiefly by 
the states. Jim Faria, a radar expert for the California Highway Patrol, 
believes the law may help cut down on speeding trucks, although he is dubious 
about the value of radar detectors anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are useless," Faria said in an interview. "The radar equipment 
we use in California does not transmit a signal continuously. We put it on just 
to confirm a speed we have established visually, and by that time it's too late 
for the driver to be warned." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) wrote the law banning radar detectors in 
commercial vehicles into the 1992 appropriation bill for the Department of 
Transportation after getting a majority in Congress to agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to have these devices except to evade the law," Lautenberg 
said. "Our nation's highways are going to be much safer because truckers are 
going to slow down without radar detectors. The lives we save will be the 
payoff." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Rogoff, an aide to Lautenberg, said the only real opposition to the 
legislation came from radar-detector manufacturers and some independent haulers 
who claim the law is an example of over-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it is a wholesale waste of time and effort on the part of 
government," said Todd Spencer, a spokesman for the Owner-Operators Independent 
Drivers Assn., which represents 21,000 truckers who operate 35,000 trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Radar detectors are not factors in highway safety or highway accidents," 
Spencer said. "They have never been shown to be, and no legitimate data exist 
to show a relationship between radar detectors and accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 However, an impressive list of safety experts has endorsed the new law on 
grounds that large trucks account for a disproportionate share of fatal highway 
accidents, with excessive speed the principal cause. These advocates include 
the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, the American Trucking Assn., the 
American Automobile Assn., the National Safety Council and the International 
Assn. of Chiefs of Police. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Institute studies have shown that truckers who use radar detectors 
are far more likely to exceed 70 m.p.h. than other truckers. As many as 40% of 
all tractor-trailers use the detectors, with the number rising to nearly 50% of 
trucks that carry hazardous materials, according to institute officials. Yet 
only 4% of passenger cars use them, the studies showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucking association, which represents 40,000 trucking companies, also 
said it is pleased with the regulation. Said John Doyle, an association 
spokesman: "There's one reason to use a radar detector: to break the law. 
You'll hear many other excuses, but none valid."

NEWS ANALYSIS; UKRAINE ACCORD RESTS ON HOPE, NOT CONFIDENCE; ARMS: PACT RELIES 
HEAVILY ON KRAVCHUK'S ASSURANCE HE CAN DELIVER DESPITE OPPOSITION IN HIS 
PARLIAMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The agreement announced by President Clinton to peacefully dismantle Ukraine's 
huge nuclear arsenal will be a diplomatic triumph for both Russia and the 
United States -- if it works. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one, including the U.S. officials who negotiated it, is sure that it 
will. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would erase the world's third-largest nuclear arsenal, more than 
1,800 warheads that posed a long-term threat to Russia, the United States and 
much of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether Ukraine actually carries out the deal rests on hope more than 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the pact includes no timetable that commits Ukraine to giving 
up its weapons by a specific final deadline. And it relies heavily on the 
personal assurance of one man, Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk, that he can 
deliver it despite determined opposition from the nationalists who form a 
majority in his Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States has brokered a good deal in which everybody wins," said 
Bruce Blair, a nuclear weapons expert at Washington's Brookings Institution. 
"It is premature to celebrate, however. Ukraine in particular has signed 
agreements along these lines before -- and has broken the promises." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials acknowledge those problems but argue that this is one case in 
which an imperfect agreement is better than no agreement at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is that we get a process going," said a senior State 
Department official who helped negotiate the pact. U.S. officials argue that 
once Ukraine begins dismantling nuclear weapons -- and begins collecting more 
Western economic aid in return -- sentiment in Kiev will swing toward 
continuing the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-way agreement, which Clinton, Kravchuk and Russian President Boris 
N. Yeltsin are to sign in Moscow on Friday, requires Ukraine formally to 
"eliminate" all nuclear weapons on its territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Ukraine will receive nuclear fuel for its civilian power plants, 
debt relief from Russia, a promise of new economic aid from the United States 
and renewed security assurances from both big powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear fuel, worth about $1 billion, will represent the energy equivalent 
of the weapons-grade uranium that Kiev is giving up. Under the pact, Ukraine's 
warheads will be shipped to Siberia, where Russian technicians will extract the 
highly enriched uranium and turn it into less powerful civilian reactor fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact could also lead to a doubling of U.S. economic aid to Ukraine, from 
$155 million this year to $310 million, the White House said. The United States 
has also offered at least $175 million to help pay the actual cost of 
dismantling the nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ukraine fails to keep its promises, officials noted, the Administration 
could respond by withholding much of that aid. 
</P>
<P>
 As for security assurances, the United States and Russia will declare their 
respect for Ukraine's existing borders and its right to independence from 
military or economic coercion. Russia's declaration of respect for Ukraine's 
borders is intended in part to meet a longstanding Ukrainian concern: the 
demand of Russian nationalists for the return of the Crimean Peninsula, which 
was Russian territory before it was transferred to Ukraine in 1954. 
Nevertheless, Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev lost no time in attacking the pact 
on Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an economic crime, because we're giving away pure gold and getting 
back ore," complained Yuri Kostenko, Ukraine's environmental minister and 
deputy chairman of the Parliament's disarmament commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Kostenko, a member of the majority that largely supports Kravchuk, predicted 
that the Parliament will demand the right to approve or disapprove the 
agreement -- a process that could leave the pact in limbo for months. 
</P>
<P>
 To make life easier for Kravchuk, U.S. negotiators agreed to leave two key 
parts of the pact ambiguous, according to officials traveling with Clinton to 
the summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 One is the timetable. The pact does not fix a specific final deadline, because 
Kravchuk warned that it might anger the Parliament, one official said. Instead, 
it recommits Ukraine to observing the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, 
which has a seven-year term -- but even that deadline is not mentioned 
explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is the U.S. demand that Ukraine move quickly to dismantle its most 
dangerous nuclear weapons, 46 long-range SS-24 missiles. Some Ukrainian 
nationalists want to keep the SS-24s as long as possible. So the pact does not 
mention the SS-24s but includes a less specific commitment to eliminate "the 
most dangerous weapons" first, an official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact could cause trouble for Yeltsin in Russia's new Parliament as well. 
"The growing voices of nationalism in Russia will resist relinquishing Russian 
claims on the Crimea, perhaps even on all of Ukraine," noted Blair, citing the 
strength of ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in Russia's 
parliamentary election last month. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have been trying to pin Ukraine down on this kind of deal ever 
since 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated and left strategic nuclear 
weapons scattered across four new countries -- Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and 
Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Kravchuk agreed in principle to give up Ukraine's nuclear weapons. 
But his Parliament, fearful of Russia and suspicious that Ukraine was being 
bilked of the weapons' value, dug in its heels. 
</P>
<P>
 By last summer, Ukraine's economy was on its knees, and Kravchuk wanted a 
deal. Ukrainian and Russian negotiators worked out a swap of warheads for fuel, 
but they disagreed over the amount of compensation and the security guarantees 
that Ukraine wanted -- and called on the United States for help. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, led by special envoy Strobe Talbott and Undersecretary of 
State Lynn Davis, went to work on the issue in September. But each time a deal 
looked close it fell apart -- usually because Ukraine's Parliament objected. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Secretary of State Warren Christopher went all the way to Kiev 
just to get Kravchuk's commitment to ratify the START treaty -- but a few weeks 
later, Parliament added 13 conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 By December, however, Kravchuk wanted to try again. Ukraine's economy was 
plummeting; its inability to pay for oil and gas from Russia forced households 
and offices to set their thermostats at 60 degrees. Moreover, the rise of 
Zhirinovsky raised the specter of a Russia that might use the nuclear issue as 
an excuse to dominate Ukraine once more. 
</P>
<P>
 Two U.S. ideas helped bring about the agreement, officials said. One was to 
strengthen the security assurances for Ukraine by having the United States and 
Russia reaffirm their commitment to secure borders under the 1975 Helsinki 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was to bring in a U.S. agency, the United States Enrichment Corp., 
to advance the money for an initial shipment of nuclear fuel rods to Ukraine.

MILITARY INTERVENTION IN BOSNIA HIGH ON THE AGENDA; SUMMIT: SOME URGE USING 
LONG-DEBATED NATO AIR STRIKES TO LIFT SIEGE OF SARAJEVO. OTHERS COUNSEL 
CAUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The thorny issue of military intervention in Bosnia pushed its way high onto 
the agenda of the first day of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization summit 
here Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As a communique was being drafted that would declare the organization's 
readiness to act against Serbian rebels in Bosnia-Herzegovina, some NATO 
leaders urged that the alliance employ long-debated air strikes to lift the 
siege of Sarajevo, while others counseled caution. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton had set the tone of the debate in the morning by warning 
that any threats of intervention to relieve the "strangulation" of the Bosnian 
capital and other besieged areas had to be more than mere words. "The alliance 
must be prepared to act," the President told his NATO colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the declaration to be issued at the close of the summit today, 
Clinton added: "If we are going to reassert this warning, it cannot be seen as 
mere rhetoric. Those who attack Sarajevo must understand that we are serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "In voting for this language, I expect (NATO) to take action when necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner had told the assembled 
leaders, "NATO has done everything which the United Nations have asked of it in 
the former Yugoslavia and we have done so rapidly and efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 The language concerning Bosnia in the draft of the final summit declaration 
repeated NATO's pledge that the alliance stood ready "to carry out air strikes 
in order to prevent the strangulation of Sarajevo, the safe areas and other 
threatened areas." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether NATO might consider targeting the battling Bosnian 
Croats and Muslims as well as the Serbs besieging Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO leaders had hoped to downplay the Bosnian issue at this summit and 
concentrate instead on the "Partnership for Peace" -- the offer to East 
European countries to link up eventually with NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 But the French, who have the largest contingent of troops in the former 
Yugoslav federation, argued that the Bosnian issue be raised. The United 
Nations' overall commander in the Balkans, French Gen. Jean Cot, has complained 
that he lacks authority from U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to 
defend soldiers engaged in humanitarian efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The French were supported by Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who 
after meeting Clinton on Sunday night, declared: "We must seriously consider 
whether to carry out air strikes. I think more and more countries agree that we 
should do this. We must give a signal." 
</P>
<P>
 But British Prime Minister John Major, who has often urged caution in the use 
of outside force in Bosnia, declared Monday morning that NATO should consider 
what "realistic help" could be given to "keep Bosnians alive and encourage the 
peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Germans and Dutch repeated Clinton's assertion that Sarajevo must not 
be allowed to be strangled by the Serbian siege. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of military intervention has been a touchy one for the nations of 
NATO, an organization that has been accused of dragging its feet over 
assistance to Bosnia's beleaguered Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner, sensitive to charges that NATO is a paper tiger with no real role in 
the post-Cold War era, has indicated his willingness to back NATO's use of air 
strikes and commitment of ground troops to police a cease-fire in Bosnia in the 
event of a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO maintains that any action must be approved by the U.N. Security 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of military intervention in Bosnia say that it will save the 
Muslim community, defend established national boundaries, deny aggressors the 
fruits of their conquest and keep other countries in Eastern Europe from 
practicing "ethnic cleansing." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say that air strikes will only increase the bloodshed in the former 
Yugoslav republic, kill innocent civilians and risk retaliation against the 
Western soldiers currently serving under U.N. helmets to protect aid convoys. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the end, they say, bombing will not stop the fighting.

ISRAEL-PLO TALKS RESUME; AGREEMENT IS EXPECTED TO TAKE SEVERAL WEEKS; MIDEAST: 
RENEWAL OF DISCUSSIONS ENDS PROLONGED STALEMATE. PALESTINIANS SEE QUICKER 
RESOLUTION THAN ISRAELIS PREDICT. 
</P>

<P>
 At this breezy coastal resort that was once a flash point of the Arab-Israeli 
conflict, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed their troubled talks for 
Palestinian autonomy Monday but predicted that an agreement is at least several 
weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting only a few hundred yards from the Israeli border in this Red Sea 
outpost, the last place handed back by Israel in its historic peace treaty with 
Egypt, the two sides ended several weeks of stalemate to begin working through 
the issues that so far have blocked any agreement on Palestinian self-rule in 
the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials cautioned that many weeks of grueling discussions lie ahead, 
but Palestinians said the remaining disputes could be worked through in the 
next two to three weeks. PLO representatives warned that an agreement must be 
signed before the April 13 deadline envisioned in the original peace accord for 
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the two autonomous areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly what the differences are, and I know that they are solvable, 
and I know that three weeks is enough," chief PLO negotiator Nabil Shaath said, 
minimizing Israeli fears that the April 13 date for withdrawal may not be 
realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they say that, they're violating the agreement, right and left. . . . And 
if we are going to play havoc with this second date, then we are playing havoc 
with the whole agreement," Shaath said. "I think it is a sad tragedy for any 
party to claim publicly that he wants to violate the agreement. We should both 
sit down and do it, rather than talking about delaying it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel, stung by what it perceived as Palestinian backtracking on 
understandings negotiated in recent weeks, made it clear that it will insist on 
exhaustively locking in every detail before any agreement is signed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that we have a very great deal of very complicated work in 
front of us, and I would say that the estimate of two to three weeks seems a 
little optimistic," Israeli delegation spokesman Ami Gluska said. "There's a 
great deal of work. Gaps have to be bridged, formulations have to be made. . . 
. But we shall make every effort to finish as soon as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Amnon Shahak, the chief Israeli negotiator, would not commit himself 
to a three-week deadline but said: "This is a place for optimistic people. If I 
wasn't optimistic, I wouldn't be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Talks have been at a standstill for more than two weeks, after Israeli Foreign 
Minister Shimon Peres and PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas met for two straight 
days in Cairo to try to complete an agreement, only to find the two sides 
bickering about what they had -- or had not -- agreed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, negotiators say they will try to build on some of the compromises 
discussed in Cairo and lock in the details that will allow an agreement to be 
signed and put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In several respects, the issues appear to be more sharply defined and the gaps 
narrower than at any time since the talks commenced in October, despite the 
recent finger-pointing and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 On one of the most crucial issues -- the size of the area in Jericho that will 
be under Palestinian control -- Shaath said that Palestinians have dropped 
their demand for a region of at least 200 square kilometers and are instead 
focusing on specific areas they want to control. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, this means that Palestinians might not object to an area of the 
size Israel is now proposing -- about 54 square kilometers, or 21 square miles 
-- if it includes areas the Palestinians consider critical, among them an 
access to the Dead Sea, all Palestinian-owned land and several religious sites, 
one of which fronts on the strategic Jordan River, the international border 
with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have abandoned defining Jericho as including Cairo to Damascus," Shaath 
said in an interview. "We have stopped counting mileage. Now we are talking 
about positions and areas, rather than counting mileage." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath also hinted that negotiators may be approaching a compromise on the 
difficult issue of who will control international border crossings. According 
to Israeli press reports, the plan proposes Palestinian and Israeli counters at 
crossings, with Israelis permitted to check incoming persons visually and with 
electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the crossings we're close in certain aspects, but the two (the issue of 
crossings and the size of Jericho) are very much intertwined," Shaath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taba was the site of the earliest talks following the signing of the original 
Declaration of Principles between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization in Washington on Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides were scheduled to break into smaller committees today to work 
out details of the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question of whether the April 13 deadline for withdrawal of troops can 
be met remained the most troubling undercurrent of the newly resumed talks. The 
two sides already have missed the Dec. 13 deadline envisioned in the original 
agreement for signing a detailed accord and beginning the withdrawal. The April 
13 date must not be similarly missed, Shaath stressed in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never. Never. I think we will lose all trust in the Israelis' willingness to 
have peace if they violate the 13th of April," he said. He said the PLO will 
demand that the United States and Russia, the co-sponsors of the peace process, 
intervene and arbitrate if the April 13 deadline is jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Jerusalem, Israeli leaders warned that until they have a satisfactory 
agreement, they will not begin pulling their troops out or turning over 
government functions in Gaza and Jericho to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say it again -- there are no sacred dates," Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin declared. "In the Declaration of Principles, stages and target dates are 
discussed, but the target dates are based on the ability to reach an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Peres said that Israel is obliged under the accord with the PLO to complete 
its pullback four months after an implementing agreement is signed, but nothing 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy reported from Taba and Parks reported from Jerusalem.

U.S. PLANS HUMAN RIGHTS DIALOGUE WITH VIETNAM; DIPLOMACY: MEETINGS WILL BE 
AMONG LAST STEPS TOWARD LIFTING TRADE EMBARGO. OFFICIALS SAY CLINTON WILL 
PROBABLY DO THAT WITHIN A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration announced plans Monday to open a formal dialogue on 
human rights with Vietnam in one of the last steps toward lifting the U.S. 
trade embargo against Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Both State Department and National Security Council officials have recommended 
that President Clinton remove the 19-year-old embargo, according to 
Administration and private sources in Washington. They said Clinton probably 
will act in late January or early February after Congress returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, Administration officials insist that the President has not given 
final approval to the move. While announcing the new human rights dialogue, 
State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly cautioned, "At this particular 
point in time, no decision has been made on further steps." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to start the new human rights dialogue was arranged during a 
trip to Hanoi last month by Winston Lord, assistant secretary of state for East 
Asia and the Pacific. The State Department spokesman said Lord will meet "soon" 
with Le Bang, Vietnam's ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 By establishing formal human rights talks now, the Administration could 
counteract in part the argument that the United States should hold up normal 
relations with Vietnam until Hanoi -- which has one of the world's last 
Communist regimes -- alters its repressive policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) said in an interview that the announcement on human 
rights is "welcome news." But he added: "I don't think this should be a fig 
leaf, and I don't think a dialogue in the United States is enough. We should 
send a human rights delegation to Vietnam soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our price for normalization should be freedom for the people of Vietnam," 
said Kerrey, a veteran who lost a leg during the Vietnam War. "We fought a war 
there for freedom. I want Vietnam to know Americans are prepared to come back 
there proud and with their heads up. I'm not talking about (Vietnam) having 
elections soon, but I believe Vietnam is in a position to change its human 
rights policies." 
</P>
<P>
 A number of members of Congress and prominent Vietnam veterans such as former 
Navy Secretary James H. Webb have voiced similar views. The Senate is 
considering a provision sponsored by Kerrey that would require Hanoi to make 
progress on human rights before the Administration could establish normal 
relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The American position, dating back to the George Bush Administration, is that, 
since Vietnam helped contribute to a peace settlement of Cambodia's civil war, 
the last condition holding up normal relations is Hanoi's full cooperation in 
accounting for Americans missing in action during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelly, the State Department spokeswoman, stressed that there is no direct 
"linkage" between the human rights issue and normal ties with Vietnam. But she 
added, "Certainly the human rights question is a part of the overall 
relationship and the considerations that we're looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Hanoi has imprisoned Buddhist monks and Roman Catholic 
priests, maintained press censorship, banned works by Vietnamese authors and 
sentenced political opponents to prison terms of as much as 12 years for 
"counterrevolutionary" crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The human rights group Asia Watch, in its recent annual report, said Vietnam 
had "a mixed human rights performance" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government released or reduced prison sentences for a number of 
well-known dissidents at the same time that it imprisoned others for peaceful 
expression of their views," the organization said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other governments, including Australia and Germany, have sent human rights 
representatives or delegations to Vietnam over the last few months. But Mike 
Jendrzejczyk (, Washington representative for Asia Watch, said that over the 
past year, "human rights has taken a back seat to POW/MIA issues." 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 1,600 Americans still listed as missing in Vietnam from 
the war, as well as nearly 600 Americans listed as missing elsewhere in 
Indochina. 
</P>
<P>
 During its last months in office, the Bush Administration considered lifting 
the trade embargo against Vietnam. But it held off after deciding that there 
was not enough time for Hanoi to resolve the questions surrounding American 
POW/MIAs. 
</P>
<P>
 That left the issue up to Clinton. During the 1992 presidential primaries and 
general election, Clinton's efforts to avoid the military draft during the 
Vietnam War had been a prominent campaign issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, the Clinton Administration has cleared the way for 
international financial institutions to resume lending to Vietnam, and the 
President has authorized American companies to compete for the contracts that 
Vietnam hands out after getting these new loans. But Clinton held back from 
lifting the embargo itself on grounds that he wanted to get "the fullest 
possible accounting of our POW/MIAs." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, during his visit to Vietnam in December, said he was satisfied with the 
cooperation Hanoi was giving to the United States in efforts to locate and 
account for missing Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Mills Griffiths, the head of the National League of Families of American 
Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, said any lifting of the trade embargo 
now would amount to a violation of Clinton's commitments because Vietnam is 
still deliberately holding back information on POW/MIAs.

 A huge extended family of neighbors, friends and politicians said farewell 
Monday to former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), who was 
hailed as a great-hearted man who never forgot his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, who was 81 when he died Wednesday, was eulogized at his funeral as 
the last of the big-time Boston Irish politicians, a warm and caring friend, a 
natural storyteller and the embodiment of the New Deal spirit in the Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among the mourners were his widow, Mildred, his five children and 
many grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting tears, House Rules Chairman J. Joseph Moakley (D-Mass.) paid tribute 
to his friend and mentor as the ideal politician, one who "treated Mrs. O'Leary 
down the street with the same respect as the president of any country." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the dignitaries were former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Gerald R. Ford, 
Vice President Al Gore, Massachusetts Gov. William F. Weld, House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), House Minority Leader Robert J. Michel (R-Ill.), 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), and 
Rep. Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), who holds O'Neill's old House seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of additional politicians and others overflowed the St. John the 
Evangelist church sanctuary.

REPORT CLEARS MANY DRUGS AS OK FOR BREAST-FEEDING MOTHERS TO TAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breast-feeding mothers can take many drugs without endangering their infants, 
but some still should be avoided, doctors reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The majority of drugs either don't cross into breast milk or do so in such 
small amounts that they don't hurt the baby," said Cheston Berlin of Penn State 
University's Hershey Medical Center.He said physicians too often tell mothers 
not to breast feed if they are taking medication, but "we're trying to dispel 
this notion" and tell women exactly what is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin was on a committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which revised 
and updated the group's policy statement on the issue. It was published Monday 
in Pediatrics, the academy's monthly journal. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded that most antibiotics, heart and high blood pressure 
medicines and non-prescription cold remedies will not harm nursing infants. It 
also suggested that up to six cups of coffee a day are safe, as well as minimal 
alcohol consumption -- one or two glasses of wine a week, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Drugs to avoid, the statement said, include such abused substances as cocaine, 
marijuana, heroin, nicotine and PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers who are undergoing chemotherapy should not breast feed, the policy 
statement said, and aspirin should be avoided in favor of acetaminophen. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also lists drugs whose effects are unknown but may be of concern, 
including such anti-anxiety agents as Valium, anti-depressants and 
anti-psychotic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most drugs are sold with patient package inserts or label instructions that 
give the manufacturer's advice when there is a question about use by 
breast-feeding women.

 The nomination of a liberal, anti-Vietnam War activist to be assistant

COURT TO DECIDE MEDICAL SCHOOL REIMBURSEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court said Monday it would rule on whether teaching hospitals can 
seek government reimbursement for the multimillion-dollar cost of training 
young doctors who work with elderly patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Medicare program, hospitals are paid for their direct costs of 
providing interns and residents. But the government has balked at paying the 
extra training costs normally covered by a university medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 The lower courts have split on whether the government's position is reasonable 
and the justices announced that they would resolve the question this spring in 
the case of Thomas Jefferson University vs. Shalala, 93-120. 
</P>
<P>
 About $145 million in reimbursements are at stake, Justice Department lawyers 
told the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices also said they would resolve an unusual dispute between Congress 
and the high court involving the time limits for filing a securities fraud 
case. The case it will consider involves a suit filed by a Newport Beach, 
Calif., insurance firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the high court in a 5-4 decision set a new nationwide standard for 
filing claims of fraud involving stock, bonds or other securities. Adopting the 
federal rule, the court said that a person who has been defrauded must file a 
suit within one year of discovering the fraud, or within three years of the 
fraud itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But many states had more lenient laws and hundreds of pending suits were filed 
after those time limits. If enforced, the high court's strict time rule 
threatened to extinguish pending claims against the so-called S&L kingpins 
accused of causing the collapse of many thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction, Congress hurriedly passed a law reinstating those pending suits. 
But the lower courts have divided on whether to follow the guidance of the high 
court or Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the justices have agreed to reconsider the issue and rule on whether 
Congress can supersede a high court ruling and revive an already-dismissed 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A ruling in the case (First Republicbank vs. Pacific Mutual, 93-609) will 
determine whether an estimated 200 lawsuits can go forward. Pacific Mutual, a 
life insurance company based in Newport Beach, had purchased debt securities 
issued by a Texas bank that was acquired by First Republicbank of Dallas. 
Pacific Mutual sued First Republicbank over the effect of the acquisition on 
debt holders. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Refused to squelch a trial in which California inmates seek to force the 
state's prison industry authority to pay them the federal minimum wage. The 
court, without comment, let stand a federal judge's ruling that a trial is 
needed to determine whether the minimum wage applies to work done by California 
prison inmates. The case is In Re Prison Authority, 93-730. 
</P>
<P>
 * Let stand an Ohio law that requires a pregnant teen-ager to notify a parent 
before getting an abortion or to convince a judge that she is mature enough to 
make the decision on her own (Cleveland Surgi-Center vs. Jones, 93-787). 
Several abortion doctors said that the law is being applied too strictly but 
lower court judges said they did not have the legal right to contest the 
matter. Recently, the high court has refused to tamper with state laws 
restricting the abortion rights of minors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rejected a claim by environmentalists who contended that President Clinton 
needed to undertake an environmental assessment before seeking final approval 
of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Public Citizen and Sierra Club vs. 
U.S. Trade Representative, 93-560). An appeals court had ruled that the 
President has the sole authority to negotiate treaties and without judicial 
interference.

VA HOSPITALS CHECKED FOR POSSIBLE ROLES IN RADIATION EXPERIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Veterans Affairs is surveying all 172 VA hospitals on any 
role they may have had in post-World War II radiation experiments, some of them 
possibly involving unwitting patients, Secretary Jesse Brown said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 48 VA hospitals had radioisotope laboratories licensed by 1958, 11 
years after the VA established a secret atomic medicine program to augment 
research into the fledgling field by the Atomic Energy Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual reports published by the Veterans Administration, which was replaced by 
the Department of Veterans Affairs in 1989, show that 959 radioisotope studies 
or research projects were carried out in 1955 and 1956 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said he did not know whether any of those experiments or others 
conducted at VA hospitals between 1947 and 1979 are among the estimated 800 
radiation tests on human beings disclosed last month by Energy Secretary Hazel 
O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 But VA documents indicate that its secret atomic medicine and more public 
radioisotope programs begun in 1947 were intended to complement research by the 
AEC, the predecessor to O'Leary's department. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the VA was a pioneer in the use of medical radioisotopes 
for diagnosing and treating a wide variety of ailments, including dysfunctional 
thyroid glands, brain tumors, leukemia and other cancers.

LORENA BOBBITT'S TRIAL FOR CUTTING PENIS BEGINS; COURT: DEFENSE WILL ARGUE THAT 
ABUSE DROVE HER TO MUTILATE HUSBAND. HIS LAWYER SAYS IT WAS JEALOUSY. THE MEDIA 
AND T-SHIRT SELLERS MOB VIRGINIA TOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case that has captured the lurid fascination of a nation, a 24-year-old 
manicurist from Venezuela went on trial in a small Virginia courthouse Monday 
for cutting off her husband's penis to avenge what her lawyers say was years of 
abuse and rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking tired but composed, Lorena Bobbitt was whisked through a phalanx of TV 
cameras and reporters in Manassas, Va., to face charges of malicious wounding 
in the same courtroom where her husband, John Wayne Bobbitt, 26, was acquitted 
in November of sexually assaulting her. 
</P>
<P>
 She faces up to 20 years in prison, if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening remarks to the jury of seven women and five men, Mrs. Bobbitt's 
lawyers indicated they plan to argue that she was driven to the mental edge by 
years of physical and verbal abuse by her bar-bouncer husband -- driven to the 
point where, on the night of June 23, 1993, she cut off his penis with a 
kitchen knife in a temporary fit of insanity as he lay sleeping after what she 
says was a bout of forced sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaten so badly that she sometimes looked like she had been attacked "by a 
wild animal," pressured into having an unwanted abortion and constantly 
humiliated by her muscular, 200-pound, ex-Marine husband, Mrs. Bobbitt was the 
"classic battered woman," said defense attorney Lisa Kimler. In the end, Kimler 
said, she was driven over the edge by one sexual assault too many in the 
four-year "reign of terror" that was her marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have is Lorena Bobbitt's life juxtaposed against John Wayne Bobbitt's 
penis," Kimler said. "It was his penis from which she could not escape and . . 
. I submit to you that at the end of this case you will come to one conclusion: 
that a life is more valuable than a penis." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on testimony from friends, acquaintances and medical experts, the 
defense team will try to convince the jury that Mrs. Bobbitt surrendered to an 
"irresistible impulse" when she went into the kitchen of her Manassas 
apartment, came back with a knife and severed her husband's penis after he 
forced himself upon her after a night of bar-hopping and beer-drinking with a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Bobbitt, taking the stand as the prosecution's first witness, denied 
that he had forced his wife to have sex with that night. He said she had 
initiated the love-making by fondling him in bed, but he was "too exhausted to 
perform" and quickly fell asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Bobbitt told reporters they did not believe that Mrs. Bobbitt's 
defense would be able to substantiate a claim of "irresistible impulse," a plea 
that is tantamount to temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "To prove irresistible impulse, you have to show it was an act done in 
passion, suddenly and unpremeditated," said Bobbitt's attorney, Gregory Murphy. 
But "her testimony at the first trial," in which Bobbitt was acquitted of rape, 
"contradicts that fact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy asserted that Mrs. Bobbitt instead acted out of jealousy because her 
husband was seeing other women and the couple was on the verge of a divorce. 
"She was vindictive. She said: 'If I can't have John, no one can" Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief prosecutor Paul B. Ebert argued that Mrs. Bobbitt had committed a 
"serious crime" -- one he urged the jurors not to treat lightly, despite "all 
the jokes" and the "zoo-like" atmosphere surrounding the two-story brick 
courthouse in downtown Manassas. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which Virginia prosecutors believe is the first involving this type 
of offense in U.S. court history, has brought reporters from as far away as 
Europe and South America to Manassas, a normally sleepy town 30 miles from 
Washington near a Civil War battle site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had capital murder cases that have attracted national attention in the 
past but nothing ever like this," Ebert said in a pretrial interview. "The 
vultures have really descended on us. . . . It looks like Super Bowl Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Television trucks with satellite dishes lined the road leading to the 
courthouse while hawkers peddled "Where's the Beef?" T-shirts and other 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides said that they were upset by the carnival-like 
spectacle, but Jerilyn Ross, a Washington specialist in anxiety disorders, said 
she was not surprised by the public's fascination with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Literature is filled with references to castration . . . to the taking away 
of a man's power. It's man's worst fear," Ross said. "What people find so 
frightening and at the same time fascinating about this case (is that) somebody 
actually did it."

SUSPECT HELD IN CARDINAL'S SLAYING IS DENIED ASYLUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 A street gang member wanted in the slaying of the cardinal of Guadalajara 
faces imminent deportation after a U.S. federal judge Monday rejected his 
request to remain in the United States and seek political asylum, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marilyn Huff ruled that suspected hired gun Adolfo Marin 
Cuevas may not apply for asylum because of his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no lawful grounds for him to be granted political asylum," said 
Assistant U.S. Atty. John Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin's lawyers had argued that he faces torture or death at the hands of 
authorities if he is returned to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring a last-minute reprieve from a federal appeals court in San Francisco, 
Marin will be eligible for deportation at noon today, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marin, 27, is one of five gang members arrested in the United States in 
connection with the death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo and six others 
in May in a shootout at the Guadalajara airport. The other suspects face 
extradition or deportation proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities charge that the members of San Diego's 30th Street gang formed an 
assassination squad that was sent to Guadalajara by a Tijuana drug cartel to 
kill a rival kingpin and killed Cardinal Posadas by mistake during the 
shootout. The prime suspects in the cardinal's death -- three brothers who run 
the Arellano cartel and their top lieutenants -- have eluded capture despite a 
sweeping investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Four additional San Diego gang members were arrested in Mexico last year; one 
of them died mysteriously in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In September a judge ordered Marin's deportation, finding that he was in the 
country illegally. His attorney appealed, arguing that Marin faces grave harm 
at the hands of Mexican police, citing the prison death and presenting claims 
that the other suspects were tortured repeatedly in Mexico. Marin sought 
political asylum on those grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Judge Huff said Monday that the law makes Marin ineligible for asylum 
because of his 1989 conviction for dealing PCP, which makes him an aggravated 
felon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deportation proceedings are pending in the case of the most recently arrested 
suspect, Isaac Guevara Hernandez, who was caught by San Diego police last month 
and is accused by Mexican authorities of having taken part in the Guadalajara 
shooting.

REAGAN FOUNDATION OPENS $20-MILLION FUNDING DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation on Monday announced a $20-million 
fund-raising drive to help pay for new exhibits at the Ronald Reagan 
Presidential Library near here and conferences at the library's Center for 
Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign will try to tap the 40,000 people nationwide who have donated to 
the 8-year-old foundation and seek funds from corporations and other potential 
donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an endowment that is specially designed to create certain kinds of 
programs that will be public oriented as much as possible," said Richard Norton 
Smith, director of the foundation and Center for Public Affairs. "We do not 
want to create an ivory tower here and I have always believed that it is 
possible to create programs that combine intellectual substance and popular 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 At the former President's request, the campaign will be co-chaired by his 
wife, Nancy, and Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., head of Forbes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am delighted that Steve and Nancy have accepted this important challenge 
for the foundation," the former President said in a prepared statement. "It is 
my hope that the library and museum will examine the past, weigh the present 
and play an important role in shaping the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation raised $60 million to build the 153,000-square-foot library and 
museum 50 miles northwest of Los Angeles on a hilltop overlooking the city of 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, the foundation turned over most of the library to the 
National Archives and Records Administration, which is responsible for the 
storehouse of presidential documents accumulated during Reagan's eight years in 
the White House. The federal agency also operates the museum and exhibits at 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, Reagan's private, nonprofit foundation has focused on 
establishing the library, Smith said. It has been only in the past year or so 
that the group has looked to the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to get one chapter behind them in terms of building the building 
and paying for the building before they could begin the next chapter," Smith 
said. "Basically, the last year has been spent in a kind of internal debate 
over what we want to be, what next?" 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has planned special events and conferences in the coming year 
that Smith said will help establish the library and Center for Public Affairs 
as a tourist and cultural destination with broad and wide appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 28, author and syndicated columnist George Will is scheduled to appear 
at the library to inaugurate a new speakers series known as "The Reagan Forum." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, former Secretary of State George Shultz is scheduled to be the 
keynote speaker at a seminar entitled, "The Perils of Democracy." The program 
will focus on the transition to democracy in the nations of the former Soviet 
Union and Eastern Bloc. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said other changes planned at the library include a remodeling of the 
popular "Oval Office" display so visitors can enter the room and hear Reagan's 
tape-recorded recollections on working in the White House.

JUDGE DENIES REQUEST FOR NEW TRIAL BY LOBBYIST JACKSON, EX-SEN. CARPENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge rejected a defense request to order a new trial for former 
lobbyist Clayton R. Jackson and former state Sen. Paul B. Carpenter on 
corruption charges. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia, who conducted a seven-week trial that 
resulted in guilty verdicts last month, rejected claims that the government 
engaged in entrapment and misconduct. Both defendants were in court. They are 
free on their own recognizance and are scheduled to be sentenced Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson was convicted of bribing former state Sen. Alan Robbins in connection 
with bills of interest to Jackson's clients, among other corruption charges. 
Both Jackson and Carpenter were convicted of engaging in a money-laundering 
scheme with Robbins (D-Van Nuys).

LAWYER SEEKS JACKSON FINANCIAL RECORDS; INVESTIGATION: ATTORNEY FOR THE BOY 
ALLEGEDLY MOLESTED BY THE SINGER FILES PARTIAL TRANSCRIPTS OF DEPOSITIONS 
TELLING OF BEDROOM ACTIVITY AND PHOTOS. JACKSON'S COUNSEL SAYS THE PAPERS 
MISREPRESENT SWORN STATEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jackson routinely shared his bed with young boys, kept a hidden closet 
with photographs of children and installed a security system to alert him 
whenever anyone approached his bedroom, according to former employees 
interviewed as part of a lawsuit brought by a boy who says the entertainer 
molested him. 
</P>
<P>
 Partial transcripts of those depositions were filed Monday in Superior Court 
as part of a motion brought by the boy's lawyer, who argues that he should be 
allowed access to Jackson's financial records because there is a "substantial 
probability" that his client will win his lawsuit. Also included is a 
declaration from the alleged victim, who repeats almost word for word the 
allegations he made to police and social workers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts and other legal documents filed Monday provide the foundation 
of the boy's lawsuit against Jackson, detailing the evidence for the first time 
and summarizing the civil case against the pop superstar. They include sworn 
depositions from the singer's chauffeur, former maids and a former secretary 
who admits that she told police Jackson was a "chicken hawk," or pedophile, 
though she now regrets the statement and disavows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is substantial direct and circumstantial evidence that plaintiff was 
sexually molested by Jackson," the boy's lawyer, Larry R. Feldman, said in his 
motion. Feldman's client was 13 years old at the time of the alleged 
molestation. He turns 14 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, one of the lawyers representing Jackson, said the portions of 
the transcripts filed by Feldman misrepresent the depositions, and he 
vigorously reasserted his client's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are half-truths and untruths," Weitzman said of the claims made by 
Feldman. "When all the facts come out, we are confident that Mr. Jackson will 
be vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who also is representing Jackson, echoed Weitzman's 
remarks. "This is innuendo and misrepresentation," he said of Feldman's motion. 
"It just points out how he is trying this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the latest legal effort by the boy's attorney highlights the 
difficulties that Jackson faces as he attempts to battle allegations of child 
molestation and sets the stage for his scheduled deposition next week. In fact, 
even as that deposition date draws near, Jackson's lawyers warned that he may 
decline to speak under oath unless he can get assurances that his testimony 
will not be used against him in the possible criminal case that prosecutors 
from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties are contemplating. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a decision that Johnnie (Cochran) and I still have not made," Weitzman 
said when asked whether Jackson would agree to give his deposition as 
scheduled. "However, it is unlikely that we would be willing to give up any 
constitutional protections that Mr. Jackson might have." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the partial transcripts attached to Feldman's motion are long excerpts 
from the sworn testimony of Blanca Francia, a former maid to the entertainer 
who has previously spoken to police as well as to The Times and to the tabloid 
television program "Hard Copy." Francia's statements during her Dec. 15. 
deposition were her first under oath, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Francia, who will be questioned again by lawyers today, worked for Jackson for 
five years beginning in 1986. During her deposition, she detailed a number of 
instances in which she said she saw the entertainer naked or partially clothed 
with young boys -- whose names are deleted from the transcripts. She also 
recounted seeing Jackson in bed or in a sleeping bag with boys, sometimes 
during the day, and she said that Jackson told her not to tell anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says that whatever I saw is none of anybody's business," said Francia, who 
immigrated to the United States from El Salvador in 1975. "And that he liked 
me, and that if I (was) ever asked by anyone, not to tell anything about him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While working at the Neverland Ranch, Francia also said she once found a 
photograph of a young boy, apparently naked except for a sheet that covered his 
genitals. Francia told the attorneys that she does not know what became of that 
photograph, but she added that Jackson stored a number of photographs and 
videotapes of children in a "closet within a closet" at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman confirmed that there is a closet such as the one described by 
Francia, but he said it had been built by the previous owner of Jackson's home. 
Moreover, Weitzman said, the closet did not contain anything suggesting that 
Jackson ever molested children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inference that Michael Jackson built it for some nefarious purpose is 
false," Weitzman said, "absolutely false." 
</P>
<P>
 During her deposition, Francia also disclosed that shortly after she began 
working for Jackson, he installed a security system at his Neverland Ranch in 
Los Olivos. Among other features, the system would alert Jackson whenever 
someone approached his bedroom, she testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It make a bell, like a little bell," said Francia. Another maid, Adrian 
McManus, also discussed the security system during her deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sensors that would alert Jackson to anyone outside the bedroom, 
the door to the room contained a peephole, Francia added, according to the 
deposition transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman dismissed the importance of the security system, noting that a common 
feature of such systems is that they warn their owners if someone is in the 
house and might be approaching a bedroom. "Most homes that are equipped with 
sophisticated security systems have electric eyes at strategic locations," 
Weitzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several representatives of companies specializing in home security told The 
Times on Monday that motion detectors are common features. 
</P>
<P>
 Francia's earlier comments have been challenged by members of the Jackson 
family and legal team, many of whom note that she was paid thousands of dollars 
for her interview with "Hard Copy." Although Francia was not paid for her 
interviews with police or The Times, Jackson's lawyers say the money she 
received from "Hard Copy" undermines her credibility as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Cochran said that Francia told attorneys that she never saw 
Jackson molest any boys. He cited Feldman's failure to include that portion of 
her deposition as evidence that Feldman's motion misrepresents the facts of the 
case. Feldman insisted that he did not withhold any relevant information from 
deposition excerpts he filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Francia's account is not the only one cited in Feldman's motion for access to 
the singer's financial records. The boy himself submitted a sworn declaration 
in which he repeated the allegations he made to social workers and police last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As in his interview by police and social workers, the boy described an 
escalating series of alleged sexual advances by Jackson, beginning with hugs 
and kisses and culminating in Jackson masturbating himself and the boy. The 
relationship ended in July, according to the boy, after his father obtained 
custody of him and broke off his contact with Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has maintained that he is the victim of a failed extortion attempt by 
the father, and he has repeatedly proclaimed his innocence. Although police and 
sheriff's deputies from Los Angeles and Santa Barbara counties continue to 
investigate the allegations of sexual molestation, Jackson has not been charged 
with any crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman and Jackson's attorneys agreed last month not to divulge certain kinds 
of information -- including details about children and Jackson's security 
systems. Late Monday, Superior Court Judge David Rothman sealed the documents 
filed by Feldman in order to determine whether the material contained in them 
should be protected by court order. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other edited depositions filed Monday in connection with the lawsuit is 
one taken from Jolie Levine, who worked as Jackson's secretary for two years 
starting in 1987. Levine told the lawyers that she called Jackson a "chicken 
hawk," a slang term for a pedophile, when police interviewed her about the 
allegations against her former boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when you told that to the detectives or the police, you meant by that 
that Michael Jackson was a pedophile, correct?" asked Robert Turner, an 
associate of Feldman who also is representing the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was caught off guard, angry, surprised," Levine said. "I didn't really mean 
saying that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's lawyers accused Feldman of filing the documents Monday merely as a 
way to make allegations against the singer public. But Feldman, in the papers, 
argues that he needs access to Jackson's financial records now because 
analyzing them will be difficult and time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his income and real estate holdings, Jackson, one of the 
world's wealthiest entertainers, owns the Beatles' song catalogue and other 
difficult-to-value assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a millionaire hundreds of times over whose assets are tied up in 
intangibles," Feldman wrote. "Plaintiff will need the three months remaining 
before the trial date to be able to track down these assets and come up with an 
approximation of their worth."

SLANDER SUIT AGAINST GATES IS DISMISSED 
</P>

 A judge has thrown out a $30-million slander suit filed by a former Los 
Angeles police lieutenant against former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and the 
city over remarks Gates made about the lieutenant's conduct at one of the flash 
points of the 1992 riots, the city attorney's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This court finds there is no direct evidence that Gates believed the 
statements alleged to be defamatory were false, or that either party has 
entertained serious doubts about the truth of those statements," Los Angeles 
Superior Court Judge Richard C. Hubbell said in the ruling handed down Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after the riots had been contained, Gates told reporters that although 
a Los Angeles Police Department lieutenant had been right to withdraw from 
Florence and Normandie avenues as violence there escalated, the lieutenant had 
been wrong not to quickly regain control of the intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a responsibility to regroup and form up in squads and obtain 
additional people and go back to that location and clean it up," Gates said 
during the news conference on May 8, 1992. "Unfortunately, he did not do that. 
. . . That was a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Michael Moulin -- a 21-year LAPD veteran who had been in charge of 
officers at the intersection when the violence erupted -- was at home watching 
television when Gates made his remarks. Moulin said that even though Gates did 
not mention him by name, he knew he was being singled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the end of my career," Moulin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Moulin and Gates saw their mostly distinguished careers unravel in the 
wake of the department's failure to stem the violence at Florence and 
Normandie. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin returned to work once, for a few hours, then retired on a stress 
pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates -- accused of failing to provide adequate leadership -- was driven from 
office, becoming a talk show host on radio station KFI, a job he quit last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulin filed a lawsuit in October, 1992, alleging that Gates had slandered 
him, invaded his privacy and intentionally caused him emotional distress. Named 
as co-defendants were a number of television programs on which the former chief 
made his remarks, Gates, the city of Los Angeles and KFI. 
</P>
<P>
 The invasion of privacy and emotional distress claims were dismissed from the 
suit, and the television programs were dropped as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A legal fight erupted over whether the case should go to trial. Gates' lawyers 
contended that the chief merely was stating his opinions and never sought to 
harm Moulin. Moulin's attorneys countered that Gates had maliciously attacked 
Moulin in an effort to shield himself from criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Gates' motion for dismissal that Hubbell ruled on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Mary Tornton House said Hubbell agreed with the city's 
position that Gates made his statements without malice and without any reason 
to believe that they may be false. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Gates nor Moulin nor their attorneys could be reached for comment 
Monday.

TOP L.A. OFFICIALS PLEDGE UNIFIED EFFORT TO CURB CAMPUS VIOLENCE; EDUCATION: 
CENTRAL TO PLAN IS THE CREATION OF 'SAFE PASSAGE CORRIDORS,' INCLUDING PATROLS 
OF STUDENTS' ROUTES. PILOT PROGRAMS WILL BE LAUNCHED AT DORSEY HIGH AND LENNOX 
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

<P>
 In a strong show of unity, several of Los Angeles' highest-ranking police 
officials, educators and politicians pledged Monday to devise community plans 
with local officials to curb violence in and around campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerstone of the plans will be the creation of "safe passage corridors" 
in which police, community members and school officials will identify and 
patrol school routes to help ensure that young people are safe as they travel 
to and from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference at the Los Angeles Police Academy that was generally 
short on specifics, Los Angeles Police Chief Willie Williams, county Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Sid Thompson 
and top deputies of Mayor Richard Riordan and county Sheriff Sherman Block said 
that making schools safe will be a priority in their departments in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every child in Los Angeles County should have a corridor of safe passage to 
school," Burke said. "We have a responsibility to say to every child: One place 
you are safe is school." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot programs will be launched at Dorsey High School in Los Angeles and 
Lennox Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the officials, however, volunteered additional money or resources. 
They emphasized that just bringing disparate bureaucracies together was an 
important first step. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of our children have to travel through neighborhoods and have to enter 
environments where death, destruction, guns, drugs and gang activity are part 
of their everyday routes to school," Williams said. "We are committed to trying 
to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey High School Principal Jerelene Wells said that a series of such 
interagency meetings has led to a soon-to-be-realized crime deterrent at her 
school -- a fence to keep intruders out. 
</P>
<P>
 School safety issues rank among the top concerns of parents and educators in 
the region. In the past year there have been two fatal shootings on Los Angeles 
high school campuses and numerous shootings, stabbings and brawls among 
students just outside school grounds. Countywide, about 1,000 students have 
been expelled for carrying weapons on campus in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the first day of school in September, a 15-year-old boy was shot and 
critically wounded at Dorsey High School. Last month, another boy was shot and 
wounded outside Chatsworth High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Norman L. Rouillier, commander of the Police Department's Southwest 
division, which includes Dorsey, said increased police presence before and 
after school has gone a long way to deter crime around campus since the 
September shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the pilot program, the duties of one of his officers will include 
coordinating safe school routes, Rouillier said.  
</P>
<P>
 Several parent activists reacted cautiously to the officials' pronouncements, 
saying that local authorities have responded slowly to their concerns and that 
meetings and talk alone will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to start putting resources in the schools," said Ellen Eckard, 
president of the Parent Teacher Students Assn. at Sutter Middle School in 
Canoga Park. "So much has been taken away from the kids, all their activities. 
Kids need a place where they can be other than the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Hillard, whose son, Demetrius Rice, was fatally shot a year ago at 
Fairfax High School, said the promises of help are "welcome as long as they 
commit to follow-through." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been almost a year since Demetrius died," Hillard said. "It has taken 
his death, Michael Ensley's death at Reseda High, the injury of Glynn Brown at 
Dorsey, the incident at Chatsworth to get this far -- I'd say that's a bit 
slow."

PRISONERS ARE SEGREGATED AFTER BRAWL; JAILS: THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SAYS THE 
ACTION IS TEMPORARY 'UNTIL THINGS CALM DOWN' BETWEEN BLACKS AND LATINOS AT 
PITCHESS FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In response one of the largest brawls ever between black and Latino prisoners 
at the racially troubled Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic, Sheriff's 
Department authorities said Monday they are temporarily segregating hundreds of 
maximum-security inmates "until things calm down."  
</P>
<P>
 The unusual tactic was triggered by a Sunday melee in which 600 inmates fought 
with knives and other weapons, injuring 80. It was another in a prolonged 
series of fights at the sprawling facility in northern Los Angeles County, 
which experienced more than 55 racial brawls last year, in which 200 to 300 
inmates were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor scuffles continued at the Pitchess facility Monday, and another racial 
fight broke out between prisoners in a holding cell at the Santa Monica 
courthouse. Fighting at the Santa Monica facility was quelled within seconds, 
but sheriff's officials at other jails were placed on alert to make sure any 
other outbreak could be put down quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The brawls underscored mounting racial tension that has resulted in conflicts, 
not only in local jails but also on the streets, between black and Latino 
street gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Southern California's black and Latino gangs operated in separate 
worlds, coexisting in their neighborhoods with little conflict while warring 
primarily with gangs of their own ethnicity. Recently, however, gang experts 
have seen black and Latino gangs begin to clash over turf boundaries and drugs 
-- a power struggle that experts say is linked to the racial conflicts inside 
jails and prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The commander of the Pitchess facility, Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Spierer, said 
Monday afternoon that the racial climate may have been exacerbated by gang 
warfare in Venice -- where 40 people have been shot in interracial gang 
conflict, 11 of them fatally, since September -- and other problems on the 
street and in the state prison and county jail systems.  
</P>
<P>
 Spierer said authorities were continuing their investigation into the cause of 
the brawl and remained perplexed about how to prevent problems between blacks 
and Latinos from escalating. 
</P>
<P>
 Segregation of prisoners is against Sheriff's Department policy and it will 
remain in effect "just until things calm down," Spierer said. "I would doubt it 
will last for more than 24 hours; then we have to re-integrate them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said authorities are bracing for the worst once the 500 to 700 inmates who 
are segregated in 14 maximum-security dormitories are desegregated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, we are worried that the hostility will carry over when they are 
re-integrated," Spierer said. "But we believe there is a greater danger in 
keeping them segregated." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a four-week pilot program is scheduled to begin at Pitchess 
in the next few months in an effort to teach inmates to defuse racial tension. 
Besides the constitutional problems of permanently segregating inmates along 
racial lines, Spierer said allowing groups to remain separate would only cause 
deeply rooted societal and racial problems to fester. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Sobel, senior staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Los Angeles, said any permanent segregation probably would not only be 
unconstitutional, but virtually impossible to uphold without leading to all 
sorts of other discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department sent extra guards and other personnel to the Pitchess 
jail facility, and top management officials spent Monday determining what other 
steps to take as part of a pre-arranged inspection.  
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, the fights in the ranch's five jail buildings start with a simple 
confrontation between two men over the use of a pay phone or a minor theft or 
because one inmate feels that another hasn't shown him the proper respect, 
authorities said. Such fights can start anywhere, including areas where inmates 
cannot easily be segregated, such as in buses and holding cells, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not actually start out racially, but it breaks out along those lines," 
Spierer said. Sheriff's Department officials said it may have been just such a 
minor incident that touched off the Sunday melee. Deputies said the fighting 
broke out almost simultaneously at 20 separate maximum security dormitories at 
3:55 p.m. In the next half hour, more than 600 Latino and black inmates battled 
with homemade knives, broomsticks and "anything they could get their hands on," 
one deputy said. Dozens of guards fired rubber bullets to break them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 80 injured inmates, 24 were sent to hospitals for X-rays or for 
treatment for stab wounds, severe cuts and head injuries. Some of those 
hospitalized were brought back to segregated dorms Monday, Spierer said, but 
others remained in the jail hospital downtown and in the Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita with serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, between 500 and 700 inmates at two of the five buildings on the north 
campus remained segregated late Monday. The two buildings house about 1,400 
inmates, with Latinos outnumbering blacks two to one, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, tensions between the two racial groups appear to have 
escalated, Sheriff's authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday brawl came on the heels of three fights in the previous week at the 
Pitchess jail. Last Friday, several inmates of the jail's north facility 
suffered minor injuries when 15 Latino and black prisoners fought, authorities 
said. The day before, 15 inmates had been hurt when 40 men battled each other 
in a medical dorm at the north facility. And on Wednesday, five inmates were 
hurt when 80 prisoners fought in the jail's east facility.

BEING POLITICALLY CORRECT; RIORDAN PULLS SOME PUNCH LINES AFTER QUIPS BACKFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Sharing the stage with Billy Crystal and other comedians Monday to announce 
the upcoming Comic Relief television special, Mayor Richard Riordan was all set 
to tell a joke of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a mayor who loves to get off a funny line and enjoys a good laugh. But 
he stuck to his straight lines after a friend, David Steinberg, who manages 
Crystal and Robin Williams, advised him to keep his humor to himself lest he be 
upstaged by the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's political advisers have been offering similar counsel, warning him 
to hold his tongue or risk offending his constituents. Drawing from an 
extensive repertoire of jokes, Riordan's past punch lines have jabbed at 
lawyers, dogs, rabbis and the Irish. Last week one of his jokes did offend and 
prompted an apology from Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 As chief executive of the nation's second-largest city, he is learning -- some 
say too slowly -- that he must edit his routine a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's aware that he doesn't have the same freedom of speech he had in 
private life," said attorney Stan Sanders, a Riordan supporter. "His jokes are 
displays of his wry sense of humor. I haven't been in his company when he told 
an offensive joke. Generally, the jokes I've heard have been at his own 
expense." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, while touring South-Central Los Angeles with Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas in a van, Riordan told a variation on a Richard Pryor joke that 
referred to a black man's penis size. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, Deputy Mayor Bill Violante apologized to Carolyn Webb de 
Macias, Ridley-Thomas' chief of staff and the only woman in the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us like a good laugh as much as anyone else, but it has to be in good 
taste," said Ridley-Thomas, who cracks frequent jokes on the floor of the 
council. "This one was politically unacceptable for someone in his position. 
It's not a matter of anyone being on a moral crusade. It's a matter of 
propriety." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's new director of communications, David Novak, said Riordan uses humor 
to make people feel comfortable, build a rapport, and poke fun at himself. But 
the mayor's office Monday apologized for the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor restated an old, crude Richard Pryor joke," said Annette Castro, 
Riordan's press secretary. "In retrospect, it was inappropriate and may have 
offended. He apologizes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time that Riordan's humor has raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Councilwoman Rita Walters, he made a risque comment about a dog 
that he spotted licking itself. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was a Recreation and Parks commissioner, Riordan joked during a 
public meeting that the only difference between an Irish wake and an Irish 
wedding is one less drunk. When someone later criticized the remark, Riordan 
said that people ought to lighten up and laugh at themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In that vein, he has been known to make lawyer jokes. Last summer when the 
head of the California Bar Assn. condemned lawyer jokes because they encouraged 
violence against attorneys, this attorney-turned-politician offered up one of 
his own. That one, though, he declared off the record. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's news conference outside the Shrine Auditorium to tout this 
weekend's sixth-annual Comic Relief telethon for the homeless, Riordan 
explained his philosophy on jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Laughter is not inconsistent with dealing with serious problems," he said. 
"The truly serious person has a good sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has said that he learned during the bruising mayoral campaign that 
every word he utters can be amplified and misconstrued, and he has tried to 
temper his remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 At a dinner to commemorate the opening of the renovated Convention Center last 
year, comedian Bob Newhart included in his routine some comments about the 
city's ethnic diversity. Riordan, who followed Newhart at the podium, told the 
audience that he had some jokes on the same theme but had learned that as mayor 
there are things he ought not say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Rodriguez, a comedian from Los Angeles' Eastside who also attended the 
Comic Relief event, said Riordan has to be cautious with his material. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the mayor doesn't know is that there is an unwritten rule in comedy that 
if you're white you cannot tell ethnic jokes," Rodriguez said. "When I'm 77 and 
the mayor of Los Angeles is a guy named Juan Lopez, he won't be able to tell a 
joke about a white guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having an official title also frees up a comedian. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bobcat Goldthwait took the microphone, shabbily dressed as usual, he drew 
laughs when he told Riordan: "Mayor, I'd like to say this: I do live in Los 
Angeles and if you ever see me being beaten by the police, put down your video 
camera and help me."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDALE; POLICE SEIZE 
$2.6 MILLION IN COCAINE, ARREST 4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale police Monday announced the seizure of 73 pounds of cocaine with an 
estimated street value of $2.6 million -- some of it wrapped as Christmas 
presents -- and the arrest of four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to be arraigned today in Glendale Municipal Court on suspicion of 
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute are Anderson Castaneda, 35, of 
Glendale; Gabriel Garcia, 28, of Bell Gardens, and Juan Alcaraz, 22, and George 
Trevino, 26, both of Huntington Park, police spokesman Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges stemmed from a search of Castaneda's apartment Friday during which 
police found 51 pounds of cocaine and $200,000 in cash. Several bags of cocaine 
had the word "Clinton" written on them, Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda had been under police surveillance for "behavior consistent with 
someone doing narcotic deals," Nicolaisen said. "Ironically, he lives pretty 
close to the police station. You can throw a rock from his apartment to the 
station." 
</P>
<P>
 After Castaneda's arrest, police went to a home in Bell Gardens, where another 
22 pounds of cocaine were found and three men were arrested, Nicolaisen said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; CITY SUES 
COASTAL AGENCY TO ENFORCE BEACH CURFEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Long Beach filed suit Monday against the California Coastal 
Commission, alleging that the agency does not have the authority to keep the 
city from imposing an early curfew on its beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing crime, the Long Beach City Council voted in June to expand its beach 
curfew by two hours, to run from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. But the commission told Long 
Beach officials last month that the new hours -- and the city's original 
midnight curfew -- violated state law guaranteeing public access to state 
beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Coastal Commission Executive Director Peter Douglas said the city's 
original curfew -- from midnight to 5 a.m. -- could stand because it had been 
in place long before the Coastal Act took effect in the 1970s. Long Beach 
officials, who still want the expanded curfew, sued in Long Beach Superior 
Court contending that state law gives them authority to regulate beach use to 
deter crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission spokesman Jack Liebster said he had not seen the lawsuit 
and could not comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH-CENTRAL; 
STATEWIDE CONTEST SET TO DESIGN AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A statewide architectural competition will be conducted by First Interstate 
Bank of California to initiate construction of an affordable housing complex in 
South-Central Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The bank has secured a 75,000-square-foot parcel at 80th Street and Vermont 
Avenue for the project, which will provide up to 130 affordable apartment units 
for low- to moderate-income residents and potentially some commercial or 
community use space. 
</P>
<P>
 The site includes a former Pepperdine University building, to be incorporated 
into development proposals, and an adjacent lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition is open to design architects throughout California who team 
with construction contractors and for-profit or nonprofit affordable-housing 
development organizations.  
</P>
<P>
 The judges will select the design in August, and the winning team will receive 
construction financing of $10 million to $14 million from First Interstate 
Bank. The affordable housing developer from the winning team will assume 
ownership of the property and responsibility for its development.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 3 SCHOOLS 
GET FUNDS FOR 'TRANSPORTATION ACADEMIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special "transportation academies" to prepare students to pursue careers as 
architects, engineers or urban planners will open soon at three Los Angeles 
high schools under a federal and local grant of nearly $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The academies will be at Locke, North Hollywood and Wilson high schools.Each 
will function as a school within a school and will enroll between 150 and 200 
students. The grant was provided by the Los Angeles County Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority and the Federal Transit Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to provide academic and vocational training, transportation 
internships and industry mentors to students. Most of the money will be used to 
buy computer upgrades so that students can study the latest technologies 
related to transportation issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Board of Education unanimously approved the grant Monday, 
praising the program for enabling schools to enter into a partnership with 
government agencies. Also, school officials said the program will allow 
students to have real-life applications of their math, geometry and other 
studies.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LANCASTER; SUSPECTED 
ABUSE VICTIMS CAN BE EXAMINED REMOTELY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-tech program unveiled Monday will allow suspected victims of child 
abuse in the Antelope Valley to be examined by medical experts working in Los 
Angeles, saving the children a time-consuming, often unsettling 150-mile round 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Lancaster hospital room decorated with Disney characters, children will 
be examined with a magnification device that can send video images over a 
telephone line to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center.Specialists there will 
help determine whether abuse has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who installed the equipment at High Desert Hospital, said 
the program is the first of its kind in the nation. They also plan to expand it 
to Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar and other locations in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical link between High Desert and County-USC is a key component of the 
new Antelope Valley Abuse Network Team, which also includes representatives of 
the district attorney's office, Sheriff's Department, Children's Services and 
the Children's Center of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, children at High Desert will be examined by nurses with 
specialized training who will look for signs of abuse, then transmit video 
images to physicians at County-USC who can direct the nurse through a headset 
during an examination.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OLYMPIC 
SURPLUS GRANTS GO TO 22 YOUTH GROUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The foundation charged with handing out the Southern California youth share of 
the 1984 Olympic surplus has awarded another $1,049,956 in grants to 22 youth 
sports organizations, bringing to more than $60 million its Southland 
investments since the Los Angeles Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest new grant, $550,000, went to Kids in Sports Inc. for running 10 
sports clubs in south and east Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other grants included $125,000 to the Southern California Tennis Assn.'s 
National Junior Tennis League; $88,629 to velodromes in Encino, San Diego and 
Carson; $72,000 to the Mt. San Antonio College Youth Days Program in Walnut; 
$45,874 to the Hollywood-Wilshire YMCA, $43,056 to the Boys and Girls Club of 
Cathedral City and $40,000 to the Boys and Girls Club of the Coachella Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Olympic surplus amounted to $222.7 million, but the 40% Southern 
California youth share has been drawing interest and has grown above the 1984 
totals.

MAIN TENANT PULLS OUT OF PLANNED WARNER RIDGE COMPLEX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The expected main tenant of the planned Warner Ridge office complex announced 
plans Monday to move elsewhere, clouding the future of one of the most 
controversial developments in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 The pullout by 20th Century Industries raises questions about whether the 
developers will be able to carry out plans for three mid-rise office buildings 
and 125 condominiums on Warner Ridge, which homeowners and city officials have 
fought for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle helped destroy the career of Councilwoman Joy Picus, who was 
defeated for reelection to her West San Fernando Valley seat after she was 
blamed for pushing the council into a losing battle over the project that cost 
the city at least $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of court rulings against the city -- agreeing with the 
developers that it was twisting the law to block the project and appease 
anti-development homeowners -- the City Council gave in, agreeing to an 
expensive settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Robert McMurry, a spokesman for Warner Ridge Partners, developer of 
the planned complex, declined to comment on the 20th Century withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jack Spound, a top figure in the partnership, previously described 
the participation of the insurance company as critical to the project's 
financial viability. 
</P>
<P>
 "In court documents, the developer has told the courts that 20th Century was 
their only client and if (20th Century) pulled out they would have no project," 
said Robert Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowner's Assn., a vocal 
opponent of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Dinon, a 20th Century Industries senior vice president, would not 
comment on its motives for withdrawing from the $150-million complex, on which 
construction was scheduled to begin Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But the insurance company, one of the state's largest, stated in court 
documents that it would back out of the deal if the construction schedule 
lagged. The company's lease on its current facility in Warner Center expires in 
November, 1995, and it must move its 2,400 employees before then.

PACKARD BELL TO MOVE 25% OF CHATSWORTH JOBS TO UTAH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Packard Bell, the Chatsworth-based computer manufacturer whose efforts to 
relocate have become the focus of a drive to retain California jobs, said 
Monday it would move almost a quarter of its jobs to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's service and support units, which include about 420 of the firm's 
1,500 employees, will move to a facility outside Salt Lake City, the company 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these employees are being offered the opportunity to relocate to 
Utah," the company said in a news release. About 50 of the support employees 
will remain temporarily at its Chatsworth facility until the remainder of the 
company relocates, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, the fourth-largest home computer manufacturer in the United 
States, is negotiating for a new location with several communities in the 
Western United States. The leading California contender, said company 
executives, is Palmdale in the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level state, county and city officials have gotten involved in the 
campaign to keep the company -- which executives say has outgrown its San 
Fernando Valley facility and needs to move to expand -- in economically 
troubled California. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on moving the remainder of Packard Bell will not come "for a few 
weeks, at least," said Liz O'Donnell, a company spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale has attempted to lure the firm with an offer of 50 acres of developed 
land, worth an estimated $7.5 million, and the proceeds from a $10-million bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has urged the Legislature to pass a bill designating Palmdale 
an enterprise zone, which would give Packard Bell a $19,000 tax credit over 
five years for every employee hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials have offered the company $12,500 in annual 
property-tax breaks, the maximum allowed under state law, if Palmdale wins out. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been plenty of competition from cities outside the state, 
notably from Portland, Ore., and Salt Lake City.

SKINHEAD LEADER SEEKS LOW-SECURITY PRISON; COURTS: CHRISTOPHER FISHER'S LAWYERS 
URGE NONVIOLENT SETTING. THEY SAY HE'S VULNERABLE AND NEEDS ROLE MODELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for Christopher D. Fisher, leader of a group of violent skinheads, 
have asked a Los Angeles judge to recommend that Fisher be sent to the 
low-security federal prison at Boron in Kern County because of his "particular 
vulnerability." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers, Anna Ho and Michael S. Meza, contend that Fisher would receive 
therapy and counseling and be in contact with positive role models because 
there are no violent individuals in low-security prisons, according to papers 
filed in connection with Fisher's sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, U.S. District Judge W. Matthew Byrne Jr. continued a sentencing 
hearing until Thursday after federal probation officials asked for additional 
time to respond to papers filed Friday by the defense lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what significance the voluminous court filing may have because 
federal prosecutors and the defense lawyers earlier agreed that a 10-year 
prison term would be appropriate. But the thrust of the papers indicates that 
the defense lawyers are hoping for a shorter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, Fisher, 20, admitted that he plotted to launch a race war with 
attacks on a Southern California church and a synagogue. In return for guilty 
pleas to two counts of an indictment against him, the government agreed to drop 
several charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher acknowledged that he and other white supremacists bombed two homes and 
a car, vandalized a Westminister synagogue and plotted to attack the First 
African Methodist Episcopal Church in the Mid-City area as well as other 
targets, including prominent members of the Orange County Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher was evaluated by a psychiatrist and psychologist, whose bills were paid 
by the defense. Dr. Louis Jolyon West, professor of psychiatry at UCLA, 
considered an expert on cults and political fringe groups, said Fisher "is very 
different in background, education and personality from the average skinhead." 
</P>
<P>
 "The racist character of Fisher's beliefs arose in part from resentment of his 
parents' devotion to helping the underprivileged and various minority groups 
while (in his view) relatively neglecting him," West wrote in his Dec. 26 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher also was "influenced by experiences of intimidation by nonwhite gang 
members, and by a perception that through reverse discrimination he was left 
relatively weak, vulnerable and abandoned by the power structure," West wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see him as a good candidate for rehabilitation if his forthcoming 
experience in prison is not protracted and is carried out in a situation 
appropriate to a truly corrective goal," such as a low-security prison, West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a general prison population, where racial gangs often prevail, he would 
promptly be taken over and thus protected by the white supremacists . . . the 
alternative might be his death by assassination," West wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multiple personality tests indicate a severely depressed, non-psychotic young 
man, overwrought with guilt, remorse, regret and low self-esteem," according to 
a report by Morris J. Paulson, professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA, who 
administered a psychological evaluation of Fisher in mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson said Fisher was troubled for years by "almost unbearable, 
anxiety-provoking stress" because of being unable to meet the expectations of 
his parents, who told him that he had a IQ of 150 when, in fact, his IQ is 127.

AMID PRESSURE, LAPD TO USE COMPUTER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After paying $250,000 last fall to settle a lawsuit and purchase a computer 
system written by a Los Angeles police sergeant, the LAPD has yet to put the 
system to use, and the department's conduct prompted a city councilwoman to 
intervene Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick emerged from a flurry of meetings with a promise that 
the system, designed by Sgt. Craig Crosby, may at last be used by the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely criminal to ignore good ideas," said Chick, who spoke to 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams about Crosby's work Monday. "We already own 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick had prepared a City Council motion directing the department to make use 
of Crosby's system, and she had intended to introduce that motion today. But 
LAPD officials urged her not to go ahead with those plans and instead promised 
her that they would move forward with the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not being ignored," said Deputy Chief Ron Banks. "It's going to be 
plugged in as we go." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the city settled a lawsuit brought by Crosby, and in the process 
won the rights to use his computer program -- a system that so simplifies 
record-keeping and planning that analysts have said it could save the 
department millions of dollars a year. Crosby had sued the city because the 
LAPD, he said, reneged on a contract and transferred him as punishment for 
challenging the department brass. 
</P>
<P>
 As that case was about to go to trial, lawyers for the city offered Crosby 
$250,000 to settle the case and acquire the computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have full access," Crosby said last week. "But they have chosen not to 
use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chick, Crosby's attorney, Martin S. Bakst, and others blamed the LAPD's 
intransigence on its unwillingness to acknowledge that the sergeant produced 
such a valuable tool on his own time. After making little headway, Chick began 
drafting a motion last week to urge the department to move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that wounded egos are getting in the way," she said. "If the only 
thing stopping them is bruised egos, I don't want to hear about it." 
</P>
<P>
 But after Chick informed Williams of her plans for the motion, department 
leaders scrambled to prove that they were not stalling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not in a position of putting that on a shelf and saying: 'We're going 
to pout and not use it,' " Banks said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that it may take some time to evaluate the possible applications of 
Crosby's work but that the department is committed to making use of it. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, that might finally mark the end to an unusual dispute that has taken 
years to resolve. Crosby developed the system in the late 1980s, and it debuted 
to a warm reception within the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, reports on productivity trends and goal attainment can be 
evaluated by management in time," Capt. John Wilbanks wrote after a 90-day test 
run of Crosby's system. "This puts Pacific Division in a position to be 
proactive, rather than reactive, to its goals." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at the end of the LAPD's test run, Crosby said the department continued 
using the system without permission, violating its agreement with him. That is 
when Crosby elected to let the system go blank, in essence pulling the plug on 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 That move infuriated department commanders and set the stage for the dispute. 
One commander, Jimmy Jones, praised Crosby's work as "superior" and said it 
"would save untold additional officer hours." But he urged the department to 
reject Crosby's system based on "the past practices and the poor reputation" 
that Crosby displayed when he let the system lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 When the department followed that advice, Crosby filed a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosby's defenders have argued that the department was punishing him for 
standing up for his rights. Chick said she was distressed to learn recently 
that the city's expenditure to settle the lawsuit still had not prompted 
officials to use the system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Chick has solicited suggestions in yet another project: upgrading 
the LAPD's increasingly obsolete technology. One suggestion she received comes 
from Crosby, who has prepared a detailed proposal for propelling the LAPD's 
computer capacity into the future -- a blueprint that he says could be 
implemented at one police station for about $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said the flurry of activity Monday encouraged her to believe that 
perhaps the LAPD will embrace Crosby's contribution. "We need to move ahead," 
she said.

WILDFIRE SUSPECT ADMITS WRITING THREATENING LETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man who remains a suspect in several of the recent arson wildfires 
pleaded guilty Monday to charges that, under the alias Fedbuster, he wrote 
letters threatening to set fires in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee Larsen, 43, pleaded guilty to six counts of sending the threatening 
letters to fire stations, mostly in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy with the settlement," said Deputy U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner. 
"It was the best the government could do." 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court, a defendant who pleads guilty can be sentenced for no more 
than six counts. Larsen originally had been charged with 77 counts of making 
threats in letters and had faced a maximum sentence of 385 years in prison and 
a $192.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the counts carries a maximum five-year prison sentence and a $250,000 
fine so Larsen technically could serve 30 years in prison and be assessed a 
$1.5-million fine under the terms of a plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But his attorney, Paul Abrams, and Jessner agreed that the sentence will be 
much less. During a bail request after the guilty plea, Abrams said that under 
sentencing guidelines, his client faces a maximum of four years in jail. 
Jessner estimated that Larsen faces a maximum of 5 years and 3 months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing has been scheduled for April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing Judge Harry L. Hupp, Larsen admitted to sending all the Fedbuster 
letters. "All the letters were the same, exact Xerox copies," he said. "And I 
sent them all on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
 But although he is the subject of a continuing arson investigation by the 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Larsen has denied setting any of the 
recent fires. He has not been charged in any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 77 counts, 33 were related to letters penned under the Fedbuster alias, 
33 were connected to letters written under the name Nitecrawler and seven were 
the result of letters threatening to kill a prominent Los Angeles criminal 
defense lawyer and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fedbuster letters were sent to 37 Southern California residents and fire 
stations last August. In those letters, Larsen said he was upset about property 
that had been seized from him, and he demanded an apology from the prosecutors, 
judges and agents who were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get no satisfaction by the time we get a good volatile fire season, 
you'll really regret it you'll see," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nitecrawler letters, sent to Manhattan Beach residents and preschools, 
the author threatened to poison baby food and meat. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit filed in connection with the Larsen case, FBI Special Agent 
Richard G. Palacios said he believed both the Fedbuster and Nitecrawler letters 
were written by the same person. Larsen never admitted writing the Nitecrawler 
letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen also is charged with sending a letter threatening to kill lawyer J. 
Patrick Maginnis and members of his family. Maginnis represented Larsen in two 
previous cases, most recently in a case where Larsen was charged with spraying 
acid on cars and a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen has a long criminal history, including a conviction for child 
molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen was arrested twice on arson charges -- once as a 9-year-old for trying 
to burn down a church, and once in 1976 for attempting to burn down the Sands 
Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on Nov. 8 for writing the Fedbuster letters.

GANG VIOLENCE WOUNDS WOMAN, SON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and her 5-year-old son, caught in gunfire believed to have been meant 
for someone else, were wounded Monday night west of Downtown Los Angeles in 
what police said was a gang-related shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The child was in critical condition and undergoing surgery at Childrens 
Hospital of Los Angeles after the shooting about 7 p.m. at Pico Boulevard near 
Berendo Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified as Vicenta Chavez, was treated at Good Samaritan 
Hospital for a gunshot wound to the leg and released to visit the boy in 
Childrens Hospital. The boy's name was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department's Rampart Division would say only that a 
black Mercedes apparently was shot at. A witness said the victims were standing 
on a street corner when someone fired at a passing car and they were hit by 
random shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a gang thing and these people just happened to be in the 
way but, we still are working on the details and we don't have anyone in 
custody," said police Sgt. Michael Blackburn.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; LOMBARDO BAND BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF NOTE

<P>
 Some shows are memorable on their own merits.* 
</P>
<P>
 Others are memorable for the memories they stir. The latter was the case 
Sunday afternoon when the late Guy Lombardo's band, the Royal Canadians, 
directed by keyboardist-singer Al Pierson, played a nostalgia-filled concert 
that included appearances from singer Gary Crosby and the Pied Pipers vocal 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's effect, though not stunningly musical, was that of a giant time 
warp that leaked the sounds and emotions of 40, 50 and 60 years ago and spilled 
them into the present. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say there weren't fine, though predictable, musical moments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pipers -- Bobbi Boyle, Dick Castle, Jay Meyer and Joe Eich -- combined on 
the kind of honeyed, four-part harmonies that have inspired such groups as the 
Manhattan Transfer. It's a safe bet that there were few in the audience who 
didn't recognize every tune the Pipers crooned -- "The Sunny Side of the 
Street," "I Should Care," "I'll Never Smile Again," the group's theme "Dream" 
-- and each chestnut was treated with grace and respect. Castle's between-song 
patter only increased the nostalgic feel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lombardo's orchestra, which opened the show, operated in the same vein, with 
Pierson adding historical tidbits before and after each tune. Here it was the 
sound that was familiar, with its creamy blend of alto saxophones, tenor, 
baritone trombone and dual trumpets that seemed to float over the simple rhythm 
section fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The genius of Lombardo's arrangements was (and is) not their complexity -- 
everything is laid out simply and with a predictable inevitability -- but in 
the various orchestrations and undemanding counterpoints that come from the 
seven-piece horn section. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Again and again on such tunes as "Sentimental Journey," "Seems Like Old Times" 
(both particularly apt in this setting) and "Boo Hoo," the band mixed and 
matched instrumental combinations. At times, the saxes took the lead, then 
handed off to the trumpets. Other times, muted trumpet and trombones worked 
delicate lines, while the saxes responded in conservative fashion. There were 
moments when two, three or all of the saxophonists would exchange their 
instruments for clarinets, often just to add the briefest embellishment. The 
result was a varied tonal palette, smeared with enough color to impress van 
Gogh. 
</P>
<P>
 The same criticism aired against the band in its heyday -- that it didn't 
swing -- was beside the point here. With the rhythms mainly paced by the 
gentlest of high-hat cymbal tapping, the horns would lift above the beat, 
almost suspended in a simple, melodic way. It was this approach, along with 
those unique orchestrations, that defined the Lombardo band, and Sunday's 
performance was absolutely true to that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this band, with a half-dozen young faces, could swing when called 
upon, as proven by its work behind the Pied Pipers. But even this was 
unambitious by today's standards, with only the occasional hard rhythmic hint 
coming from pianist Fred Norman or the horns as conducted by lead alto player 
Bob Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The least satisfying moments came from Crosby, son of the famous singer, who 
had a fling with vocal stardom himself after recording "Sam's Song" with his 
father in 1950. Wearing a tux, eyeglasses and an earring, Crosby recalled the 
composers who traveled through his childhood home -- Johnny Mercer, Hoagy 
Carmichael -- with a tune or two from each. 
</P>
<P>
 His delivery was hampered by a narrow range and a lack of strength on higher 
pitches. At times, it seemed there was only one tone he could hit well, while 
he disguised the rest with slides, vibrato and other stylistic tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 He was at his best (even though he dropped a line and had to wait for the band 
to catch up) during "The Downtown Polker Club," a rap popularized by Phil 
Harris. Crosby was able to talk his way through, rather than sing, and his 
rhythmic smarts were readily apparent.

ART / CATHY CURTIS; A FUN EAST-WEST SHOW WITH NO SACRED COWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever intrepid, this column ventures far and wide to bring you the best in art, 
so long as it has something to do with Orange County. Today we get as far as 
Long Beach, to a new alternative space that grandly calls itself the South Bay 
Contemporary Museum of Art II (No. 1 is in Torrance). 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County connection is Richard Turner, a Chapman University art 
professor who has curated "If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!" 
(through Saturday). 
</P>
<P>
 This is a show about intersections of Eastern and Western cultures in which 
points are usually made through humorous indirection. Although the symbolism 
borrows from both cultures, the prevailing point of view is unapologetically 
Western. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the artists express a blithe disregard for the original context of the 
imagery -- an entirely appropriate attitude for an age when bits and pieces of 
the world's diverse cultural influences are whipped together in the media 
blender. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a set of wryly self-conscious cultural appropriations -- some 
more accomplished than others, to be sure -- that are oceans more fun than the 
righteous platitudes of multiculturalism. (Turner says the show's title -- an 
admonition to disregard even the highest outside authority in favor of a 
personal feeling of rightness -- is a Zen koan .) 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Whipple is the unacknowledged star of this show. Her "Homage to Tung 
Ch'i Ch'ang" -- the austere 17th-Century Chinese landscape master -- is a tiny, 
yellowed hand scroll in which rock formations, distant mountains, a river and a 
scholar's hut are all made out of artfully placed wisps of dried grasses and 
rice kernels. 
</P>
<P>
 Imitation was the highest form of flattery in ancient Chinese art, yet Tung 
himself wrote that "those who study the old masters and do not introduce some 
changes are as if closed in by a fence." Whipple's painstaking replication of a 
landscape made out of the staff of life doubles back on Tung's daringly 
conceptual view of nature as grist for the dry brilliance of his brush strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whipple's other piece is an untitled assemblage. A reproduction of a Winslow 
Homer painting (a fisherman in a rowboat with his catch) is juxtaposed with a 
pair of chopsticks and two chopstick rests shaped like leaping fish. The 
parallels between image and objects are intriguing: The angled chopsticks 
become surrogates for the boat's oars, while the vivaciously poised 
mass-produced ceramic fish are improbably lifelike surrogates for the gleaming 
dead fish in the painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious devotion plays a central role in several works on view, but in 
unorthodox ways. Some images suggest the wisdom of combining outlooks of 
Eastern and Western religions; others re-imagine Eastern deities or rites in 
Western guises. 
</P>
<P>
 With a bow to New-Age globalism, Sherie Scheer floats a scene of the Last 
Supper -- with Buddha as a surprise guest -- above a photograph of a scrubby 
Western hillside ("Coral Canyon Last Supper"). Tony Cockrell shows the Buddha 
thoughtfully contemplating the bony torso of Jesus on the cross in a 
perspectively altered triptych that plays with "god-sized" scale and the 
all-seeing viewer's multiple vantage points ("Buddha Meets Jesus Giving . . . 
"). 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Ausgang altered an elaborate thrift-store painting of worshiping Hindu 
fisherman in order to have some fun with the phrase cargo cult (the belief 
among some South Sea Islanders that that their ancestors' spirits will bring 
them modern consumer goods to free them from white dominance). 
</P>
<P>
 Each worshiper now bears a blue "car-go" engine block logo on his back, a 
purple go-cart is parked outside a nearby hut, and an engine part lies 
reverently at the feet of a Buddha surrounded by flames that now suggest cool 
"car culture" hood ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 William Anthony's eager little stick figures dance, make music, throw posies 
and offer food to a herd of smiling, chatting cows in "Veneration of the Cows," 
a beguilingly childlike drawing of Hindu devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrasting Buddha with the proverbially naughty little boy god, Krishna, 
Pamela Wilson envisions the serene god holding the crayon with which he has 
drawn a fey image of a mustachioed Krishna in sunglasses ("Buddha Never Had Any 
Fun"). 
</P>
<P>
 Pierre Picot's untitled paintings of the Buddha, shown with various numbers of 
teacups, may be a spoof of the intricate numerology of Buddhism. Turner's own 
assemblage, "Dish Wallah," humorously suggests that the elephant god, Ganesha 
-- whose resplendently enthroned image appears on a large Indian hanging -- may 
be connected with the heavenly blessing of a satellite dish, humbly cobbled 
together with wood and a furled luffa cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis deSoto turns the concept of the sacredness of living things into a 
literal image by painting a gold lily pad on a photograph of the sky and a gold 
arch on a photo of a honeycomb. In an untitled mixed-media piece, Gail Tomura 
uses (Indian?) decorated paper, sequin "rubies" and Chinese brass brackets to 
section off a little corner of heaven in a gold-washed sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Qathryn Brehm's enigmatic paintings with flat patches of color apparently were 
taken from Chinese cartoon panels. Severed from their contexts, the 
expressionless, often uniformed figures and their curiously agitated or empty 
environments might as well have dropped from the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadpan effect of these images is happily remote from the didacticism of 
"Monasteries / Money Stories," in which Arnie Charnick contrasts a serene 
Eastern vision of worshipful unity with a cacophonous scene of Western greed. 
The beauty of the better works in the show is their refusal to tout any one 
world view, preferring the unexpected thrills of cultural corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 * "If You Meet the Buddha on the Road, Kill Him!" through Saturday at the 
South Bay Contemporary Museum of Arts, 1969 Obispo Ave., Long Beach. Hours: 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Free. (310) 985-0242. * 
</P>
<P>
 OVERDONE: When exhibitions are organized around narrowly conceived 
programmatic themes, the results tend to resemble "Baking Cookies," an 
embarrassingly mediocre feminist art show at the Orange County Center for 
Contemporary Art in Santa Ana (through Feb. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Dated and dull, this work hardly serves as much of an advertisement for the 
7-month-old Orange County chapter of the Southern California Women's Caucus for 
Art, of which all 26 artists are members. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problems with the works are their unoriginal use of tired old 
imagery and formats (masks, underwear, fragmentary torsos, dancing figures, 
shrines) and their lack of specificity (like most other things, "oppression" is 
boring as a generality.)  
</P>
<P>
 Just about the only work in the show of any freshness is Joyce Presseau's 
woodcut, "Spinsters Abroad (Lady Victorian Explorers)," a compendium of 
genteelly venturesome tourist gambits, executed in a beguilingly cluttered, 
quasi-Victorian style. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition is dedicated to the memory of painter Elaine Kennedy, who died 
Jan. 2 at 54. Unfortunately, her two small monotypes pale beside the 
free-flowing landscape paintings -- vibrantly "feminist" in a broader sense -- 
for which she is best remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baking Cookies," through Feb. 4 at the Orange County Center for 
Contemporary Art, 3621 W. MacArthur Blvd., Space 111, Santa Ana. Hours: 11 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Free. (714) 549-4989.

JAZZ REVIEW; SAX MAN'S HOME IS WHERE THE HOT IS; POPULAR O.C.-BASED MUSICIAN 
ERIC MARIENTHAL RETURNS TO THE STUDIO CAFE ON WEDNESDAYS, LEADING A FIRST-RATE 
ENSEMBLE. TOGETHER, THEY REACH GREAT HEIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hey, Eric Marienthal! You've just spent six months touring Europe, South 
America and the United States, with Chick Corea, David Benoit and under your 
own name. Now whaddaya goin' to do? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, in Marienthal's case, ain't Disneyland. When the popular Orange 
County-based saxophonist comes home from a stint on the road, he returns to the 
Studio Cafe, where he's been appearing on and off for some 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he's best known for his work with the Elektric version of keyboardist 
Corea's band and his own string of fusion-oriented recordings for the GRP 
label, Marienthal takes a dip into the mainstream when he plays Wednesdays at 
the Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 His first set there last week featured a savvy rhythm section working with him 
on an ambitious string of standards: Joe Henderson's, "Isotope," "My One and 
Only Love" and "Softly as in a Morning Sunrise." Even the most tired warhorse, 
in this case, Duke Ellington's "In a Sentimental Mood," was given a fresh 
treatment with a rollicking, Latin-flavored beat supplied by drummer Paul 
Kreibich. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of his contemporary work will recognize the Marienthal style in this 
setting. Switching between tenor and alto, the saxophonist applied an insistent 
attack with little room for breath-catching. Despite the insatiable nature of 
his playing, there was plenty of rhythmic variation, with long, fleet lines 
punctuated by strategic, sustained tones and the occasional repeated lines for 
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to rely on cheap thrills, Marienthal developed drama with strong 
melodic connections and the sheer persistence of his playing. His high-end 
bursts, or repeated, low-end honks were the logical extension of his statement, 
not the statement itself. And when it comes to playing prettily, the 
saxophonist has few peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another attraction of these ongoing appearances is the company Marienthal 
keeps. Pianist Dave Witham, the musical director for guitarist George Benson 
who also has done production for saxophonist Tom Scott, is Marienthal's equal 
in ambition, bringing long, flowing lines to his improvisations and sharp, 
cleanly cut accompaniment that is neither too spare nor too busy. Bassist Paul 
Gormley, an active member of the Los Angeles club scene, provides firm footings 
and lyrical solos of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band's standout is Kreibich, the in-demand session man who was 
practically the house drummer during last season's Jazz at the Hyatt series in 
Newport Beach. Kreibich is active both on and off the beat, establishing 
rhythms with confidence while providing accent and shading that's almost 
harmonic in its sound. Together, the foursome makes for one of the most 
satisfying musical presentations available on an ongoing basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The other attraction of this engagement is its size. While the rest of the 
world sees Marienthal in oversized clubs, outdoor settings and concert halls, 
Orange County fans can move right up into the bell of his horn in a row of 
chairs set against a counter that divides the bandstand from the rest of the 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's small crowd was attentive and appreciative, something that spurred 
the combo to even greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This intimacy leads to magical moments. Between sets, the band sat around 
talking about their careers and the long stint at the Studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Kreibich remembered how he appeared at the Studio's first show back in the 
mid-'70s with saxophonist Vince Waller. Gormley, after moving from Las Vegas, 
played his first Southland gig here with pianist Frank Strazzeri. Collectively, 
the band recalled the days when such greats as the late pianist Hampton Hawes 
and one-time Miles Davis saxophonist Gary Bartz worked the room. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with these kinds of precedents, it's apparent, especially after 11 
years, that Marienthal and company are making history here of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eric Marienthal plays every Wednesday this month at 9 p.m. at the Studio 
Cafe, 100 S. Main St., Balboa. No cover. (714) 675-7760.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MATSUSHITA TO LICENSE NEW SOUND TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd., the Japanese parent of entertainment 
giant MCA Inc., has tentatively agreed to license new audio technology from 
Desper Products Inc. in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the deal were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, Matsushita will use Desper's Spatializer audio processor 
for its Panasonic consumer electronics products. The processor is designed to 
create three-dimensional surround sound from any stereo using two ordinary 
loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 The integrated circuits for Spatializer will be manufactured and distributed 
by Matsushita Electronics Corp., the Japanese concern's semiconductor 
subsidiary. The audio products using Spatializer technology are expected to be 
ready for the consumer market in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Desper, a start-up company, reported a loss of $2.1 million on sales of 
$42,086 in its fiscal year that ended Aug. 31. It has also begun marketing a 
3-D processor for the professional recording industry.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: MORTGAGE & REALTY TRUST FAILS TO PAY NOTE INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mortgage & Realty Trust, a financially shaky real estate investment trust with 
dual headquarters in Burbank and Elkin, Pa., didn't pay interest Dec. 31 on 
$290 million of its notes due in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust earlier said it didn't plan to make the payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage & Realty last week said the principal holders of its notes had 
rejected the company's proposal for restructuring the debt. Discussions between 
the trust and the note holders are continuing, Mortgage & Realty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the trust said it would continue operating while attempting to 
work out a restructuring agreement. However, if that is impossible, Mortgage & 
Realty said the trust may seek relief under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Filing Chapter 11 protects a company from its creditors while it seeks to 
reorganize its finances.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: PERCEPTRONICS CREDITORS TO RETIRE DEBT AND SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perceptronics Inc., a struggling Woodland Hills maker of computer-simulation 
and software systems, said three creditors will retire $4 million of its debt 
and preferred shares in a plan that will return the company to a positive net 
worth by next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreements, the creditors will receive $414,000 plus 259,000 shares 
of Perceptronics' common stock.Perceptronics is primarily a military 
contractor. Its losses are the result of the steep decline in military 
spending. The losses have narrowed recently. In the three months that ended 
Sept. 30, the company posted a net loss of $94,051, compared with a 
$2.91-million net loss a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The creditor agreements announced last week were part of a debt-restructuring 
that Perceptronics began last year. They allowed the company to retire $1.6 
million of debt and preferred stock before Dec. 31. The remaining $2.4 million 
of debt and preferred shares covered by the agreements will be retired by March 
31, Perceptronics said.

PROMENADE HOPING FOR TURN AROUND IN '94; WOODLAND HILLS: THE MALL'S FOCUS IS ON 
SPECIALTY SOTRES THAT CATER TO HIGH-END SHOPPERS. THREE RESTAURANTS ARE 
PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 There is still a 25% vacancy rate at the Promenade at Woodland Hills, but 
things are only getting better, claims its owner, the O'Connor Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-luck mall caters to affluent shoppers -- but the problem for some 
time has been that there have not been enough of them.  
</P>
<P>
 Bullock's, a division of R.H. Macy & Co., became one of the mall's anchor 
tenants on Nov. 10 when it moved into a building vacated by Robinson's last 
year. By all accounts, Bullock's is doing better than anyone expected at its 
new site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very successful holiday season at the Promenade. Sales were 30% 
higher than our initial plans for the store. The mall's demographics are 
consistent with what Bullock's has catered to in the past," said Malcom Rubin, 
Bullock's vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the store's presence and success at the Promenade is a "challenge" to 
O'Connor officials "to continue opening stores" at the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total sales in 1993 were flat when compared to 1992," given the number of 
stores that closed, said Katherine C. VanDeusen, O'Connor regional director of 
leasing. "But when you compare store-to-store sales, our (Promenade) stores' 
sales were up an average of 18%. We're really optimistic for 1994," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 One strength VanDeusen is counting on is the mall's well-to-do customers. She 
claims the typical Promenade shopper earns about $90,000 per year and has 
plenty of disposable income. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the affluence of its customers, the Promenade has played second fiddle 
to the Topanga Plaza mall, located one block away, and its middle-class 
customers over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Promenade's owners have searched for just the right chemistry of 
chic retailers who appeal to upscale shoppers, its mall, or center, as O'Connor 
officials prefer to call it, has often had a high vacancy rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The high vacancy rate, symbolized by boarded-up store sites illustrated with 
portraits of historical figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Clara Barton, is 
also reflected in the sparse foot traffic. The pictures are accompanied by 
catchy slogans like "Come see our many new shops and restaurants -- they are a 
wave of excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, customers remain scarce inside the mall. "We're not seeing a lot of new 
traffic, but quite a lot of return traffic. It's hard to draw the conclusion 
whether it's because of the store or the mall," said Karen Peck, spokeswoman 
for Eddie Bauer, which has a store at the Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 The large number of vacancies has been attributed to factors such as the 
lingering Southern California recession and the Persian Gulf War, which 
affected many businesses. In 1993, the 21-year-old Promenade underwent a 
$40-million renovation, which kept shoppers away and forced several retailers 
to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Topanga Plaza, which includes a more diverse list of retailers that 
cater to customers across the board, has usually been 100% occupied. Indeed, 
there are some Topanga Plaza patrons who do not think much of the Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing there. They have specialty shops that sell things that have 
no practical value and stores that sell clothes to rich old ladies. The only 
good thing about the Promenade is Ruby's restaurant," said Evelyn Bancroft at 
Topanga Plaza on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Promenade's fortunes are going to turn around in 1994, said 
VanDeusen. With the renovation complete, giving the mall a clean, airy and 
bright appearance, O'Connor is going through with plans to, well, turn the mall 
into the Rodeo Drive of the Valley and its suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, do not expect Sears, J.C. Penney or McDonald's to move into 
one of the 20 store and restaurant sites now vacant at the Promenade, which has 
space for 79 shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some tenants whose leases expire this year will be asked to leave, 
VanDeusen said. "We've mutually agreed not to renew their leases, because we're 
trying to upgrade the center . . . We're looking for the high-bred customer, 
and these stores just don't fit into our plans." 
</P>
<P>
 VanDeusen declined to identify the tenants who will be asked to leave. But she 
did say that the Promenade's "big push" in 1994 will be restaurants. According 
to VanDeusen, O'Connor has reached leasing agreements with three restaurants 
that will open later this year, but refused to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very selective in the type of tenant mix we're putting together . . . 
That's the only way we could compete because we're a small center," VanDeusen 
said. Specifically, she said the Promenade is trying to recruit retailers that 
do not aspire to put a store in every mall. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor's most important new tenant, Bullock's, agrees with the mall's 
strategy to recruit retailers that cater to more affluent shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no disagreement with their plans. This is an upscale mall and 
(O'Connor's) plans for the future are very good. They're quite picky about who 
they allow at the center," Rubin said. "I would like to see all of the (vacant 
sites) filled," he said, adding that Bullock's wants the Promenade's owners to 
stick to their plan to attract retailers that appeal to the well-heeled shopper 
"so we can maintain the integrity of our store." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock's unexpected level of success reflects the successes of other 
retailers at the Promenade. Ann Taylor was relocated and enlarged, and 
Victoria's Secret was enlarged from 1,000 square feet to 6,100 square feet. 
They are two of the most successful stores at the mall.

NEW CEO AT LIVE ENTERTAINMENT SEEKS TO GET FIRM BACK IN FOCUS; MOVIES: ROGER 
BURLAGE IS THE THIRD BOSS AT VAN NUYS VIDEOCASSETTE DISTRIBUTOR SINCE FORMER 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE JOSE MENENDEZ AND HIS WIFE, KITTY, WERE SLAIN IN 1989. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks ago Roger Burlage, was appointed the third CEO at Live Entertainment 
Inc. since chief executive Jose Menendez was slain in 1989 along with his wife, 
Kitty, in their Beverly Hills home. Menendez's two sons are now standing trial 
for the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlage, 51, sitting in an office at Live's Van Nuys headquarters that was 
redecorated by Kitty Menendez about a month before the slayings, said he isn't 
haunted by the company's past turmoil, indeed he joined Live for the 
opportunity to run a bigger company. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Menendez's death, Live's revolving management door has been just one of 
the videocassette distributor's many problems, including an ill-timed expansion 
dating from the Menendez days into retail music and video stores. Live also 
suffered because its former majority owner and biggest supplier of films, 
Carolco Pictures Inc. ("Terminator 2," "Basic Instinct") virtually shut down 
production as it dealt with its own debt troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlage, the former head of Trimark Holdings Inc., a smaller video and film 
distributor, now takes over Live as the company tries to return to health after 
emerging last spring from bankruptcy and turning over controlling interest to a 
group of foreign companies led by Pioneer LDCA of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlage hopes to make Live profitable again -- although he concedes that might 
not happen this year because of the long lead time needed to acquire video 
rights to movies before the cassettes hit the marketplace. Live hasn't turned 
an annual profit since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 His plans also include expanding into acquiring the worldwide theatrical, 
television and video rights to movies, a strategy he employed with success at 
Trimark. "It's building a company on a broader base, and controlling the whole 
asset, rather than a piece of the asset," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Live's future is far from certain. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine months that ended Sept. 30, Live lost $5.55 million on $193 
million in revenue, and its stock remains in the cellar, trading at less than 
$3 a share. Live hasn't completed its refinancing, and a merger with Carolco -- 
an idea that was proposed and then scuttled two years ago -- is still hinted at 
by both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The often-discussed possibility of selling Live's retail operations -- which 
includes the Strawberries and Waxie Maxie chains in the East -- remains open. 
Its video distribution business also faces changes because of technology, 
including soon the home delivery of movies-on-demand over phone lines or by 
satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlage believes the new ways to bring movies into homes will benefit Live. 
The company has for the past year included video-on-demand in its acquisitions 
of video rights. "I couldn't care less what technology delivers the movie to 
the viewer, as long as I own the rights," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During his four years at Trimark, Burlage presided over a threefold growth in 
sales to $60 million, specializing in modest-budget, "B" movies. His move to 
Live was announced on Dec. 30, one day short of a deadline imposed by Live's 
bank lenders, led by Chemical Bank and Credit Lyonnais, to find a new chief 
executive or risk defaulting on its credit agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burlage replaced David Mount, who moved to record distributor WEA Corp. in 
September. Mount, previously president of Live's home video subsidiary, had 
succeeded Wayne Patterson as chief executive in December, 1991. Patterson, 
former chairman of Pace Membership Warehouse, was hired in 1990 after a long 
search following the death of Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Live's troubles started in late 1991, when its proposed merger with Carolco 
collapsed as the financial conditions of both companies deteriorated and their 
stock prices fell. In 1991 Live lost $107 million on $361 million in revenue, 
because of poor videocassette sales, a poor showing by its retail stores, and 
write-offs from its acquisition of a rival distributor, Vestron Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Live's loss narrowed to $14.8 million, but its revenue fell 19%, to 
$291 million. Constrained by debt and a lack of capital, and in danger of 
defaulting on its bonds, Live filed a "prepackaged" bankruptcy petition in Los 
Angeles last February, emerging the following month when the court approved its 
plan to issue new notes and preferred stock to replace its old debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolco, which completed its own restructuring in October, once owned 53% of 
Live. But when all the bankruptcy negotiations were done, Carolco had turned 
over all its Live shares to its major investors, Pioneer, RCS Video 
International Services of Italy and France's Le Studio Canal Plus. That group, 
which also controls Carolco, currently owns 64% of Live's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Live now has $23.5 million in bank credit available, which it is negotiating 
to increase to $75 million. Part of that money could be used to pay off $37 
million in notes Live owes that carry a 12% interest rate and that mature in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Carolco films on videocassette have accounted for about one-third of 
Live's revenues in the past, so it's good news that Carolco can now resume 
production, although those movies won't bring any revenue to Live until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Live spent $48 million acquiring video rights from 
independent production companies in the nine months ended Sept. 30. Among its 
coming releases are Miramax films, including the critically acclaimed "The 
Piano," starring Holly Hunter, and the coming "The House of the Spirits," with 
Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close. 
</P>
<P>
 Live also last year entered a five-year, multipicture deal with Rank Film 
Distributors, MGM and Gladden Entertainment, whose previous films included "The 
Fabulous Baker Boys." Burlage said Live has about 30 video releases for 1994, 
and he hopes to get that number up to 40, which is about average for the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of Live stock and bonds are optimistic that the company is back on 
track. Norman Sapoznik, director of securities at the brokerage William J. 
Gallagher & Co. in Los Angeles, said he has purchased more Live stock recently. 
"I think they're in good shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were capital-constrained," said David Millison, director of research at 
the Beverly Hills brokerage Dabney/Resnick Inc. "The company now has access to 
capital." 
</P>
<P>
 Millison said a big issue remaining is whether Live and Carolco will resurrect 
plans to merge. Pioneer has said it might ask the boards of both companies to 
reopen merger talks. Burlage said he couldn't comment beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 As he struggles to put Live's problems behind, Burlage might have another 
decision to make. If any of the movies being planned about the Menendez 
slayings are released on videocassette, will Live acquire the rights? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, if it's tasteful and can make the company money, Burlage said. But if 
there are too many TV movies about the Menendez case, "there probably won't be 
that much value in other markets." Live Entertainment Inc. at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc. is a Van Nuys-based videocassette distributor and 
retailer. After a failed 1991 merger attempt with its former majority owner, 
movie producer Carolco Pictures Inc., Live's finances deteriorated and it filed 
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last February. Live emerged from 
Bankruptcy the following month with a plan to restructure its complicated and 
debt-heavy balance sheet. Control of Live was transferred from Carolco, which 
also recently completed a restructuring, to foreign investors led by Pioneer 
LDCA of Japan, who together own 63.8% of Live. The company now has a new chief 
executive, Roger Burlage, who hopes to lead Live to a complete recovery.

AILING HOSPITALS; UNCERTAINTY OVER REFORM, GROWTH OF HMOS PUT SQUEEZE ON MANY 
LOCAL FACILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The local clergy could hardly believe it when Valley Presbyterian Hospital 
laid off its full-time chaplain last fall. The elimination of the $40,000 job, 
which had been around since the Van Nuys facility opened 35 years ago, 
indicates just how tough things are for hospitals these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Uncertainty about health care reform under the Clinton Administration and 
efforts by big corporations to slow their soaring medical costs -- mainly by 
driving employees toward health maintenance organizations -- have caused 
turmoil in the hospital industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeezed by meager reimbursements from Medicare and severe pressures from 
HMOs, local hospitals are fighting for their lives. It is largely a losing 
battle in the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valley areas. Of 29 
acute-care hospitals there, 16 are losing money, according to their most recent 
annual reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some hospitals are going to have to close because there's just not a need for 
them all," says Michael Weinstein, a former administrator of the Medical Center 
of North Hollywood and a consultant in Encino. The most imperiled are small 
hospitals, especially those without any deep-pocket owners, such as Panorama 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 After Panorama Community lost $2.7 million in 1991, its former owner shut the 
96-bed hospital in January, 1992. But it reopened in October, 1992 after a 
nonprofit organization bought it for a mere $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "This opportunity came along and at the right price," said David Green, the 
hospital's chief executive officer. Despite outsiders who doubt that the 
hospital can make it financially, Green thinks the hospital will survive by 
providing basic services without spending a lot of money for fancy equipment. 
"We don't want to get caught up in a frenzy of the latest technology," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, hospitals are struggling because there are simply too many of 
them -- bed occupancy is running at just 40% locally, half that of a decade 
ago. Layoffs at General Motors, Lockheed and other major Valley employers have 
trimmed the number of insured patients. But the biggest pinch is coming from 
HMOs, which have negotiated huge discounts for hospital services. That, plus 
popular managed-care insurance programs with a select list of hospitals and 
doctors who screen patients before they visit specialists, have pared the 
number of days spent in hospitals. So Valley hospitals are furiously slashing 
costs, consolidating, merging and racing to secure more managed-care contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has also meant more uninsured people who cannot pay their 
hospital bills. Northridge Hospital Medical Center's provisions for bad debts, 
for instance, nearly doubled in 1992 to $12.2 million. Also, reimbursements 
from Medicare, which account for a third of most hospitals' revenue, continue 
to lag rising costs for medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Drumwright, a turnaround specialist who took over management of two 
Valley hospitals last fall, concedes that West Valley Hospital in Canoga Park 
may not survive. The 139-bed facility has heavy debts and only a 25% occupancy 
rate and is losing customers. Drumwright says there are still ways to help 
build business at the hospital. "But the question is, can we do it fast 
enough?" 
</P>
<P>
 The upheaval has threatened jobs at nonprofit and for-profit hospitals, both 
small and large: 
</P>
<P>
 * St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, the region's largest with 658 beds, 
lost more than $10 million in 1992. Last year the nonprofit hospital cut 195 
jobs, expanded its neonatal center and hired a new chief executive, Michael 
Madden. Madden said the hospital probably lost another $3 million in 1993. "We 
plan to continue the cost-containment efforts," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Triad Healthcare Inc., owner of Sherman Oaks Hospital and West Valley 
Hospital in Canoga Park, last year defaulted on a $167-million state-guaranteed 
bond after the two facilities lost more than $10 million in 1992. But Sherman 
Oaks Hospital operates the region's only burn center, which now accounts for 
25% of its patients, so that hospital is expected to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Glendale Adventist Medical Center, with 454 beds, reported an operating loss 
of $5.6 million in 1992. To break even last year, the hospital cut 49 jobs, 
including electricians and plumbers, and then told its remaining 1,700 
employees to choose between a 5% wage cut or fewer work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Palmdale Hospital Medical Center, an independent business owned by a 
partnership, lost $1.7 million for the 12 months ended April 30. Part of the 
reason is the hospital took in a surge of patients from Medi-Cal, the state 
program for the needy, which pays even less than Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Perry, an economist at the Hospital Council of Southern California, said 
that most of the council's 219 member hospitals lost money in 1992. A decade 
ago, 80% of them were profitable, with some earning 20 cents for every $1 in 
revenue. Now, she said, "we expect 20% to 30% of them to close over the next 
three to five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the turmoil, a few Valley hospitals are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente, the state's biggest HMO, operates a 212-bed hospital in 
Woodland Hills and one with 364 beds in Panorama City. The two hospitals serve 
more than 320,000 HMO members, about one-fifth of the insured patient 
population in the Valley. The occupancy rate is about 50% at Kaiser's Panorama 
City facility and nearly 70% in Woodland Hills. While Kaiser said it does not 
break down financial results by hospital, analysts say both are profitable.  
</P>
<P>
 A very successful for-profit hospital in the Valley is West Hills Regional 
Medical Center, a 236-bed hospital that earned $8 million for its fiscal year 
ended Aug. 31, up 33% from the previous year. The success comes despite having 
had four owners in the last two years. West Hills is now owned by Columbia/HCA, 
a Louisville, Ky.-based chain of 190 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is West Hills doing so well? The hospital's main market includes upscale 
Calabasas, Agoura Hills and Woodland Hills, so fewer of its patients are likely 
to be uninsured. In fact, less than 1% of the hospital's revenue comes from 
Medi-Cal, contrasted with 26% for the average hospital in Los Angeles County. 
It also helps that the hospital is owned by a big corporation, which has 
greater negotiating clout when buying supplies. Dan Brothman, West Hill's chief 
executive, says he gets discounts of up to 20% for drugs, prosthetics, implants 
and other medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 But West Hills has boosted its market share by aggressively securing 
managed-care contracts, which now account for 40% of the hospital's revenue. By 
forging ties with organizations such as the Community Medical Group of the West 
Valley, which has 35 physicians and serves 40,000 members, the hospital was 
able to get a share of those managed-care customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, a hospital put up billboards and drove a lot of business," 
Brothman said. Today, hospital officials target employers during open 
enrollment; the rest of the time they wine and dine medical groups and people 
like Nick Demko. 
</P>
<P>
 Demko is director of hospital contracting at Blue Cross of California, the 
huge Woodland Hills-based insurer. A decade ago, Demko's job didn't even exist. 
Back then all Blue Cross members had traditional coverage: They went to the 
hospitals their doctors chose, the hospitals billed Blue Cross and the insurer 
reimbursed them in full. 
</P>
<P>
 But now most of Blue Cross' 2 million-plus customers belong to a Blue Cross 
HMO or other managed-care group. So for a hospital to get the business of these 
Blue Cross-insured members, it has to get a contract with Blue Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Demko says Blue Cross currently contracts with most of the hospitals in the 
Valley, but the number of hospital its picks under managed care will shrink. 
Blue Cross and other insurers are putting together a cost analysis on hospitals 
that is likely to lead to bigger discounts for hospital services. HMOs mostly 
pay hospitals on a per-diem basis for patients, and discounts run up to 30% for 
certain hospital procedures. That leaves inefficient and even some well-run 
hospitals with losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our payments don't contribute to a hospital's demise," Demko insists. "It's 
enough for them to continue to operate -- maybe not enough to keep adding 
services." Yet Demko said Blue Cross isn't likely to contract with hospitals 
that don't provide major services. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Demko says Blue Cross doesn't contract with small facilities 
such as Panorama Community Hospital. "It's not in our interest to do business 
with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes it tough for Panorama Community Hospital, whose nonprofit owner 
also operates the 69-bed San Fernando Community facility in San Fernando. The 
two hospitals lost a combined $5 million in the year ended last June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 But Green, chief executive of both facilities, said Panorama Community 
recently formed a medical group to try to land some HMO contracts. And it has 
opened a diabetic center for the hospital's large Latino community -- which has 
a higher incidence of diabetes -- to try and draw more patients. 
</P>
<P>
 K. D. Justyn, administrator of Westlake Medical Center in Westlake Village, 
worries as others do that underpayments from HMOs will create "understaffed and 
under-equipped hospitals." Earnings at her 96-bed hospital sank to $55,000 in 
1992 from $4 million a year earlier because major employers, such as Amgen Inc. 
and GTE, encouraged more of their employees to join HMOs or managed-care 
networks, which cut into the hospital's revenue stream, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the backing of its big parent firm -- Universal Health Services of 
Pennsylvania -- Justyn said that the hospital would not have been able last 
year to expand its outpatient surgery facilities, in keeping with a national 
trend. Justyn said her hospital showed a small profit last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Westlake Medical Center, other hospitals in the region are expanding, 
adding services and buying more modern equipment to get a competitive edge. 
Last year, for example, Northridge Hospital opened an $11.5-million outpatient 
cancer center. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Flocken, chief executive at the 427-bed Northridge Hospital, admits 
"there's too much bricks and mortar around." But he says hospitals need to 
offer full services because that's what managed-care providers and doctors 
want. Northridge can afford to expand. Flocken says it made $4.5 million in its 
last fiscal year ended Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that Northridge Hospital is owned by Unihealth, a $3-billion 
nonprofit outfit in Burbank. Unihealth also owns Chatsworth-based CareAmerica 
HMO, a dozen hospitals -- including Valley Hospital Medical Center in Van Nuys 
-- and is a major stockholder in PacifiCare, another big HMO, based in Cypress 
and serving 100,000 members in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, Northridge Hospital and Valley Hospital can count on patients being 
sent to them from HMOs like CareAmerica and PacifiCare. On the other hand, 
Unihealth's rival hospitals find it hard to get these same contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no surprise that Valley Presbyterian Hospital in Van Nuys, which is only 
a mile from Unihealth's Valley Hospital, does limited work with CareAmerica and 
has no PacifiCare contract. Valley Presbyterian has tried to establish its own 
links. The hospital recently set up an alliance with the renowned Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles, under which perinatal specialists from Cedars 
visit Valley Presbyterian twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Valley Presbyterian last year cut almost 100 jobs, including the 
chaplain's position, which was turned over to volunteers. By slashing costs, 
the 362-bed hospital rebounded from five straight years of losses, earning $2.9 
million for the 12 months ended last June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite having turned a profit, Chairman David Fleming says the hospital 
still needs a partner to cope with all the unknowns that lie ahead.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: OFFSHOOT OPTICAL COMPANY ENVISIONS A NEW DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three months ago, Roy E. Hacker, the top executive at Santa Barbara Applied 
Optics, a Ventura-based producer of night-vision lenses and other optical 
equipment for the military, learned that his firm was about to close its doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense orders, which accounted for 85% of revenues, were down sharply.The 
payroll, which had stood at 110 a year earlier, had shrunk to only 40 
employees. So Hacker wasn't totally surprised when his bosses at the parent 
company, Optical Filter Corp. in Natick, Mass., sent word that his division, 
which he headed as vice president and general manager, was to be shut down in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Hacker, a 24-year veteran in the electro-optical business, quickly raised some 
money, leased a 24,000-square-foot plant in Camarillo and tapped 20 of his key 
employees to join him at his newly formed Optimum Optical Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Importantly, he arranged to continue servicing most of the contracts awarded 
to Santa Barbara Applied Optics. The projects include designing and 
manufacturing lenses and other equipment used in training simulators for U. S. 
tank and aircraft crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're projecting sales of only $1.5 million to $2 million in our first year. 
But we hope to grow, mainly in non-defense work. By year three, we expect our 
commercial business to equal our defense business," Hacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hacker believes that his best non-defense opportunities lie in a line of 
lenses for high-tech surgical instruments. These and other lenses are made with 
such exotic materials as sapphire, quartz, germanium, zinc selenide and 
sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
 At the former parent, privately held Optical Filter, a spokesman said the 
Massachusetts firm wishes its former employees well. "We're a small company. We 
couldn't continue to cope with the profitability problems we were experiencing 
out there."

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: 100 WILL LOSE JOBS AS BANK BRANCHES CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eight Ventura County bank branches are about to be closed due to 
consolidations, throwing as many as 100 employees out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the moves, Chatsworth-based Great Western Bank will shut down 
offices of HomeFed Bank in Westlake Village, Ventura, Camarillo and Simi 
Valley.The closures will take place in February. 
</P>
<P>
 And branches of First State Bank of the Oaks in Camarillo, Simi Valley, 
Thousand Oaks and Westlake Village will be closed in April as a result of a 
takeover by First Interstate Bancorp, based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both acquisitions were announced last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western paid $151 million to the federal government's Resolution Trust 
Corp. for troubled HomeFed. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, parent of First Interstate Bank, paid $23 million to a group 
that controlled Bank of the Oaks.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: SIX-STORY BUILDING SELLS FOR $5.1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SEARLES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A buyer has finally been found for 1000 Town Center Drive, the green glass 
office building in Oxnard that has been on the market for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford Property Investors Inc., a real estate investment trust based in 
Lafayette, Calif., has purchased the six-story structure from Citicorp for $5.1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The building adjoining the Ventura Freeway was completed in 1991 at an 
estimated cost of $17 million. Only about 40% of its 110,000 square feet of 
space is occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 Citicorp turned down a $6.5-million offer in a nationwide auction in May, 
1992. At that time, the building was known as North Coast Executive Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in the Oxnard Town Center, which never lived up to its developers' 
vision of a $500-million project that would be the largest commercial 
development in Ventura County history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The low cost . . . and high quality of the building will allow us to compete 
aggressively in the west Ventura County market," said Peter B. Bedford, the 
investment trust's chairman and chief executive.

 TMM Inc., a small Thousand Oaks firm that develops software for the 
entertainment and telecommunications industries, has filed for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel P. Shields, the firm's chief executive, said the action was taken as a

 Shields said TMM failed to restructure a $1.8-million debt owed to Martini.

 "If we hadn't filed the petition, he could have forced a sale of company 
assets," Shields said.

 TMM had revenues of only $500,000 in 1993 but is on the verge of a marketing

FHP, RIVAL AGREE TO MERGE, FORM NO. 2 HMO IN STATE; TAKEOVER: THE O.C.-BASED 
HEALTH CARE PROVIDER WOULD ACQUIRE TAKECARE INC. IN AN $829-MILLION DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ and THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing a wave of health care mergers that have reshaped the industry in 
recent years, FHP International Corp. said it has agreed to acquire a competing 
health maintenance organization in Northern California for $829 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan by FHP, based in Fountain Valley, to acquire TakeCare Inc., based in 
Concord, is the biggest takeover of a managed-care company to date and would 
create the second-largest HMO in California and about the fifth largest in the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategically, the acquisition would allow FHP, which has 851,000 members, to 
expand its Medicare market into Northern California and Colorado, where it has 
been struggling to establish itself. TakeCare, which has 742,000 members, is 
already strong in both regions. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be a competing bid in the wings. Pittsburgh's wealthy Hillman 
family, which controls 16% of TakeCare's 13 million outstanding shares, will 
oppose the FHP deal because "there's another offer available to TakeCare that 
would offer greater value to shareholders," said Lawrence M. Wagner, president 
of Hillman Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner would not comment further, and executives of TakeCare or FHP would not 
disclose the identity of the potential suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Keaney, an analyst with the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus in St. Louis, 
said a second offer could derail the FHP bid. "This really is a long way from a 
done deal," Keaney said. "There is the risk that the deal will not be 
completed." 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said the deal has strong support among other shareholders, 
however, and they expect it to be finalized by the end of June. The transaction 
would also require regulatory approvals. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal comes amid a frenzy of health care mergers in recent months, fueled 
in part by the expectation that national health care reform will favor larger 
health care companies that offer a range of services and cover broader 
geographic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately on Monday, Nashville-based Healthtrust Inc. said it will buy 
Dallas-based EPIC Holdings Inc. in a deal valued at $1 billion. Upon completion 
of the acquisition, Healthtrust said it will operate 115 acute care hospitals 
in 22 states. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the largest health care merger proposal was the planned union 
of Blue Shield of California and Unihealth America. But that deal, which would 
have created the second-largest HMO in California behind Kaiser Permanente, 
unraveled two months ago over differences in "corporate culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the FHP-TakeCare deal is not comparable to the defunct Blue 
Shield-Unihealth proposal, and predicted smooth sailing for FHP, which would 
pay $62 a share for the smaller firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In over-the-counter trading Monday, TakeCare's stock shot up $6.50 a share to 
close at $58.25. FHP's stock, also traded on the Nasdaq market, closed at 
$26.50 a share, unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good deal for both parties," said Jack Massimino, an FHP 
executive vice president. "It is a great strategic fit for both organizations, 
and we are very excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts also lauded the tentative agreement -- which caught them by surprise 
-- saying each side would complement the other by creating a new, powerful 
company that would be a formidable competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 FHP is already the nation's largest provider of managed-care services to 
Medicare patients. Under its Senior Plan, about 300,000 Medicare patients 
receive comprehensive medical benefits. FHP officials would like to increase 
that number in the competitive, highly profitable Medicare market. 
</P>
<P>
 But FHP needs to boost its regular membership first, analysts noted, 
especially in Northern California and Colorado, where the company now has only 
a small presence. Federal law requires that for each Medicare member that an 
HMO signs up in a region, it must also sign up a regular member. 
</P>
<P>
 TakeCare President R. Judd Jessup said that his company's large number of 
regular members in the Bay Area and Colorado mean that the merged entity would 
be able to add new Medicare recipients quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will be great going forward together," Jessup said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have about 1.6 million members in California, Colorado, 
Utah, Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Guam, New Mexico and Nevada, and would have a 
combined annual revenue of $3.5 billion, company officials estimated. HMOs Join 
Forces 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of FHP Inc. and TakeCare Health Plan would create the second-largest 
HMO in California and one of the top five in the nation.

KARCHER GETS INTO CHICKEN BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to cash in on growing consumer demand for healthier restaurant food, 
Carl Karcher Enterprises said Monday it plans to open as many as 300 Boston 
Chicken Inc. outlets in Southern California and Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 The move is designed to augment flagging profits at Anaheim-based Karcher 
Enterprises by giving the parent company of the Carl's Jr. hamburger chain a 
strong presence in the fast-growing broiled chicken segment of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks Karcher Enterprises' first move in a new direction since a 
highly publicized dispute pitted founder Carl N. Karcher against his handpicked 
board of directors. Karcher, who was ousted on Oct. 1 as chairman but was 
subsequently invited back as chairman emeritus, split with the board on a 
proposal to sell Green Burrito Mexican-style foods at Carl's Jr. restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises President Donald E. Doyle said the hamburger chain will 
continue to experiment with new menu items and that Boston Chicken products 
won't be sold at Carl's Jr. locations. Instead, the company will create a 
separate division to build the 300 Boston Chicken locations. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boston Chicken, a Naperville, Ill.-based rotisserie chicken chain that set 
records when it first offered stock to the public in November, the deal is a 
major piece in its ambitious plan to expand nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken said it was attracted to Karcher Enterprises' land holdings. 
"Carl's has some of the highest-quality real estate in the Southern California 
market, and we needed a substantial player in the market to get our concept 
going strong," said Mark Stephens, Boston Chicken's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises has 649 Carl's Jr. fast-food restaurants in California, 
Nevada, Oregon, Arizona and Mexico. Doyle said the company will convert about 
35 Carl's Jr. stores to Boston Chicken locations. 
</P>
<P>
 In planning to open separate chicken restaurants, Karcher Enterprises is 
joining several competitors -- including longtime king Kentucky Fried Chicken 
-- that are rushing to meet the demand for products that are perceived as 
healthy and relatively inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the food concept of the 1990s," said Janet Lowder, a restaurant 
consultant in Rancho Palos Verdes. "You've already got an awful lot of 
competition in that non-fried chicken segment, and this deal suggests it's 
going to heat up even more." 
</P>
<P>
 KFC Inc., the Louisville, Ky.-based parent company of Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
turned up the heat last summer by spending more than $100 million to roll out 
its new Colonel's Rotisserie Gold chicken line. The company's rotisserie sales 
totaled $175 million for the second half, leading KFC to project that they will 
equal those of fried chicken by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 KFC controls about half of the nation's $7-billion market for fried chicken. 
But investors nonetheless embraced Boston Chicken when the company made its 
first public stock offering in November. Its shares more than doubled in 
first-day trading to close at $48.50, up from $20. Restaurant industry analysts 
were stunned because the chain had fewer than 200 locations nationwide and had 
recently reported a $5.9 million loss on annual revenue of $8.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's announcement pushed Boston Chicken's stock up $3.75 to close at $41 
in Monday's Nasdaq trading, while Karcher Enterprises, also traded on the 
Nasdaq market, surged $2 to $13.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Karcher Enterprises President Doyle described the Boston Chicken franchise 
purchase as a long-term investment that won't make a significant contribution 
to his company's bottom line until 1995 at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect a modestly positive effect in the second year, with (profits) 
improving after that," Doyle said. Karcher Enterprises will create a separate 
division to run the chicken business, Doyle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken is moving into Southern California and Sacramento as part of a 
national strategy that calls for more than 400 locations to be open by year's 
end. The company recently agreed to pay $22.3 million for 87 Philadelphia-area 
Roy Rogers restaurants that will be converted to Boston Chicken eateries. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken isn't the only chain eyeing California. Kenny Rogers Roasters, 
a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., chain with 100 units nationwide, plans to add "several 
hundred locations in the next four or five years in the state," spokesman David 
Morrow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Chicken also faces stiff competition from El Pollo Loco, an 
Irvine-based chain with 210 locations in California, Nevada and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it, we're a direct competitor," said Ray Perry, El Pollo 
Loco's president. "We've been expecting their arrival, and we have some things 
planned to blunt their arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston Chicken deal won't take away sales from the 649-unit Carl's Jr. 
chain, Doyle said, because "Boston Chicken is clearly positioned as takeout 
meal replacement. It's not part of the day-to-day fast food environment. It 
almost has the feel of a takeout deli." 
</P>
<P>
 And the deal isn't likely to take away from Carl's Jr. sales -- a typical 
dinner at a Boston Chicken outlet costs about $4, more than a meal at Carl's 
Jr. Top Chicken Sales 
</P>
<P>
 Biting into the market for rotisserie chicken could earn millions of dollars 
in sales for Carl Karcher Enterprises. Estimated 1993 sales, in millions:

INSURER PULLS OUT OF WARNER RIDGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The expected main tenant of the planned Warner Ridge office complex announced 
plans Monday to move elsewhere, clouding the future of one of the most 
controversial developments in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 The pullout by 20th Century Industries raises questions whether the developers 
will be able to carry out plans for three mid-rise office buildings and 125 
condominiums on Warner Ridge, which homeowners and city officials have fought 
in a battle that goes back eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle helped destroy the political career of West San Fernando Valley 
Councilwoman Joy Picus, who was defeated for re-election after she was blamed 
for pushing the rest of the council into a losing battle that cost the city at 
least $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of courts ruled against the city -- agreeing with the 
developers that the city was twisting the law to block the project to appease 
anti-development homeowners -- the council gave in, agreeing to an expensive 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Ridge Partners, the development firm, declined comment Monday on the 
20th Century withdrawal, said the firm's attorney, Robert McMurry. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jack Spound, one of the top figures in the partnership, had 
previously described the participation of the insurance company as critical to 
the financial viability of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "In court documents, the developer has told the courts that 20th Century was 
their only client and if (20th Century) pulled out they would have no project," 
said Robert Gross, president of the Woodland Hills Homeowner's Assn., the most 
determined foe of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company announcement that "it will not be occupying new 
corporate headquarters in the Warner Ridge development" also leaves hanging 
another controversial project -- the scheduled transfer of 425,000 cubic yards 
of topsoil from Warner Ridge to the adjacent farm at Pierce College, which was 
to receive $1 million in desperately needed cash from the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century Senior Vice President Richard Dinon said the company would not 
comment on its motives for withdrawing from the $150 million complex, on which 
construction was scheduled to begin Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance company, one of the state's largest, had stated in court 
documents earlier however that it would back out of the deal if the 
construction schedule lagged. The company's lease on its current facility in 
Warner Center expires in November, 1995, and it must move its 2,400 employees 
to new offices before then. 
</P>
<P>
 20th Century has not chosen an alternate site. "The company has established an 
internal committee to evaluate alternatives, including different sites, and 
select the best location for our new headquarters office," according to the 
statement faxed late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, Warner Ridge would eventually include 125 condominiums and five 
office buildings, three of which were to be built by June, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was proposed for the 21.5-acre Warner Ridge in 1985, and drew 
strenuous opposition from the Woodland Hills Homeowner's Assn., which argued 
that such a massive development would clog traffic on De Soto Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 After the proposed development was modified several times, the Los Angeles 
City Council tried changing the zoning of the area in an attempt to scuttle the 
project. But the developer sued the city and eventually won the right to build 
690,000 square feet of office space and condominiums, as well as exemptions 
from $4 million in city fees. The city's legal expenses were estimated at 
$700,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and agriculture activists responded by filing lawsuits challenging 
the stated environmental impact of the project and the topsoil transfer, which 
further delayed construction. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last month, Warner Ridge Partners was scrambling to secure a 
last-minute loan to finish grading and begin construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent stumbling block for the Warner Ridge development, 
opponents of the project were hesitant to declare a victory Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what's going to happen next," Shirley Blessing, a director of 
the Woodland Hills Homeowner's Assn., said after learning of the decision by 
20th Century. "I can only hope that maybe now the homeowners, the city and 
Warner Ridge can go back to the drawing board to find something that is more 
acceptable to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said the homeowners group was willing to support a project that 
consisted of 471,000 square feet and adhered to a three-story limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're willing to settle for a lesser project, then everything would go 
away," Gross said. "The ball is in their court." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the group will pursue a lawsuit filed against the city 
because it provided Warner Ridge with entitlements to build the office complex. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Court of Appeal hearing scheduled for Wednesday has been continued 
until Feb. 8 by court officials to review the claims made by the homeowners 
group, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a victory for the community if 690,000 square feet of commercial 
office space does not go in," said Gross, of the homeowners association, which 
represents about 450 homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we want it resolved. We hope the developers find a client that will be 
happy with a lesser project," Gross added.

QUEUE FOR HOUSING TURNS UGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sometimes unruly crowd of more than 2,500 people gathered Monday at Burbank 
City Hall to apply for 25 vacancies on a low-income housing list and had to be 
dispersed by police worried that children, the elderly and disabled would be 
injured in the shoving. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident illustrates "the very severe need" for more low-cost housing in 
the city and county, said Burbank Mayor George Battey. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday marked the first time in four years that the Burbank Housing Authority 
has accepted applications for Section 8 status under a federal rental 
assistance program that provides subsidies for low-income tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials decided to open the application process after the federal government 
recently authorized 25 additional recipients. Those who qualify for the program 
receive vouchers they can turn over to property owners, who turn them back to 
the government for cash. The vouchers are scaled to keep the recipients' rent 
expenses from exceeding 30% of their income. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to create a new waiting list because we've exhausted the old one," 
said Burbank Housing Administrator Linda Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Published in local media and posted at City Hall, the announcement that the 
city would begin accepting applications drew people from Burbank, Glendale and 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the office was not scheduled to begin handing out applications until 
7 a.m. Monday, some began gathering as early as midnight in a walkway behind 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipated that we would have several hundred applicants," said Lt. 
Robert Giles of the Burbank Police Department. "At 5 in the morning we found 
over a thousand applicants waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Huddled in blankets and resting in lawn chairs, the applicants organized 
themselves, scribbling numbers on scraps of papers and on the palms of their 
hands to indicate their places in line. Others began circulating a sign-up 
sheet to those in the growing crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the line mistakenly believed the numbers and sign-up sheet were 
circulated by City Hall officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was something done by the people in line very unofficially," Giles said. 
"We told them we didn't necessarily adhere to those numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn De Windt of Burbank arrived at 6 a.m. and saw an opportunity in an 
otherwise dismal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went home and made hot dogs and sold them," she said. "I sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 But by 10:30 a.m. the line was a quarter of a mile long and extended down San 
Fernando Road, Giles said. Concerned that the crowd was too large, police began 
handing out applications to those at the back of the line that would have to be 
mailed in rather than filled out on the spot. Those in the front were still to 
be allowed to turn in their applications that morning. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when the real problem began, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a giant pushing match," Giles said. "The danger became obvious at 
that point. There were handicapped, elderly people and children who were being 
pushed around in the middle of the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Language barriers complicated matters, Giles said. Many in the crowd were 
Armenian speakers who may not have understood police directions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point police decided to disperse the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics were called for one pregnant woman who was pushed against a wall in 
the confusion, but there were no serious injuries, Giles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons said those who did not receive applications should "call us up and 
we'll mail the applications out and they can send it by mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who had waited in line for hours were clearly angered by the city's 
decision to stop accepting applications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were here since 6 a.m. and we can't get an application," said Astgik 
Tanashyan, who has lived in Burbank for four years. "I think it's bad 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't have a phone," said Donna Maspero. "I can't call them. I 
stood in line to get an application and now they're telling me I can't get one. 
. . . I think they should totally throw out today and start over." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials pointed to the economy and the scarcity of housing throughout 
the county as a reason for the overwhelming response. When Section 8 
applications were last taken during January, 1990, about 1,100 people applied 
during a two-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is worse than it was four years ago," Simmons said. "With cuts in 
AFDC (Aid to Families with Dependent Children) and different programs, people 
are struggling. You can see that the need for affordable housing in Los Angeles 
is very prevalent." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday afternoon, signs were posted on the doors of several offices at City 
Hall declaring that no more applications would be accepted. Still, knots of 
people stood in the corridors outside the housing authority office, expressing 
disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Katharine Nickolson, who arrived after the disorder ended, stood calmly 
writing down the housing authority's phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been trying for five years to get on Section 8," she said. "My income is 
fixed and my son and I need a place where we don't have to pay all of our money 
in rent."

FORMER HEAD OF IRVINE CHARITY FOUND GUILTY; COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY FORGERY AND 
EMBEZZLEMENT NETTED HIM MORE THAN $400,000 FROM FUNDS FOR THE HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The former director of an Irvine charity was found guilty of forgery and 
embezzlement Monday in a scheme that prosecutors said netted him more than 
$400,000 in funds intended to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde E. Weinman, 44, received a quick pat on the back from his attorney after 
the clerk read the verdicts, and he appeared somewhat shocked and bewildered as 
he was led away in handcuffs to await his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman, former director of Irvine Temporary Housing, is scheduled to be 
sentenced Feb. 4. He faces a maximum of eight years in prison and $200,000 in 
fines for his conviction on 13 felony charges of forgery and grand theft. The 
jury started deliberating last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's well-deserved," said Margie Wakeham, the ITH administrator who 
first reported possible wrongdoing by Weinman in 1992 and later succeeded him 
at the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wakeham said it was difficult to see a former colleague go to jail. 
"There's certainly mixed feelings when you see someone taken off to jail that 
you thought you knew," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, prosecutors portrayed Weinman as a reverse Robin Hood who 
stole money from the poor to bankroll a posh lifestyle that included fancy cars 
and a luxury home. Weinman's Lake Forest home was a virtual "Taj Mahal," 
replete with lavish landscaping, pool and sauna, Deputy Dist. Atty. Bill 
Overtoom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman also embezzled money to pay his utility bills, lease a Mercedes-Benz 
and carry plenty of spending money, Overtoom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have 588 checks totaling over $400,000 with forged signatures . . . 
the evidence is pretty overwhelming," Overtoom said Monday after the verdict. 
"They had several thousands of pieces of paper all pointing to Mr. Weinman," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jury member William Villafana of Tustin agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used the money for his own benefit," Villafana said. "Even though he put 
some (money into the charity), he took a lot more out." 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman has defended himself by saying he was a "scapegoat" for the mismanaged 
charity, and he insisted that he pumped $65,000 of his own money -- including 
his wife's teaching checks and money from his two children's savings accounts 
-- into the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Milton Kerlan Jr. said Irvine Temporary Housing, a nonprofit 
agency founded in 1985 to provide shelter for the homeless, was chronically 
underfunded by at least $100,000 per year. Weinman got into trouble when he 
took $60,000 out of the charity to pay for his modest living expenses, Kerlan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Overtoom said Weinman, hired as ITC's executive director in 1989, must be 
blamed for any management problems. "There certainly was mismanagement, and it 
was Mr. Weinman," Overtoom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman was fired from the charity in June, 1992, after the agency's board of 
directors found that several thousand dollars in charity money was missing.

NO WORD ON FATE OF CLINIC; UPRISING: CRYSTAL CATHEDRAL MEMBERS ANXIOUSLY PRAY 
FOR SAFETY OF WORKERS AT HOSPITAL IN CHIAPAS, MEXICO, THAT CHURCH HELPED BUILD 
10 YEARS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The violent uprising that began recently in southern Mexico is drawing special 
attention at the Crystal Cathedral, where volunteers and missionaries from the 
church are praying for the safety of workers at a hospital the church helped 
build 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials have heard that the eight employees of the remote clinic fled 
the area last week when rebels stormed several villages in the state of Chiapas 
to protest the government's treatment of peasants in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the outbreak began, the church has lost contact with the outpost, 
which is within 20 miles of the fierce fighting in the town of Ocosingo. The 
fate of the clinic is important to the Crystal Cathedral congregants, some of 
whom still keep close tabs on what they call "the Chiapas Project." The church 
also sends an occasional volunteer to help at the rural health facility, though 
it no longer supports it with funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Carla Sterk, a missionary who worked with Crystal Cathedral 
volunteers when they helped build the hospital in the early 1980s, reportedly 
left Michigan to return to the clinic area. Her trip had been scheduled before 
the uprising began at the beginning of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said they are concerned about the fate of the clinic and its 
workers, as well as for Sterk. The location is so remote there is no telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't surprise me that a missionary would want to go back. When people 
are missionaries, they set aside their own personal safety," said Michael 
Nason, a spokesman for Crystal Cathedral. "When there is a crisis, missionaries 
are often more active. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would feel a very deep loss" if anything happened to the hospital and its 
personnel, added Nason. "There was such a sense of medical need in that part of 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Hollenbeck, a Chiapas Project volunteer who now works as an 
administrative aide at the Crystal Cathedral, said he is disheartened to hear 
that the hospital could be endangered. "I think it's terrible. . . . I'd be 
very sad if the hospital got destroyed. All the money and donations that went 
down there to keep it going would be for nothing, and we'd have to start all 
over again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Philanthropists from the Crystal Cathedral were the driving force behind El 
Buen Pastor Hospital (The Good Shepard Hospital) in Chiapas, choosing the site 
because there was little or no medical care for the peasants living near the 
Guatemalan border. 
</P>
<P>
 Church members raised more than $500,000 for the project, and about 30 
volunteers from the congregation traveled to the remote mountain area to help 
in the construction.  
</P>
<P>
 "As missionaries we tried . . . to meet the needs of these people who were not 
empowered by the government," said Paul Hostetter, a former Crystal Cathedral 
congregant who oversaw the construction of the hospital and is now a religion 
professor in Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Those running the clinic, like most of the patients, are local residents. A 
doctor and a nurse work full time at the five-building facility, which has 12 
beds and an operating theater and has grown in the 10 years since it was set 
up. Patients often pay with a bag of corn or a chicken, though many are treated 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, El Buen Pastor Hospital is owned and operated by Mexican Medical Inc., 
a Spring Valley, Calif., organization that owns and manages other Christian 
hospitals in Mexico. Mel Peabody, president of the company, said he has been 
anxiously awaiting word from the doctor, Neftali Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can do is wait," he said. An affiliated organization, which supplies 
the hospital with medical equipment, also has had no word from the local doctor 
or others at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm assuming at this stage of the game that no news is good news," said 
Peabody, who was worried last week that the facility might have been occupied 
by the rebels or the Mexican army. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital workers evacuated the area a week ago, fleeing to the nearby state of 
Tabasco along with many residents of nearby villages, Peabody said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff left because they were afraid for their lives. Government troops 
were arresting all the Indian workers in that area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that fighting is believed to have stopped, Peabody hopes to hear this week 
from Dr. Torres that it is safe for the rest of the staff to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Some at the Crystal Cathedral say they are concerned about the clinic's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollenbeck, a volunteer who has been there seven times, said, "I'd probably go 
back down there and help rebuild" if it was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 When he visited Chiapas in 1989 to repaint the hospital, there were a new 
pharmacy, an X-ray room, dentistry equipment, a kitchen, four examining rooms, 
a water tank and living facilities for both staff and volunteers who come on 
missions from all over the United States and Canada. There is also a 
residential area for patients' family members, who typically stay with them 
until they are well.  
</P>
<P>
 To Hollenbeck the recent rebellion comes as no surprise and stems from the 
indigenous peoples' feelings of disenfranchisement from the Mexican government. 
From what Chiapas Project workers observed while there, tensions leading to the 
revolt had been building up for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Duffy of Huntington Beach, who was director of special projects at 
Crystal Cathedral in 1980 and 1981, said he saw evidence of the impending 
rebellion even then. At the time, he was in Chiapas with a film crew, which 
made a documentary that raised $500,000 to build the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 When he and his crew left the area, they were detained by armed guerrillas. 
"We were driving out (of the village) on this lonely jungle road," said Duffy, 
who now runs an Irvine public relations and marketing firm and hosts a talk 
show on KKLA-Radio in Glendale. "A band of Indians dropped a log across the 
road. They were all armed. We couldn't back up. We couldn't move forward."  
</P>
<P>
 They demanded money to allow the filmmakers to use the only road out of the 
area. "The driver negotiated a price so we could go through," he said. "This is 
how they (get) money so they can conduct their revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the same people. They have the same concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollenbeck agreed. "The ones that are uprising," he said, "decided they were 
going to do something and make the government wake up. They've just been put 
out of the land that they've had for hundreds and hundreds of years that 
belonged to their ancestors."

SCHOOL ENROLLMENT BECOMES MORE DIVERSE; GROWTH SLOWS; EDUCATION: LARGEST 
INCREASES ARE AT JUVENILE COURT FACILITIES FOR DELINQUENTS AND DROPOUTS, 
ACCORDING TO AN ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ANNUAL REPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Enrollment in Orange County public schools continued to grow slightly and 
become more ethnically diverse last year, while programs that educate dropouts 
and delinquents have seen a sharp rise in attendance, new statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the largest increases in enrollment were in the county-run juvenile 
court schools, alternative high schools and home-schooling programs. The number 
of students in court schools and the alternative program -- which consists 
mainly of independent study and handles students who have dropped out or been 
expelled from local districts -- jumped nearly 25% to 3,227 last fall, 
according to an annual report just released by the Orange County Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot more young people out there who are getting themselves in 
trouble," said William Habermehl, assistant superintendent of the Department of 
Education, who runs the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermehl and John F. Dean, the county superintendent, attributed the sharp 
rise to an increase in juvenile delinquency and to the countywide trend toward 
"zero tolerance" discipline policies, which dictate that schools will expel 
students after even a single incident of weapon possession, drug use or other 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Education has dealt with the enrollment surge by 
assigning more students per teacher in the independent study arena, hiring more 
part-time teachers and opening several new independent study locations over the 
past year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish the need weren't there, as all of society does, but it is a safety 
valve for the local school districts," Dean said. "We began this service a long 
time ago to be sure that there was a place for these kids to go. If we can help 
them by putting these students into a different program, that's why (the county 
department of education is) here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of students being taught at home jumped nearly 14%, to 
742 this year. But the number enrolled in the county's special education 
programs dropped 33% to 487 largely because disabled students in the Garden 
Grove area are now taught through the local school district. 
</P>
<P>
 In mainstream school programs, demographics continued to shift as expected, 
with white students making up a smaller percentage of the population and school 
districts near the county borders growing most quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, enrollment for the fall of 1993 was 404,465, a record high that 
represents a 1.3% rise from the previous year. Boys make up 51.5% of the 
students and girls 48.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more demands on teachers, and we're not doing much in the way of 
building so we're having to absorb more and more students into the same 
classrooms," Dean said. "It's a constant challenge to satisfy the needs of the 
students when we have, in essence, less money." 
</P>
<P>
 Whites were the only ethnic group whose representation in local schools 
dropped this year, from 49.2% of the total to 47.9%. But ethnic diversity is 
still wildly different across districts: in Santa Ana Unified, whites make up 
less than 5% of the student body, whereas in Laguna Beach Unified, they are 
85%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Latino student body swelled 3.4%, and now fills 35% of the classrooms 
overall. Asians and blacks each increased their numbers about 2%, to make up 
12.6% and 2% of the county's public school population. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the county's 27 school districts, including the three that serve only 
high school students, dropped in enrollment this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The largest gains besides the county-run programs came in Los Alamitos, Tustin 
and the sprawling South County district, Capistrano Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Unified, a small district that enjoys one of the best reputations 
in the region and often draws students from outside its borders, had a surge of 
more than 6%, which assistant superintendent David Hatton attributed to the new 
preschool program, an increase in transfers from other districts and new 
families moving into the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin grew 4.6% and, for the first time, whites became a minority in the 
district. Supt. David Andrews said the growth comes from the new housing 
development, Tustin Ranch, and a growing number of families crowding into 
apartments on the district's south side. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified, which encompasses most of the county's sparsely developed 
turf, also grew about 4.6%, and plans to absorb the larger population with five 
new elementary schools next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a growing district," said Supt. James A. Fleming. "We'll be ready." 
Public School Growth Slows Orange County's school enrollment exceeded 400,000 
students last fall, continuing a growth trend. Since 1989 the total number of 
students has increased 12%, but the growth rate has slowed slightly. Enrollment 
and percentage increase 1989: 360,213; 2.7% 1990: 375,579; 4.3% 1991: 390,898; 
4.1% 1992: 399,592; 2.2% 1993: 404,465; 1.2% Diverse Enrollment Whites made up 
nearly half public school enrollment, not including adult education or 
preschool. The ethnic makeup of county schools: White: 48% Latino: 35% Asian: 
13% Black: 2% All others: 2% District Changes Just six districts experienced 
enrollment decreases between 1992 and 1993, led by Huntington Beach Union's 
near 4% decline. Santa Ana Unified is still the biggest district in the county.

PACKARD BELL WILL RELOCATE UNITS TO UTAH; CHATSWORTH: COMPUTER MAKER'S DECISION 
INVOLVES SERVICE AND SUPPORT DIVISIONS AND MEANS THE LOSS OF HUNDREDS OF JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Packard Bell, the Chatsworth-based computer manufacturer whose efforts to 
relocate have become the focus of a drive to retain jobs in California, said 
Monday it would move almost one-quarter of its jobs to Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Service and support units, which include about 420 of the firm's 1,500 
employees, will move to a facility outside Salt Lake City, the company 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these employees are being offered the opportunity to relocate to 
Utah," according to a written statement put out by the company. About 50 of the 
support employees will remain temporarily at the Chatsworth office until the 
remainder of the company relocates. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, among the largest personal computer manufacturers in the United 
States, is negotiating with several communities in the western part of the 
country that would like to snare the company and its jobs. The leading 
California contender, according to company executives, is the Antelope Valley 
city of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 High-level state, county and city officials have gotten involved in the 
campaign to keep the company -- which executives say has outgrown its San 
Fernando Valley facility and needs to relocate to expand -- in economically 
troubled California. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on moving the remainder of Packard Bell will not come "for a few 
weeks, at least," according to spokeswoman Liz O'Donnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale has attempted to lure the company with an offer of 50 acres of 
developed land, worth an estimated $7.5 million, and the proceeds from a 
$10-million bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has gotten involved on the city's behalf, urging the state 
Legislature to pass a bill designating Palmdale an enterprise zone, which would 
give Packard Bell a $19,000 tax credit over five years for every employee 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles County officials have offered the company $12,500 in annual 
property tax breaks, the maximum allowed under state law, if Palmdale wins the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been plenty of competition, most notably from Portland, Ore., 
and Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said that the decision to move the support and service units to Salt 
Lake City should not be read as an indication that the Utah city is now the 
front-runner to get the rest of Packard Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a separate issue," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell sells personal computers through 9,000 retail outlets worldwide. 
Company officials say it posted revenues of more than $1.25 billion in 1993 and 
project 84% sales growth in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 As a privately owned company, Packard Bell is not required to disclose sales 
figures. But it is known that the company has had debt troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 when it attempted to raise capital with a public stock offering, the 
company issued figures showing that as of 1991 it was carrying $93 million in 
debt. The stock offering was withdrawn due to a poor response from potential 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard Bell did get a boost last year, however, when a French computer 
company bought a 19.9% stake in the firm.

TRIAL MOVES TO SCENE OF THE CRIME; SAN FERNANDO: SHACKLED MURDER DEFENDANT AND 
COURTROOM ENTOURAGE RETRACE VICTIM'S PATH AT STORE.

 Guns bulging from tweed jackets. A man hobbling through the home-improvement 
store, chained at the ankles and wrists. The store manager holding forth under 
oath. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the usual fare at the Home Depot at 12960 Foothill Blvd. But that's what 
curious shoppers saw Monday morning as a murder trial moved from the courthouse 
in San Fernando to the scene of the crime, where a guard was shot to death 
during a robbery in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half a dozen police officers accompanied the shackled defendant, 
Sean Darnell Slade, with the judge, court reporter, defense attorney, 
prosecutors, 12 jurors and four alternates as they retraced the path that 
prosecutors claim was taken by the guard, Edwin Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
 As manager Ronald Shultz steered the entourage down the aisles, he described 
the routine followed by Maldonado, then 26, on July 20, 1992, before he was 
gunned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's impossible for the jury to understand from aerial photographs and 
layouts," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas. "The walk-through, the 
observation and general feeling help them see what had to be done to pull this 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors alleged when the trial began last week that the robbery was 
well-planned and had the help of someone familiar with the store's procedures. 
Three men committed the robbery, but two remain at large, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Slade was the man who shot Maldonado, who was wearing 
a bulletproof vest, twice in the head. The shooting was part of a robbery in 
which $82,000 was taken.  
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado had emptied the vault at the store and was taking the cash to his 
Sectran Security Transportation truck when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors claimed that Slade grew up with a Home Depot employee who was 
leaving the store for the day at the time of the robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney, Bruce C. Hill, said that his client was not involved in 
the robbery or the shooting and said he will present alibi evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in front of the spot where Maldonado was killed, jurors watched as 
Shultz demonstrated how the alarm normally sounds in the event of a robbery. 
But on the day of the shooting, the alarm did not sound, and security cameras 
were not functioning.  
</P>
<P>
 Slade faces the death penalty if convicted.

PITCHESS INMATES SEGREGATED BY RACE IN WAKE OF BRAWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department authorities said Monday they were temporarily segregating 
hundreds of maximum-security inmates at the Peter J. Pitchess jail in Castaic 
"until things calm down" in the wake of perhaps the biggest-ever brawl there 
between Latino and African-American detainees. 
</P>
<P>
 As authorities looked into the cause of the melee, in which 600 inmates fought 
with knives and other weapons Sunday and 80 were injured, minor scuffles 
continued at the sprawling facility in northern Los Angeles County. And another 
fight broke out in a holding tank in a Santa Monica courthouse, the latest of 
dozens of racially tinged altercations that have erupted in the county jail 
system in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The early-morning fights at the ranch and in Santa Monica were quelled in a 
matter of seconds and the commander at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho said 
authorities countywide were on alert to make sure other flare-ups would be 
dealt with quickly, before they escalated into battles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Robert Spierer, Pitchess commander, said Monday afternoon that 
gang warfare in Venice and other problems on the street -- and in the state 
prison and county jail systems -- might have exacerbated tensions at the ranch 
and caused the inmates to become combative. He said authorities were continuing 
their investigation into the cause of the melee, which occurred at the North 
County Correctional Facility, and said they remained perplexed about how to 
prevent problems between blacks and Latinos from escalating in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Racial segregation is against Sheriff's Department policy and will remain in 
effect "just until things calm down," Spierer said. "I would doubt it will last 
for more than 24 hours, then we have to re-integrate them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said authorities are bracing for the worst once the 500 to 700 inmates who 
are segregated in 14 maximum-security dormitories are reunited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, we are worried that the hostility will carry over when they are 
re-integrated," Spierer said. "But we believe there is a greater danger in 
keeping them segregated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the constitutional problems of permanently segregating inmates along 
racial lines, Spierer said allowing the groups to remain separate would only 
cause deeply rooted social problems to fester. 
</P>
<P>
 "As in the past when we have segregated people racially, there is a greater 
possibility they will get together and plan retaliation," Spierer said. "And 
all we would be doing is transferring problems from our custody areas to our 
other locations, and maybe even aggravating and intensifying the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Sobel, senior staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union in 
Los Angeles, agreed. She said any type of permanent segregation probably would 
not only be unconstitutional but virtually impossible to uphold without leading 
to other discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do -- not allow certain types of people to work out when others 
do?" Sobel asked. "What do you do with job assignments? I think it would be an 
impossible situation that would lead to a whole host of equality problems." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ramona Ripston, executive director of the ACLU's Southern California 
office, said the civil-rights group wants to examine the issue more thoroughly 
before taking an official position. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department has sent extra guards and other personnel to the jail 
facility east of the Golden State Freeway, and top management officials spent 
the day there Monday determining what other steps to take as part of a 
prearranged inspection. Spierer said the brawl was at least the 55th such 
incident at the ranch's five jail buildings in the past year alone, and that 
during that time between 200 and 300 inmates have suffered injuries ranging 
from minor abrasions to serious wounds that required hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, such fights have begun with a simple confrontation between two men 
over the use of a pay phone or a minor theft or because one inmate feels that 
another -- often of a different race -- hasn't shown him the proper respect, 
authorities said. Those fights can start anywhere, including areas where 
inmates cannot easily be segregated, such as buses and holding cells.  
</P>
<P>
 "It may not actually start out racially, but it breaks out along those lines," 
Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials said it may have been just such a minor 
incident that provoked the melee Sunday. Deputies said the fighting broke out 
almost simultaneously at 20 separate maximum-security dormitories at 3:55 p.m. 
In the next half hour, more than 600 Latino and African-American inmates 
battled with homemade knives, broomsticks and "anything they could get their 
hands on," one deputy said. Dozens of guards fired rubber bullets to break them 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 80 injured inmates, 24 were sent to hospitals for X-rays or for 
treatment for stab wounds, severe cuts and head injuries. Some of those 
hospitalized were brought back to segregated dorms Monday, Spierer said, but 
others remained in the jail hospital in downtown Los Angeles and in the Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa Clarita with serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 500 to 700 inmates at two of the five buildings on the north 
campus remained segregated late Monday. The two buildings house about 1,400 
inmates, with Latinos outnumbering blacks 2 to 1, Spierer said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, tensions between the racial groups appear to have escalated, 
sheriff's authorities have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's brawl came on the heels of three fights in the previous week at the 
Pitchess jail. Last Friday, inmates at the jail's north facility suffered minor 
injuries when 15 Latino and African-American prisoners fought, authorities 
said. The day before, 15 inmates were hurt when 40 men battled in a medical 
dorm at the north facility. And on Wednesday, five inmates were hurt when 80 
inmates fought in the jail's east facility. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sunday's disturbance, at least two other fights occurred later Sunday 
and on Monday, although no one else was hurt, authorities said. All the 
incidents had racial overtones, Spierer and other county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the Monday-morning fights, 10 of 75 inmates housed at a dorm in the 
south facility battled with broomsticks and coffee pots, said Sheriff's 
Department spokesman Robert Stoneman. Inmate fights also broke out at the jail 
well into the night Sunday he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a four-week pilot program is set to start at the facility in 
the next few months aimed at teaching inmates alternative ways of dealing with 
stress and defusing racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff tells us the reason they have all these (fights) is race-related 
and that the inmates don't know how to deal with conflict or differences," said 
Lori Howard, a deputy to County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents the 
area where the ranch is located. "This will teach them how to deal with it 
without killing anyone."

WIFE HELD IN DEATH OF MAN'S LOVER AND SON; CRIME: LI-YUN (LISA) PENG WAS 
ARRESTED ON THE BASIS OF TESTS MATCHING DNA FROM HER BLOOD WITH SALIVA LIFTED 
FROM A BITE MARK ON VICTIM'S ARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A DNA sample from a bite mark on a dead body has led to a woman's arrest on 
suspicion of murder in the deaths of her wealthy husband's girlfriend and their 
infant son, the Orange County district attorney's office said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Li-Yun (Lisa) Peng, 44, of Rancho Santa Margarita was arrested by Orange 
County sheriff's deputies Saturday after criminologists had completed extensive 
tests of the suspect's blood and a saliva sample taken from a bite wound on the 
arm of the victim, Jennifer Ji, 25, of Mission Viejo, said Ronald Cafferty, a 
deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Ji was repeatedly stabbed. Her body was discovered by Tseng Jyi Peng, 50, Ji's 
lover and the father of her 5-month-old son, Kevin, who had been suffocated in 
his crib. The bodies were found at the Vista Del Lago Apartments on Aug. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Tseng Peng, a Rancho Santa Margarita resident, is chief executive officer of 
San Diego-based Ranger Communications, one of the world's biggest manufacturers 
of citizens' band radios with factories in Taiwan, Malaysia and China. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Lisa Peng denied knowing about the deaths or that her husband had 
been having an affair with Ji, Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she was first interviewed by sheriff's investigators, she told them she 
didn't do it," Cafferty said. "She also told investigators she didn't know (her 
husband) had a girlfriend or had fathered a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy revealed that Ji, a 5-foot-7, 122-pound woman, died of 18 stab 
wounds, Cafferty said, adding that the woman's son died after a blanket was 
stuffed into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a bite mark on Ji's left arm that became the focus of the sheriff's 
investigation. Cafferty said Sheriff's Department criminologists swabbed the 
wound and retrieved saliva samples that matched Peng's DNA taken from her 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the basic material of life and contains an 
individual's genetic code. So-called genetic fingerprinting is used by 
prosecutors and investigators to link a suspect with a crime when witness 
testimony and other evidence are not strong enough. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the killings, sheriff's deputies believed the killings were 
committed by someone the woman knew because there were no signs of forced entry 
to the two-bedroom apartment near Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 After the grisly discoveries, deputies had interviewed both Peng and her 
husband. The couple had been in Taiwan just before the murders. Lisa Peng had 
returned to Orange County on Aug. 15, three days before the slayings, and her 
husband came back on the day Ji and the child died. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's husband called police after he found the victim's bloody body sprawled 
on a living room couch about midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators initially had suspected both Pengs.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cafferty said the husband had an "iron-clad" alibi because he was in 
Taiwan at the time of the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, witnesses at Ji's apartment complex told investigators that they 
had heard noises coming from her apartment about midday. Lisa Peng told 
investigators that she could not have committed the murders because she was 
having lunch with one of her two children at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Further investigation revealed that the killings were committed later, because 
Ji had called Peng in Taiwan in the afternoon, according to telephone records, 
Cafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng was arrested after she and her husband agreed to come in for further 
questions by investigators on Saturday. Both drove to the sheriff's office, and 
after the interview she was taken into custody without incident, Cafferty said. 
She was being held in the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's arraignment is scheduled for today in Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel. 
Her husband could not be reached for comment Monday either at his office or 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are expected to file murder charges and additional charges of 
special circumstances because it was a double homicide. If Peng is found 
guilty, the added charge could result in the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will decide on whether to seek the death penalty at a later date," 
Cafferty said. "I have a lot of things to look over, but if the penalty is 
justified, we will be adding it before the case gets to Superior Court."

 After burning his hand on an iron, David's mother, Carolina Rodriguez, tried 
to treat the wound with home remedies but nothing stopped the pain, she said. 
Because she doesn't have health insurance and can't afford to pay hospital 
bills, she couldn't take her son to see a doctor and waited until the clinic 
opened to have him treated for free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rodriguezes are among families in the neediest parts of town who don't 
have health insurance and seek help at nearby schools. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials from Las Lomas and Las Positas elementary schools and 
Imperial Middle SchoolQ said the clinic almost didn't open. Last year, they 
sought a state grant to build the clinic but were turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Friendly Hills HealthCare Foundation, which had initially offered to pay 
for a nurse to staff the school's clinic, decided to pay for everything as part 
of its first community project since converting into a nonprofit organization 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The new clinic, Friends of Children Health Center, offers medical care for all 
kinds of illnesses and injuries and preventive care to the city's youths from 
low-income, uninsured families. 
</P>
<P>
 Services cost from $2 to $20, depending on the patient's family income, but 
most will be treated for free, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which cost $150,000 to build, equip and staff, will continue to be 
funded by the foundation, said Gloria Mayer, president and chief operating 
officer of Friendly Hills HealthCare Network. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to increase health care for the whole community with this clinic," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Lomas Principal Mary Jo Anderson, whose school offered medical services 
through a St. Jude mobile health clinic in the mornings one day a week last 
year, said the new clinic will boost school attendance because children can get 
medical attention sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to come and line up at 6 in the morning last year to see the 
nurse in the mobile unit, and many had to be turned away because it was on a 
first-come, first-served basis," she said. "Now children will get taken care of 
before their illnesses become chronic, and they can come back to school faster. 
That will increase learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayer said the new clinic will take up to 16 appointments a day, Monday 
through Friday, and is planning to offer parenting classes and health fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven-year-old Virginia Ruelas, the clinic's first patient, was given an 
antibiotic for an infection in her mouth and cream for her palms, which were 
peeling from an allergic reaction, Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia's mother, Josefina Ruelas, said she will now bring her to the clinic 
for periodical checkups. "It's too expensive to take her to the doctors, and we 
don't have any insurance," she said in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "This clinic is really close to home," said Norma Hernandez, who brought her 
10-month-old baby for a checkup. "It really helps."MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY'S MOBILE HOME PARK PLAN RAISES IRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and the owners of Treasure Island Mobile Home Park say they plan to 
criticize recommendations to close the park by City Manager Kenneth C. Frank at 
a special meeting of the City Council tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regard it as a total sellout of the moral position that the city has 
taken," said K.P. Rice, president of the Treasure Island Residents and Owners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like it, and we don't think it'll fly," said Richard Hall, a Costa 
Mesa businessman and partner in the park's ownership. "This will end up in 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting is the latest installment in a nearly two-year process 
involving the city, the park's owners and its residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, the City Council approved a conditional use permit that requires 
the park's owners to compensate residents who are forced to relocate because of 
the park's closure. Negotiations over that compensation plan began in September 
when Hall and his partners notified the city that they planned to close the 
park and develop the 29-acre, oceanfront parcel at the city's south end. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and the firm of Merrill Lynch Hubbard are partners in the investment 
group Treasure Island Associates, which bought the prime property in 1989 for 
$43 million. Although no plans have been drawn up, Hall said, he and his 
partners envision developing it for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have said they plan to close the park in the next two years but 
have not given a definite date. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the recommendations that City Manager Frank will present to the council 
tonight are four options that the park's owners could choose from: 
</P>
<P>
 * Allow mobile home owners to keep their residences in the park for 10 years 
with no relocation benefits provided. 
</P>
<P>
 * Relocate mobile homes, at the park owner's expense, to other parks deemed 
suitable by the city with no further relocation benefits required. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find a comparable replacement mobile home at another park at the park 
owner's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay a portion of the appraised fair market value, based on a sliding scale, 
for the resident's mobile home if it must be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, president of the residents' group, complained that the city manager's 
proposals give all the power to the park's owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents would consider unacceptable a relocation to another mobile home 
park, which would not have the scenic location and amenities of their current 
homes, Rice said. He also objected to a provision in the proposed agreement 
that would allow residents to sell their mobile homes to Treasure Island for a 
maximum of $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not help residents deal with their loss," Rice said. "We look forward 
to a council position that will restore the balance and treat both sides 
fairly." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall likewise objected to the proposals. He said they exceed state 
requirements for "reasonable costs of relocation." He also protested that the 
agreement would require his partnership to reimburse mobile home owners who do 
not live in the park, or who only vacation there. 
</P>
<P>
 The council considered similar proposals on Nov. 3 but postponed action to 
allow the city and the park owner an opportunity to negotiate an agreement. 
However, meetings among the three parties and a mediator were not 
successful.RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; BOARD TO DISCUSS PLAN FOR ARMORY SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider today a resolution that would put 
Orange County at the forefront of a statewide effort to keep National Guard 
armories open to shelter the homeless in winter months. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution, sponsored by the county's Homeless Issues Advisory Committee, 
would call on Gov. Pete Wilson to reconsider his decision to shut down the 
6-year-old armory program next year for budget reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution additionally calls on Orange County cities and the 18 other 
California counties involved in the program to adopt a similar position. Maria 
Mendoza, the county's homeless issues coordinator, has also met with her 
counterparts statewide to gather support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're prepared to take the lead on this," Mendoza said. "If it's just Orange 
County voicing opposition, (the state) might say 'Thank you very much' and 
'Goodby.' But if it's a coalition, it might make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's two armories, in Fullerton and Santa Ana, sheltered 20,721 
people last winter, and the facilities have housed capacity crowds during the 
current cold season, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 More than just a dry cot and a roof over their heads, the shelters each year 
become impromptu centers for services. Secondhand clothes are distributed, AIDS 
tests and counseling are provided, and warm meals are given for the 250 people 
taken in each night. 
</P>
<P>
 Without that refuge, Mendoza said, Orange County would have a difficult time 
keeping its increasing number of homeless people healthy when temperatures 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not to sound morbid, but somebody is going to have to step over sick and dead 
people in the streets before people realize the need for shelters," Mendoza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that there are between 10,000 and 12,000 homeless people in 
Orange County -- as many as half of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County was among the first counties when former Gov. George Deukmejian 
in 1987 opened the armories to local homeless assistance groups on nights when 
temperatures dipped into the low 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson this year notified participating counties that the shelters would not 
be available next year. The cost of maintenance and the general disrepair of 
some of the facilities were cited as reasons. GEOFF BOUCHER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; 2 CRITICALLY INJURED IN 3-CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were in critical condition after one of them drove into oncoming 
traffic on Carbon Canyon Road on Monday morning and collided with two other 
vehicles, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers closed both sides of the road between Olinda Drive and the border of 
San Bernardino County for three hours while workers cleared the 8 a.m. 
collision.The accident backed up westbound traffic for several miles as 
commuters sought alternate routes into Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Francisco Rodriguez, 44, of Chino Hills was eastbound when he crossed 
into the westbound lane near Olinda Drive, Sgt. Jon Strash said, adding that 
officers are checking to see if Rodriguez's driving was affected by a diabetic 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez collided with a van driven by 49-year-old Restituto Tamag and a car 
driven by 33-year-old John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Rodriguez were flown to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where they 
were listed in critical condition, Strash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams' two children, a 5-year-old and a 7-year-old, were taken to Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana with unspecified injuries. Tamag was uninjured, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims are all from Chino Hills, Strash said.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SUPPORT GROUP HELPS TEEN-AGE MOTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Anna Salazar got pregnant in the ninth grade, it seemed her freedom and 
any hopes of an education vanished. At least that's what everyone told her. 
</P>
<P>
 "People told me when I got pregnant that I wouldn't have a life any more. That 
my boyfriend would go on with his life and I would be saddled with the baby," 
she said. "I wasn't sure if I would even finish high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, 17 years later, Salazar's daughter is finishing high school -- as did her 
mother before her. 
</P>
<P>
 And Salazar is making sure that other teen-age mothers aren't hearing the same 
discouraging words hurled at her so many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a facilitator for a support group in a program called Young Moms, Salazar 
encourages teen mothers to continue fighting for their futures, finish school 
and make sure they don't become mothers again until their lives are on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see my role as a cheerleader, someone standing on the sidelines saying, 
'Come on, you can make it!' ," said Salazar, 32, of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The Young Moms program is overseen by Friends of the Family, a nonprofit 
counseling and education center that works to strengthen families. The program 
is holding a training weekend beginning Jan. 21 for new facilitators. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers who have been teen-age mothers are being sought to help guide and 
support young women now facing new motherhood, said Regina Law, project 
coordinator and a former teen-age mom herself. 
</P>
<P>
 The program needs volunteers between the ages of 22 and 40, who are good role 
models and can donate about six hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The volunteers are the heartbeat of the program," Law said. "The girls are 
able to relate and receive information from people who have gone through what 
they're going through." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which begins in the last trimester of pregnancy and lasts until 
the child is 2 years old, also offers assertiveness training and child 
development instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls that come to the group are very eager to be a good mom," said 
Salazar. "Sometimes they hear from older women that they're not doing a good 
job. It chips away at their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let them know they are doing a good job and when they're not, the girls 
will let each other know," she said. "Sometimes they feel all alone and when 
they see other girls going through the same thing, it helps them realize 
they're not alone and they can make it." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the program or the three-day training session beginning 
Jan. 21, call Friends of the Family's Van Nuys office at (818) 988-4430.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; GIRL WINS 3RD PLACE IN SAFETY POSTER CONTEST 
</P>

<P>
 Elana Rachel Azose wasn't exactly surprised when her poster won third place 
for her age group in a national art contest to promote driving safety. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the 13-year-old student at Portola Highly Gifted Magnet School has 
been an enthusiastic artist since she started finger-painting at the age of 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, she has won numerous school-based art contests and impressed her 
teachers and peers with her colorful renderings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been framing her artwork since she was little," said Elana's mother, 
Eileen Azose. "She used to do such intricate designs in nursery school that I 
would carry them in my wallet." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Elana found out that nearly 100,000 copies of her poster would be 
distributed to schools and safety specialists throughout the Southland, she was 
thrilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really neat to see people looking at my work and enjoying it," Elana 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elana's poster was chosen by the Automobile Club of Southern California out of 
more than 70,000 entries in the 1993 American Automobile Assn.'s 50th annual 
National Traffic Safety Poster Program Contest.  
</P>
<P>
 The bright, detailed drawing, which Elana completed in a week using pastel 
markers, warns drivers to use caution in bad weather. From the perspective of a 
driver behind the wheel, which Elana drew by sitting in her mother's car in the 
garage, drivers are warned by yellow caution signs to go slow, be alert and use 
their headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Elana, who sketches and draws whenever she has spare time, said she would like 
to be a fashion designer one day. "Art is just what I do," she said. "It's like 
I can look at a blank piece of paper and I can just see what to draw." SUSAN

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; CENTER HELPS DYSLEXICS 
CLEAR AWAY OBSTACLES

 On the wall in a tiny Studio City classroom is a handwritten sign in carefully 
formed block letters: "Learning to read, at any age, is the most precious gift 
in the world."  
</P>
<P>
 For 20 adults who come to the classroom at the Ryan Dyslexia Center twice a 
week, written language had been a jumble of nonsensical letters. But slowly, 
the letters are forming words, and words are forming sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 The adults are in a literacy program co-sponsored by the Orton Dyslexia 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Dyslexics can be of above-average or superior intelligence but have difficulty 
learning, retaining and expressing information, according to the Orton society. 
Symptoms of dyslexia may include poor organizational skills, inability to 
recall numbers in proper sequences and difficulty learning an alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to see it a lot -- a lot -- of times before I get it," said Diana 
Hall, 47, of Canoga Park. "You can't just tell me. You have to give me an 
example and I gradually get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall tore down and rebuilt words with her classmates on a recent Monday. 
Students watched a videotaped class as two volunteer instructors paused the 
tape to answer questions or discuss rules of spelling. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheery blond woman with a hint of the South in her speech drilled students 
from the television screen on types of suffixes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vowel suffix!" Lawrence Cane Jr. bellowed as the suffix "-ing" flashed on the 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cane, improving his reading boosts his construction business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps me fill out my contracts, write out receipts," said the 31-year-old 
from Atwater Village. "It makes me feel more confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Cane and his classmates are excited about learning, said volunteer instructor 
Rhea Walco, a teaching assistant for special education classes in the L.A. 
Unified School District. "The motivation is totally there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the students are so motivated may be a role model they see each 
week. Valeri Lisa Cirino, who drives from Oxnard to help teach the Monday 
class, is dyslexic.  
</P>
<P>
 Cirino, 32, remembers a high school counselor's admonition that she wasn't 
"college material." She took it as a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 In junior college, testing revealed that she is dyslexic and intellectually 
gifted. Years of doubting herself were over. A world of education opened up 
with new learning methods. 
</P>
<P>
 It still wasn't easy. She spent eight years in junior college before being 
accepted to UCLA. Now a graduate with a psychology degree, she wants to 
encourage others with learning differences and educate the public about a very 
misunderstood group of people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to know that dyslexics are creative and intelligent people," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The photos of dyslexics hanging on the office wall are testaments to that. 
Whoopi Goldberg, Nelson Rockefeller and Bruce Jenner are among the dyslexic 15% 
of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Dottie Zediker, 51, attends the twice-weekly classes faithfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to it because I learn so much," said the Sunland resident. 
"It's a gift to myself. It's just a wonderful thing to look at something and be 
able to figure it out." 
</P>
<P>

 Other volunteering opportunities:  
</P>

 The Retired Senior Volunteer Program needs volunteers 55 or older to help in 
school libraries, to serve as teacher aides and tutors. Call Panorama

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; ENVIRONMENT GROUP SUES BATTERY FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By E.J. GONG JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An environmental group has accused huge battery-maker Delco Remy of failing to 
sufficiently inform the public about hazardous lead emissions at its Anaheim 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 California Earth Corps filed a lawsuit last week in Orange County Superior 
Court alleging that the Delco division of General Motors, which uses lead to 
make automotive batteries, has violated the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic 
Enforcement Act of 1986.The act requires companies to notify workers and 
residents about toxic emissions from operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer representing California Earth Corps said the battery plant at 1201 N. 
Magnolia Ave. emits nearly 300 pounds of lead annually into the air, and has 
failed to adequately warn people about the dangers. Lead exposure, according to 
state and federal studies, can cause cancer, birth defects, learning 
disabilities in children and adult reproductive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Michael Freund said the lawsuit seeks a reduction in the plant's lead 
output and better warnings to the public, as well as civil penalties. He said 
Delco representatives have been receptive to making changes and are involved in 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Delco spokesman Al Wichmann would not comment on the lawsuit but said his 
company has complied with all federal, state and local regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been a member of the Anaheim community for nearly 40 years, and we've 
been a good neighbor to all the people," Wichmann said. E.J. GONG JR.

 Monday morning's rush hour on the Riverside Freeway was slowed by a lane 
closure as California Department of Transportation workers finished cleaning up 
500 pounds of sewage sludge that had spilled from a truck the previous night, 
the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>

 CHP officers had closed all eastbound lanes between Magnolia Avenue and 
Brookhurst Road from 10 p.m. until 2 a.m. because of the spill at 9:20 p.m. 
Sunday.Traffic had been diverted to the southbound Santa Ana Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 By about 7 a.m., morning commuters were allowed back on the Riverside Freeway 
and only the No. 3 lane remained closed. It was reopened about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill occurred when the back gate on the truck, carrying waste from a 
sewage treatment plant in Carson to a farming company in Yuma, dropped open as 
the truck traveled east on the freeway near Magnolia Avenue, Officer Denise 
Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck pulled to the shoulder and stopped near the Brookhurst Road exit, 
Quesada said. 
</P>
<P>
 The thick oily gunk, which spilled over half a mile of freeway, caused six 
minor accidents as cars slid to the sides of the road or rear-ended each other. 
There were no major injuries, Quesada said. By midday, only the "fragrance" of 
the spill remained, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It smelled bad last night, but I'm sure it will get worse as the temperatures 
heat up," she said.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; HOME CHILD-CARE CENTER WINS OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A child-care center proposed for one of a small cluster of houses along 
Ventura Boulevard won conditional approval Monday from a Los Angeles zoning 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning administrator Albert Landini said conditions governing the center's 
hours of operation, total number of clients and other details would be included 
in a written report to be released next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two dozen residents and an aide to City Councilman Marvin Braude spoke 
in favor of the project, which will provide day care, art and computer lessons 
and other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that is just going to have a very positive impact on the 
kids," said Dotti Russell, who with her husband, Graham, will run the center at 
the intersection of Ventura Boulevard and Garden Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is considered sensitive by city planners because it is the only spot 
on 17-mile Ventura Boulevard that has residential structures. Critics worry 
that allowing a commercial operation such as child care would set a precedent 
for converting the other houses to commercial use. But Cindy Miscicowksi, 
planning deputy to Braude, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that fits in with the neighborhood as a whole," she said. 
"It is not the first step of opening this area to future commercial inroads." 
</P>
<P>
 No one spoke against the project, but a representative of a local homeowner 
group asked that conditions be imposed on its hours, size and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been very protective of land use and zoning in this community," said 
Irma Dobbyn of the Tarzana Property Owners Assn. "We're concerned with the 
long-term picture." SCOTT GLOVER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; COUNCIL MAY REVISE EMERGENCY PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The flames of early November narrowly missed Westlake Village, but the brush 
fires have prompted city leaders to look again at how well prepared they are 
for an emergency caused by fires, floods or earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Westlake Village City Council discussed ways to strengthen the 
city's response plans to natural disasters.The discussion was part of a session 
Friday to develop overall goals for the city in 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 The council discussed drafting a new version of its current disaster plan, 
which explains how to set up emergency communications networks. City Councilman 
Ken Rufener said that the plan as currently written is highly technical and 
might be difficult to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides clarifying the plan, the council also hopes to expand it, he said. For 
example, a new plan might include requirements that brush be cleared from 
around homes. Also included might be plans to recruit and train volunteer arson 
patrols for periods when fire danger is high, Rufener said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides reworking the disaster plans, the council considered launching an 
effort to keep the city's new county library branch open and expanding the 
economic development committee to include smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufener suggested that the council consider putting traffic lights on Agoura 
Road and Lindero Canyon Road. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: LAS VIRGENES; HOMEOWNERS GROUP GETS NEW PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new president of the Las Virgenes Homeowners Federation said she will 
continue the organization's opposition to large developments proposed by Soka 
University and Ahmanson Ranch, as well as guide the umbrella group toward 
addressing fire safety and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Michele Herdzina, who became federation president Jan. 1 after serving as vice 
president last year, said she expects to "maintain the status quo of opinions" 
expressed by the organization during the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people moved to this area for the mountains and the rural atmosphere," 
Herdzina said in an interview. "So that will continue to be our main goal: 
trying to preserve more open space." 
</P>
<P>
 Herdzina said much of the federation's attention early this year will be 
focused on the work of a committee established after the Calabasas-Malibu blaze 
to study fire-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people around here are horse owners, have children in schools and 
live in hillside areas," Herdzina said. "They want to have a say in policies 
about how they get onto their properties during a fire and other things." 
</P>
<P>
 The federation was formed in the mid-1960s, before the incorporation of Agoura 
Hills, Westlake Village and Calabasas, as a quasi-government for homeowners who 
felt distant from decision-making in Los Angeles. The federation represents 20 
homeowner associations, with an estimated 25,000 members. The president of the 
federation directs the organization's monthly meetings, writes letters on 
behalf of the group to local, state and federal officials and often speaks at 
government hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Herdzina, a data processor for an insurance firm in Warner Center, said she 
expects to spend one year as head of the federation. She replaces Les Hardie, 
who served three years as president. KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; RESTAURANT GETS DANCE HALL PERMIT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Commission has approved a dance hall permit for El 
Senda restaurant, formerly a Russian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 West Valley vice officers requested that the commission approve the permit 
with some conditions, including a requirement that El Senda's owners keep music 
volume low enough so that dance tunes cannot be heard outside the building, and 
that they keep the building clear of graffiti and litter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's adjacent to residents there," said West Valley Vice Sgt. Gene Leary. 
"Noise is the main issue. If people hear the music, they will be calling 
police." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission took police concerns under consideration at a meeting Dec. 21 
and subsequently imposed noise limits on El Senda, which is on the corner of 
Sherman Way and Corbin Avenue, said Patrick Ehrich, investigator with the 
Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's owners, listed in commission documents as Sherman Kuenfat Yu 
and Teresa Siu King Wong, could not be reached for comment. JILL LEOVY

 Call it Orange County's other Richard Nixon museum. 
</P>
<P>
 It can't match the size and notoriety of Yorba Linda's Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace, but San Clemente's one-room exhibition does offer visitors plenty 
of information about the 37th President. 
</P>
<P>
 The President Richard Nixon Room is part of the Spanish Village Historical 
Center, in the Casa Romantica mansion on Avenida Granada. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is filled with newspaper articles, photos, political memorabilia and 
personal items that focus on Nixon's 10 years as a resident of San Clemente. 
From 1970 to 1980, his ocean-side home was known as the Western White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The display includes pictures of famous world leaders who met Nixon in San 
Clemente as well as many books authored by the former President. 
</P>
<P>
 The historical center, at 415 Avenida Granada, is open Tuesdays and Thursdays 
from 1 to 4 p.m. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY MAY DECIDE TO LAY OFF 70 EMPLOYEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight will vote on a proposal to lay off 70 municipal 
workers in an effort to close a $4.5-million budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the cuts are necessary to make up for tax and development 
fee revenues that fell short of projections. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. proposed laying off 64 full-time workers and up 
to six part-time workers from departments throughout the city. Ten managers are 
among the targeted employees. Six of the managers would lose their jobs under 
the plan, while the remaining four would be offered lower-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant position of director of administrative services would also be 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has cut more than 100 jobs over the past three years at a savings of 
$12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have expressed support for the layoffs. They said the 
cuts are the best way to close the budget shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the council voted to lay off six workers when a similar shortfall 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the latest round of cuts is approved, the layoffs will be based in part on 
seniority. Veteran employees whose jobs are eliminated might be offered other 
jobs, forcing the layoffs of fewer senior employees.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; POLICE CHIEF TELLS OF SORROW TIED TO JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After just a week as Los Alamitos' police chief, Michael J. Skogh feels that 
he has already attended too many police funerals. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first official act Jan. 3, Skogh attended the funeral of Manhattan 
Beach Police Officer Martin L. Ganz, who was killed Dec. 28 during a traffic 
stop by a still unidentified gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral was particularly painful for Skogh, a captain with the Manhattan 
Beach Police Department before he became police chief here, because Ganz was 
under his command for more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the first officer I lost in the line of duty in all the departments 
I've worked with," said Skogh, 48, who has served in law enforcement posts for 
the past 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The day Ganz was shot, Skogh attended another funeral -- this one for Los 
Alamitos Police Lt. Lyell Duane Swearingen, who died of a heart attack Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths cruelly coincided with Skogh's first days on the job and have taken 
"a lot out of the joy and happiness" of becoming a police chief, Skogh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very tragic, professionally and personally," said Skogh, a longtime 
Orange County resident who was picked to head the 31-member Los Alamitos police 
force last year after a six-month search. The city's former police chief, James 
Guess, retired in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But Skogh said the deaths of Ganz and Swearingen also somehow brought into 
focus his priorities as police chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Skogh said he believes there is a need to review police training and 
practices, including how police officers maintain physical and mental fitness, 
although he said he does not expect "dramatic changes." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always things that we can do better," said Skogh, who holds a 
degree in criminal justice from Cal State Fullerton and is a 1989 graduate of 
the state Police Officers Standards and Training Command College. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Robert C. Dunek said the tragic events may also provide Skogh 
with an opportunity to show his leadership to the department and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique situation and challenge," said Dunek, who was a La Palma police 
officer for more than five years before he became an administrator. "He can 
provide the stabilizing leadership and pull everyone together." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council picked Skogh last year over Police Cmdr. Gary Biggerstaff, 
who has served with the Los Alamitos police for more than 20 years and was 
acting police chief after Guess' retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Skogh said he plans to "personally speak with each employee. The key is 
listening to what people tell me." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the city's continuing budgetary problems, Skogh said, the community 
must be more involved in law enforcement. Programs with neighboring cities must 
be maintained or expanded, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a strong supporter of regional activities and sharing of resources," said 
Skogh, who was administrative assistant to the chief of the Azusa Police 
Department before he joined the Manhattan Beach force in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Skogh, a native of Detroit, moved to Orange County in the 1950s and graduated 
from Garden Grove High School in 1963. He is married and has two teen-age 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still remember the joy when I made my first arrest," Skogh said. "If I 
don't stop remembering, I'll be OK." BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; NEW CITY SCULPTURE TO BE UNVEILED JAN. 20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southland artist who sculpted Laguna Beach's well-known wooden "greeter" 
has now created a larger-than-life bronze sculpture of a man and a woman for 
display at the Civic Center here. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture will be unveiled at a civic ceremony scheduled for Jan. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Guy Angelo Wilson said the work, titled "Union Passage," celebrates the 
richness of diversity and the establishment of connections among people. 
</P>
<P>
 The bronze sculpture, with granite pedestals, stands 11 1/2 feet tall, and the 
entire installation is 33 feet long and 12 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation has two granite monoliths at each end that visitors can use 
as benches to view the work after passing through an archway formed by the 
couple's clasped arms. Each monolith is inscribed with a passage that Wilson 
has written to describe his work: 
</P>
<P>
 When the day ends, another begins, struggle turns to dance  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere beneath the union of our difference  
</P>
<P>
 Lies a passage to transcend ourselves. The verses are also etched in Braille, 
and the archway is accessible to wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, 35, a Los Angeles-based artist who lives in Diamond Bar, said his work 
is a metaphor that is open to various interpretations. Some may see the figures 
as representing winter and spring, and the union of prayer with answer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed from one end of the installation, the male figure in the sculpture 
appears to be supporting the female, he said, but from the other end, the 
female appears to be offering her strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "With public sculpture, the work may not be in agreement with everyone, but I 
hope that it will be meaningful to the community," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also sculpted a work that stands in Brea and created the wooden "Laguna 
Greeter" that welcomes visitors to downtown Laguna Beach, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Union Passage" sculpture in Garden Grove, located between two pine trees 
at a corner of Civic Center Drive near Euclid Street and Acacia Parkway, cost 
about $68,000 and was financed by developer fees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second sculpture to be displayed in the city's Arts in Public Places 
program. The city's first outdoor art object, "We the People," commemorates the 
bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution. It stands near Garden Grove and Harbor 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Rietzel, manager of the city's community services department, who has 
worked as a liaison on the project with Wilson for nearly three years, said the 
sculpture is "very pretty and very striking. It's something you can find in the 
better museums in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts in Public Places program was started by the City Council in an effort 
to enhance the quality of life and cultural experience in the city, Rietzel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedication and unveiling of the work is scheduled Jan. 20 at noon. A limited 
number of posters that depict the sculpture will be handed out to people in 
attendance.ROBERT BARKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CHAMBER'S SCHLATTER TO QUIT IN MARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 27 years of service, the general manager of the Glendale Chamber of 
Commerce has announced he will resign from his post in March, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expected to stay this long," Aulden Schlatter said Monday. "The years 
fly by." 
</P>
<P>
 The 67-year-old Glendale resident, who played a role in planning the Glendale 
Galleria and worked to bring economic development to what had been a sleepy 
suburb, submitted his resignation last week during a meeting of the chamber's 
eight-member executive council. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of his years with the chamber have been positive ones, Schlatter 
said, he decided to leave after facing decision-making clashes with chamber 
board members last year. Schlatter said he realized that the 1,700-member group 
could use fresh leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some things that I didn't feel that they were listening to me 
about," Schlatter said. "And I just felt that rather than continuing the stress 
. . . I should make my departure at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Iowa, Schlatter said he plans to move to Palm Desert and do 
volunteer work in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really mad at anybody," he said. "I just wanted to get out of the 
situation and enjoy my life." 
</P>
<P>
 One key disappointment last year involved GlenFest, a May street festival that 
brought the chamber a loss of nearly $230,000, Schlatter said. He had supported 
the idea of a small, local event with amateur entertainers, but the chamber 
board opted for a large-scale production, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber board members conceded last July that the event was "a failure of 
major dimensions," according to a chamber task force report. Board members are 
expected to vote today on whether to hold the festival this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, chamber President Pat Liddell acknowledged that disagreements had 
existed between the board and Schlatter in the past but said he thought 
Schlatter would eventually retire -- and not resign -- from his position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about Aulden Schlatter," Liddell said. "He is the Glendale 
Chamber of Commerce. . . . If he were to say tomorrow, 'I would like to 
reconsider and come back,' great." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlatter, who left his family's farm in Iowa to pursue a career in business, 
was hired in March, 1967, to oversee operations at the Glendale chamber. He had 
earlier managed chambers of commerce in Harlan, Iowa; Richland, Wash., and 
Watsonville, Calif. TOMMY LI

 Residents angered over two proposals to convert equestrian land to housing 
complexes have reached tentative accords with a Bel-Air developer. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Mark Armbruster, would be able to construct 67 attached homes 
on Foothill Boulevard near Glenoaks Boulevard, and 33 single-family homes on 
Dronfield Avenue if the agreements hold, according to both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Equestrians had vehemently opposed both developments in earlier forms, but 
after a series of meetings both sides have given ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbruster has cut the number of homes in both projects, restricted some 
heights and made other changes to allay fears that dense residential complexes 
will damage the area's suburban, equestrian appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if he does what he says he will, it will turn out OK," said Harley 
Booten, whose horse-boarding facility abuts Armbruster's Dronfield Avenue 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbruster said he has compromised as much as he can. "I've been working on 
proposals for people for a long time," he said. "I'm not happy in a firestorm. 
I'm much happier when we can reach a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dronfield project would have comprised 36 multistory units on small lots, 
a much denser zoning than the existing regulations, which also permit horse 
facilities. Although he still needs the same zoning change, Armbruster said he 
will cut out three units, add a horse trail as a buffer, and construct a common 
horse stable for the complex. The project fronts on Dronfield Avenue between 
Taylor and Bledsoe streets. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Foothill Boulevard project, Armbruster reduced the height to calm 
fears that the homes would tower over neighboring houses and infringe on 
residents' privacy. As a result, Armbruster cut the number of housing units 
from 86 to 67. The project would be built on the former site of Cacho's 
Nursery.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Planning Commission will weigh the revised Foothill Boulevard 
proposal at its Jan. 27 meeting in the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club and has 
tentatively slated the Dronfield Avenue project for a February meeting.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PAROLEES WILL FIELD CRIME QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What makes a burglar target a particular home or business? Are muscular people 
less likely to get robbed than frail people? And just how effective are car 
alarms? 
</P>
<P>
 When in doubt, ask an ex-con. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the advice of police, who say Van Nuys residents can do just that at a 
question-and-answer session with parolees on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. in the roll 
call room of the Van Nuys police station at 6240 Sylmar Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Lead Officer Jean Green, who is bringing the parolees in from a local 
halfway house, said the workshop should clear up misconceptions about personal, 
home and vehicle security. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, the question that comes first to us is, 'What makes a criminal 
choose me rather than somebody else?' " said Green. "A lot of citizens are 
under the misconception that the bigger they are, the less likely they are 
going to get robbed. They think that frail people are more likely targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the case," she pointed out. "Usually, the ones that don't get 
robbed are the ones that are alert. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of questions come up like that," Green said. "The parolees kind of 
straighten them out." JEFF SCHNAUFER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; BOMB MAKER GIVEN 5-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A reputed white supremacist was sentenced Monday to five years in prison for 
manufacturing pipe bombs in his home, reportedly to assault Latino and black 
drug dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Lord Jeffrey, 21, who was convicted in October of conspiracy to possess 
unlawful firearms, declined several invitations from U.S. District Judge Gary 
L. Taylor to stand up and speak in his own defense before he was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing swirls on, and the party that's most affected by everything 
doesn't say a word," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, federal agents acting on a tip raided Jeffrey's house on the 1300 
block of South Poplar Street in Santa Ana and seized 14 homemade devices. 
Agents also found materials believed connected to the white supremacy movement 
and satanic worship, according to federal court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Federal Public Defender Leon Peterson told the court that his 
client's motives for making explosives were misunderstood, but he didn't 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said Jeffrey's neighbors have stated he was known for having friends 
of various ethnic groups. "Their opinion of him is that he's a fine person," 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Stephen G. Wolfe was satisfied with the sentence, saying 
"five years is a long time for a 21-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey has had past legal troubles, having violated his parole from a May, 
1991, conviction in Fresno for vehicle theft and drunk driving, federal 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Jeffrey was sentenced to two years in prison and was released on 
parole in July, 1992, according to the state Department of Corrections. He 
returned to prison three months later for a parole violation, but resumed his 
parole in less than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 An informant told police about Jeffrey last July, court documents indicate, 
leading police to his home, where they reported finding 14 bombs made of metal 
pipes, gunpowder and pieces of cannon fuse in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Papers describing terrorist acts were in the room, according to an affidavit, 
and agents found other items including satanic bibles, pornographic satanic 
comic books and black dolls hanged by nooses and labeled "hang me." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey's mother, Yvonne Jeffrey, has maintained that her son does not hate 
minorities and is himself part Latino and Native American. She has said that 
the swastika and the letters WP -- an acronym for "white power" -- tattooed on 
her son's chest are only body art. ALICIA DI RADO

<P>
 A Panorama City man who fatally shot a motorist during an apparent robbery 
attempt was sentenced Monday to nearly 24 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Whicker, 21, pleaded no contest to voluntary manslaughter in the death 
of Ronnie Vasquez, a 24-year-old Van Nuys man who was gunned down Aug. 3, 1992, 
as he left his job at a grocery warehouse on Parthenia Street in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Whicker, who was armed with a .25-caliber handgun, approached 
Vasquez's car, where a struggle ensued, according to Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie 
Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez was able to disarm the assailant. He gave the weapon to an onlooker, 
but Whicker was able to get it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Whicker again approached Vasquez's Cadillac and fired two shots through the 
driver's window and then several more as the car drove away, Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant was either after the car or the (wheel) rims," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez's passenger, Jose Morales, was not injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Leon T. Kaplan sentenced Whicker to 23 years and 
8 months in prison as part of a plea agreement between the defendant and 
prosecutors. THOM MROZEK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; LAPD'S VALLEY CHIEF TO ADDRESS RESIDENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Martin Pomeroy is scheduled to 
speak tonight at a meeting of the Studio City Residents Assn. The meeting marks 
the first time the San Fernando Valley's new top cop will address the residents 
group, which is the largest in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to introduce the new chief to Studio City and make him aware of some 
of the issues we are facing," association President Tony Lucente said. "We are 
really trying to strengthen our relationship with LAPD." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month the group launched a Partners Against Crime program, intended to 
increase cooperation with the North Hollywood Division that covers the area. 
Under the program, which is similar to many others around the Valley, residents 
will conduct foot patrols with walkie-talkies and report suspicious activity to 
police. In return, police will provide residents with crime updates at monthly 
association meetings as well as material for a special Crime Watch feature in 
the association's monthly newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomeroy plans to present his vision for continued community policing in the 
San Fernando Valley. A question-and-answer session with Pomeroy is also 
scheduled for the 8 p.m. meeting in the auditorium of Carpenter Avenue 
Elementary School, 3909 Carpenter Ave. SCOTT GLOVER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; REPUTED MEMBER OF GANG FATALLY SHOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An alleged gang member was fatally shot around midnight Monday as he was being 
driven away from a fight with rival gang members, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddieberto Felix, 18, of Santa Ana was in the parking lot of a Jack-In-The-Box 
restaurant at Edinger Avenue and Bristol Street when the group of men with whom 
he had been fighting opened fire, according to Lt. Bob Helton. 
</P>
<P>
 Felix ran away, flagged down a passing motorist and asked for help, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was being driven away, Felix leaned out the passenger window to look 
back at the assailants and was shot once in the head, Helton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver took Felix to the Healthcare Medical Center of Tustin, where he was 
dead on arrival, according to Helton, who said Felix was known to be a Santa 
Ana gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators didn't know what the fight was about and no suspects were in 
custody Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of the driver, who Helton said was not involved in the dispute, was 
withheld for his safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shooting happened at that corner of Edinger Avenue and Bristol Street 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Debbie Gonzalez, 23, died after a stray bullet fired during a gang 
confrontation hit her in head. A 17-year-old believed to be a gang member was 
arrested hours later on suspicion of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, who investigators said was not a gang member, had been standing with 
friends in the same parking lot of the Jack-In-The-Box when shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, standing on the other side of Edinger Avenue, allegedly had been 
aiming at a moving car but instead hit Gonzalez.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; MAN, 23, ARRESTED IN '92 DOUBLE SLAYING

 Sheriff's investigators have arrested a 23-year-old man in connection with a 
double slaying here in 1992, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Ervin Dennis, who has no permanent address, was arrested without 
incident in San Diego on Friday, according to a spokesman for the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and two other people allegedly broke into the home of Robert Klecker, 
40, the morning of Nov. 17. Klecker and Karen Stevens, 30, were both fatally 
shot in the head without any apparent sign of struggle, sheriff's officials 
said. Klecker's 14-year-old son discovered the bodies on the floor when he 
returned from school at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini said the break-in was drug-related. 
</P>
<P>
 A second suspect, who currently is serving an unrelated sentence in Texas, 
also has been linked to the slayings, Martini said. Marcus Edward Marsh, 23, 
will be extradited to California to face the same charges when he completes 
jail time in Texas. Martini said he did not know how long that would be. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sheriff's investigator Leo Vandor, two of Klecker's handguns 
stolen at the time of his death were recovered in Hanford, Calif., shortly 
after the killings. Dennis was selling them illegally on the street there, 
Vandor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department said the third suspect, whom they would not identify, 
is believed to have fled the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis and Marsh will be arraigned Wednesday.E.J. GONG JR.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; COCAINE SEIZED, 4 SUSPECTS ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police on Monday announced they had seized 73 pounds of cocaine with an 
estimated street value of $2.6 million -- some of it wrapped as Christmas 
presents -- and arrested four suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute were 
Anderson Castaneda, 35, of Glendale; Gabriel Garcia, 28, of Bell Gardens; and 
Juan Alcaraz, 22, and George Trevino, 26, both of Huntington Park, according to 
Glendale Police spokesman Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen. 
</P>
<P>
 All are scheduled to be arraigned today in Glendale Municipal Court, 
Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Castaneda had been under police surveillance for "behavior 
consistent with someone doing narcotic deals. Ironically, he lives pretty close 
to the police station. You can throw a rock from his apartment to the station." 
</P>
<P>
 Police obtained a warrant to search Castaneda's apartment on North Isabel 
Street on Friday. There officers found 51 pounds of cocaine and $200,000 in 
cash, some of which was also wrapped as Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said plastic bags holding the cocaine smelled of diesel fuel, leading 
them to believe that the drugs were smuggled into the area in fuel tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 After Castaneda's arrest, police went to a home in the 6000 block of Gage 
Avenue in Bell Gardens, where another 22 pounds of cocaine was found and three 
men were arrested. All four suspects were arrested without incident, Nicolaisen 
said. JULIO MORAN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY CLOSE TO LURING LARGE INSURANCE FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A deal that would bring the U.S. headquarters for a multinational insurance 
company to Burbank could be signed within days, a spokesman for the Allianz 
Insurance Co. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very, very close," said John Kozero, spokesman for the company, which 
has offices on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles as well as in Woodland Hills 
and Glendale. However, he said, "The deal is not yet final." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council offered Allianz -- which would bring 300 jobs 
with it -- a $250,000 tax rebate in exchange for moving to Burbank. Burbank 
lost 15,000 workers after Lockheed Corp. announced it was pulling its 
operations out of the city three years ago, and has been trying to woo Allianz 
and other companies ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax rebate, which would be spread out over nearly 10 years, is meant to 
help offset the cost of renting space in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozero said that an agreement to move all of the company's offices to a 
Riverside Drive location could be finalized by the end of the week. The company 
would sublease space from Sony Pictures Entertainment Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany-based Allianz is a subsidiary of Allianz A.G., one of the 50 largest 
public companies in the world and the largest insurance company in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Allianz deal is finalized, city officials expect another 
deal, which would move KIIS Radio from Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to Studio 
Plaza, to be approved. The station, which wants to move because of increasing 
crime in its neighborhood, was offered $50,000 by the City Council in November 
to help with relocation expenses. That offer was also made to help compensate 
for lower rental costs outside of Burbank, but unlike the Allianz deal it will 
not be paid as a tax rebate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just enough to put it over the top," said Jim O'Neil, special 
assistant to the Burbank community development director. KIIS would become the 
seventh radio station to broadcast from Burbank. It would bring about 60 
employees. ED BOND

AIRPORT OFFICIALS OPPOSE FAA RADAR PLAN; AVIATION: DIRECTOR AT JOHN WAYNE FEARS 
THAT MOVING EL TORO UNIT WILL HURT OPERATIONS. AGENCY DENIES IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite protests from John Wayne Airport officials, the Federal Aviation 
Administration has tentatively decided to move a radar now stationed at El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station to Camp Pendleton in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent letters to the FAA opposing the proposed move of the radar, John 
Wayne Airport Director Janice M. Mittermeier said she was concerned that 
reduced radar coverage could mean delays for local travelers because arrivals 
might have to be stretched over a longer period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 But FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell said that the airplanes will not have to be 
separated by any greater distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to move it to Camp Pendleton for the purpose of giving us better 
radar coverage," O'Donnell said in an interview last week. "It's not going to 
degrade the radar coverage for John Wayne Airport at all." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said that while the decision has been made to move the radar, the 
federal agency is conducting further studies that should validate the transfer, 
with a final decision expected in late March. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport spokeswoman Courtney Wiercioch said officials raised the 
questions to ensure that the issues are addressed as the FAA studies radar 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will defer to the FAA. If the FAA does not believe that the transfer of 
the radar will result in any transfer of service from here, that's their call 
to make," Wiercioch said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said the El Toro radar is a backup system to one now at Garden 
Grove, which provides principal radar coverage for aircraft arrivals at John 
Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the hills to the south of El Toro created problems and caused 
interference with radar coverage, O'Donnell said. But by moving the radar 
closer to the coastline at Camp Pendleton, the FAA will have a clearer view of 
air traffic along the coastline from John Wayne Airport to San Diego, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The move that's taking place is being done primarily for technical reasons. 
It has nothing to do with area coverage," O'Donnell said. "The Garden Grove 
radar has been, and will continue to be, the primary radar for John Wayne 
Airport. Nothing is going to change. . . . (The move is) going to provide us 
better service, better radar coverage along the coast." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to the forefront late last year, when the FAA asked for 
comments on its long-standing plan to shut down the Coast Terminal Radar 
Approach Control at El Toro, known as Coast TRACON, and consolidate it with 
Southern California TRACON in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Five Southern California regional air control facilities are being 
consolidated into one facility as part of the FAA's effort to better coordinate 
air traffic. Officials said they did not have figures on the total cost of the 
moves. 
</P>
<P>
 While Orange County did not object to the proposed TRACON move, local 
officials questioned the effect of also relocating the El Toro Airport 
Surveillance Radar, raising the concern that the current radar coverage of the 
Orange County airspace might be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the radar distance is increased from the airport, its resolution accuracy 
is reduced," Mittermeier said in a letter dated Nov. 4, 1993, to Richard R. 
Lien, the FAA's regional air traffic manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "An increased separation requirement could reduce the number of aircraft which 
could use the John Wayne Airport arrival airspace, particularly during peak 
operational periods, and produce air travel delays," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mittermeier's letter stated that if the radar's relocation also reduces the 
coverage for low altitudes, it could hurt the ability of departing aircraft to 
operate under community-imposed noise restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel strongly that any modification to (radar) coverage for John Wayne 
Airport should have no impact on the ability of the air carriers to perform 
(noise-abatement) operations," Mittermeier said in her letter. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Donnell discounted any suggested connection between the radar relocation 
and noise reduction procedures at the airport. "What's that got to do with it?" 
he asked. "We are reading problems into this move that do not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County officials also are worried that the radar's move could affect 
the airport's ability to increase operations at John Wayne, and perhaps also at 
El Toro, should local officials decide to convert part of the 4,700-acre base 
to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA began planning for the radar's move about two years ago, before the 
Defense Department scheduled the closure of the El Toro station by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 In a follow-up letter dated Nov. 15, 1993, Mittermeier suggested that the FAA 
delay the decision to move the radar until the county's future aviation needs 
are determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot wait for that decision to be made," O'Donnell said. "What we have 
to do now is improve our airspace plan without any degradation at all of the 
service provided at John Wayne Airport."

BANK ROBBER MAKES OFF WITH $2,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lone bandit walked into a downtown bank Monday, handed a teller a note 
demanding cash and made off with about $2,000, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandit entered Home Savings Bank at 620 N. Brand Blvd. at about 2:40 p.m., 
said Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen of the Glendale Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The man did not show a weapon and is believed to have approached a single 
teller window, Nicolaisen said. Nicolaisen said he did not know what the note 
said, but added that such notes typically imply the threat of a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber was last seen walking north out of the parking lot, and no vehicle 
was identified, Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandit is described as a Latino man about 40 years old with gray hair and 
beard, about 5 feet, 3 inches tall and weighing about 140 pounds. He was seen 
wearing a navy blue shirt and gray slacks, Nicolaisen said.

VASQUEZ HEADS OCTA; BIG PROJECTS LOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez on Monday was named chairman of the 
Orange County Transportation Authority, the $600-million-a-year agency that 
sets transit and highway priorities countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez succeeds San Juan Capistrano Councilman Gary L. Hausdorfer, who was 
OCTA's chairman for 18 months during a period of record spending on traffic 
improvements under Measure M, the half-cent sales tax approved by Orange County 
voters in November, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez was selected unanimously by the 10 other voting OCTA board members. La 
Habra Councilman William D. Mahoney was named vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman, Vasquez will preside over one of the biggest decisions OCTA will 
have to make this year -- whether to proceed with plans for a $2-billion, 
elevated urban rail line through central Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the OCTA meeting, Vasquez said he hopes to continue the agency's 
commitment to finish the $1.9-billion Santa Ana Freeway widening effort and 
other construction projects, as well as plan for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to speculate on OCTA's pending decision in April on whether to 
proceed with the elevated urban rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever decisions are made," said Vasquez, "they will be based on good 
information."

VALLEY INTERVIEW: IS THE CURTAIN GOING UP ON NORTH HOLLYWOOD'S RENAISSANCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hopes of North Hollywood boosters to see the dilapidated Lankershim 
Boulevard business district reborn as the NoHo arts district will get a big 
lift next month, when the Actors Alley Repertory Theatre stages its inaugural 
performance at El Portal, a onetime vaudeville house that most recently showed 
Spanish-language films before going dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Actors Alley, which has been putting on live theater in the San Fernando 
Valley for 21 years, is staking its future on NoHo. So are eight smaller 
theaters that coexist with abandoned, deteriorating buildings and vacant lots 
amid a predominantly Spanish-speaking population. 
</P>
<P>
 To spark the area's revival, they are counting on a future Metro Rail station 
just across from El Portal, a revitalization program planned by the Los Angeles 
Community Redevelopment Agency and a soon-to-be-adopted city ordinance that 
would allow artists to live in the buildings in which they work. 
</P>
<P>
 The managing director of Actors Alley for the last nine years, Robert Caine, 
is president of Caine & Weiner Co. Inc., a nationwide commercial collection 
agency with $55 million in annual sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Caine negotiated the troupe's 29 1/2-year lease on El Portal and made the 
proposal to the CRA that won $250,000 in loans and grants for renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 An Encino resident, Caine moved with his family to Studio City in 1945. He 
recalls watching movies at El Portal when he was a student at North Hollywood 
High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He discussed the North Hollywood renaissance with staff writer Doug Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Lankershim Boulevard is devastated right now. All the buildings east 
of the theater are vacant. What's going on there?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't think this area can get any lower. It's impossible. You think 
in terms of the commercial part of it, North Hollywood is at the bottom. 
Economic times today haven't helped it a hell of a lot. I'm not sure who else 
can go out of business. The car guy up the street, he's gone. The redevelopment 
people and the chamber, everybody is really working together. I think there is 
a lot more conversation on how we as a community work together to upgrade. The 
potential is really good. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe the NoHo district can become a distinct theater district, or 
is that a gimmick?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's not a gimmick. It certainly is a PR tool. It is something to use to 
try to bring others in so they would be encouraged to establish residency. I 
think the potential is there. I'm not going to sit here and say there are going 
to be 20 theaters in two years. But I think the potential is there to attract 
better people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is a face - lift coming soon, or will the street be a series of empty lots 
for the next 10 or 15 years?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't think it will be a series of empty lots for the next 10 or 15 
years. As far as an overall face-lift, I don't know. A lot of stories are 
floating around. But, in reality, until something happens -- specifically 
somebody says, "Yes, I'm doing this, and here is the money that we're going to 
do it with," -- I don't know that we can count on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that (Metro Rail) is coming in with their station, I mean we could 
throw a rock and hit it, is going to help tremendously. That's six or seven 
years, by their projection, so give a little, eight years. It's certainly 
something that's going to improve the area as far as making it accessible so 
that people don't have to have cars. You can get from Hollywood in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 There's been conversation of changing the way that you park on Lankershim, 
angled parking instead of parallel parking, and maybe nicen it up a bit with a 
few trees. That doesn't have to be a high-cost project. But it certainly would 
improve it if we did that for five or six blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a lot of faith in this movement of the Planning Commission changing 
over the zoning restrictions so that the artists' movement can develop. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Were you drawn to Lankershim Boulevard by the NoHo district concept?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As far as Actors Alley is concerned, we have been looking for a place the 
past four years or so that would enable us to fulfill the mission of our 
organization, which is in the broad sense to create a regional theater for the 
San Fernando Valley and in the narrower sense to create an Equity performance 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody saw it driving down the street and said, "You ever look at the El 
Portal? I don't think it's being used very much." As we started talking to 
those people, it became pretty evident that kind of a facility would have some 
real value, a fairly old theater actually built as a vaudeville house. There's 
a little romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see risk in this venture?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a risk in everything. Some people have some reticence about going 
there. I don't think there's any question about it. But I think what we put 
together was based upon logical business decisions. There's a parking lot that 
is relatively close, half a block. There is decent lighting. I don't think the 
area is any worse than anything else. People get mugged anywhere. In our case, 
it isn't that dangerous. I mean, I don't feel that uncomfortable.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: In terms of personal safety, you mean? Won't the lowbrow environment 
discourage patrons?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the issue is personal safety. I don't think it has anything to do 
with lowbrow or highbrow. I don't think that most of the people who are 
theater-goers are big snobs. People who go to the theater, they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see a part of your role as stimulating the area?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, yes, absolutely. Not only economically, because we'll be employing 
people to work there and creating some kind of ongoing business with positive 
energy, but also with what we do in the community, non-performance programs in 
the schools and the community around us. And we have several of those on board. 
We have done them before at different times, and once we're open we're going to 
go ahead and reinstate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If you succeed at what you're doing, Lankershim Boulevard would be a 
gentrified district in the middle of a huge population of Spanish-speaking 
people. Do you have any plans to reach that community?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our Latino playwrights program is a new thing to us that we feel is very 
important to establish and get going in that area. We feel that, not just North 
Hollywood but in the San Fernando Valley, the Latino population, the 
Spanish-speaking population, has to be somewhere around 45%. We feel that there 
should be an outlet for development of what comes from them, plays written 
about their own experience. 
</P>
<P>
 There needs to be an opportunity to have that form of expression. Hopefully, 
it can be translated into other kinds of programming, not only putting on plays 
but dealing with the community in general so that you sensitize people to 
theater arts and you get them to start coming to a theater, whether you take it 
to a school and get the kids interested, and then maybe the kids bring their 
parents to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an audience to develop there, not just selfishly nor necessarily 
altruistically. There is an audience to develop. I'm not sure that we 
necessarily have to cater to the Latino community, but they are a population 
that is underserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does that mean you'll perform plays by Latino playwrights?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You're darn right. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will that be in English or Spanish?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Hopefully it can be done in both. The process will probably take a year or 
so to get it into the workings of everything else that is going on as far as 
the plays being done and getting it into the reading process. But it is on our 
agenda. It would be done in English and it would be done in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then you could promise that in the next couple of years there will be 
Spanish words up on that marquee again?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, "El Portal" is always going to be up there, unless we get some guy 
named Smith who wants to give us $1 million to name the theater after him. Then 
it will be named "Smith" real fast.

GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN 'FEDBUSTER' LETTERS CASE; COURTS: THOMAS LEE LARSEN OF 
VAN NUYS COULD FACE 63 MONTHS TO 385 YEARS IN PRISON. HE REMAINS A SUSPECT IN 
SEVERAL ARSON WILDFIRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man who remains a suspect in several of the arson-set wildfires 
that devastated Southern California pleaded guilty Monday to charges that he 
wrote letters under the alias "Fedbuster," threatening to set fires.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee Larsen, 43, had been charged with 77 counts of making threats in 
letters sent through the U.S. mail and faces a maximum sentence of 385 years in 
prison and a $192.5-million fine if convicted on all counts. 
</P>
<P>
 But through an agreement between U.S. Atty. Gregory Jessner and Larsen's 
lawyer, Paul Abrams, he pleaded guilty to six counts of sending the threatening 
letters to fire stations, most of which are in the San Fernando Valley. In 
federal court, a person who pleads guilty can only be sentenced for up to six 
counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were happy with the settlement," said Jessner. "It was the best the 
government could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the counts carries a maximum five-year prison sentence and a $250,000 
fine so the maximum sentence Larsen could serve under terms of the plea bargain 
is 30 years in prison with a $1.5-million fine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely to be much less, however. During a bail request after the guilty 
plea was entered, Abrams said that under sentencing guidelines, his client 
faces a maximum of four years in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessner then said that the maximum Larsen could serve was 63 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that Mr. Larsen is not looking at 10, 20 years in prison, 
but a much shorter period," said Abrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing is scheduled for April 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen admitted to sending all the "Fedbuster" letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the letters were the same, exact Xerox copies," said Larsen, addressing 
Judge Harry L. Hupp, "And I sent them all on the same day." 
</P>
<P>
 But although he is the subject of a continuing arson investigation by the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Larsen has denied setting any of the 
recent fires. He has not been charged in connection with the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77 counts include 33 counts related to letters penned under the 
"Fedbuster" alias, 33 counts connected to letters written under the name 
"Nitecrawler" and seven counts resulting from letters threatening to kill a 
prominent Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer and his family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fedbuster letter was sent to 37 Southern California residents and fire 
stations in last August. In the letter, Larsen said he was upset about property 
that had been seized from him, and he demanded an apology from the prosecutors, 
judges and agents who were responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get no satisfaction by the time we get a good volatile fire season, 
you'll really regret it you'll see," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They burned me now I'm going to burn back. I fight fire with fire. You like 
my puns chump? Sizzle sizzle," the letters said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Nitecrawler letter, which was sent to Manhattan Beach residents and 
preschools, he threatened to poison baby food and meat. It was unclear what 
motivated Larsen to send the Nitecrawler letters. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit filed in connection with the Larsen case, FBI Special Agent 
Richard G. Palacios stated that he believed the Fedbuster and Nitecrawler 
letters were written by the same person. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, 43, is also charged with sending letters threatening to kill J. 
Patrick Maginnis, a defense attorney who represented Larsen in two cases, and 
members of Maginnis' family. 
</P>
<P>
 Maginnis most recently represented Larsen in a case where Larsen was charged 
with spraying acid on cars and a young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, a convicted child molester, has a long criminal history -- including 
other incidents of sending threatening letters. 
</P>
<P>
 He once wrote a letter threatening the daughter of a judge who had presided 
over one of his cases. On another occasion, he threatened the mother of one of 
his molestation victims in a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen has also been arrested twice on arson charges -- once as a 9-year-old 
for trying to burn down a church, and once for attempting to burn down the 
Sands Hotel in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested on Nov. 8 after Jessner identified him through several clues, 
including a series of initials.

PANEL BACKS MORE FUNDING FOR L. A. FIRE DEPARTMENT; SERVICES: THE $11.6-MILLION 
PLAN FOCUSES ON BETTER PREPARATION FOR BRUSH FIRES, INCLUDING PROPERTY 
INSPECTIONS AND FIREFIGHTER TRAINING. 
</P>

<P>
 To better prepare for the next brush fire emergency, a committee of the Los 
Angeles City Council endorsed a plan Monday to increase Los Angeles Fire 
Department funding and adopt a law requiring new swimming pools to include 
hookups for fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-point plan was submitted to the Public Safety Committee by Fire Chief 
Donald O. Manning in response to a request by Councilman Marvin Braude that the 
department investigate ways to better prepare for the next major brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the terrible fires which caused so much loss in Malibu, Laguna Beach, 
Altadena and other communities, it was imperative that we learn what we were 
doing right and what we still need to do," said Braude, chairman of the 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which would cost the city $11.6 million, will be considered next 
week by the City Council's Budget and Finance Committee before it is referred 
to the entire council for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Manning, the Fire Department needs the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * $487,000 that was cut from the department in the fiscal 1993-94 year. The 
money would be used to help inspect properties to make sure landowners are 
meeting city requirements for brush clearing, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 * $1.35 million to provide special emergency training for firefighters, such 
as training to handle hazardous materials. Manning said funding shortages have 
cut training hours by 73% over the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * $9.8 million to replace antiquated equipment such as 20-year-old fire 
engines, ambulances, trucks and aerial ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 * A law requiring residents who build new swimming pools to include a curbside 
fire hose connection that would allow firefighters to drain the pools when 
other water supplies to fight fires are not available. 
</P>
<P>
 * City Council support for state and federal legislation that would provide 
$15 million to modernize the C-130 aircraft used by the California Air National 
Guard to fight wildfires and eliminate restrictions to getting federal 
assistance in the case of a fire disaster.

 Valencia resident Joseph Yohanna was arraigned in U.S. District Court Monday 
on one count of possessing machine guns and one count of possessing 
unregistered firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Each count carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco & Firearms said the weapons were 
found in his home during a search on Dec. 21. The firearms seized in the raid 
included a 9mm Uzi, .45 caliber MAC-10, .223 caliber CAR-15 and 9mm CAR-9 
machine guns. In addition, they seized eight claymore mines containing plastic 
explosives, two incendiary devices, eight silencers, nine handguns, two 
shotguns and one rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Also found were a quarter-pound block of TNT, 40 feet of detonating cord and 
13 fuse ignitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agents searched the home last month after getting a tip from an 
informant that the firearms were being kept there. But when the agents also 
found military explosives, they evacuated 32 homes in the quiet, middle-class 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, neighbors and relatives have offered strong support for Yohanna, a 
bodyguard for Interscope Records, since his arrest. About 25 supporters 
testified on his behalf at a bail hearing last month, rejecting prosecution 
comments he was a danger to the community and should not be allowed to post 
bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Bail was ultimately set at $350,000. His trial is scheduled to begin March 1.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OFFICIAL REVERSES OPINION ON COURTHOUSE 
CONSTRUCTION; GOVERNMENT: A FEW DAYS AFTER ADVISING THAT BUILDING PLANS BE 
SHELVED, CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER SALLY R. REED CALLS FOR ACTION 'AS 
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.'

<P>
 Just a few days after making a recommendation that construction of a new 
courthouse in Lancaster be put on indefinite hold, county Chief Administrative 
Officer Sally R. Reed on Monday toured the existing court and found conditions 
"overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 90-minute briefing and tour of the municipal and superior courts in 
Lancaster, Los Angeles County's top administrator said, "I can't help but be 
concerned about the position the courts are dealing with here. Something needs 
to be done as quickly as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 16-page report released last week, Reed recommended that eight courthouse 
construction projects, including the $80-million facility planned for 
Lancaster, be put on indefinite hold due to a lack of funds. Reed further 
recommended that the county continue only with courthouse projects in 
Chatsworth and near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed said it is possible that a majority of the supervisors may agree that 
the Lancaster courthouse is a necessity. If so, Reed said, she is hopeful they 
will opt to build it rather than one of the two she has recommended. Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich had earlier suggested the Lancaster facility be built instead 
of the one in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, who represents the Antelope Valley and most of the San Fernando 
Valley, was prompted by the report to invite Reed to visit the overcrowded 
Antelope Valley courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 While Reed was surprised at what she saw -- crowded hallways, a meeting room 
at the nearby county library used as a courtroom and cramped work quarters -- 
it was unlikely she would change her recommendation. Instead, Reed, who was in 
the Antelope Valley on Monday for the first time since she took over the chief 
administrative post Oct. 18, said she was looking forward to the options and 
suggestions raised by the supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said, "I'm hopeful we can have some options so we can move 
forward." The answer, he said, is for the Antelope Valley to have expanded 
facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Webber, chief of the county's capital projects division, said late Monday 
he had not talked with Reed since her morning visit to the courts in north Los 
Angeles County. Webber, whose division prepared the report on the courts, said, 
"I would be very surprised if our recommendation changed." 
</P>
<P>
 The county has already spent millions of dollars on six of the eight 
courthouse projects, including nearly $6 million for the one in Lancaster that 
Reed said should be put on hold. "We need to stop spending money on six 
courts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said it is more than money that must be considered in making the 
decision on the fate of the courthouses, particularly the Antelope Valley 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't try to get divorced in the Antelope Valley," said Antonovich deputy 
Lori Howard. "It takes five years." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Municipal Judge Ian Grant, who has worked in the Antelope Valley 
since 1964 and plans to retire when his term expires at the end of the year, 
said the existing courthouse has grown over the last three decades, but 
unfortunately not enough. "The population growth has just outpaced the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Fritz Ohlrich, assistant executive officer for the Administratively Unified 
Courts of Los Angeles County, said there are numerous courts within the county 
that are overcrowded. Antelope Valley, however, faces one of the most severe 
space shortages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts have agreed that if only two (courthouses) are to be built, the 
airport and Antelope Valley should be built," Ohlrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Chatsworth residents are opposed to the construction of a 
courthouse in their community. They have filed suit against the county to stop 
the $51.5-million court from being built. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Caler, court administrator for the Antelope Judicial District, said the 
municipal court suffers from a severe lack of space. The court commissioner 
does not have a courtroom to work from and spends the mornings in a free 
courtroom. He then rotates between jury deliberation rooms and Caler's 
conference room. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Millings, senior judicial assistant, said the lack of superior court 
space means civil and criminal cases have to be transferred from the Antelope 
Valley to other courts, such as San Fernando or Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bleak, bleak picture out here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the new courthouse would best meet the needs, but Millings 
said if it is put on hold, portable trailer or leased space would at least 
lessen the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really do need the courthouse," he said. "If worse comes to worse, 
something's better than nothing."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WORK ON SHERIFF'S STATION TO START IN MAY; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: CITY OFFICIALS PRAISE THE $25-MILLION PROJECT AS A WAY TO IMPROVE 
PUBLIC SAFETY AS WELL AS THE DOWNTOWN AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Construction of a $25-million sheriff's station in downtown Lancaster is 
expected to begin in May, with city officials hailing the project as an 
opportunity to improve both public safety and the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ceremony Monday, Lancaster City Council members together with Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich and Sheriff Sherman Block unveiled details of 
construction plans for the 50,900-square-foot station, which is scheduled to be 
completed in August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheriff's station is a real benefit to the downtown area," said Lancaster 
Councilman George Root. "It's badly needed." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is one of several county facilities, including five fire stations 
and a library, that are being built in Lancaster as a result of a 1992 
agreement between the city and county. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned for construction on 6.9 acres on the north side of Lancaster Boulevard 
between Sierra Highway and Beech Avenue, the sheriff's station will include a 
forensics laboratory, booking and jail facility, detective bureau, 
communications center and a vehicle maintenance building. 
</P>
<P>
 Block noted that he was on hand for the ground-breaking of the existing 
Lancaster sheriff's station more than three decades ago when, he said, the 
facility was expected to meet the needs of north Los Angeles County into the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department Antelope Valley station is housed in a building at 
Avenue J and 10th Street West that was designed to accommodate 110 department 
employees, Block said. More than 200 people work out of the station now. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to serving the area better, the larger station will have a 
regional training facility that should aid recruitment of local residents -- "a 
real plus," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Arnie Rodio said the new sheriff's station constitutes only a partial 
victory for public safety because the area also needs a new courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on an $80-million courthouse was slated to begin as early as the end of 
the year but the county's Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed recommended 
last week to indefinitely delay the project and seven other proposed 
courthouses.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is slated to vote on Reed's recommendation today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure we get that courthouse," said Rodio. "It's not enough to 
be able to build a sheriff's facility."

CHILD-ABUSE EXAMS GO HIGH-TECH; CRIME: NEW VIDEO EQUIPMENT INSTALLED AT 
LANCASTER HOSPITAL LETS MEDICAL EXPERTS IN LOS ANGELES MAKE A LONG-DISTANCE 
DETERMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A high-tech program unveiled Monday will allow suspected victims of child 
abuse in the Antelope Valley to be examined by medical experts working in Los 
Angeles, saving the children a time-consuming, often unsettling 150-mile round 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Lancaster hospital room decorated with Disney characters, children will 
be examined with a magnification device that can send video images over a 
telephone line to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center. Specialists there will 
help determine whether abuse has occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who installed the equipment at High Desert Hospital, said 
the program is the first of its kind nationwide. They also plan to expand it to 
Olive View Medical Center in Sylmar and other locations in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we foresee is that we'll have enough centers in the county to make sure 
that every child gets expert examinations," said Dr. Astrid Heger, director of 
the Center for the Vulnerable Child at County-USC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The video system was launched in the Antelope Valley because of its remote 
location and the unusually high number of child-abuse cases in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Digre, director of the county Department of Children's Services, said 
the prevalence of child-abuse cases may be related to the area's isolation and 
to drug use by residents. He also said people who work with children in the 
Antelope Valley tend to be diligent about reporting suspected child abuse to 
the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical linkup between High Desert and County-USC is a key component of 
the new Antelope Valley Abuse Network Team, a multi-agency program. It also 
includes representatives of the district attorney's office, Sheriff's 
Department, Children's Services and the Children's Center of the Antelope 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman R. Block, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich, whose district includes the Antelope Valley, were among those who 
took part in the program's kickoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They emphasized that the video link and the team approach to child-abuse cases 
can easily be duplicated. "We hope the Antelope Valley (program) will be the 
model we can use throughout the county of Los Angeles," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Heger, a widely recognized child-abuse expert, said she learned how long it 
takes to reach the Antelope Valley 10 years ago, when a sheriff's deputy urged 
her to testify at a local trial. "Nothing against the Antelope Valley," she 
said, "but the drive, as those of you who commute know, is a real killer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said local physicians have largely "bowed out" of child-abuse examinations 
because of the costs and time-consuming court obligations. Under the new 
program, children at High Desert will be examined instead by nurses with 
specialized training. 
</P>
<P>
 These nurses will look for signs of abuse, and video images will be 
transmitted to Heger or her associates at County-USC, who can direct the nurse 
through a headset during an examination. 
</P>
<P>
 If evidence of abuse is found, the images can be printed out or stored on film 
or videotape for use during a court hearing. If the allegations appear to be 
unfounded, the child can be returned promptly to his or her family -- without 
the delays associated with a trip to and from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment for the video program costs $18,000. But Heger said the county 
will save money through reduced costs for foster care and investigations. She 
hopes to place a similar system at Olive View within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Gillies, executive director of the Children's Center, a nonprofit 
organization that provides counseling to victims of sexual abuse, hailed the 
video system and plans for better cooperation among medical experts, 
investigators and prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We make much better decisions when we make them as a team," she said, "and 
get all the pieces of the puzzle together as quickly as possible."

PRUDENTIAL INVESTORS SUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County retirees Art and Georgia Marsh had no idea a free lunch at 
Clifton's Cafeteria in Laguna Hills offered by a Prudential Securities broker 
would turn out to be quite so costly. 
</P>
<P>
 After the lunch meeting, the couple put nearly $100,000 of their savings into 
now-defunct oil and gas partnerships offered by Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Art, 69, and Georgia, 67, are just two of an estimated 10,000 to 15,000 
Californians, mostly retirees, who invested $1.44 billion in Prudential's 
embattled petroleum investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshes are parties in a $1.1-billion class-action suit filed in Orange 
County Superior Court Friday against Arthur Andersen & Co., the nation's 
largest accounting firm, in connection with the partnerships. Accounting firm 
Deloitte and Touche is also named in the suit, but not Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was doing fine until I ran into that fast-talking broker," said Art Marsh, 
a former garment worker in downtown Los Angeles, who lives with his diabetic 
wife in Leisure World. "I told him I was very conservative; I just want 
something safe. And he said, 'You can trust me; it's safe,' but it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Marshes said they hope several lawsuits pending against Prudential and the 
most recent one against Arthur Andersen will recover some of their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry I got taken in, but I know I'm not alone, there's a lot of people 
just like me," he said. One of those is Lucille Imada, a 78-year-old former 
factory worker who invested $95,500 of her retirement savings with Prudential. 
Imada and her husband Yoshio, 84, recently moved in with their 53-year-old son 
in Huntington Harbour because of health and financial pressures related to the 
Prudential debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want my money before I die," said Imada, who said she never made more 
than $5.85 an hour working 34 years in a Chicago factory. "I thought Prudential 
was steady like a rock," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her son Randy, a real estate sales agent, is helping his parents attempt to 
get their money back. He said his parents' vision of a golden retirement in 
California is gone forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prudential defrauded my mother, like many other people," Randy Imada said. 
"The question I have to ask is: Why is a company like that still around doing 
business? Why aren't they shut down by the Securities and Exchange Commission?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit in Orange County is the latest move in an ongoing battle over 
Prudential's Energy Income Funds, a series of oil-and-gas partnerships sold by 
New York-based Prudential, one of the nation's premier securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, attorneys representing about 1,000 investors asked a federal judge 
to reject a proposed $120-million settlement between Prudential and its 
partnership investors. The attorneys want the judge to appoint a special 
counsel to reopen the case. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais of New Orleans has scheduled a Jan. 19 
fairness hearing on the settlement between the brokerage firm and 137,000 
investors who have accused Prudential of fraud and misrepresentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers, who represent individual investors, contend that the settlement 
negotiated by class-action attorneys will leave only $90 million for investors 
after attorneys' fees are paid. They claim investors are entitled to at least 
$780 million for out-of-pocket losses and 6% interest that would have been 
earned if the money had been invested elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate settlement, Prudential in October agreed to pay $371 million in 
penalties to settle a lawsuit filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
though Prudential neither admitted nor denied findings that it defrauded the 
limited partnership investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview Monday, John Murray, head of corporate risk 
management for Prudential in New York, said though he had not yet seen the 
lawsuit, it was without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what we know, it's old hat. It's totally without merit," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 When told of Lucille Imada's situation, Murray said he was not familiar with 
her case but that the company is looking into several individual cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have something where there was an unsuitable situation, we'll remedy 
that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit charges that Andersen, which audited the records of the oil and gas 
partnerships, allowed Prudential to issue false financial statements and 
prospectuses, hiding the fact that "profits" investors were receiving were 
actually their own money being paid back to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Ruane, a spokesman for Andersen, said Monday that his firm had not seen 
the lawsuit and therefore had no comment. A spokesman in Los Angeles for 
Deloitte & Touche said the firm also could not comment because it had not seen 
the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Kurtz, executive director of the California Society of Certified Public 
Accountants, a trade group based in Redwood City, said the lawsuit was part of 
a disturbing trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess what makes this so unnerving is that there seems to be increasingly 
little or no relations between the amount claimed and the charge against the 
CPAs," he said, adding that the accounting firms should not be held accountable 
for nearly all of the investor losses -- financial institutions should shoulder 
more of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Newport Beach attorney Jeff Dennis Ferentz, co-counsel for the 
investors who are suing, argues that the accountants had a major role in the 
partnerships and should be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might not have fired the gun, but they pressed the lead onto the shell 
containing the powder," he said. The accounting firms "put their name on (the 
investment documents) so everyone would think it had substantial credibility 
with Prudential and the large accounting firm standing behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several of the Orange County investors are troubled about the lengthy 
legal process required to recover their money and many doubt they will ever see 
their funds again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I guess all my eggs lie in Jeff Ferentz's basket," said Michael 
Falvo, 76, a San Clemente man who invested his whole portfolio in the 
Prudential partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fooled. A handshake was always good enough for me. I trusted people and 
I was fooled," Falvo said. "At our age, we were looking for stability and 
safety and instead our broker put us into that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Munroe, 70, sold his stake in a small engineering company in Orange and 
invested $145,000 of the sales proceeds in Prudential's energy funds in the 
mid-1980s after being promised yields reaching 15%. He said he is still angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly feel like the investments were misrepresented. I didn't expect a 
guaranteed 15%, but I didn't expect to lose my money," Munroe said, adding that 
he still does consulting for the company. "This was money for my retirement and 
for my children. Certainly it's made life more difficult."  
</P>
<P>
 Another local investor, Selma Feldman, 64, a widow who lives in Leisure World, 
put at least $15,000 in the partnership after meeting a broker at Clifton's 
Cafeteria. She said the investment was represented to her as the best thing for 
a widow to have. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you very nervous to live these past three years with all this going 
on," she said. "It's a traumatic life to live."

O.C. WOMEN LAWYERS NAME ATTORNEY OF YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patricia Herzog, who argued a case before the California Supreme Court in 1982 
that changed divorce settlements across the nation, was named Attorney of the 
Year on Monday by the Orange County Women Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog, 71, argued in that landmark case that people who put their spouses 
through medical or law school have the right to share in the earnings of that 
career even if the couple divorce.The case, Sullivan vs. Sullivan, was reported 
on the network TV show "60 Minutes" and prompted legislation in California and 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concept is what blew everybody's mind," said Herzog, who recently 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1957, Herzog became the eighth woman to be accepted to the Orange County 
Bar. She was the first counsel to the Legal Aid Society in Santa Ana and set up 
a private practice in Corona del Mar in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, she ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for a state 
Senate seat. She is a founding member of the county chapter of the American 
Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been outside the Establishment, you could say anti-Establishment, all my 
life," Herzog said of her career. "To me, it's an interesting and stimulating 
place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The award to Herzog is the second in the history of the Orange County Women 
Lawyers Assn., which has 400 members.

REGULATORS PUT MORTGAGE BROKER OUT OF BUSINESS; HOME LOANS: THE OFFICE OF 
THRIFT SUPERVISION SENDS A SIGNAL TO THE INDUSTRY BY TAKING ACTION AGAINST 
CENTRUST FINANCIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sending a signal to mortgage brokers, the Office of Thrift Supervision said 
Monday that it has banned a Garden Grove company from doing business in the 
banking industry for what the federal agency alleges were phony home loan 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking action for the first time against a mortgage broker, the OTS banned 
Centrust Financial from peddling loans to, or otherwise working with, banks, 
savings and loans and other regulated financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency accused the small mortgage broker of concocting a sham deal to 
obtain $643,907 from Plaza Home Mortgage Bank, a Santa Ana thrift, and 
providing false information in an attempt to obtain a $637,600 loan from United 
Savings Bank in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Centrust and its manager, Carter C. Green, agreed to the ban without admitting 
or denying the agency's charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The OTS, which is looking into the activities of real estate agents and other 
mortgage brokers, is trying to halt what it sees as a growing trend among both 
professionals and borrowers to rip off S&Ls and banks by obtaining loans based 
on sham deals or phony facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are most concerned about real estate agents and mortgage brokers who 
systematically encourage people to submit false loan documentation," said John 
F. Robinson, the agency's regional director in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency as well as financial institutions have referred as many as 300 
cases of false loan applications in Orange County alone to the FBI in Santa 
Ana, said Michael S. Anderson, FBI agent in charge of institutional fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have professionals trying to make a living in a down market and people 
trying to buy houses without financial wherewithal," Anderson said in 
explaining the large number of cases. He would not say whether the FBI was 
investigating Centrust. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza, which called in the OTS and the FBI, uses about 5,500 independent loan 
brokers in 12 states to line up mortgages, and it has been burned on sham deals 
by only three brokers, said Phyllis Downes, an executive vice president of 
Plaza Home Mortgage Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the misrepresentations we see are professionals who push loans 
through for borrowers who are marginally qualified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Robinson said, the serious nature of the Centrust deals has become "a 
big problem" for a number of West Coast thrifts that rely on independent 
brokers to bring in borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Green nor other Centrust employees could be reached for comment. The 
office telephone has been disconnected, and Downes said the office is believed 
to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds from the Plaza loan were to be used for a Dana Point condominium 
that a Centrust customer allegedly was buying for her home. The OTS said the 
false statements in the loan documents included the woman's intent to live 
there, an inflated salary figure for her and an inflated value for the 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 No payments were ever made on the loan, and Plaza eventually sued Centrust, 
Green and others. It settled the case for $400,000 and collected nearly 
$100,000 from parties other than Centrust and Green, Downes said. She said the 
thrift has not been able to find Green since.

KNOTT'S TO ADD $10-MILLION ATTRACTION; THEME PARKS: OFFICIALS HOPE THE 'MYSTERY 
LODGE' SHOW, FASHIONED AFTER A POPULAR SPECIAL-EFFECTS DRAW AT THE '86 WORLD'S 
FAIR, WILL PULL IN CROWDS THIS SUMMER. 
</P>

<P>
 Pledging to shatter the sameness that has gripped Southern California theme 
parks, Knott's Berry Farm on Monday unveiled plans for a $10-million, 
family-oriented special effects show that it hopes will become the hit of the 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Mystery Lodge" show will feature an authentic Native American storyteller 
and will probably employ effects such as objects and ghosts that appear in 
campfire smoke. At the end of the show, the storyteller will mysteriously 
disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an updated version of a show that was one of the most popular 
attractions at the 1986 World's Fair in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I visited Spirit Lodge at Expo '86, I was captivated, uplifted and 
determined to bring the next generation of this extraordinary journey to 
Knott's," Knott's President Terry E. Van Gorder said in a statement. "Our 
guests will see a new, technically advanced version of the original attraction, 
a truly memorable experience they simply can't experience anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 With Disneyland not expected to debut a major new ride for summer, Knott's 
would not get lost in the Anaheim park's shadow during the height of this 
year's peak tourism season. 
</P>
<P>
 At $10 million, Mystery Lodge will cost a fraction of the amount for a major 
attraction like Disneyland's Splash Mountain or Mickey's Toontown, which had an 
estimated price of $100 million. But this represents Knott's largest capital 
investment at the Buena Park attraction since 1988, when it opened its Camp 
Snoopy area for children. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction comes at time when Knott's needs an attendance boost. Its 
estimated attendance last year was down 5% to 3.7 million, according to the 
trade magazine Amusement Business. The park has fallen from the fifth to ninth 
most popular in the nation in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But opening an attraction that is merely different may not be enough. Knott's 
is taking a calculated risk by not spending its money on new action rides, 
motion simulators and the like that other parks have preferred. 
</P>
<P>
 And its previous venture into the Native American theme, an "Indian Trails" 
area that opened in 1992, did not substantially increase the park's attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts suggest that Mystery Lodge could prove to be very popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is one of the best new types of attractions to come along in years," said 
Jim Benedick, senior vice president for Management Resources, a theme park and 
exposition consulting firm in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 The show begins when visitors cross a bridge next to a waterfall and enter a 
cave. Inside, they are surrounded by a full-size replica of a Kwakiut'l tribal 
house, a tribe from the Pacific Northwest. To set the mood, the lights dim and 
a lightning show fills the fake sky. 
</P>
<P>
 They then enter another room where they find the storyteller and his spooky 
campfire. All told, the show takes about 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier show at Expo '86 in Vancouver had crowds waiting three and four 
hours in line at the General Motors pavilion and was the talk of the fair, 
Benedick said. Given that, it is surprising that no U.S. theme parks have 
picked up the mystery show since, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The special effects are good and the story is good," he said. "It is the 
perfect attraction for (Knott's) because they can build on that mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction is being developed for Knott's by the same firm that designed 
the Vancouver show, BRC Imagination Arts in Burbank, which was founded by 
Orange County native Bob Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rogers said his company has invented shows that play around the 
world, he said he is thrilled about bringing the show to Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will leave people stunned," he predicted.

FORMER LINCOLN S&L CHAIRMAN SENTENCED TO 3 YEARS' PROBATION; FRAUD: RULING 
REFLECTS HIS ROLE IN THE IRVINE THRIFT'S FAILURE AND HIS HELPING PROSECUTORS 
WIN STATE, FEDERAL CONVICTIONS OF CHARLES H. KEATING JR.

<P>
 A bookish computer expert swept up in Charles H. Keating Jr.'s empire to 
become chairman of Lincoln Savings & Loan was put on probation for three years 
Monday for his role in helping Keating swindle investors and loot the Irvine 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Scott Symes, 41, who also was one of a succession of Lincoln presidents, 
was given a light sentence in the nation's costliest thrift failure because he 
helped win both state and federal court convictions of Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 "His cooperation was extensive and forthright, and he was candid and helpful," 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. David A. Sklansky. 
</P>
<P>
 Symes had testified that Keating held such a tight grip on the S&L that he 
dictated what employees could hang on office walls, even though he never held a 
position at the thrift. Keating was chairman of Lincoln's parent company, 
American Continental Corp. in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Symes, of Malvern, Ohio, also testified that Keating told sophisticated 
investors that the company was in trouble, yet told the largely unsophisticated 
bondholders who bought securities at Lincoln branches that American Continental 
was a safe investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Symes, who had pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud, did not 
address the court or comment on his sentence outside. He shook hands with state 
and federal prosecutors, who wished him luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln's collapse nearly five years ago is estimated to have cost taxpayers 
$3.4 billion. Investors lost more than $285 million, though they since have 
recovered about 50 cents on the dollar through settlements with a host of 
lawyers, accountants and other professionals who allegedly helped Keating 
deceive the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, meantime, acted as his own lawyer to win a temporary transfer 
recently from an aging, crowded state prison in San Luis Obispo to a newer 
federal prison in Tucson, Ariz., near his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating is serving a 10-year prison term for violating state securities laws 
and a federal term of 12 years, seven months for racketeering, fraud and 
conspiracy. State prosecutors, who won convictions first, vowed to keep Keating 
in state custody for the minimum five years he has to serve on the state 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Richard M. Bilby in Tucson ordered the transfer to 
help the 70-year-old Keating participate in civil lawsuits that continue in 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The action angered the state prosecutors. The lead prosecutor in state court, 
William Hodgman, called it "a complete sham" designed to make Keating's life 
more comfortable. "I find that disgusting," Hodgman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-prosecutor Paul Turley said, "I had hoped he would be engaged in making 
small rocks out of big rocks."

PERSONAL HEALTH; CURING DOCTORS OF FIGHTING ON JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you hear the one about the surgeon and the anesthesiologist who got into a 
fistfight in the surgical suite while the patient awaited her gallbladder 
operation? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this is not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre spectacle made news recently when the two doctors reached an 
agreement with the Massachusetts State Board of Registration in Medicine, which 
fined them $10,000 each and put them on probation for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Peculiar as the case may seem, heated quarrels between doctors on the job are 
not unusual. And although most doctors stop short of duking it out, conflicts 
among health-care professionals are sometimes serious enough to interfere with 
patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gitlin, chief of the Massachusetts medical board that investigated the 
case, said the clash was classic, in that it involved a surgeon and an 
anesthesiologist. Individuals in those two specialties are well-known for their 
mutual antagonism, born of the intense pressure of shared responsibility for a 
patient's life under the knife and the traditionally different personality 
types of the two. Surgeons are typically personified as cowboy go-getters, 
anesthesiologists as cool, calm, fine-tuners. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, conflict-resolution has become a component of medical school 
training.

FIRST PERSON / ANDREA HEIMAN: WHEN IT COMES TO HEALTHY SELF-ESTEEM, ONE SIZE 
FITS ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA HEIMAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I'll admit, I was flattered at first. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Linda, a pattern-maker for a clothing manufacturer, asked me to be a 
"fit model" for her company. Fit models are like live dressmakers' forms, Linda 
explained. Designers use them to make sure their clothing fits correctly. A fit 
model must be well-proportioned and have the ideal measurements for a certain 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 I certainly never thought of myself as an "ideal" size. Like most women, I 
obsess over a few pounds and generally think my life would be better if my 
thighs were smaller. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda measured me and pronounced me a perfect junior Size 7. It still 
didn't seem right. I'm 27, and although my measurements might match a Size 7, 
my body is not a teen-ager's. As every woman knows, even those who weigh the 
same as they did when they were 16 (which I don't), our bodies change as we get 
older. 
</P>
<P>
 But Linda reassured me. And at $50 an hour, who wouldn't be tempted? 
</P>
<P>
 So, one afternoon a short time later, I went to Linda's company in an L.A. 
suburb. Per Linda's instructions, I brought tights, slip-on shoes, hair ties 
and a T-shirt. I should be prepared to try on many different kinds of clothes, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 I was escorted into a huge warehouse filled with clothing, sewing machines and 
offices, and then into a small room where Linda worked with three other 
pattern-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda took me into another room where the designer waited. I was instructed to 
try on several short, tight, stretchy dresses -- the kind of dresses you see 
high school girls wearing. They were outfits I might have worn when I was 16, 
but they were less than flattering on me now. I looked silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda and the designer seemed to think I was fine. Before they could 
officially use me as a fit model, however, I had to be OKd by The Boss. Linda 
had warned me about him: "He's a jerk."  
</P>
<P>
 "He's very busy, so if he's kind of gruff with you, don't be offended," the 
designer cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 They dressed me in a clingy knit dress covered with tiny print flowers and 
escorted me down a long hall toward The Boss's office. 
</P>
<P>
 I started to get nervous. The dress left nothing to the imagination -- it 
completely outlined my figure, and this man was about to decide if it -- if I 
-- was acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrived in a large office, the only one in the warehouse, I noticed, 
equipped with curtains and furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 There he sat, my judge. I had half-expected to see a fat man with a stogie 
dangling from his lips, but instead I was greeted by a rather handsome blond 
man in his 30s wearing a well-pressed suit and sitting behind a big desk. A 
well-coiffed dark-haired man in a pin-striped suit sat across from him -- a 
sales rep, I was told later. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to sweat, and my heart began to pound. 
</P>
<P>
 I stood in front of the blond man. He looked me up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn around," he ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 I spun around quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, slow down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I turned around again and stood with my back to him. He stared at my rear end 
(or I can only assume he was staring at that part of my anatomy). I stood 
there. He stared. I felt sick. 
</P>
<P>
 I finally turned back around. 
</P>
<P>
 "What size are her hips?" he barked to Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 She told him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's too big," he said. "What about her waist and chest?" 
</P>
<P>
 Again, too big. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all agreed that her measurements are the right size," Linda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business 14 years, and Size 7 has always been 35-25-36," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has the same measurements that Racquel (the last fit model) had," Linda 
protested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, Racquel was too big, too!" he responded. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure my face turned about a hundred shades of gray and red during those 
few minutes. I wished I could disappear. Or at least shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 I slunk back to the dressing room to change into my own clothes. Within 10 
minutes I had gone from perfect to cow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry," Linda said. "He's wrong -- you really do have the right 
measurements." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's OK. I think I'll eat a cake now," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'll get a gun and a knife now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She was right. Why would I want to eat a cake, when he was the jerk who had 
proclaimed me -- and just about every woman over 18 -- "too big"? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are grown women modeling teen-agers' clothes, anyway?  
</P>
<P>
 That day I learned firsthand what it means to be a "piece of meat." It was a 
woman's worst nightmare -- or the worst nightmare of any woman who has any kind 
of body image, which includes most women I know -- being told: "Your body is 
not right." It was one of the most humiliating experiences I can remember, in 
part because I had put myself in the situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, I cannot imagine how models and actresses cope with the constant 
appraisal of their physical appearance. Their livelihoods depend on being 
"perfect." I used to think models were overpaid; now I think they earn what 
they make for what they put up with. What a horrid feeling to make your living 
based on a perception of what you should look like. 
</P>
<P>
 As I drove home -- past the billboards with half-naked women advertising all 
sorts of products, past the huge Bud Lite woman hovering over Santa Monica 
Boulevard -- I had to laugh. I, a feminist who argues that women should not be 
exploited for their bodies, who wants to be seen for who I am, not for my 
measurements, had so quickly been seduced into the world of thinner-is-better. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't go home and eat a cake. But I know I'll never attempt to be a fit 
model again. At any price.

THE MYSTERY OF MEMORY; WHY DO WE REMEMBER USELESS THINGS FOREVER WHILE 
IMPORTANT ONES VANISH? NEW RESEARCH OFFERS SOME CLUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE EMMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can recall everything that happened during prom night, but you can't 
remember where you left your keys last night.  
</P>
<P>
 You check your watch. Fifteen seconds later, you can't remember the time.  
</P>
<P>
 The image of Grandma's cute little white house is vivid in your memory -- 
until you find a snapshot that shows it was yellow.  
</P>
<P>
 And just when you figure your memory is shot, you recall with ease where you 
put the lawn rake three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Human memory is a bewildering marvel, capable of miraculous feats and 
frustrating failures. But now, after what UC Irvine professor Gary Lynch calls 
"a bona fide scientific revolution over the last 10 years," brain researchers 
are beginning to understand some of memory's most basic workings.  
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, a psychobiologist at UCI's Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and 
Memory, is among the world's leading brain scientists. He and colleagues have 
discovered what they believe is the process by which memory is stored in the 
brain, and they have devised an experimental drug, Ampakine, which they say 
increases learning speed and retention in rats. 
</P>
<P>
 The university has licensed an Irvine pharmaceuticals firm to develop Ampakine 
as a possible prescription drug, hoping it will increase memory in mild cases 
of dementia, stroke and Alzheimer's disease. So far, its effect in people is 
untested.  
</P>
<P>
 But this is only the latest development in brain research, Lynch says. A 
decade of discoveries now allows science to describe "with some degree of 
confidence things that would have sounded like science fiction 10 years ago. 
What we know now compared to just five years ago is incredible."  
</P>
<P>
 Why is it you can remember the prom but not where you put your keys? 
</P>
<P>
 You are using two physically separate kinds of memory, Lynch says. The prom is 
engraved in your "episodic memory," a very powerful system for preserving the 
rich details of events. The hormones released when you feel strong emotions 
intensifies these memories, and your hormones really pumped on prom night.  
</P>
<P>
 But the location of your keys was recorded in your "scratch-pad memory," which 
is separate and notable for two qualities: You can't store much information 
there, and the information evaporates quickly, usually within a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 This also explains why you don't remember the time only seconds after looking 
at your watch. As soon as the need for the information is gone, scratch-pad 
memory tosses it overboard.  
</P>
<P>
 But how could the memory of Grandma's white house be so vivid yet so wrong?  
</P>
<P>
 Lynch says it is not known exactly how this happens. There is evidence that 
new memories can partially override old ones, so seeing a white house similar 
to Grandma's yellow one might unconsciously tint the original memory.  
</P>
<P>
 It is also known that newly formed memories are, like unset concrete, 
vulnerable for a few hours. During that time, the brain can send a code that 
erases the new memory.  
</P>
<P>
 All this is more important than most people realize, Lynch says. Most people 
think of memory only as remembering to pick up milk on the way home. In 
reality, you use memory constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 You leave work and recognize your car among the hundreds in the parking lot. 
You remember how to open the door, how to start the engine, how to drive home. 
You hear a song on the radio and remember the emotions you felt when you first 
heard it. You see a red light and unconsciously remember that you're supposed 
to stop.  
</P>
<P>
 "Memory is the device that organizes the world for you," Lynch says. "Whatever 
you encounter, you will relate it to something in your experience -- that is, 
to something you remember. You have to, because your brain's just built that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The brain is an unimaginable jumble of electrical circuits. Each of 10 billion 
brain cells connects with 50,000 others. One square millimeter of cortex, the 
crinkly surfaced dome of the brain, contains 80,000 brain cells, making the 
cortex the most complex electronic circuit board on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 This means the brain's memory storage capacity is effectively unlimited. You'd 
need many more than one lifetime to fill it up. 
</P>
<P>
 The brain can manage such an immense cargo of memories because it breaks the 
process into smaller jobs. What seems to you to be a single continuous action 
of remembering is actually many actions occurring in quick, seamless 
succession.  
</P>
<P>
 At the most basic level, the brain stores each memory in its own network of 
brain cells by changing how those cells behave. An electrical "learning code" 
is sent telling each cell to remember whatever immediately follows, such as the 
impulses from hearing a sound.  
</P>
<P>
 The cells record by turning themselves into more sensitive receivers. Now the 
cells have hair triggers, and when the brain goes looking for this memory, the 
network where it's stored is much more likely to respond strongly.  
</P>
<P>
 The process is pure cause and effect -- first comes the code, then the 
information to be remembered -- and the process depends on a sense of time. 
Code pulses spaced too closely or too far apart will fail to turn on the memory 
apparatus.  
</P>
<P>
 Lynch suggests that this is the basic reason we have a sense of cause and 
effect, that we recognize (or imagine) that two things happening at different 
times can be related. "This is why when a door slams and the light goes out, 
you instantly assume the slam shut off the light. It's inescapable, because 
it's built right into our brain organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Time has other effects on memory. Say ought , toe and mobile , and they're 
recognized as three words. But the same sounds without pauses are recognized as 
one word.  
</P>
<P>
 Show your baby a teddy bear and he or she will remember the visual image. Say 
teddy at the same time and the word association is recorded as well. Then the 
sound teddy will summon up a visual memory of the teddy bear, a phenomenon 
Lynch believes is unique to human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next level of memory, the brain is organizing memories according to 
physical similarities. Lynch says the design of brain circuits causes this to 
happen automatically, unconsciously and irresistibly. The process produces 
"phenomenally good categories," much better than categories we could 
consciously devise, he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, brain scientists did not know this categorizing process was 
occurring, yet people use memory categories constantly, Lynch says.  
</P>
<P>
 Example: A friend asks, "What's that on the limb?" You look, see an adolescent 
male English sparrow with a band around one leg and an insect in its beak, and 
you say, "It's a bird." Why are you withholding all that extra information?  
</P>
<P>
 Because at first glance, the brain goes only to the category it has made for 
such objects, Lynch says. The brain goes deeper for detail as a second step 
when detail is needed.  
</P>
<P>
 This makes more sense than you might think, Lynch says. "It's an excellent 
survival technique. You walk out in the street and you see an object coming at 
you on four wheels with someone sitting in it. You've never seen this specific 
object before, but you instantly know it's a car. You don't stand there and 
say, 'I believe that's a '37 Ford. Or perhaps a Chevy.' You know it's a car and 
you get out of the way."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet consciously trying to define a car category, for example, is difficult, 
Lynch says. Try it, then see whether it would exclude a bus, a truck, a golf 
cart and a wheelchair. Yet such a sophisticated category was created in your 
brain, by your brain, without you realizing it.  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is the human brain capable of forming these categories, it cannot 
avoid doing so, Lynch says. Every encounter with something new requires the 
brain to fit it into an existing memory category.  
</P>
<P>
 You can experience this process any time you want. Stare at fleecy clouds or 
into a cottage-cheese ceiling, and soon your mind perceives images forming 
among the random patterns. Your brain is trying to organize the information 
from your eyes into something that will fit into one of your memory categories. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At the next higher level of memory, the cortex reaches outside itself to add 
emotional and muscular power to memory.  
</P>
<P>
 All parts of the cortex have electrical connections to other parts of the 
brain, but there are immense trunk lines running to specific regions.  
</P>
<P>
 One destination is the amygdala, which controls emotion. It doesn't matter 
what you're doing, smelling, seeing or thinking, if we stimulate one part of 
your amygdala, you'll feel angry. Stimulate another and you'll feel happy or 
sad or hungry or lustful.  
</P>
<P>
 The emotional effects of memory are stored here. Whenever you recognize or 
recall something, your cortex checks with the amygdala, which sets off whatever 
emotion has been earmarked for that memory or category, Lynch says. This is the 
reason string quartets might make you cry and movie theaters might make you 
hungry.  
</P>
<P>
 Other connections reach a region known as the striatum, where we organize our 
movements. Here recognition can bring fast action. When someone yells "Duck!" 
the striatum remembers what you're supposed to do and it makes you duck before 
you can think. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, "We're talking about circuitry that's universal to mammals. It's just 
as well developed in a rat's brain as in yours," Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
 But a third region, the hippocampus, is much more developed in human beings.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to lose your hippocampus, and tragically enough, it's probably 
the most vulnerable part of your brain," Lynch says. "You have a heart attack, 
a stroke, and you can wipe it out. Then you can't form any new memories -- or 
very few. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, you could learn to ride a bicycle, but you'd never remember where 
you put it. We still don't know why the hippocampus does that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lynch has published a hypothesis that the hippocampus adds additional 
kinds of memory seemingly needed to form ordinary memories in the cortex.  
</P>
<P>
 The first, which he calls "recency memory," records the passage of time. "You 
run into someone, it's Charlie, and you say, 'Hey, Charlie, haven't seen you in 
years.' What happened was you recognized this person to be Charlie and then you 
checked the hippocampus to see how long it's been since you saw him. That's a 
powerful effect, and you know it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The second powerful effect is knowledge of whether you've already been here 
and already done this. This is the scratch-pad memory at work, recording, for a 
short while only, routine matters that you're not going to want to remember 
tomorrow: "Where did I park my car?" "Have I already checked the mail?" "What's 
the phone number I just looked up?"  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very imperfect device, and it may be because its memory is actually 
meant to be thrown away. The trick is to stay away from it when you need 
long-term memory," Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
 People who never forget where they put their keys are using tricks, 
consciously or unconsciously, such as always putting them in the same place, 
Lynch says. They depend on remembering a procedure, a ritual, which is a 
different, very stable form of memory outside the hippocampus.  
</P>
<P>
 The hippocampus' third powerful effect is expectation or anticipation -- 
memory of what the proper sequence of events should be. You meet Charlie and 
you say you haven't seen him in years. If instead of returning your greeting 
Charlie starts tap-dancing and yodeling, you will immediately know something's 
screwy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You instantly detect this prior to making any intellectual judgments or 
analysis," Lynch says. "You instantly have a sense that something's wrong, and 
it's full stop, freeze, back up and what's going on?"  
</P>
<P>
 The reaction is unavoidable, Lynch says. If you open your refrigerator and see 
piles of cash instead of food, your first reaction will be wariness, not joy.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are now going much deeper into the land of hypothesis," Lynch says. "Now 
we're into an area that is a little embarrassing for us brain scientists, 
because what I'm telling you is this: We don't have much of an idea at all 
about what's going on in 85% of your brain."  
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the cells in the cortex do not connect to anything 
outside, Lynch says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems insane. Where's all the real-world stuff -- information from the 
eyes and the ears? That's still going to small parts of the cortex, but the 
rest of the cortex is just hooked up to itself. It's like a huge city where 
none of the streets leads to the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of the cortex is an area involved in coordinating physical 
movement, from climbing a tree to speaking a language. This area must remember 
incredibly complicated instructions to accomplish these tasks.  
</P>
<P>
 At the back of the cortex are individual areas involved with vision, smell, 
sound and other perception.  
</P>
<P>
 Connections allow these two areas to talk to one another and to form 
associations. Consequently, hearing the word dog can summon up a mental picture 
of a dog, and you can scan it as you would a picture. These connections allowed 
Beethoven, even though he was deaf, to compose music by remembering the sounds 
of notes and instruments.  
</P>
<P>
 Lynch says no other mammal has anywhere near as many front-to-back 
connections. In a person, they are gathered in immense bundles, trunk lines "as 
big around as your finger," Lynch says. He guesses that communication along 
these trunk lines was the ultimate evolution of the human brain.  
</P>
<P>
 Once this link existed, the complicated programs at the front that had been 
controlling movement could now communicate with the huge store of memories at 
the rear. The brain no longer needed the eyes to create vision. The memory of 
images could be coordinated in the same way. You could experience a walk to the 
store entirely within your imagination, arranging memories of what you saw, 
smelled, felt and heard on previous trips.  
</P>
<P>
 There could be language, because the memory of word sounds stored at the back 
could be arranged into phrases and sentences by programs at the front.  
</P>
<P>
 There could be foresight and planning, because remembered images, stored at 
the back, could be arranged into sequences, allowing the brain to preview 
actions. This is what high divers are doing when they seemingly go into a 
trance just before their dives. This is what novelists are doing as they devise 
a plot.  
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect it was the growth of this front-to-back thing that led to what we 
experience as thinking," Lynch says. "You took those motor programs meant to 
help you climb trees, but you used it to organize the memory of climbing trees. 
You turned it inward. Of course, once this thing is clocking along, it never 
needs to do anything. It can go on forever.  
</P>
<P>
 "And here's the irony to this argument. You tell me something, and I say to 
you, 'What are the rules of grammar you just used? I mean, you just used them. 
You changed the pronunciation of this word because it followed that word, you 
had this sequence, you used this exception -- what did you experience as you 
were doing it?'  
</P>
<P>
 "You'd have to sit down and think, but all you can do is analyze it. Because 
you didn't actually experience anything. You just did it.  
</P>
<P>
 "So why are we so screwed up? Because in order to think, we run these 
programs, but our consciousness has no access to those programs. They're 
organizing your memory and coordinating your thinking, but you have no 
conscious access to them." Memory at Its Most Basic Level 
</P>
<P>
 A. Eye: Sees object and sends electrical impulses to brain. 
</P>
<P>
 B. Visual cortex: On surface of the brain. Receives impulses, sends them to be 
recognized or recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Neocortex: Surface of the brain. Stores most memories. At 10 billion brain 
cells, the capacity is so large you can't fill it in a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 D. Amygdala: Inside the brain. Adds emotional meaning to memories, how you 
react to spiders or kittens. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Hippocampus: Inside the brain. Remembers time ("I haven't seen you in 
years"), recognizes incongruities ("There's something different about you") and 
temporarily remembers routine details ("We parked in the third row"). 
</P>
<P>
 F. Striatum: Inside the brain. Remembers whether action is required, such as 
the necessity to duck away from a bee. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 To store one memory, the brain sets aside a network of thousands of brain 
cells, called neurons. Above, how simple memory works. Below, how neurons 
communicate electrically: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Above, a sending neuron transmits a voltage along its axon to the dendrites 
of the receiving neuron. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The gap, or synapse, between sending and receiving neurons, is so small it 
can be seen only with an electron microscope. Electrical impulses are sent by 
squirting a chemical called a neurotransmitter across the synapse. 
</P>
<P>
 3) If enough neurotransmitter sticks to the receptor, the receptor opens. 
Brain fluid and its sodium ions flow through the channel. When enough ions 
enter through enough receptors, the receiving neuron fires its electrical 
impulse to another neuron down the network. This occurs throughout the memory 
network, recalling the memory as quickly as one-fifth of a second. Getting a 
Quick Reaction 
</P>
<P>
 The memory system is so finely tuned that sensing an object, sound or 
circumstance can make you move faster than you can think. 
</P>
<P>
 1) You see a multicolored, long coiled object. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Visual cortex queries the neocortex ("Have you seen anything like this?") 
and the neocortex replies ("It looks like a snake"). 
</P>
<P>
 3) Hippocampus remembers a snake isn't normally there. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Amygdala remembers you hate snakes and switches on fear. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Striatum remembers that when startled by a snake, you are supposed to jump 
back. This message is relayed to your muscles, and you jump. Sources: Center

THRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE; RELATIONSHIPS: MANY COHABITATING ORANGE COUNTY 
COUPLES JUST AREN'T INTERESTED IN A WEDDING AND REMAIN HAPPILY UNMARRIED, 
DESPITE FAMILY PRESSURES AND TAX DISADVANTAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Eric and Tricia are spending time with friends, it's not uncommon for 
someone to call them "Mr. and Mrs." or for Tricia to be asked what's new with 
her "husband."  
</P>
<P>
 Comments like that are laughed off; everyone in their circle knows that Tricia 
O'Toole, 25, and Eric Moe, 33, are unmarried although they have lived together 
almost two years. But to the group, they "seem" married.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our friends sometimes say we forgot to get married," says Moe. "The fact that 
we're living together without a marriage license just isn't an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Renting a small house on Balboa Island, which is easier to do with two incomes 
than one, was a prime reason they decided to live together. They're comfortable 
planning a future that may include marriage one day, but it's a day that gets 
referred to most often when they're around their families.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are always asking about our plans, especially since my sister is 
getting married," says O'Toole. "But we're going to let her have her year; we 
don't feel like planning a wedding right now."  
</P>
<P>
 The statistics show that more couples like O'Toole and Moe are cohabitating 
than ever before in America. The Census Bureau reports that in 1970, about 
523,000 unmarried couples lived together. In 1992, the number jumped to 3.3 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 While some states recognize a common-law marriage for couples who live 
together seven years or more, California has no such statute. Cohab couples who 
want the protection the state gives married people have to buy the license and 
do the vows. "Not being married frees you from some entanglements, but it can 
hurt you in other areas," says family law attorney Carlos Cuesta of Fullerton. 
"Tax law favors married couples, as do insurance companies when you're shopping 
for life and health insurance."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rare for a couple to come to me who haven't lived together before 
getting married," says Judy Albert, a marriage, family and child counselor in 
Huntington Beach. "I never ask, 'How long have you been married?' I say, 'How 
long have you been together?' "  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cohabitating couples Albert sees are open about their lifestyle. 
Whether their reason for cohabitating is economic, or if they just aren't 
comfortable with the formalities of the marriage bonds, the growing number of 
cohabitants may be a sign that living together is no longer something to hide.  
</P>
<P>
 When Cheryl Bowman and Rich Neary of Sunset Beach found their first apartment 
together, they wore bogus wedding bands. "It was 1973, and I think landlords 
felt that if you were cohabitating, you were probably into drugs and porno and 
who knows what else," says Bowman. "We just weren't into the whole wedding 
thing; we wanted to be 'together' rather than 'married,' and we still feel that 
way."  
</P>
<P>
 "For the first few years, I think we both thought we'd get married in the 
future. Now the future is here and we still haven't done it," says Neary. "I 
think living together lets us feel like we're still in our 20s. Being married 
means being an adult, (and) we still want to experience childhood."  
</P>
<P>
 Bowman and Neary, both 46, believe that cohabitation is more acceptable than 
ever and that few couples have to shield the truth about their home lives like 
they once did. "I've always been a grade school teacher, and a teacher's 
off-campus image is important," says Neary. "It was only about five years ago 
that I told my administrator that Cheryl wasn't my wife. I did this after 
realizing that most of the parents I deal with are either living with someone 
now or they have in the past."  
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family have "given up" in Bowman's words, any hope of the couple 
marrying, but both feel some family pressure. "We're treated like any other 
married couple at family gatherings, but there's often an edge. When we tell 
people we're planning a trip to Reno, they always ask if we're going to visit 
one of the little chapels."  
</P>
<P>
 While Bowman says her mother now loves Neary like a son, it wasn't always that 
way. "She was hurt that I had decided to live with a man I wasn't married to, 
and (my mother and I) had a very tense relationship the first couple of years, 
which was difficult because we had always gotten along so well."  
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen parents become a little more accepting of children who live with 
someone before marriage," says Albert. "Because of the trauma of divorce, they 
feel that a trial without the legal constraints of marriage might be good for a 
couple. It may go against their feelings of morality, but they want what's best 
for their children."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Family pressure to marry, whether it's good natured or harsh, can put an undue 
strain on a cohab couple. "When faced with that kind of resistance from a 
parent or other family member, people often feel they need to change that 
person's opinion," says Jackie Singer, a marriage, family and child counselor 
in Irvine. "But you have to try not to do this.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can say, 'I know this must be hard for you, but you need to let me live 
my own life.' It's important to remember that while you may not understand 
their position, they're having a hard time understanding yours. The other 
person is just as upset as you are."  
</P>
<P>
 For Moe, his sister's decision to live with her boyfriend a year earlier 
helped him. "She kind of 'broke the ice' by being the first in our family, 
which made it easier when I told them that Tricia and I were going to live 
together."  
</P>
<P>
 "Eric stayed at my parents' house for a short time after college," says 
O'Toole. "From that experience everyone got to know him and he became like a 
part of the family. When we told everyone that we would be living together, the 
fact that he'd been around made it easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Eden, 38, was a bachelor who had lived alone since leaving college. But 
in December of 1992, he moved into the home of girlfriend Wendy Carter, 36, of 
Anaheim, and her 5-year-old son, Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years I never did much during the holidays, and suddenly I'm putting up a 
Christmas tree and setting cookies and milk out for Santa on Christmas Eve. It 
was an amazing transformation for me," says Eden.  
</P>
<P>
 "Having Bruce move in has been great; he and Andrew get along and my 
ex-husband likes him and he appreciates having a man around the house with 
Andrew," says Carter. "But I've had some strange reactions from other people. 
Some friends were outraged, saying I was a bad influence on my son by having 
Bruce come to live with us. They don't trust my judgment; Bruce and I had been 
close a year before he had moved in and they liked him fine before then. They 
act as though I were living with a guy I met two weeks ago."  
</P>
<P>
 Carter's parents in Arizona were a little uncomfortable when she told them 
about her new living arrangement. "They wanted to meet Bruce, and when they did 
they liked him and approved, although I'm sure they'll be thrilled when we 
actually get married."  
</P>
<P>
 When Carter and Eden planned to spend a weekend at her parent's home last 
summer, they faced a typical problem for cohabitating couples who visit their 
parents: Where do we sleep? 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have two extra bedrooms. One has two twin beds, the other has a 
double bed. I wasn't going to quibble about the sleeping arrangements. If they 
wanted us to have the twin beds, and Andrew to have the double, that was fine," 
Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Carter's mother showed her to the double bed, and Andrew and 
Eden to the twin beds down the hall. "This is what they were comfortable with; 
it's their house, and we were comfortable with that."  
</P>
<P>
 "That sense of 'you do what you want in your home, but not in my home' still 
prevails," says Singer. "Even if the parents accept the couple living together, 
there's often something about sleeping with that person in the parent's house 
that causes discomfort. They feel it's a violation."  
</P>
<P>
 When Bowman and Neary visited his parents for the first time, she slept in the 
spare bedroom while he got the couch.  
</P>
<P>
 "The next time, we did the adult thing," says Neary. "We bought them a 
queen-size bed and had it delivered the day before we arrived, assuming we'd 
get to use it. But they had it put in their room, tossed the old bed out, and I 
was on the couch again. Now we just stay at a hotel."

SHARING THE SLOPES; RECREATION: SKIERS HAVE HAD TO LEARN TO MAKE MORE ROOM FOR 
THEIR MORE RADICAL COUNTERPARTS, SNOWBOARDERS. THE LATTER SPORT HAS A GROWING 
FOLLOWING IN O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Skiers say they see them coming from a distance, an ominous blur against the 
white. Charging recklessly across the powder, done up in snappy mountain 
threads more street than snow. The outlaws of the slopes, the snowboarders, are 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them are young and decent kids, I guess," sighs Larry Evers, 38, 
who's been skiing for 15 years. "But the thing is, they're radical, doing all 
their tricks and routines. They really mess up the quality (of the ski runs) by 
acting so aggressive. . . . They make you nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, c'mon, loosen your bindings, replies Dan Brown, a former skier turned 
snowboarder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us don't screw things up any more than the skiers," says the 
25-year-old Laguna Niguel resident, an avid snowboarder since hanging up his 
skis four years ago. "They just like to pick on us. I think they're bitter; 
they feel left behind because snowboarding is taking over." 
</P>
<P>
 That may be a stretch, but just about everybody from resort managers to 
snowboarding groups agree that the sport has grown quickly in recent years. The 
Surf Industry Manufacturers Assn. in Corona del Mar estimates that nationally 
2.2 million snowboarders are expected to visit the mountains this season, up 
from 1.9 million last year. Board sales, the association notes, should jump 
more than 30,000 above the 130,000 mark of 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and others say Orange County, like most of the Southland, has a loyal 
and rising number of followers. This demands a peaceful coexistence between 
skiers and snowboarders, a fact the resorts recognize. While some don't allow 
snowboarding, most do and have tried to minimize tensions by creating special 
snowboard runs featuring "half pipes," or banks of snow used for tricks, much 
like skateboard ramps. They also have staffers patrol the slopes, warning 
visitors about unruly behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "All that helps and I'm trying to be hopeful," says Evers, from Huntington 
Beach. "It's a real drag, though, when they come screaming down the slopes, 
tearing everything up when you're trying to have a relaxing day." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Paul Herman, a 29-year-old Long Beach skier: "What I hate is when they 
cut you off or act like they own the place. They hoot and holler and say things 
to you, especially if you're in the way. No respect." 
</P>
<P>
 It all comes down to philosophies, concedes Brown. Pointing out that 
snowboarders tend to be younger (the core age group is 13 to 25 years old), 
Brown says that most skiers go for fast descents, performed gracefully if 
boringly, while snowboarders prefer acting up with almost acrobatic 
maneuverings on the mountain face. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their clothes are provocative; snowboarders have taken the radical urban 
styles, bright colors and baggy sizes onto the slopes, often annoying the 
sensibilities of more restrained skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skiers are into speed, we're into style," Brown says. "Sometimes those 
(attitudes) don't get along. The (two sports) are just very different." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of two long skis, snowboarding is done on a sleek fiberglass plank 
(which can cost as much as $500 new; used ones come as cheap as $100) somewhere 
between the size of a skateboard and a surfboard. The rider stands sideways, 
with his or her feet hooked into a pair of latches. From this position, the 
snowboarder can slash and cut through the powder, leaping from moguls to 
perform "aerials," or air-born tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves are similar to those done by surfers and skateboarders. No surprise 
there; snowboarding actually developed in the early '80s in response to both 
those pastimes. Surfers and skateboarders, already dominating the sea and the 
asphalt, naturally turned to the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, though, snowboarders were such a minority that most skiers hardly 
noticed them, and usually only as a curiosity. But not now. Skiers may not like 
it, but snowboarding has become an important sport. There are even contests, 
many of them televised on channels like ESPN. Mt. Baldy, for instance, plans to 
hold no fewer than four snowboard competitions in the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skiers, especially younger ones, have met the lure of snowboarding by 
crossing over. Mindy Clark, the marketing director for Snow Summit in Big Bear, 
notes that it rarely works the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skiers (become snowboarders) but not vice versa," she says. "It's easier for 
snowboarders to get good once they learn, unlike skiing which is easier to 
learn but harder to get good at." 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Saunders, 19, from Westminster, agrees. He says he found skiing somewhat 
difficult to pick up, even though he's been surfing and skateboarding since he 
was 12. But snowboarding felt very natural, almost from the start. Now, he's 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "A common day when I'm not in school may start out with surfing in the 
morning, then a drive up to the mountains," Saunders says. "We'll do some 
styling in the snow in the afternoon, then come home, watch TV, then go out and 
skateboard 'til dark. That's a great day!" 
</P>
<P>
 An added attraction, Saunders felt obliged to note, are the girls and women 
who have taken up the sport in recent years. "There are some hot ones, and 
young, too. Not like (the older women) skiing," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, snowboarding is experiencing a surge in feminine participation, says 
Fran Richards of Transworld Snowboarding magazine. This year, she predicts that 
30% of the snowboarders will be women, compared to the 10% who surf and 
skateboard. "Women have a greater ability to be more competitive in 
snowboarding than surfing," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what appealed to Sara Sheen, a 20-year-old from Costa Mesa. Always 
looking for a new recreation, Sheen, who also teaches aerobics, tried surfing 
and skateboarding but wasn't impressed. Snowboarding, however, eventually felt 
right, even though her first outings were difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd recommend trying it twice, not once," she says. "You fall down all the 
time in the beginning, it's not fun. But then you catch on somehow and there's 
not as much pain. You stop landing on your butt all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about it now are all the tricks and maneuvers. To me, it's like 
dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the tension between skiers and snowboarders, Sheen has seen her share. 
Like Brown and Saunders, she's been yelled at and joked about while in lift 
lines. Sheen has also seen fights, as has Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we both bother each other," she says. "It's too bad, but I don't 
thing we like each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Evers won't go that far, believing that a little respect on both sides can 
mean a lot. "They (snowboarders) aren't going to go away, skiers have to 
understand that. But (snowboarders should) realize that we were there first and 
we're not going away either." Where to Get on 'Board 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a sampling of ski resorts, and whether they allow snowboarding, 
according to Sportours.

'MEMORY DRUGS' STILL NEED YEARS OF TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ampakine, the drug that helped rats learn and remember in experiments 
conducted at UC Irvine, has a long way to go before it can be prescribed for 
humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers hope that the drug will reduce memory loss in mild cases of 
dementia, such as early Alzheimer's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 JoAnn McConnell of the Alzheimer's Assn. says it's "very theoretical" that the 
drug will help Alzheimer's patients. "The big problem in Alzheimer's is the 
(brain) cells are dying," McConnell says. "Even if you improve communication 
between them, it isn't going to prevent them from dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on people are expected to begin in mid-1994.  
</P>
<P>
 The chemical -- developed by brain scientists Gary Lynch of UC Irvine, Gary 
Rogers of UC Santa Barbara and Ursula Staubli of New York University -- creates 
a new class of drug believed to work directly on the brain process that creates 
memory. Cognex, the only drug now approved for treatment of Alzheimer's 
disease, works indirectly by blocking enzymes that destroy substances needed 
for memory.  
</P>
<P>
 Allan A. Steigrod, president of Cortex Pharmaceuticals of Irvine, said that 
even if all tests are successful, it will be at least five years before his 
firm can market the drug.  
</P>
<P>
 Cortex is developing the drug under license from the University of California. 
The firm, created in 1987, includes Lynch and two other UC Irvine professors -- 
Carl W. Cotman and Ralph A. Bradshaw -- among its founders. STEVE EMMONS

GILOT: ACCEPTING AN HONOR WITH STYLE; WIFE OF JONAS SALK AND FORMER LOVER OF 
PABLO PICASSO GETS THE SEVERIN WUNDERMAN MUSEUM'S JEAN COCTEAU AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the former live-in love of Pablo Picasso, wife of Dr. Jonas Salk and an 
artist in her own right, Francoise Gilot knows a thing or two about style. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her personal style and role in the arts, the Severin Wunderman 
Museum in Irvine chose Gilot as the recipient of its 1994 Jean Cocteau 
International Style Award. About 110 guests paid $50 each to attend a Saturday 
ceremony and a lecture by Gilot at the Westin South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa 
following a showing of Gilot's exhibit, "Mythology of the Gods," at the museum. 
Modern Goddess 
</P>
<P>
 To observers, Gilot has lived a life as charmed as one of the Greek gods she 
paints. She lived with Picasso for 10 years, she married the doctor who 
perfected a vaccine for polio, and her daughter, Paloma, is an internationally 
known style-setter and designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, style is essentially doing things well. If you want to be outrageous, 
be outrageous with style. If you want to be restrained, be restrained with 
style," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can't specifically define style. It's like the perfume to a flower. It's 
a quality you can't analyze." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of France who now lives in La Jolla with Salk, Gilot understands the 
American versus European approach to style. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about the American woman is she usually has a lot of dynamism. In 
the U.S., women have a tendency to go forward, to be more exaggerated than in 
Europe. Many times the rough ideas come from the States, then they are refined 
in Europe. The American women and the French women are still the best-dressed." 
Spirit of Cocteau 
</P>
<P>
 After viewing Gilot's paintings at the museum of gods and goddesses, guests 
headed to the Westin for tea, finger sandwiches and a slide presentation by 
Gilot that charted the influence of Greek mythology on art through the 
centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francoise Gilot has an incredible presence that comes from deep inside," said 
Arianna Huffington, emcee of the award ceremony. "She's been through a lot of 
experiences, but there's also been a lot of pain, which is where her wisdom 
comes from." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has written a tell-all biography of Picasso and a new book on "The 
Gods of Greece" illustrated with many of Gilot's works. Huffington, a native of 
Greece, attended with her husband Rep. Michael Huffington (R-Santa Barbara). 
</P>
<P>
 The Jean Cocteau Style Award is given to those who style and art reflect the 
spirit of Cocteau, an artist, poet, writer, filmmaker and set designer. The 
museum has the largest collection of Cocteau's art. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilot was the perfect choice for the award, said museum executive director 
Tony Clark, who presented the award. Like Cocteau, Gilot has worked in all 
kinds of medium. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's so multifaceted," Clark said. "She's been a novelist, an art critic, an 
artist. She refuses to be put in a box." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilot was a friend of Cocteau, and both shared a strong affinity for Greek 
mythology, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how you feel about their art, with Cocteau and Gilot above all you 
will say, 'They have style,' " Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending included museum founder Severin Wunderman; Jean-Claude Terrac, 
cultural attache from the French consulate in Los Angeles and his wife Solveig; 
Jonas Salk (who arrived for a post-tea dinner at Diva with his wife and select 
friends); Judy Fluor Runels, Joy Tash and Jacques Wizman. KATHRYN BOLD

A YOUNG STAR IS BORN IN 'PIANO'; MOVIES: NOVICE ANNA PAQUIN, 11, WHO HAS 
RECEIVED A GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATION FOR BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, RETRACES THE 
FAIRY-TALE ROAD SHE HAS TRAVELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood's A-list actors and directors generally place a high premium on 
awards. But to 11-year-old New Zealander Anna Paquin whose first screen 
performance as Holly Hunter's daughter in Jane Campion's "The Piano" earned her 
a Golden Globe best supporting actress nomination and a shared prize from the 
L.A. Film Critics, the honors are just another curve in the fairy-tale road 
she's traveled since landing the role. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed as to whether the experience has made a marked difference in her 
life, she throws up her hands. "If you could give me my life without it, I 
would tell you," she observes philosophically in her first and only press 
interview. "But, that's not the case." 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles to shoot a series of MCI commercials, Paquin is alternately shy 
and forthcoming, childlike and precocious, depending on the subject at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask about her dramatic technique, her co-stars Hunter, Harvey Keitel and Sam 
Neill, or her opinion of the highly acclaimed film -- the story of a mute 
Scottish woman involved in a highly charged love triangle in 19th-Century New 
Zealand -- and Paquin merely shrugs. But when it comes to delineating the chain 
of events that led her to the project, she rambles on nonstop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, my sister ran into a friend who had seen a story in the paper 
announcing auditions for the part," says Paquin who, despite the California 
sunshine, is sporting a green turtleneck, red sweater and floral hat in an 
effort to fight off the flu. "Though I never acted before, when I heard both of 
them were trying out, I wanted to go, too. My father said if I was interested 
I'd have to ring up myself. 'Come to blah, blah, blah at such-and-such a 
place,' they told me. They needed to find girls who looked the right way. 'Too 
tall, too this, too that' . . . You had to be able to pass -- or, at least, be 
short enough -- to be Holly Hunter's daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Five thousand girls showed up for the session. Paquin, as one of three 
finalists, was instructed to return in two days to read a passage. Memorizing 
posed no problems, she asserts, and the taping went without a hitch. A few 
weeks later, she was called back for a workshop/audition in Auckland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We found out later that she already had the part," recalls the 44-year-old 
Brian Paquin, a tall, down-to-earth physical education teacher who insisted on 
monitoring the interview. "After viewing her tape, they knew they had their 
person -- she read the speech almost as well as in the movie, I was told. Anna 
wanted it and really went for it. The workshop was scheduled only to see if she 
could handle the stress of a workday." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Paquin recalls being "a bit excited, though not terribly nervous" at the 
prospect of tackling the role and "probably more naive than most." The part 
called on her not only to deliver her own lines but, frequently, to serve as 
her mother's interpreter in the speaking world. During rehearsals, the young 
actress took up sign language and had to master a Scottish accent. Dialogue 
coach Edward Campbell came to her house every week or so, Scottish soap operas 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Miramax production notes call the accent "the hardest thing about 
becoming Flora," the actress begs to differ. "That's not true," she protests 
vehemently. "They (Miramax) never asked me!" Still, when the reporter asks for 
a sample, the youngster immediately clams up. "Waitresses in restaurants, 
people all over have been asking Anna to perform," interjects her father, whose 
mission, as he sees it, is to keep life for Anna, his wife, Mary, and their two 
other children as normal as possible. "We're trying to avoid the trained seal 
syndrome, the dog jumping through the hoop." 
</P>
<P>
 Her colleagues have called her "fearless," a concept to which she doesn't 
relate. More to the point, says her father, who joined her on the set, she's 
"an intelligent child who picks up intuitively what's going on. Anna takes 
direction, but fills in the gaps quite nicely by herself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the movie to work, the relationship between mother and daughter -- 
strangers in a strange land -- had to be inordinately close. Hanging out with 
Hunter off-camera helped Paquin to cement the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I went to New Zealand, I had a lot of anxiety about who would be 
playing my daughter," allows Hunter, who still exchanges letters with her young 
charge. "If we didn't have a connection, I didn't know if I could handle the 
extra workload. You may or may not like an adult actor, but, with certain 
choices and a learned professionalism, you can usually pull together a 
chemistry on-screen. With children, though, it's impossible to lie. Their 
priorities are less formulated and the responses uncensored. This was a gamble 
but, as it happened, a magical one." 
</P>
<P>
 If Paquin is taking her newfound success in stride, she's not above reveling 
in the fact that a certain ballet teacher who once dismissed her has now 
changed her tune. 
</P>
<P>
 "She played favorites," she explains. "If you weren't going to be a prima 
ballerina, she wouldn't pay you any attention. I was always a back dancer. I 
played a skunk in one performance in which my brother was Prince Charming. The 
teacher now conducts a weekly session in my gymnastics class and she treats me 
slightly differently. She even tells me if my toes aren't pointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Father and daughter will not discuss the future -- or whether acting will 
figure into it. No offers have come their way, he says, so no decisions have to 
be made. Their focus, they insist, is fixed on the present.  
</P>
<P>
 Big deal or not, the Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 22 are of more than passing 
interest since "they sort of lead up to the Oscars -- which I highly doubt I'll 
win," she maintains. As for the Oscars, "I just want to get nominated. At the 
very worst, get nominated." In February she'll be starting sixth grade at a new 
school in Wellington ("the capital city of the north isle") -- a prospect 
Paquin finds more daunting than plunging into "The Piano." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know anything about making movies before," the young actress says. 
"It's not as glamorous as it seems -- especially when you have to do something 
many, many times. My favorite scene, playing football with a cabbage in the 
mud, never got in. For that matter, neither did my least favorite one: sitting 
in a freezing cold stream. And it's difficult to judge the film based on what 
I've been allowed to see of it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Anna was initially cast, father and child had no premonition it would 
become a major motion picture. Campion had a fine reputation, the elder Paquin 
acknowledges. But, who would imagine she'd walk off with best director trophies 
from the L.A. and New York film critics, that the "The Piano" would win the 
Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival or that Hunter would pull off a best 
actress sweep? 
</P>
<P>
 "Jane's work has been primarily art-house stuff rather than mass appeal," he 
says. "When I saw the rushes for this movie, I thought it was primarily for the 
European market with some interest in Australia because of the content. I told 
my mother in Winnipeg, Canada, that, if we're lucky, it might come to her local 
theater in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, we're dealing with 'Jurassic Piano,' " he says, flashing a smile. 
"Fortunately for us who are trying to keep Anna a kid a while longer, New 
Zealand is pretty removed from it all."

ANYTHING FOR A LAUGH?; COMEDY: STAND-UP VETERANS PUSH THE ENVELOPE, BUT IT'S A 
PERSONAL DECISION, NOT ONE FOR THE CENSORS, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The audience is roaring. Peals of laughter are echoing off the walls of Igby's 
comedy club. Eyes are tearing, and knees are being slapped. Dennis Wolfberg is 
talking about his colon. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran stand-up comedian often closes his sets with an excruciatingly 
funny 10 minutes on an excruciatingly invasive colon exam he suffered through 
some years back. A slapstick pastiche of unsympathetic nurses, breezy doctors 
and gigantic medical implements, it's not the kind of material anybody could 
make funny, or would attempt to. But, for Wolfberg, it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did that bit on 'The Tonight Show,' and it was a major turning point in my 
career. I'm now shallow enough to admit that I'd go after a joke anywhere," he 
says with a chuckle. "My material generally comes from my personal experiences 
and my family and is usually self-deprecating. That's what I'm comfortable 
doing. But I also have great admiration for comics who can get laughs with 
subjects I wouldn't touch in a million years. Virtually anything can be funny." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a sometimes thin-skinned society, virtually anything can offend. One 
person's colon joke can easily be another's vulgarity. While most comics 
cherish their right to do or say anything for a laugh, performers must decide 
how much of themselves they're willing to reveal on stage, how hard they're 
willing to push an audience and what they're willing to do for the sake of 
comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, stand-up comedy is all about telling a secret that people are thinking 
but no one's saying out loud," says Bill Maher, host of Comedy Central's 
freewheeling, comic talk show "Politically Incorrect." "If you capture that, 
then anything can be funny. There are a lot of issues you need to tread 
carefully on, but sometimes the best disinfectant for a messy topic is 
sunlight, and it's comedy's job to be that sunlight. Society's in trouble when 
comics don't take advantage of free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Issues of censorship and freedom of speech are currently hot as debates swirl 
around proposed curbs on violent imagery in video games, FCC decency clauses, 
campus speech codes and terms of political correctness. In this climate of 
battling sensibilities, the nation's comics may be offering a working system of 
self-regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, audience response makes every comic his or her own best censor. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Charles Fleischer is known for his wildly improvisational routines, 
and he guides his antics with a simple set of principles. "A comic can only go 
by his own perspective. When I'm working, I don't worry about offending anybody 
else, only about offending myself. What offends me is anything that messes with 
the innocence of children or animals. That's the area I won't go into for a 
laugh. Beyond that, I think it's sometimes good to offend people. It wakes them 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Curry targets his tales of tweaked reality toward a broad audience. The 
star of "Hangin' With Mr. Cooper" and host of "Showtime at the Apollo" has an 
easygoing and likable persona on comedy club stages, but he says he's 
occasionally lost an audience's good will when harsher material misfired. He's 
also learned how to climb out of any holes he digs himself into. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go too far with an audience, I can come back. If an audience goes silent 
on me, I'll play it off by becoming one of them -- switching into my comedy 
patron voice and saying, 'Boy, that Curry's no Seinfeld.' Or maybe I'll just 
tell an audience to deal with it. Personally, I won't do anything that demeans 
black people for a laugh, but other than that I'm on stage to talk about what I 
want to talk about. If the audience disagrees with me, they have the right to 
sit there, look mean and not laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 As a stand-up performer and star of "Grace Under Fire," Brett Butler believes 
that risk-taking is precisely what keeps comedy vital. She is disheartened when 
she sees comics backing away from material for fear of offending a crowd. 
"Stand-up comedy is a great American art form, but the scourge of stand-up is 
the craving for conformity. Too many comics think that getting on stage is the 
end of the risk, and they take the road more traveled. Comedy should celebrate 
uniqueness and inconsistency." 
</P>
<P>
 While developing her barbed wit on the comedy club scene, Butler discovered a 
valuable comedic alternative to self-censorship: Comics may not have to tone 
down their message if they can repackage the messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was often told by club owners that I was too dark, too political and too 
profane. I eventually responded by bleaching my hair and smiling a lot more on 
stage. I told the same jokes, and the crowds suddenly thought they were 
hilarious. It made me wonder who was zooming who." 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy is taken care of by a free market," says Penn Jillette, the speaking 
half of the twisted comedy-magic team Penn & Teller and the voice of Comedy 
Central. On that channel, he is currently presenting an open letter to Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno, who has spoken in favor of curtailing violent imagery on 
television. In the spot, he and Teller helpfully point out the difference 
between stage blood and real blood and make a pitch for an artist's right to 
"give people a rage to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo's stage shows have been known to make use of copious quantities of 
fake blood in the service of violent illusions. There are limits to what 
they'll do on stage, but they are based more on competition than taste. "I'm 
personally interested in sex, and I love dirty jokes, but I don't do them on 
stage because other people do them better. If you talk about love and sex and 
dating, you're going head-to-head with Shakespeare and Albert Brooks. We stick 
with violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Jillette feels that his open letter merely seconds the feelings of one of the 
country's Founding Fathers. "The best line for Janet actually came from 
Benjamin Franklin, who said, 'Those who sacrifice liberty in the name of safety 
deserve neither.' Performers have the right to say what they want to, and 
anyone paying money has the right to accept or reject the art and entertainment 
that's available. Teller and I do what we do because we have something to say, 
not because we want to shock. Our audience understands that, and the people who 
are upset by us don't have to be in our audience." 
</P>

 Bill Hicks came up short in a clash of comedic tastes last year when a bit he 
did for the Letterman show was deemed too hot for broadcast television. But he 
sees no reason to soften his satirical jabs. "The only way to do comedy is to 
speak from the heart and do what makes you laugh. People appreciate emotional 
honesty, whether they agree with your point of view or not. I like to be 
shocked and surprised, so I'm out there trying to shock and surprise myself."

 Even some comics known for scrupulously clean material support their 
colleagues who choose to push the envelope of acceptability. "I've had children 
and archbishops in my audience and haven't had to change a thing," says veteran 
comic David Brenner. "That's my preference. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wouldn't want anyone to walk into a club and say they were shutting the 
show down because I hadn't cursed in 10 years, and I don't think it should go 
the other way either." 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that differences of taste among comics, and audiences, will 
persist as long as comedy does. Every newly uttered punch line may delight 
someone and offend someone else. The offended may want to stifle the laughs, 
but Bill Maher says that any attempt to quell comic speech may simply result in 
stronger material for the comics. 
</P>
<P>
 "A restrictive mood is usually good for comedy, because it gives us something 
to rebel against. We love that. There's no way any censor can really win with a 
comic. We'll always have the last word, and, more importantly, the funnier 
word."

RICK DU BROW: 'SOUTH CENTRAL': THE RIGHT TIME, THE RIGHT STUFF; TELEVISION: 
WITH THE L.A. RIOTS AND THE KING AND DENNY CASES IN THE PAST, THE SERIES WILL 
LIKELY BE WEIGHED FOR ITS QUALITY -- NOTHING ELSE. AND A GOOD THING, TOO -- 
IT'S GOT ENOUGH GOING FOR IT.

<P>
 Television pilots are a dime a dozen but "South Central" was clearly different 
and provocative from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the traditional half-hour comedy length, but actually far more of a 
dramedy about a struggling black family in the Los Angeles community, it faced 
a tough road. 
</P>
<P>
 The series finally begins pre-production for the Fox Broadcasting Co. in 
February after getting an order for nine additional episodes -- a sizable 
commitment in today's nervous TV environment -- and the network and producers 
say it will probably premiere around April. 
</P>
<P>
 But when "South Central" surfaced last year as a possible CBS entry -- billed 
by that network as a comedy contender -- it was only a year after the Los 
Angeles riots, with the high-tension Rodney G. King and Reginald O. Denny cases 
still unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the intentions of the creators not to trivialize life in the L.A. 
neighborhood, there was some perception -- including from yours truly -- that 
the show might be seen as exploiting the setting and name of the well-known 
area at a touchy moment in time. In addition, there was the unknown factor of 
whether there would be further fallout from the volatile period that might make 
the comedy format seem inappropriate.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, a year has passed since CBS first considered "South Central"; 
the King and Denny cases no longer await an edgy public and the TV series will 
likely be judged wholly for its quality -- nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 And a good thing, too. For with Tina Lifford playing a principled, 35-year-old 
mother of three who is trying to steer her family to a decent life despite 
often-trying conditions, "South Central" has enough going for it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I viewed the pilot again the other day for the first time since last 
year, somehow the lack of added tension from the high-profile cases of 1993 
worked -- at least for me -- in the show's favor. The sense of the ordinary -- 
from the family's natural interplay to the daily neighborhood hassles -- was a 
plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fox and "South Central's" creators and executive producers, Ralph 
Farquhar and Michael Weithorn, seem in agreement that the network did not delay 
the debut of the series to allow more time to pass since last year's tense Los 
Angeles situation. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Farquhar and Weithorn had been enlisted by Fox to work on its 
"Sinbad" sitcom, which is why the previously announced "South Central" series 
is just getting underway, with shooting set to begin in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Weithorn says that the longer elapsed time between last year's real-life 
racial troubles and the debut of "South Central" was not a factor: 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the network did not delay the show for that reason. They were in 
trouble on the 'Sinbad' show and asked us to take that show over. And we did so 
very reluctantly. And we got some concessions out of them for 'South Central' 
-- that it would air by mid-April. They had said at one point that one of the 
possibilities was that it would air next summer, and that's a difficult time 
for a new show to get launched." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that "the incidents and uprising had brought the concept 
of South-Central (Los Angeles) into public consciousness," Weithorn says he and 
Farquhar didn't think it was "relevant as to whether the series catches on. 
It's dependent on the characters and whether people invest themselves 
emotionally in the world we've created in the show. And that's independent of 
how much South-Central issues are in the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, I guess I prefer that we're not airing in the midst of the 
trials because I wouldn't want to invite the thought that we were trying to 
capitalize on a hot issue," Weithorn adds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Says Farquhar: "I don't think the network types are any more at ease with the 
subject matter of 'South Central' now than they would have been four or five 
months ago. But I think what's happened in the meantime is that people want a 
higher quality show." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the challenge of doing "South Central," Farquhar says: "We invite the 
skeptics. We want to surprise them. And we want to have that universe of 
South-Central available to us, all the ups and downs." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox Entertainment Group, is blunt about the 
timing of "South Central's" arrival: "The racial climate in Los Angeles had 
absolutely nothing to do with the launch. If anything, there was some concern 
on the other side, that the urgency of this series might be mitigated as time 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm comfortable that if we get it on the air in the next three or four 
months, we will still have a socially relevant TV series. We also think it's a 
show for all seasons. Our position has been to support Ralph and Michael in 
whatever it is their vision dictates. Obviously, we are concerned about 
broad-based appeal. But all great TV series are true to a singular vision." 
</P>
<P>
 Farquhar and Weithorn seem to have been tenacious in sticking to their vision 
of what "South Central" should be. Before landing on Fox, they split with CBS 
because that network apparently wanted a broader comedy. Says Peter Tortorici, 
executive vice president of CBS Entertainment: 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make a decision on whether you're doing a comedy or a drama. 
There's room at both ends to push the form, as in shows like 'All in the 
Family,' 'MASH' and 'Roseanne.' And I was looking for that mix in this form. I 
told them we can do an 'important' show or one that gets watched, and I don't 
think the two are mutually exclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Farquhar, CBS said the show was "brilliant" and then "chose not 
to pick it up." He recalls two phone calls an hour apart during the 
pilot-selection process. In the first, "They said they loved it, it was moving, 
it had a strong chance. An hour later, we were told it wasn't exactly what they 
were looking for, it wasn't funny, we misled them." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Weithorn: "We want to present the realities of life for this family. It 
does not idealize them or the world in which they live. If it were up to us, 
(the series) would not be presented to the public as a comedy. Our nightmare is 
that the network will do promos by taking three or four clips from shows with 
laughs, leading the public to expect 'Martin.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that the show will be judged as a show done in half an hour rather 
than as a sitcom. It will necessarily involve a more complex world and a higher 
level of melancholy."

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; 'MRS. DOUBTFIRE' STILL CLEANING UP

 No one in Hollywood expects January moviegoing to keep up the pace of the 
holiday season. On the other hand, no one thought moviegoing this January would 
be as strong as it is -- 10% better than the same week a year ago.And it's no 
wonder, what with the comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire" pulling in $11.5 million for the 
weekend -- a number that is more common for an opening weekend instead of a 
movie's seventh . Strong showings were registered by "The Pelican Brief," 
"Grumpy Old Men," "Tombstone" and "The Air Up There." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shadowlands," with Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger, expanded its 
modest-sized run and still generated numbers big enough to rank sixth. But the 
numbers were dismal for the openings of "Cabin Boy" with Chris Elliott (No. 13) 
and the action film "American Cyborg" (No. 22).

 Legal fees -- In a Dec. 4 article on a decision by the state Senate Rules 
Committee to help pay the legal defense costs of former Sen. Cecil Green, a 
committee source said that Green had been "bled dry" by legal fees in what the 
story called a "long series of lawsuits" brought by Walter E. White. The 
source's statement referred to Green's campaign committee funds, not personal 
funds. In addition, White filed two lawsuits naming Green, not "a long series."
