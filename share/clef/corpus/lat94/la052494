2 FOUND DEAD IN FIRE AT MCKINLEY MANSION; DESTRUCTION: THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE 
NEAR LAFAYETTE PARK WAS ABANDONED YEARS AGO. POLICE BELIEVE THE VICTIMS MAY 
HAVE BEEN AMONG THE TRANSIENTS WHO FREQUENTED IT.

<P>
 The bodies of two people believed to be transients were found in the charred 
wreckage of the McKinley Mansion, after fire gutted much of the boarded-up 
structure near Lafayette Park on Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the victims, the cause of their deaths and the cause of the 
fire were not immediately determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles firefighters said the blaze, reported at 6:09 a.m., was 
extinguished about half an hour later. One of the bodies was found on the 
second floor and the other in the third-floor attic. 
</P>
<P>
 The crumbling, 13,000-square-foot Italian Renaissance-style home at 3rd Street 
and Lafayette Park Place had been vacant for years. However, police say 
homeless transients often scaled the chain-link fence surrounding the spacious, 
weed-choked grounds to take up temporary residence there. 
</P>
<P>
 The ornate, 20-room house was built by a millionaire from Ohio in 1914 for use 
as a winter home. It is named for Mator McKinley, a wealthy mortuary owner who 
bought it in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 The city declared the house a cultural-historic monument in 1987, but that 
designation did little to forestall the mansion's continuing deterioration. 
Plans to move the house fell through, and it was boarded up after suffering 
earthquake damage.

 * On Mother's Day, The Times chose to print an opinion piece by an abortion 
advocate (Column Left, May 8).No surprise there. But, by continuing to identify 
Frances Kissling's so-called "Catholics for a Free Choice" without 
qualification or disclaimer, The Times is in complicity with a fraud. As the 
U.S. Catholic bishops recently stated, "Many people may be led to believe that 
it is an authentic Catholic organization. It is not. It has no affiliation, 
formal or otherwise, with the Catholic Church," and "merits no recognition or 
support as a Catholic organization."

LET BLOCK PURSUE REFORM PROMISES; SHERIFF, WITH WORTHY AGENDA, DESERVES 4TH 
TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 70, Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, after an apparently 
successful battle with cancer, is running for his fourth term. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time he faces five opponents, some of them plausible and attractive. 
And the five all agree on one thing: Block has been in office too long and a 
change is needed. They have a point, but Block's reply that the Sheriff's 
Department is currently under immense pressure to reform and that he needs more 
time to see the revision through is valid, too. 
</P>
<P>
 When Block last ran for reelection, his department had just been shaken by a 
major narcotics scandal. Confidence in him was not at an all-time high. Today 
he can claim to have attacked that problem; he can also point to a measure of 
success in working with the Kolts Commission, created two years ago to 
recommend reforms for the department and to monitor whether they are being 
carried forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Block no doubt views this election as his last and wants another term so he 
can go out on an upbeat note. Does he deserves this chance? Block is a 
nationally respected law enforcement professional whose quiet demeanor and 
bespectacled appearance mask knowledgeability, pride and commitment. Almost all 
of his opponents make good points and impressive presentations (Block and his 
rivals gave their views recently on our Commentary page). But if Block can 
deliver, as he promises, on the Kolts reforms and can keep corruption out of 
the department, he will indeed have made a case for experience over change. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be especially true if he also works hard in two other key areas. One 
is pressing forward with the spirit of community policing: Get the department 
closer to the people. The second is improvement of relations with minority 
communities; in the past, relations between deputies and some Latino, African 
American, Asian and gay communities they patrol have been plain awful. These 
ties are improving, but must be made even better. 
</P>
<P>
 The five county supervisors also can help. With the additions of Gloria Molina 
and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, the board is already less likely to automatically 
go along in order to get along. That quality would come in handy if for any 
reason a victorious Block chose not to serve out the full four years of a new 
term. If that happens, the board should not follow the tradition of meekly 
accepting whatever replacement the incumbent sheriff puts forward. Instead, the 
board should initiate a national search for a replacement, or order a new 
election.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the greater activism among county supervisors and given Block's 
apparent commitment to reform, corruption control, community policing and 
minority relations -- and we'll be monitoring these areas carefully -- The 
Times endorses Sherman Block for reelection as sheriff.

SUBWAY WATCH; SMELLY PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new problem with Los Angeles' Red Line -- gases like potentially explosive 
methane and smelly hydrogen sulfide have been leaking into it -- will not make 
it any easier to convince the public that the city's new subway is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's gas leak story follows earlier reports in The Times that some tunnel 
segments of the subway's first leg, underneath Downtown, were built with 
concrete thinner than called for in the original design specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fact the subway is prone to gas leaks is much less of a 
surprise than the thin-concrete problem. Los Angeles was once the site of major 
oil fields, so subway designers knew that keeping gases out of the system would 
be a challenge. In fact, $2 million per mile has been spent to insulate the 
tunnels against gas, and gas detectors and additional ventilation were 
installed. But now it appears that more gas than predicted is getting in. Some 
of those involved in the subway project have suggested the problem is caused by 
the same unacceptable construction practices that produced the thin tunnel 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, that's unfortunate, but it would be well for would-be subway riders to 
remember that, as a result of the thin-wall flap, the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority asked a panel of independent engineering experts to 
inspect the tunnels. They recommended some repairs but also concluded the 
subway is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of the new problem should not have a major effect -- except to 
emphasize to MTA officials that they must be constantly vigilant to make sure 
the subway stays safe.

WELCOME BREEZE FROM THE NORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crisis that has been rapidly building over North Korea's suspected nuclear 
weapons program seems for now to have abated. Inspectors from the International 
Atomic Energy Agency have been sent to Pyongyang to see what they can learn 
about the refueling of a key reactor that is now under way. Washington, 
welcoming this and other recent signs hinting at a more cooperative attitude by 
the North, says that it's ready to reopen high-level contacts with Kim Il 
Sung's regime. 
</P>
<P>
 So for the moment at least the United States doesn't have to worry about 
trying to muster international support for economic sanctions against a country 
that, at a minimum, seems to have done all it can to encourage the belief that 
it has been violating the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. How long that 
moment will last is up to Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 The key question is whether North Korea will let IAEA inspectors examine 
several hundred specifically chosen fuel rods from its five-megawatt reactor at 
Yongbyon, north of Pyongyang. By analyzing certain rods the IAEA could tell how 
long they had been in the reactor, and that in turn would indicate whether 
other fuel rods had earlier been secretly removed. There's a suspicion, 
heightened in the last few days by the claims in Tokyo of a North Korean 
defector who once worked at the Yongbyon reprocessing plant, that 26 pounds of 
plutonium were secretly extracted from spent fuel rods in 1988. That supports 
the CIA's suspicion that the North has produced enough plutonium for a couple 
of nuclear devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is ready -- it wouldn't be too much to say eager -- to move 
toward normal relations with North Korea and so help stabilize Northeast Asia. 
Rightly, though, it conditions such a move on Pyongyang's readiness to meet its 
responsibilities under the Non-Proliferation Treaty. South Korea supports the 
American effort. If North Korea goes along, it could see its diplomatic and 
economic isolation end. If it balks, new pressures would fall on its weak 
economy. Enlightened self-interest makes the choice clear. The question is 
whether a regime that has for decades zealously preached the virtues of 
inward-looking self-reliance is able finally to recognize where its true 
long-term interests lie.

TEETH FOR DRIVER'S LICENSE LAW; KATZ BILL WOULD ALLOW SEIZURE OF CARS IF 
MOTORISTS LACK VALID LICENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The problem of motorists who have been banned from driving is one that feeds 
upon itself in chilling and costly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Point 1: Drivers whose licenses have been suspended or revoked (or who never 
obtained a license in the first place) subsequently commit most of the 
hit-and-run accidents in Los Angeles and Orange counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Point 2: Los Angeles and surrounding communities lead the state in the 
frequency of hit-and-run incidents, and California leads the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Point 3: Hit-and-run accidents account for such tragedies as last week's death 
of a Pacoima mother and her daughter. For police, these cases are 
time-consuming and difficult to solve. In addition, hit-and-run accidents pose 
the threat of higher insurance rates for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials estimate that there are as many as 2 million unlicensed 
drivers on the roads today. Unfortunately, existing law authorizes the 
forfeiture of cars only when the driver has been convicted of vehicular 
manslaughter or repeat drunk driving offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill moving through the Legislature would change that. The Safe Streets Act, 
by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), would authorize the permanent seizure 
of the vehicle of anyone caught driving with a revoked, suspended or expired 
license or no license at all. Drivers who could clear their records and 
first-time offenders who had loaned their cars to unlicensed drivers would get 
their cars back. All others would be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The Katz legislation comes up for a vote before the Assembly's Ways and Means 
Committee on Wednesday. We support the bill, with one reservation. It should 
not be extended to drivers with otherwise clean records who simply may not have 
noticed that their license recently expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, the proceeds from the sale of forfeited cars first would go 
toward storage costs and then would go to lien holders. Remaining sums would be 
divided among state and local agencies. The bill prohibits police from stopping 
vehicles for the sole purpose of determining whether the driver has a valid 
license. The legislation's main purpose would be to up the ante for getting 
behind the wheel without a valid license. The measure could well save lives.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: SELLING SOCIALISM ON THE NORTH COAST; A 
PRIMARY CANDIDATE TENDS THE HUSTINGS AND FINDS PEOPLE OPEN TO SOME UNORTHODOX 
APPROACHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To judge from the legislation they're trying to rush through Congress, most 
politicians reckon the voters want a steady diet of throw-away-the-key 
sentences for malefactors, plus an end to welfare.  
</P>
<P>
 What is it like down there in the trenches, making eye contact with the 
citizenry, seeking their support? My good friend Bruce Anderson is running for 
Fifth District supervisor in Mendocino County, in California's June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a huge slab of terrain, running from Gualala (100 miles north from San 
Francisco) up to touristy Mendocino Village, to Fort Bragg with its struggling 
mill workers, east to out-of-work loggers in Willits and Ukiah, and up in the 
hills the dope growers. This is beautiful country but economically depressed, 
with the two big earners being timber and marijuana. The more desirable 
portions of it are increasingly the preserve of the rich, comfortably deployed 
on their 160- to 320-acre parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is a socialist and the editor of the widely read and combative 
Anderson Valley Advertiser, to which I am a regular contributor. He's also a 
proved vote-getter, having run up 16,000 votes on the North Coast in 1990, the 
year mutinous citizens threw out Democrat Doug Bosco. Now the First 
Congressional District is held by Dan Hamburg (D-Ukiah), one of the more 
liberal reps in Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's program calls for eminent-domain takeover and local public 
management of corporate timber lands; rent control on residential and 
commercial property; reinvestment of county employees' pension funds in the 
county housing authority; a small-business "incubator," meaning business people 
can find the relevant bureaucracies under one roof. Anderson calls for no 
prosecution of families growing marijuana for cultivation of fewer than 50 
plants, which is the way it used to be with Dist. Atty. Joe Allen back in the 
middle-1970s. Anderson's campaign mailer also calls for "an end to the DA's 
so-called welfare-fraud unit, which basically persecutes and prosecutes welfare 
mothers for the crime of working to supplement their AFDC grants."  
</P>
<P>
 After several weeks of candidate forums -- there are seven active aspirants 
for the supervisor's slot -- plus campaigning in trailer parks, doing radio 
talk shows, Anderson says it's true: People mostly do want to talk about crime 
and so-called welfare fraud, often parroting exact phrases from the nightly 
network news shows.  
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to myth," he said, "there's no crime wave here. I read the sheriff's 
weekly printout for all the county and what I see are the same drunks, 
crankheads and lowlifes doing the same self-destructive things, week after 
week. The full-time criminal population is virtually nonexistent except for a 
few meth(amphetamine) manufacturers affiliated with the Hell's Angels in the 
Bay Area."  
</P>
<P>
 Phrases about "eminent domain" don't make much impact. But at a joint 
endorsement session of the International Woodworkers of America and the 
Carpenters' Local in Fort Bragg, Anderson did get an enthusiastic reaction from 
the crowd when he challenged the idea that environmentalists are the problem in 
timber country. To the contrary, he argued to a group that included at least 
two T-shirts bearing spotted-owl recipes that the true criminals are the big 
timber corporations ruled from Atlanta and Portland.  
</P>
<P>
 He got a warm welcome for the proposal that the holdings of Louisiana Pacific 
and Georgia Pacific should be confiscated "on the grounds that their short-term 
profit-taking has caused great harm to the people, streams and forests of 
Mendocino County, and Harry A. Merlo (chairman of Louisiana Pacific) should 
have been arrested for treason when he shipped our jobs, trees and mills out of 
Covelo and Potter Valley to Mexico."  
</P>
<P>
 There's almost no radical idea you can't get a cheer for in America as long as 
you put it in terms people can understand.  
</P>
<P>
 Anderson outlines his plan for reinvesting the county employees' fund in a 
county housing association, for low-interest mortgages for local people, 
affordable housing and a steady, secure income for the fund. This goes down 
very well.  
</P>
<P>
 Is there room for a socialist in the populist style?  
</P>
<P>
 "The choice here is the same as at the national level, between the fuzzy 
pseudo-liberals and the corporate surrogates. The ruling conservatives are all 
Farm Bureau types, reading manifestoes written for them by corporate timber. 
The local liberals are Clinton types. Plenty of high-minded rhetoric, but 
behind it they're greedy, grasping and sanctimonious.  
</P>
<P>
 "I find that there really is a strong sympathy for left populist ideas. The 
Democratic Party has conceded this whole terrain to the Rush Limbaugh right."

COLUMN RIGHT/ MICHAEL M. UHLMANN: A PLEA BARGAIN, A HEALTH PLAN -- A CONFLICT?; 
A MUTUAL LAWYER IS ONLY THE LATEST INTEREST THAT ROSTENKOWSKI AND CLINTON 
SHARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL M. UHLMANN, Michael M. Uhlmann is a senior fellow at the Ethics and 
Public Policy Center in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, the facts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The House Ways and Means Committee is the most powerful committee in 
Congress. Membership is highly prized and aggressively sought. Even junior 
members acquire a certain cachet among their colleagues. They also get noticed 
by lobbyists, who pay inordinate attention to what goes on in Ways and Means -- 
and to the political fortunes of its members. Not for nothing is the hallway 
outside the committee hearing room known as "Gucci Gulch." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Ways and Means chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) -- "Rosty" -- is 
one of Washington's most famous faces and a man no President can safely ignore. 
That's because the committee's jurisdiction includes the crown jewels of the 
modern state, including international trade, Social Security and welfare 
entitlements, tax bills of every description and health-care financing. 
President Clinton has become particularly dependent on Rostenkowski because his 
political future is staked on matters that must pass through Ways and Means 
before they become law. Clinton's only notable legislative achievements to 
date, the North American Free Trade Agreement and his tax bill, both owe their 
success to Rostenkowski's formidable clout. Nothing will happen on welfare 
reform unless Rostenkowski nods and, without him, Clinton's health-care reform 
proposal doesn't have a prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Not surprisingly, the President and the chairman have become political 
intimates. The President went out of his way to support Rostenkowski during a 
hotly contested primary earlier this year, even appearing at a Chicago 
fund-raiser. (Memory does not recall the last time a sitting President made a 
personal appearance during a congressional primary fight.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Rostenkowski has been in political hot water since 1992, when it was 
revealed that the U.S. attorney's office in Washington was investigating him 
for fraud, misuse of government funds and payroll padding. Rostenkowski denies 
the charges, but indications are that a felony indictment is near. Under the 
rules of the House, a felony indictment would require Rostenkowski to resign as 
Ways and Means chairman, a step that would almost certainly doom the 
President's prized health-care proposal. On the other hand, something less than 
a felony indictment would enable Rostenkowski not only to retain his 
chairmanship but also to avoid the shame and burden of grave criminal sanction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rostenkowski dismissed his first lawyer last year and retained Robert 
Bennett -- yes, the same respected criminal defense attorney who became a 
household name a few weeks ago when the President tapped him to defend against 
Paula Corbin Jones' sexual-harassment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rostenkowski investigation is clearly headed toward its denouement. 
Plea-bargaining is under way between Bennett and the Justice Department, 
although it is not clear who is negotiating for the government. One story has 
it that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno will follow the recommendation of the U.S. 
attorney, come what may. Another has it that Bennett, dissatisfied with 
progress at lower levels, is seeking to take the negotiation "upstairs" within 
the department. But neither the ordinarily garrulous Bennett, nor Reno nor the 
White House is commenting directly. The major participants, in short, are being 
unusually mum about one of the more dramatic events now on the Washington 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Do you suppose the White House might have a political interest in the outcome 
of the plea-bargaining with Rostenkowski? Do you think it likely that someone 
in the White House may have spoken to someone in the Justice Department about 
it? Do you think it likely that the President has spoken with his counsel (or 
vice versa) about it? What do you suppose goes through the minds of Justice 
Department political appointees when the man they know to be the President's 
personal lawyer negotiates on behalf of the President's most powerful ally on 
Capitol Hill? 
</P>
<P>
 What do you suppose Clinton's lawyer is saying to Rostenkowski's lawyer about 
all this? To avoid a conflict or an appearance of a conflict, it is sometimes 
necessary for one lawyer to wall himself from others in the same firm, but how 
does an attorney erect a Chinese Wall within his own brain? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anything about the foregoing bother you? If a non-felony plea bargain is 
negotiated, would you be surprised? Before that happens, don't you think it 
would be a good idea if the press started asking some hard questions?

DOWNTIME: AIDS GIVES HIM NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By PAUL MIGNOLI, West Hollywood

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I think of "Downtime," it forces me to once again redefine another term 
and how it applies to my situation. I have AIDS; so many things have different 
meanings than they once did. 
</P>
<P>
 Because my time is limited, and the days are long, I hate to think of any time 
as being wasted. There are days when I do absolutely nothing out of necessity, 
so when I can, I spend my downtime taking long walks with the dog. I let him 
run wild without a leash, bouncing from one well-manicured lawn to another. It 
doesn't matter that I may get a ticket, for the joy on his face is worth any 
price. I love to take a ride in the convertible, sometimes going nowhere, just 
the wind in my hair and the sun keeping me warm. I close my eyes and like to 
imagine a world where compassion runs rampant and no one hates or judges.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: THERE'S NO PLACE FOR EDDIE AT THE LAPD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Scene: Sunday night at Mann's Chinese Theatre, for the premiere of 
"Beverly Hills Cop III," starring Eddie Murphy as the lovable ninja cop from 
Detroit. Who needs Westec with this guy around? The Paramount Pictures release 
opens Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The party on the Paramount lot featured a street fair complete with Ferris 
wheel, ring toss, stuffed animals and a bandstand. So what if the streets were 
lined with New York brownstones and Madison Avenue storefronts? The event 
raised $100,000 for the United Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You Never Know These Days: The squad car at the entrance was somebody's idea 
of a party favor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ferris wheel drew a big crowd, even though the film features an 
amusement-ride disaster in which Murphy's character leaps from car to car to 
save small children. "I admire Eddie," said actor-director Robert Townsend, 
"but at least I can claim that I do all my own stunts." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: Stars Murphy, Theresa Randle, Bronson Pinchot and director John 
Landis were feted by Wesley Snipes, Vanessa Bell-Calloway, Andrew Dice Clay, 
Natalie Cole, Debbie Allen, Terence Trent D'Arby and Sugar Ray Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams appeared broad-shouldered and capable. He 
wouldn't hire Murphy for the LAPD, he joked, "but give me some of those 
high-tech weapons!" (We're assuming he meant some of those Uzis that aren't 
able to hit good guys, rather than the Boombox-Toaster-Flamethrower.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Get a Clue: Along Came Mary catered a cuisine of peach barbecued ribs, fried 
chicken, potato salad and slaw, with Rice Krispie squares and candy apples for 
dessert. More frightening than the squad car. The pasta bar was working 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scarier Still: Wayne Newton was the best-dressed person in attendance, 
downright imposing in a charcoal suit, lemon shirt, cuffs and collar. Co-star 
Randle also cut a figure in diaphanous white, while everyone else seemed to 
have dashed out of the brownstones for a carton of milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entertaining: Deejay Michael Nesmith careened smartly from Salt N' Pepa on 
back to '70s George Clinton. 
</P>

 Wave of the Future: Child group Immature, three swaggering 10-year-olds in 
baggy denim and John Lennon sunglasses, who conclude interviews with a hug and

BOOK REVIEW / ESSAYS; A FLUID VOYAGE OF CRYSTAL BLUE PERSUASION; ON WATER BY 
THOMAS FARBER ; ECCO, $20, 183 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I n the deep blue off Diamond Head, running downwind before the howling 
trades, kayak all too eager to pitchpole, to broach. The waves, also 
wind-inspired, giving chase. A following sea.  
</P>
<P>
 These three sentences form an entire chapter in "On Water," Thomas Farber's 
collection of ruminations on his chosen element. It is a book to read instead 
of actually being in the water, not to gain information about the ocean or 
about Farber's life. To read it on the beach would be redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reading water . . , " Farber writes, and then drifts off, just like that. 
Then he quotes Italo Calvino, then Pablo Neruda, then a fellow surfer. "Eh?" 
you yell back across your board, bobbing in the surf off the coast of Hawaii, 
the South Pacific or California. He needn't finish that thought, he's moved on 
to another: "It may be necessary," he yells back, quoting Lyall Watson, "to 
think of water as an organism in its own right. . . ." A riot of parentheses, 
Walt Whitman comes to mind and leaves . . . "Out so long," writes Farber, "one 
(almost) forgets to come in." You feel a little chilly. 
</P>
<P>
 The waves have taken him over completely. Farber writes in a cycle of lulls 
and sets, and thinks in a tidal pattern. This collection of ruminations on 
water is only the second time I have read an author who seems to have become 
the natural element he writes about. (The first time was reading Charles 
Bowden's "The Sonoran Desert," in which he seems to fold himself into the 
desert, embodying all its space and bitterness.) 
</P>
<P>
 Decades ago, the Sierra Club published a series of books on wilderness that 
made their way into backpacks and onto coffee tables and bookshelves across the 
country. They were often a combination of quotations and photographs and some 
text by the author. One in particular -- "On the Loose," by Terry and Renny 
Russell -- became a sort of bible, not so much read as incorporated, not so 
much memorized as inhaled. If you were trapped in the city, this book could 
re-create the experience of camping in the Western wilderness, subtly, 
subliminally capturing those things that would catch in the corner of one's 
eye: the veins in an outcropping of rock over a river, dusty boots, the flash 
of a red truck. All juxtaposed with quotes from Ecclesiastes, Homer, Whitman 
and Aldo Leopold.  
</P>
<P>
 In "On Water," Farber's language and meaning are so densely intertwined that 
he re-creates the experience of being in the water without the help of 
photographs. If there were photographs, they would be the kind in which you see 
the edges of the fisheye lens and feel yourself trapped inside the camera as 
the water splashes on the glass.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a graceful (fluid!) writer can pull this off -- to write about whatever 
you want, to wander all over the map, to present information in no other 
perceptible way than how your own mind works, to pull readers through that 
labyrinth and keep their eyes on the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 There is some raw information here (although it must be said again that one 
reads this book for the feeling of the water). We learn, for example, that we 
are two-thirds water, "ten to fifteen gallons in most of us (human brains are 
three-quarters liquid, bones more than 20 percent liquid, the just-formed fetus 
nearly entirely water)"; how to drown properly; why seawater is so mysterious, 
and the role cowries have played in human history.  
</P>
<P>
 There's also a little bit of autobiography here -- memories of the waters of 
Farber's childhood in Boston, something about a family and saying something 
that hurts someone -- but Farber is probably three-quarters water and only 
one-quarter human flesh where memory is stored, so ruminations on his own life 
are kept to a fairly obscure minimum.  
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you, God," Farber writes. "For what? Oh, for this pulsing undulating, 
shimmering, sighing, breathing plasma of an ocean. For the miracle of warm 
water. For rideable waves and no wind." It may be a marketing trick, but I 
swear the book smells like seaweed.

ART THE WAY JOE STALIN LIKED IT; RUSSIAN MUSEUM DISPLAYS WORKS OF A CLOSED 
SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT BIVENS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What sort of art did Josef Stalin like best? Some answers: a bronze statue of 
a Greek athlete, beautifully proportioned, muscles rippling as he raises his 
discus above his head in victory -- and nearly bursts his tight-fitting shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Or a lovely black lacquered box painted carefully in the Russian folk 
tradition -- of men with jackhammers slung over their shoulders in a 
composition titled "Glory to the Miners!" 
</P>
<P>
 Both are on display at St. Petersburg's Russian Museum, part of one of the 
most intriguing and entertaining collections of artwork assembled here since 
perestroika.  
</P>
<P>
 "Agitation for Happiness: Soviet Art of the Stalinist Epoch" gathers works 
from 1930 to 1950 -- a period "short and, in the opinion of many, far from 
artistically faultless," according to Evgenniya Petrova, the show's organizer. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a Soviet artist was never more confining than during that 20-year 
period. Artists were expected, in Stalin's words, to concentrate on a single 
theme: "A majestic theme -- the theme of the hero of our times. The hero of the 
Stalinist epoch is unlike the heroes of all other ages: He is marked by 
activity and modesty, moral cleanliness and exactingness, nobility and 
constancy." 
</P>
<P>
 The most heroic subject of all, of course, was the Great One himself, and 
"Agitation for Happiness" struts more than its share of Stalins: Stalin staring 
ahead purposefully, Stalin with binoculars calling artillery adjustments at the 
front, Stalin drawing a line in pencil along a map while generals watch in 
adoration, Stalin graciously receiving the applause of a multi-cultural crowd 
("Glory to the Great Stalin"), Stalin schmoozing with pretty young women 
("Leader, Teacher and Friend").  
</P>
<P>
 There is far less Lenin to be seen, although his bust or statue hovers in the 
background of most of the Stalin portraits, like a guardian angel squinting 
down upon his chosen successor. 
</P>
<P>
 If the era on display was artistically stunted, the exhibition manages to be 
intelligent and varied. It includes not only paintings and drawings -- some the 
size of a postcard, others larger than a dump truck -- but also sculptures, 
vases, china cups and alarm clocks. Such was the tenor of those times, when, 
according to Petrova, "a jewelry box, a tea service and a painting all had only 
one purpose: to mark the grandiosity and greatness of the particular historical 
moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Petrova spent six months assembling the show, which runs through May. Many of 
the works on display have languished in the museum's vaults since the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition also includes period posters, newspapers and pamphlets, rousing 
piped-in music from the 1940s and '50s, and even a hall dedicated to art about 
holidays, where visitors can dance on a gazebo-like stage to live music. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin Preobrazhensky, a 70-year-old painter, has visited twice. He finds 
the work too patriotic and too commercial. "These paintings were painted to 
order, for money, and so they are of a lower quality." Although none of 
Preobrazhensky's works are included, he admitted freely to having done his 
share of agitating for happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, a poet and a student, disappeared into the labor camps. "Stalin 
killed him," Preobrazhensky said. But a few years later, during World War II, 
while working at an airplane factory, Preobrazhensky said, "We painted Stalin 
portraits, with the same paint we used for the planes."

 Lansbury Recuperating: "Murder, She Wrote" star Angela Lansbury is recovering 
at her Los Angeles home after undergoing successful replacement surgery on her 
left hip last Wednesday -- two days after completing scheduled filming of her 
top-rated drama. Lansbury's surgeon, Dr. John R. Moreland, said the 68-year-old 
actress should be "fully prepared to resume filming" in August. "She is in 
marvelous health, and the surgery went without a hitch," he said. "The 
transplant should eliminate any discomfort she has been experiencing." Although 
Lansbury apparently planned the surgery several months in advance, a CBS 
spokeswoman said the operation came "much to our surprise." But Lansbury and 
company already have a jump on the fall season, having completed four new 
episodes of "Murder, She Wrote" before going on hiatus.

 * Houston's Next Trophy -- TV Ratings?: Singer Whitney Houston will headline 
the 25-minute pregame show for the World Cup '94 soccer championship game at 
the Rose Bowl July 17. "As today's top performer, Whitney is the perfect 
ambassador for the U.S. to welcome the world," said a spokesman for Radio City 
Music Hall, the show's producer. The performance and game are expected to be 
broadcast in more than 180 countries, with an anticipated audience of 2 
billion. That could make Houston's concert the most-watched TV performance in 
history.

 * 'Flintstones' Promotion: Hanna-Barbera will attempt to break a Guinness Book 
World Record by rebroadcasting "The Flintstones" premiere episode, titled "The 
Flintstone Flyer," in all 24 time zones on June 3. The program will air on 
Turner Entertainment Networks for a worldwide telecast via a global dual 
satellite feed reaching more than 67 countries and 80 million subscriber 
households. Hanna-Barbera also plans to show the cartoon on other international 
networks and non-traditional venues including airlines, cruise lines, major 
sporting venues and electronics stores. 
</P>

 * 'Tom's' Second Chance?: Although CBS has officially canceled Tom Arnold's 
low-rated series, "Tom," the network now says it would consider bringing the 
show back as a midseason replacement in the unlikely event it brings in "great 
numbers" in the ratings when three remaining original episodes air next month. 
In nine outings this past season, "Tom" tied for 97th place among 129 network 
shows. THE ARTS

 'Twilight' Wins Obie: Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992" won 
the Obie Award for best play, announced Monday in New York. The Obies go to 
shows from New York's Off- and Off-Off Broadway. "Twilight" qualified from its 
Off-Broadway run at the New York Public Theater. It later moved to Broadway, 
where it has been nominated for two Tonys. It was commissioned by L.A.'s Mark 
Taper Forum and premiered there last year. Another show that played the Taper 
before New York, Eric Bogosian's "Pounding Nails in the Floor With My 
Forehead," took one of the two Obies for playwriting, while the other went to a 
script that was initially commissioned -- though not produced -- by South Coast 
Repertory, Howard Korder's "The Lights."

 * Conal Posters Challenged: Los Angeles "guerrilla artist" Robbie Conal is 
coming under fire once again for his politically themed street posters. "What 
we don't need more of in Southern California is visual pollution and that's 
what Conal's posters are," said L.A. County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who is 
calling for "appropriate jurisdictions" to fine Conal for his "latest act of 
illegally plastering posters on private and governmental property." In 1988, 
Conal was fined $1,300 by the City of Los Angeles for putting his posters on 
public property. His latest poster -- a depiction of Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.) 
with the words "Nothing Personal," and an inset of the late Richard Nixon, a 
dog and the words "Richard M. Nixon Memorial Pet Peeve Award Winner" -- went up 
on the streets of L.A. and Orange counties over the last two weeks. On Monday, 
Conal explained the poster, saying: "Robert Dole's tearful delivery of the 
eulogy at Nixon's funeral . . . makes him the heir apparent to Nixon's standard 
of smarmy political dishonesty." Of Antonovich, he added: "Perhaps because he 
has no sense of humor about his profession (he) objects to public expression by 
people who don't support his own obsolete position."

 * An Orchestrated Switch: The Orange County Chamber Orchestra announced Monday 
that Micah Levy, the orchestra's founder and music director throughout its 
11-year history, is leaving to pursue a musical arts doctorate. Levy will be 
replaced as music director and conductor by Diana Halprin, the orchestra's 
concertmaster since 1987. Levy, who has been asked to return to conduct future 
concerts and will assume the new title of founder/music director emeritus, will 
study at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore as a doctor of musical arts 
candidate. QUICK TAKES

 Barney the dinosaur, that purple TV hero of the preschool set, will make his

four-part interview about his most memorable "Arsenio Hall Show" moments on

RICH PERFORMANCE BY THE MASTER CHORALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Extreme loudness is not the usual commodity one expects from the stage of 
Segerstrom Hall at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. Of 
course, in these nine calendar years, we have had our share of it: in Mahler 
symphonies, in "Aida," in Schoenberg's "Gurrelieder." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, however, the climactic moments in those earlier performances 
were matched, perhaps even surpassed, when the Master Chorale of Orange County 
essayed the bombast in praise of hedonism that is William Walton's colorful 
1931 cantata, "Belshazzar's Feast." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the steady leadership of William Hall, and with the incisive soloism of 
veteran baritone Richard Fredricks egging it on, the 125-voice Master Chorale, 
splendidly competing with its own Master Chorale Orchestra, filled the hall 
with powerful sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtlety was not the subject of this performance, nor should it have been. 
Whatever its projected moral, Walton's Depression-era paean to materialism and 
conspicuous consumption is about excess and over-richness. By its conclusion, 
naturally, Babylon is brought down. But its subtext, in any case, remains: 
Wasn't that some town? 
</P>
<P>
 A brassy work in every wise, "Belshazzar's" demands fine control from both 
vocal and instrumental performers. This it got, for the most part, especially 
from the real brass of the Orchestra. Hall, perhaps, might have found more 
places in which to pull back the climactic waves, yet the raucousness his 
forces so gamely produced never actually caused pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Soloist Fredricks projected his contributions clearly and with dramatic ardor. 
This is no masterpiece, but it always makes a killing. Some nights, that seems 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 A stronger work, though this time around less compellingly performed, is 
Prokofiev's cantata (from his film score) "Alexander Nevsky." Sunday night, the 
well-endowed -- with players, not money -- Master Chorale Orchestra alternately 
achieved genuine virtuosity and notable tentativeness in meeting its demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestral playing in the opening movements seemed merely uncertain, as 
well as unbalanced. Then, in "The Battle on the Ice" and the finale, all things 
came together, instrumentally. Mushy enunciation aside, the Master Chorale sang 
well enough, if with less fervor than it mustered later. 
</P>
<P>
 In timbre, mezzo-soprano Catherine Stoltz proved well-cast, though limited 
both dynamically and in terms of text-coloration, in the ought-to-be poignant 
"Field of the Dead" solo.

MUSIC REVIEWS; SPIRITUAL OUTING BY JUBILEE SINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was it a concert or a three-hour, high-energy revival meeting? Sometimes the 
boundaries blurred at the 30th anniversary celebration of the Albert McNeil 
Jubilee Singers, but one thing remained clear -- impressive voices continue to 
abound in this fine group. 
</P>
<P>
 Though dedicated to disseminating a broad body of African American music to 
international audiences, Sunday night, as guests of the Los Angeles Master 
Chorale, the singers appeared most moved by spirituals -- the genre that first 
incited their assemblage under McNeil. Here, working mostly a cappella at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, fervor and improvisatory talent shone -- 
particularly through Muriel Bennett's soulful and immaculate soprano for "I 
Wanna Be Ready" and the gutsy and fluid, admirably controlled voice of another 
soprano -- Victoria Burnett, in "I Been in the Storm So Long." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the men, the clear tenor of Thomas Young, a former member returning as 
guest soloist, soared over an enthusiastic choral backdrop in "Sinner Man," and 
Carver Cossey's baritone emerged rich and evocative during "John the 
Revelator." 
</P>
<P>
 Other styles did not always receive convincing treatment. Soprano Lisa 
Gray-Ashley could not meet the vocal demands of excerpts from "Carmen Jones" -- 
Oscar Hammerstein's re-texting of Bizet's "Carmen" -- though she vamped her way 
through Yvonne Farrow's alternately steamy and humorous choreography well 
enough. Many of the lively arrangements came from within the chorus; Larry 
Farrow claimed the most, but Dianne and Michael Wright, Richard Jackson, Byron 
Smith -- the rousing, foot-stomping piano accompanist -- and McNeil himself all 
contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 The founder and his assistant Paul Smith took time to pay tribute to all who 
had aided and inspired during the ensemble's three decades, most notably in a 
guest-conducting spot for 92-year-old Jester Hairston, who directed his 
adaptation of "In That Great Gettin' Up Mornin." The Rev. John Nix-McReynolds 
-- minister of the Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana -- belted out the tenor 
solo. SUSAN BLISS

THEATER REVIEW; 'HARVEY': TIMELESS QUALITY ENRICHES WORK AT LA JOLLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only thing dated about "Harvey," Mary Chase's 50-year-old play, is that if 
an Elwood P. Dowd truly believed today that his best friend was a 6-foot 1 
1/2-inch invisible rabbit, he'd be the toast of the daytime talk-show circuit 
with a fat book contract on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you can put "Harvey" firmly in its time period, a time when social 
standing was directly tied in with conformity, one can appreciate Chase's 
message that there is magic everywhere -- even in crackpots -- and we'd do well 
to pay attention to the miracles that are daily with us. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Jolla Playhouse's flawless presentation of the Seattle Repertory 
Theatre production does just that, touching on the timeless aspects of this 
wise, witty work, unleashing the magic with fabulous performances and sumptuous 
production values. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's a joyous season opener at the Mandell Weiss Theatre, flavored with just 
the right touch of poignancy, to be savored in every rich detail. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the keys to a successful "Harvey" is the actor who plays Elwood -- he 
not only has to make you believe and care about the character, he has to make 
you see Elwood seeing Harvey as convincingly as James Stewart did in the 1950 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Weiss does that with such ingenuous wonder and charm that you quickly 
fall under his spell, wanting him to keep his friend so much that reality 
becomes a secondary consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the depths of his character's well-searched soul, he can deliver 
even the best-known line from the play -- "I wrestled with reality for 40 years 
and I am happy to state that I finally won out over it" -- with such hard-won 
clarity that you want to cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas Hughes, acting artistic director of the Seattle Repertory Theatre, 
directed with a graceful, loving hand. Every nuance is polished and burnished 
to full shine and yet the show flows easily without a single forced note. 
</P>
<P>
 Peggy Pope and Marianne Owen humanize Veta Louise Simmons, Elwood's sister and 
her daughter Myrtle, two women who confuse social grace -- which Elwood has in 
abundance -- with their own social climbing, which Elwood impedes with his 
delusion. As the sanitarium's snippy but sexy Nurse Kelly, Katie Forgette spars 
stylishly opposite Christopher Evan Welch's Dr. Sanderson. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the key role of Dr. William Chumley, Rick Tutor brings dark, brilliant 
colors to the pompous psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugh Landwehr's stunning set serves the play well, as the lavishly detailed 
living room yields to a sterile tile-and-metallic sanitarium, both expertly lit 
by Greg Sullivan. Linda Fisher's elegant period costumes and Michael Roth's 
music composition turn the charm up full throttle. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, one could complain that "Harvey" romanticizes mental illness, or even 
drinking. But what it really does is take poetic license to romanticize life in 
all its infinite variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been spending my life with fly specks while miracles have been leaning 
on lampposts," Dr. Chumley says at one point. It's a feeling that audiences may 
well share as they follow that White Rabbit to Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Harvey," La Jolla Playhouse, Mandell Weiss Theatre, UC San Diego, La Jolla. 
Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m., Sat.-Sun. matinees at 2 p.m. Ends 
June 19. $19-$32. (619) 550-1010. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes.

TV REVIEWS; 'FRONTLINE' LOOKS AT 'PUBLIC LANDS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Poor Bruce Babbitt. The Secretary of Interior was twice a contender for an 
Associate Supreme Court Justice position but remained in his current post 
because of his value to President Bill Clinton.But his current job means that 
he must forever contend with one of the country's most unbending, virulent 
interest groups: Business people who make money off of Western lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through his "Frontline" report (produced with the Center for 
Investigative Reporting), "Public Lands, Private Profits," reporter Robert 
Krulwich asks Babbitt if he regrets not going to the Supreme Court. "A little," 
Babbitt laughs. It's understandable, since Babbitt is faced with a powerful 
mind-set in the West, best exemplified by this report's central concern -- the 
U.S. government's outdated method of selling public land to mining companies 
for $2.50 an acre, including no additional royalty fee. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Babbitt's attempts to reform the arrangement, based on an 1872 law to 
encourage Western development, should get some impetus both from this thorough 
report and from his May 16 sale for a mere $9,000 of a gold reserve valued at 
between $8 billion and $10 billion to Canadian-owned American Barrick Resources 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 His campaign has thus far been blocked by those pesky business land interests 
and, Krulwich suggests, a lack of political spine by Clinton. Efforts in 1993 
to raise grazing fees on Western public lands, for instance, were met with 
bipartisan opposition by Western Senators whom Clinton needs for bigger 
political battles down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Public Lands, Private Profits" airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and 
KPBS-TV Channel 15, and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24. ROBERT KOEHLER

MUSIC REVIEWS; SHANKAR BRINGS EAST TO WEST IN PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even for the adventurous Western classical music listener, Ravi Shankar can be 
a stretch, but stretch that listener must, for he can't all of a sudden grow 
Eastern ears. 
</P>
<P>
 The renowned Indian sitarist, now 74, came to a packed Sexson Auditorium at 
Pasadena City College Sunday night for a joyful program of evening ragas (he 
had offered morning ragas earlier in the day), and his music proved as 
challenging as our own avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 This was chiefly, though certainly not entirely, because of its length. After 
a brief preliminary by some other musicians, Shankar started the first piece at 
about 7:20 and the music continued virtually nonstop, except for tuning, until 
9:32, when he finished the second piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The best analogy for what went on, though Shankar would probably dispute it, 
is a jam session, and for one listener the most remarkable feature of the first 
raga, "Jaitashree," was Shankar's opening improvisation with the material, 
which lasted some 40 minutes alone. 
</P>
<P>
 With drones, played by the tanpura, buzzing in the background, and assisted by 
sitarist Kartik Seshadri, Shankar seemed in no hurry to take the raga anywhere, 
playing with two or three notes -- bending them, sustaining them, creating 
dissonances pregnantly resolved to the tonic -- for considerable lengths, and 
even stopping periodically to retune. But eventually, almost by misdirection, 
he reached great heights, as if only by mulling everything over from different 
angles could he get there. 
</P>
<P>
 The second raga, "Pilu," impressed with its rhythmic groove, at first a plump 
medium tempo, in which Shankar and tabla (hand drums) master Swapan Chaudhuri 
made much of the rhythmic tension and release inherent to this music, and then 
at a much faster tempo where flying virtuosity took over. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience, a mixture of Indians, old, ex- and current hippies (including 
George Harrison), greeted Shankar with reverence and sent him off like a rock 
star. TIMOTHY MANGAN

SHONEN KNIFE LOOKS SHARP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to see why Kurt Cobain loved Shonen Knife so much. The Japanese 
female trio is an embodiment of the purity and innocence that the singer 
treasured and found so elusive in the pop music world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain was one of many peer-group patrons and admirers that the three women 
from Osaka have acquired along their path from offbeat cult item to fairly 
major cult item. Two others, the Bangles' Susanna Hoffs and the Go-Go's 
Charlotte Caffey, were part of the emcee team introducing Shonen Knife on 
Friday at the Palace. It was a big-time show for the group, and they responded 
with a typically fresh and unaffected performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a song about my favorite drink -- tomato juice," said 
singer-guitarist Naoko Yamano, introducing "Tomato Head," which featured the 
show's one concession to theatrics -- two roadies dancing around wearing tomato 
headpieces. "This is a song about a cat," said bassist Michie Nakatani, 
announcing "I Am a Cat." 
</P>
<P>
 So it went, delivered with a tight, perky attack that recalled the Ramones' 
buoyant pop side. A sound problem left the guitar without much presence for the 
first part of the show, but it was full and powerful by the time the three 
women were dropping slow, lead-weight metal riffs and, with big grins, flashing 
the devil's-horn hand sign. Never had parody been more free of hostility.

HANDGUN CRIME STATISTICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was especially intrigued by the last paragraph of "Handgun Crime Soaring 
in U.S., Report Says," May 17. 
</P>
<P>
 I quote, "The survey also found that 38% of the victims who were armed 
attacked the individuals seeking to harm them. One-fifth of those attempting to 
protect themselves with a firearm were injured, compared to almost half who 
used other weapons or had no weapon at all." 
</P>
<P>
 I guess it comes as no surprise that the notoriously anti-gun Times would bury 
this intriguing bit of news at the very end. 
</P>
<P>
 SAM BRUNSTEIN 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 * By now everyone knows the position of the National Rifle Assn. regarding the 
Second Amendment, but does anyone know the NRA strategy for keeping guns out of 
the hands of those using them to commit crimes? 
</P>
<P>
 J. S. KLEINSASSER 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield 
</P>
<P>
 * Are all you gun advocates who want assault weapons part of "A well regulated 
militia, being necessary to the security of a free State" as specified in the 
Second Amendment? That's the prelude to the part you guys always quote, but you 
completely disregard it. Do you want an assault weapon in every home for 
self-defense? Or would you have equipped the law office in San Francisco, where 
eight people were killed, with assault weapons? 
</P>
<P>
 Your emphasis is always on "criminals" committing these crimes, whereas these 
mass murders are committed by deranged men who can go out and buy these weapons 
of war to commit these atrocities. And then they often commit suicide, which 
precludes prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law-abiding responsible citizens" are not "being stripped of their 
self-defense" (letters, May 14). We -- and the police -- are being outgunned by 
wackos with weapons of war that will fire 100 bullets at one loading. 
</P>
<P>
 HERBERT HERR 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * In response to "Hold Handgun Makers and Sellers Liable," by Erwin 
Chemerinsky and Richard Mosk, Commentary, May 19: 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it interesting that lawyers would state that "it should not matter if 
there is an intervening criminal act." Haven't they missed the point? Criminals 
are the problem, as well as a justice system that no longer cares about 
victims, only sound-bites. How much money do lawyers expect to earn from these 
fraudulent lawsuits? Why aren't they now suing Ford and General Motors because 
drunk drivers kill innocent people? Maybe brick makers should be sued because 
chimneys fell during the earthquake! 
</P>
<P>
 Second, according to recent information, of the 38,000 firearms deaths, only 
13,000 are murders. I'm sure someone committing suicide would never think of 
taking sleeping pills or jumping off a cliff in the absence of firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 JOHN THOMAS APA 
</P>
<P>
 Canoga Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Let's see. The threat of criminal proceedings for handgun crime is not 
enough. As such, only the introduction of endless tort litigation would stop 
the criminal use of handguns. Right. And why not just call the new federal 
statue, "The Attorney Full Employment Act of 1994"?

PARKS, WILDLIFE INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times' support of Prop. 180 (editorial, May 15) leaves out one important 
element: the source of the funds to repay the bonds and interest. That money 
will come out of the state general fund, which will be badly out of whack next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Those parks and wildlife bonds will cost taxpayers an average of $142 million 
in principal and interest for 25 years. If all the bond measures on the June 
ballot pass, the total obligation will be $422 million a year. And no telling 
what additional bond measures we can expect ahead, for such things as more 
prisons and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 To make things balance, the Legislature will again have to take money away 
from schools and local government. Parks and wildlife are important, but of 
lower priority than our education and safety.

 * On a recent trip on Highway 89 to Markleeville, stopping along the curving 
road at Monitor Pass, I looked across the divide over the valley below, 
stretching out like a pale green painting framed in chocolate brown, with 
patches of a giant's snow cone on the mountain peaks. Along the eastern slopes 
of the Sierra Nevada, 7,500 feet elevation, is some of the most beautiful 
scenery in the world, I imagine. The widening sweep of jagged mountain tops 
encircles the blue of Bridgeport Lake. Few who have traveled this route to 
Bodie State Historic Park will forget it, even the washboard road that goes 
with the Bodie experience, a unique view of the 1877 mining "ghost" town kept 
as near as possible in the state of arrested decay, with buildings not restored 
but preserved, down to the last creaking hinge on the dry goods store's door or 
the Miners Union Hall stage curtain. It is imperative that this park, and other 
California state parks benefit from funding provided by Prop. 180 for upkeep 
and maintenance. We must pass this bond issue. We must protect and operate safe 
park and recreation facilities, leading to jobs and more tourism, but also for 
coming generations to appreciate California history.

HUFFINGTON'S RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your May 4 article, "Michael Huffington Wins Few Allies in Congress, Is 
Proud of It," your reporter describes GOP Senate candidate Rep. Michael 
Huffington's record in Congress as "razor thin" and "slim." But in the third 
paragraph, it says that he "refused to pursue all but a few federal projects 
for his Santa Barbara-area district, called for elimination one of the two 
committees of which he is a member and frequently criticized his colleagues for 
excessive spending." 
</P>
<P>
 I've got news for you -- refusing to vote yourself pork-barrel projects is not 
the same as not compiling a good record. This is only a "slim" record for 
people who equate spending this country into debt with progress. 
</P>
<P>
 We need more legislators who know how to "slim down" our government. 
Huffington's getting my vote.

STEPHEN BREYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This May 17 attack on Supreme Court nominee Stephen Breyer, your Column Right 
contributor Cal Thomas laments, "Breyer is clearly part of the Harvard 
sociological approach, which believes the law is something that should be 
fitted to the wishes and needs of contemporary culture, not to an absolute 
fixed standard to which people should be made to conform for their own and the 
country's welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course laws can be fitted to the wishes and needs of contemporary culture! 
If they couldn't, we'd still have school segregation, male-only voting 
privileges, Prohibition, slavery . . . and hundreds of other dated rules and 
institutions. In America, we do not claim that our laws come from on high, that 
they are divinely inspired "absolutes" to which all citizens must "conform." As 
human society evolves, so must its laws. 
</P>
<P>
 ALLEN B. URY

</P>
<P>
 The first sentence of David Savage's May 15 news analysis on the nomination of 
Stephen Breyer preposterously likens Clinton to his "Republican predecessors, 
who sought to build a court more likely to adhere to the status quo." Far from 
championing the then-status quo, Presidents Reagan and Bush self-consciously 
planned to reshape the federal judiciary including the Supreme Court through 
their nominating power. In this, they had a substantial measure of success. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Bush was less committed to the plan than Reagan because of his 
indifference to domestic issues. In the case of Robert Bork, the Senate's 
determination to take its constitutional responsibilities seriously did slow 
this plan's progress; still Bush subsequently nominated Clarence Thomas. 
Admittedly, sitting justices may thwart presidential plans by virtue of their 
subsequent judicial evolution. Savage notes all this late in the article. But 
he significantly misrepresents recent presidential history by describing the 
goals of Reagan and Bush as the appointment of status quo justices.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; THE 'CAN DO' STATE CAN BE AGAIN; DYNAMISM DRIVES OUR 
CULTURE, WHICH SEES SOCIETY AS AN EVOLVING PROCESS WITHOUT A PRECONCEIVED 
OUTCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA I. POSTREL, Virginia I. Postrel is editor of Los Angeles-based 
Reason magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1931, a Los Angeles woman wondered "how soon the wheels of progress are 
going to stop rattling long enough for us to hear ourselves think, catch our 
breath and develop some sort of cohesive social organism." Sixty-three years 
later, the answer appears to be never. Or maybe, soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Her question still hangs in the air, more potent than ever. In post-Cold War 
America, the most significant division isn't between left and right but between 
dynamism and stasis. 
</P>
<P>
 It is between those who see society as an evolving, experimental process with 
no particular end state and those who seek to impose a single best "cohesive 
social order." It is between those who prefer choice and those who prefer 
control. It is between those who value growth and change and those who long for 
a "steady state." 
</P>
<P>
 This division explains the odd political alliances we've seen in recent years: 
Pat Buchanan and Jerry Brown opposing free trade with Mexico, National Review 
and Paul Ehrlich opposing immigration, Jeremy Rifkin and neoconservative cleric 
Richard John Neuhaus opposing biotechnology. They are the partisans of stasis. 
</P>
<P>
 In economic good times, their platform manifests itself most clearly in growth 
controls and environmental regulations -- the laws that are choking 
California's industry. In recession, the rage for stasis comes out in attacks 
on immigration and trade, the pillars of the open economy. The party of stasis 
is strong in today's California.  
</P>
<P>
 California is, or has been, the capital of dynamism. "It has no past," wrote 
Charles Dwight Willard in 1886. "Its future reveals nothing but an ignominious 
scramble for dollars, its politics are odious and its population mongrel." He 
later changed his mind. But his description, however pejorative, wasn't far 
from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Dynamism assumes that individual identities are not fixed. Class is fluid; so 
even are race and ethnicity. One estimate holds that nearly a quarter of 
California babies are born to parents of different races. A recent Daily Bruin 
article about ethnic organizations at UCLA highlights the experiences of two 
students active in Raza Women, a Latina group. The students are an Indian woman 
and an Iranian man. The reporter, who quotes no Latinas, treats their 
membership as unremarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 California's dynamism commits it to an open society in which the past matters 
less than the present and the future, in which it's not who you know but what 
you know that counts. Feminism works here; California treats women as 
competent. Merit matters more than tradition. Or such is the promise -- truer 
in Silicon Valley, perhaps, than in Hollywood, but truer in California than in 
many other places. 
</P>
<P>
 If dynamism is the core of our culture, then, why have so many Californians 
recently fallen for stasis? 
</P>
<P>
 The current static backlash is just that, a reaction. It springs in part from 
California's contradictory promises of paradise. California's paradise is not 
really Lotusland, a place of hedonistic fun in the sun. It is, rather, a 
peculiarly American paradise, not a utopia but a place where striving is both 
easier and more rewarding. "My father," writes James Fallows of his childhood 
in Redlands, "never felt for a moment that the gentle climate was an excuse to 
slack off. It let him do more, not less, and in that way it represented the 
general license he'd earned, by moving west, to invent a new life for himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The rewards of the dynamic paradise are bourgeois: social mobility, a home, 
two cars, education for the kids, "the barbecue culture." And bourgeois rewards 
bring their own insecurities -- the tension between appreciating home values 
and affordability, the stresses of crowded freeways and crowded classrooms, 
fewer wide open spaces, the feeling that "they keep coming." California's 
dynamic past produces the static pressures of the present. 
</P>
<P>
 And politicians are rewarded for action, for imposing controls, for shaping 
change from above. Their incentives run contrary to a dynamic vision. So 
Kathleen Brown switches sides on NAFTA because "it does not sufficiently 
address the wage gap between our two countries." She'd hoped to dictate Mexican 
wages by treaty, to keep them higher and less competitive. NAFTA promises more 
jobs, but its beneficiaries are unknown. Californians who lose their jobs to 
trade will punish the politicians. It is safe to maintain controls. 
</P>
<P>
 And it looks better to fight post-Cold War restructuring with mandates than 
with markets -- to "do something" rather than trust dynamic processes. Instead 
of treating displaced aerospace workers as individuals finding their own places 
in the world, politicians vow to keep them together by requiring an 
electric-car industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The politicians' zeal for directing change from above is a vision incompatible 
with the California culture that MIT's Charles Ferguson used to condemn as 
"chronic entrepreneurialism." A more suitable policy would remove barriers to 
new industries such as medical instruments and biotechnology -- industries that 
this fall's single-payer health-care initiative threatens to gut. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the politicians, California's dynamism persists. As University of 
North Carolina sociologist John Shelton Reed has pointed out, strong regional 
cultures have a way of reinforcing themselves. California pulls in people who 
share its dynamic vision, whether they hail from South America or South 
Carolina. People who prefer stasis leave. 
</P>
<P>
 California is still a place where people remake themselves, where unabashed 
self-improvement is the norm, where change is as central to the culture as 
tradition is to Vermont or Virginia. It is still a place where you can walk 
into a shop to get acrylic fingernails and find a woman reading "How to Win 
Friends and Influence People" in Vietnamese.

JOINING THE TB FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to the editorial "Getting the Jump on TB, (May 5)" I completely 
concur with the need to seek further funding from the state and federal sources 
and indeed this is being done. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate that at this time of scarce financial resources at every 
level of government we are seeing cases of TB up 4% in 1993 compared to 
1991.The cases of TB in the schools reflect what is occurring in Orange County 
as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Solutions to those critical problems aren't just the responsibility of the 
public health system but for all of us as a community to find ways to deal with 
the crisis. A coalition has been put together by the American Lung Assn. of 
Orange County made up of a cross-section of private and public sector, racially 
diverse health care professionals, volunteers and media, as well as state and 
national government representatives. Members of the coalition are working 
together to advocate for tuberculosis funding and education for health 
professionals and the general public to control this epidemic.

NOT EVEN THE BAT OF GROSS ENOUGH; DODGERS: PITCHER HITS A THREE-RUN HOMER, BUT 
HIS TEAMMATES PROVIDE ONLY THREE HITS IN A 6-3 LOSS TO THE CUBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Gross, the slugger, couldn't contain the bats of the Chicago Cubs on 
Monday night, even though he tried to compensate with two hits of his own, 
including a three-run shot into the left field pavilion that earned him his 
first curtain call at Dodger Stadium before 37,569. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time this crowd has ever rooted for me this much here," Gross 
said after the Dodgers' 6-3 loss, which extended the Cubs' winning streak to 
seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who scored 46 runs and had 81 hits in their last seven games, got 
only fivehits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bound to happen, we hit a couple of balls hard and a couple right at 
them, but their pitchers did a good job," said Mike Piazza, who singled in the 
eighth but was stranded at first. He is batting .385 in his last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Against five Cub pitchers, who sure didn't throw like they belong to one of 
the worst pitching staffs in the league, even Raul Mondesi's 14-game hitting 
streak was laid to rest. In fact, Gross was the leading hitter in the game, 
getting two hits against starter Jose Guzman (2-2) before leaving after the 
sixth inning. By then, the Cubs were ahead by 6-3 after having put together a 
four-run sixth inning, aided by a three-run homer by Derrick May. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a chance to gain ground for the Dodgers because the San Francisco 
Giants lost to the San Diego Padres. And the seldom-used trio of Gary Wayne, Al 
Osuna and Roger McDowell held the Cubs scoreless for the final three innings, 
but that wasn't enough as the Dodgers remained 3 1/2 games in front of the 
Giants in the National League West, losing only for the third time in the last 
14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are really getting good pitching and that allowed us to stay in the game," 
Cub Manager Tom Trebelhorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good job out of the bullpen with good defense and were able to take 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some shoulder stiffness, Gross (3-2) had won his last three starts, 
but this time, even though he said he felt as good as he had in his last five 
starts, the Cubs got to him quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won because they hit the ball out of the park," Gross said. "They are a 
hot team right now and are playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sosa worked Gross to a full count before he hit a two-run shot over the 
left-center field fence in the second inning, scoring Mark Grace, who had drawn 
a lead-off walk. That put the Cubs ahead, 2-0.  
</P>
<P>
 But Gross got more than even in the bottom of the inning. Guzman went to 
2-and-0 on Gross before taking him to a full count. Gross unloaded on the next 
pitch for his sixth career home run. That earned Gross his curtain call. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather get the win then the home run," said Gross, who gave up six runs 
-- five earned -- and six hits, including two home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made some not very quality pitches tonight and then there were others that 
I threw quite well." 
</P>
<P>
 After that, though, the Dodgers didn't get another hit until the fifth inning, 
when Gross grounded under the glove of Guzman and beat out an infield single. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a lull in the storm for the Dodgers, who lead the league in offense and 
a number of other categories. "It's been a long time since I looked at the 
batting leaders and saw a few of my players listed," Manager Tom Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Delino DeShields made two star plays, before throwing a ball 
away in the sixth inning that eventually cost a run. "I was just trying to get 
Kevin out of the inning," DeShields said.  
</P>
<P>
 But the loss came because of the Dodgers' quiet bats. Before Monday's game, 
the Dodgers had a collective batting average of .308 with runners in scoring 
position, with Cory Snyder's .500 leading and Raul Mondesi's .450 next best. 
Henry Rodriguez is batting .433, with Piazza at.362. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, who played his 300th consecutive game without an error, took 
himself out of the game in the eighth inning with a sore knee that occurred 
while running before the game. His status is listed as day-to-day.

THE ROCKET BANDWAGON GROWS WITH ROUT OF JAZZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mayor walked to midcourt before the game and promised a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The P.A. announcer welcomed everyone to "Clutch City." 
</P>
<P>
 All that other stuff -- blowing 18- and 20-point leads against Phoenix, both 
newspapers writing "Choke City" headlines, the Suns ferrying fans in when the 
games didn't sell out -- was forgotten as a great American metropolis 
belly-flopped back on the bandwagon, just in time to see the suddenly beloved 
Rockets steamroll the Jazz, 100-88, in Monday night's opener of the Western 
Conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got their eyes set on something bigger than us," said Jazz Coach 
Jerry Sloan, sounding like a man who'd just had a nightmare wide awake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know they've got great aspirations. We didn't come in here thinking we 
were going to walk all over them. We had a difficult time with them during the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no bull . . . . I'm not going to answer it 100 times. We know they're 
good. We know we have to have a perfect game to beat them. We know we have to 
have everybody on our team play well to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, no wonder they lost then. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz didn't play a perfect game, nor did all of their players play well, 
nor did many of them play well. 
</P>
<P>
 They managed a 14-9 lead and after that, the sky fell in. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets held them scoreless for 4:42 in the first quarter and went on an 
11-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie guard Sam Cassell, the wildcard in the Suns' series when he averaged 13 
points and six assists in 25 minutes and scored 22 in Game 7, came off the 
bench Monday to score nine consecutive points to open the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl Malone, who entered the game with a 28-point playoff average, second only 
to Hakeem Olajuwon's 31, missed 10 of his first 12 shots. Asked what he was 
thinking early in the game, the Mailman answered: "That I was playing like 
hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hornacek missed all five of his shots in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mid-first period to the final seconds of the second, the Rockets 
outscored the Jazz, 45-18, to take a 22-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 What was there to say after that but good night? 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon scored 31 points. Point guard Kenny Smith hit six of his nine 
three-point attempts and scored 27. The Jazz found themselves on a banana peel, 
trying to get to Olajuwon, trying to get back to the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't deal with 'em," said Sloan. "They shot three-pointers well. 
Olajuwon was shooting it. We just couldn't contain 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz did manage one small spurt, coming out of halftime with a 13-2 run 
that trimmed the Rocket lead to 56-47, stirring memories of the Phoenix series 
when the Rockets lost leads of 18 and 20 points and Games 1 and 2, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always going to be on our minds," said Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich. 
"That's why we were telling each other, 'Stay aggressive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Utah was the No. 5 seed in the West and arrived courtesy of a favorable draw, 
beating the fading Spurs in the first round, blowing a 3-0 lead but beating the 
No. 8 seed Nuggets in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston had its own share of good fortune, drawing the toothless Trail Blazers 
in the first round, then rallying from 0-2 in the second round when Charles 
Barkley's back tightened. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're rolling now in Choke, er, Clutch City and pity the fools who have 
to stand in the way.

COMMENTARY; BREAKTHROUGH FOR THE KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE JACOBSON, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe in the crucible of the seventh game the Knickerbockers learned something 
about the game and about themselves. They also can play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Under all the pressure of the moment and of six years of moments against the 
Chicago Bulls, the Knicks overcame both history and the devils inside 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's a breakthrough both ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Beating the Bulls Sunday doesn't mean a championship; it was the franchise's 
most meaningful victory in 21 years. "You learn as a team," said John Starks, 
who should have been made to sit in the corner often. "I think we learned from 
Chicago. You never see them lose their composure. That's what the champion 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 One never knows what fires rage inside Starks in the heat of the contest. 
Maybe the next time he and Greg Anthony, Anthony Mason or Charles Oakley are 
behind, under pressure, frustrated, they'll revert to their past. Maybe they'll 
respond with the kind of barbaric tantrum they threw at Chicago Stadium. Some 
cats never learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some do. Maybe this was a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls went out as a champion with all credits due. They went to the last 
minutes of Game 7 with a chance to win, with a chance to extend a noble reign. 
The Bulls leaped to a 57-53 lead late in the third quarter. They had a chance 
to preserve themselves as the nemesis of the Knicks. They asked the Knicks to 
crack. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Valkyries of the home sound system urging them on, with the 
expectations of the crowd waving in the nap of each of those swirling towels, 
the Knicks restrained themselves by the seats of their pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out today and played in a way we're capable of playing," said Dave 
Checketts, the president and chief architect of this team. No tripping, no 
chest-butting, no brutal elbowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, hardly any. Give the officials credit for setting the rules early. Not 
even their harshest critic, Phil Jackson, accused the Knicks of brutality this 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Checketts was embarrassed by his players in Chicago, particularly in the sixth 
game: If they couldn't beat the Bulls, at least they could leave the Bulls so 
sore they'd regret it. Checketts noted how Starks tripped Scottie Pippen to 
stop his breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have the hometown critics been so unanimous in their distaste for the 
way their team played. These Knicks were unsympathetic, unlovable thugs, 
destined to poison themselves with the venom of their own game. And now the 
Knicks would be emboldened by the home crowd, by the home court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the game I told John I don't want to see that again," Checketts said. 
"They came out today and played with great control and great poise. It says a 
lot about this team." 
</P>
<P>
 What it says can be heard in several ways. Instead of coming apart when the 
Bulls took away what the Knicks like to do, the Knicks showed a resourcefulness 
that's been unseen from them. They kept up that relentless defense without the 
strongarm. And they kept their poise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how much poise you can play with in the seventh game," Pat Riley 
said. He was dodging the issue, but only for a moment. He knows about poise and 
self-control from his past life. He hadn't been able to teach it to these 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 He identified the situation of trailing 57-53 as the test of the Knicks, 
perhaps as the test of his coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being frustrated by the double-teams the Bulls were throwing up 
around Patrick Ewing, the Knicks suddenly discovered what they like to call 
"the little game." Suddenly it dawned on Ewing that when he was doubled, the 
ball didn't always have to go back outside. There was a big man open. And the 
ball went from Ewing to Oakley or Ewing to Mason. Or from Ewing to Oakley to 
Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 It's never a surprise to Ewing that he's doubled. Why then didn't he learn 
that before? "It's a personal thing," Derek Harper said. "Patrick being the 
main force, a lot of times he's going to look for his shot first." 
</P>
<P>
 This team is impressive for its willingness to work. The reputation for court 
wisdom belongs to the team of the other era. 
</P>
<P>
 These people had to grow past the Bulls. In the process, they relegated the 
demon of Chicago Stadium to history. But that's another story. They had been 
eliminated by the Bulls four of the last five years. The Bulls had been their 
personal barrier. A little brother has to overcome the aura of his big brother. 
In their time, the Bulls had to overcome the Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe giving the Knicks credit is all splitting homecourt hairs because a 
Chicago loss to the lowly Celtics on the last Friday of the season took the 
chance for an advantage away from the Bulls and gave it to the Knicks. We'll 
never know how much that meant. 
</P>
<P>
 We know the Knicks beat the threepeat Bulls, headed off their march to the 
"4-peat" lettered on Pippen's sneakers. Riley saw a parallel in how his Lakers 
had to overcome the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to beat the world champions," he said. "Our first year against them in 
the playoffs, they had won the title and we could not beat them in seven games. 
We were matched up against the champions last year and could not beat them in 
six games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year we had to beat them again. So somewhere, some team had to put them 
away. If we really aspire to what they have worked so hard to achieve, then it 
is fitting that we beat them in this round." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls were noble champions. Blame Pippen for his last-second runout in 
Chicago; acknowledge that he's a great player. Acknowledge that they set an 
example for the Knicks to grow into. "You saw how when things flared up, they'd 
walk away," Herb Williams, the Knicks' sage, said. "They never let things get 
out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody ever said that about these Knicks before. "What we showed," said 
Checketts, a reasonable man, "is that we're capable of turning their emotion 
into positive energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anthony, Starks, Mason, Oakley -- they've come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 The champions are dead. Chicago Stadium is no more. The Knicks get another 
chance to prove they have control of themselves.

 Jason Kidd, expected to be one of the top selections in next month's NBA 
draft, met Monday with authorities in Oakland who were investigating his 
allegedly fleeing the scene of a traffic accident. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries in the wreck early Sunday on I-80. 
</P>
<P>
 The car Kidd, an All-American point guard at California, was driving allegedly 
sideswiped another car, skidded and overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The other car was moderately damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd left in a third car, his two passengers staying at the accident scene, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd admitted he had fled. 
</P>
<P>
 "While driving two friends home I was involved in an accident," he said. "I 
panicked and mistakenly left the scene. I was not intoxicated, and I have 
spoken with the authorities regarding this matter. Thankfully, no one was 
injured." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told the CHP that Kidd's car was weaving in and out of traffic and 
speeding before hitting the other vehicle. Miscellany

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS; KNICKS REGROUP, CONFRONT MIRROR IMAGE 
IN HOT PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those dreaded Huns from the Midwest, the Chicago Bulls, have finally been sent 
away, leaving the New York Knicks to use Monday to heal from an emotional and 
physical seven-game series and to also remember one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those weren't even the conference finals. 
</P>
<P>
 These are, the best-of-seven meeting with the Indiana Pacers beginning tonight 
at Madison Square Garden. For the Knicks, it's a showdown with the league's 
hottest team, with a trip to the NBA Finals on the line. Ready or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won, but it's a dead issue," Knick guard John Starks said of the Bulls 
series. "We have to worry about Indiana because our season doesn't stop with 
the Chicago Bulls." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pacer Coach Larry Brown of the Knicks: "They've prepared themselves to 
play. The Knicks have talked all along about what great shape they're in. They 
know what it is to play in big games and big series, and that's something that 
may be in their favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Experience is an obvious Knick advantage, although the biggest might be the 
home-court edge. The Pacers, off since Thursday night, had never before made it 
out of the first round but went 7-2 against Orlando and Atlanta, despite being 
the lower-seeded team in each matchup, then waited out the final two games of 
the New York-Chicago scrum. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Pacers get a chance to put another notch on their pistol. So the 
Knicks swept the season series, 4-0, and held Indiana to 84, 91, 82 and 82 
points. So what? Indiana split with the Magic during the regular season and 
then went 3-0 in the playoffs, and lost the season series to the Hawks, 3-2, 
but needed only six games to beat the East's No. 1 team in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides, New York broke 100 only once in the four earlier meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indiana is almost a mirror image of us," New York's Anthony Mason said. "They 
work hard and they bang the boards. We can't celebrate too long because we have 
another tough series."

 TAGS FOR TOTS: In some nurseries, well-adorned babies now carry anti-theft 
devices. . . . Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura attaches a nearly 
undetectable tag on newborns which sets off an alarm if the infant is carried 
out of the maternity ward (B1). . . . Los Robles Medical Center is installing a 
similar system. One problem: Where do you put the tag? Some hospitals opt for a 
wrist band. But security consultant Lynn West recommends the belly button. 
"Most people," she said, "are afraid to touch the umbilical cord clamp." 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD PROSPECTS: With Congress poised to allow Alaska to export crude oil 
overseas, Ventura County's smaller oil companies hope they may finally get a 
break. . . . For several years, cheap Alaskan oil has flooded the California 
market, depressing oil prices and making it tougher to sell oil from local 
fields. But Congress may soon permit Alaskan oil to be redirected to Japan. "It 
is pretty exciting," said Barry McMahan of Seneca Resources Corp. in Santa 
Paula. "Any boost in pricing is going to help us tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 CHIPS & DIPS: Silicon chips make up the building blocks of today's computers. 
And the tiny circuits spawned an economic region called Silicon Valley. . . . 
Tomorrow's computers could be made of faster chips made of a gallium-arsenide. 
And a Camarillo company that makes the high-speed chips has recovered from a 
dip in sales (Valley Business, Page 3). It's too early to rename the area, the 
Gallium-Arsenide Valley. But Cal Lutheran University economist Jamshid Damooei 
sees great promise in such high-tech firms. "This is the hope of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 DEATH CASE: Prosecutors may seek the death penalty against a Port Hueneme 
teen-ager accused of gunning down a Simi Valley man and his dog so he could 
steal a pickup truck from an Ojai campground (B1). . . . The county's grand 
jury indicted Port Hueneme teen-ager Timothy Chrestman on murder and robbery 
charges that leave open the option of capital punishment.

2 FOUND DEAD IN FIRE AT MCKINLEY MANSION; DESTRUCTION: HISTORIC STRUCTURE NEAR 
LAFAYETTE PARK WAS ABANDONED YEARS AGO. THE VICTIMS WERE TRANSIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC MALNIC, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two transients were found dead Monday morning after fire raged through the 
boarded-up McKinley Mansion, a stately home near Lafayette Park that was 
declared a historic monument seven years ago in an effort to save it from 
demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze in the landmark structure -- long since stripped of the elaborate 
furnishings that had made it a Los Angeles showplace in the decades after World 
War I -- was reported by passersby at 6:09 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters reached the bluff-top home overlooking Rampart Boulevard a few 
minutes after the call came in, and finally snuffed out the blaze about 7:15 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The identity of the victims was not immediately determined, and the cause of 
their deaths also remained a mystery. But the county coroner's office said 
autopsies would be performed within the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 With the blaze under control, firefighters began to search the cavernous 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims was found on the second floor. The other was discovered 
sprawled in the third-floor attic. 
</P>
<P>
 The crumbling, 13,000-square-foot Italian Renaissance-style home had been 
unoccupied for years. However, neighbors said transients often scaled the 
chain-link fence surrounding the extensive, weed-choked grounds to take up 
temporary residence there. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Daniels and his wife, Sherry, a San Fernando Valley couple who spent years 
in a futile attempt to save the historic home, were left heartbroken by the 
fire that claimed the two lives and dashed their longtime dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is gone," Rod Daniels said Monday after viewing the blackened ruins. 
"It's like losing a member of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 The ornate, 20-room house at 3rd Street and Lafayette Park Place was built by 
a millionaire from Ohio in 1915 as a winter home. Daniels said a series of 
other families bought the house, lived in it for a while and then resold it 
before it was purchased in 1945 by Maytor McKinley, the wealthy mortuary owner 
for whom it is named. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinley lived there until his death about 20 years later. His widow lived 
there until she died in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, after developers purchased the property with the intent of building a 
118-unit apartment complex on it, the Los Angeles Conservancy intensified its 
efforts to save the old house. A few months later, on the urging of the 
conservancy, the city declared the mansion a cultural-historic monument. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the Danielses stepped in. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchasing the structure from the developers for a token $1, they announced 
plans to saw it into three pieces and haul it, one piece at a time, to a site 
in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still in perfect condition when we bought it, except for some 
gold-plated doorknobs and light fixtures that were missing," Sherry Daniels 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the couple's best intentions, their plans for saving the old house 
came to naught. Although the developer's efforts to tear down the structure 
without a permit on New Year's Eve, 1988, were foiled, the Danielses ran out of 
money, and the boarded-up mansion stayed where it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next six years, the development plans stagnated. 
</P>
<P>
 Year by year, the house continued to decay -- broken roof tiles, shattered 
windows and piles of trash accumulating in a yard dominated by the ruins of the 
once-grand front porch, ripped from the mansion during the aborted attempt to 
tear it down in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition work was all but completed Monday by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw it this morning, I felt sick, just sick," Sherry Daniels said. "It 
could have been one of the most beautiful homes in Los Angeles. Instead, it's 
gone."

FRIENDS MOURN WOMAN KILLED IN DESERT BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lynn Standish, a single mother killed by a mysterious explosion in the desert 
near her Pearblossom home, was remembered Monday by friends and family as a 
woman who often hiked through the sandy terrain, looking for collectibles, 
recyclables and a few moments of peace in what was sometimes a troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert calm was shattered Friday afternoon, investigators said, when some 
type of explosive device went off while Standish, 33, was sifting through 
discarded items in a patch of open desert. She might have picked up or stepped 
on the object. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved making jewelry," said her mother, Virginia Holmes. "She would find 
old beads or old bottles that they don't make any more. She'd find old lace out 
there -- even clothes. It was peaceful and relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved anything to do with the outdoors," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 With a smile, her father, Keith Holmes, added: "She came back the other day 
and showed me she had 10 pennies that someone had thrown away with their junk." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Standish's three sons accompanied her on the hike. Her 4-year-old, 
Michael Hepburn, suffered a serious leg injury in the blast. His brother, 
Jeffrey Standish, 9, who was standing a short distance away from his mother, 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members provided some details about what happened after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that Michael was injured, Jeffrey took off his shirt and used it to 
cover his younger brother. Jeffrey then carried Michael to their mother's car. 
A passing motorist summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not hurt, Jeffrey stayed in his brother's Antelope Valley 
Hospital room for three days, offering comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His grandparents said Michael must remain in traction for four weeks while 
receiving treatment for his leg injury, but they said he is expected to recover 
fully. 
</P>
<P>
 A third son, Jared Standish, 14, had not joined the others on the hike. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, Standish was unemployed. She lived with her parents 
in the small unincorporated town where she had grown up. She devoted most of 
her time to caring for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a single mother, she felt she needed to be with the three boys," 
Virginia Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Standish's death, church members and neighbors in Pearblossom, about 20 
miles east of Palmdale, rallied around the surviving family members, offering 
sympathy, meals and donations for Standish's funeral and for her sons' future. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, sheriff's homicide investigators were still trying to figure out 
what sort of explosive device Standish had stumbled upon and who had left it 
along a dirt road near 106th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents of Pearblossom and neighboring Littlerock said they have 
complained for years about the widespread dumping of old sofas, appliances, 
junk vehicles and other trash in the undeveloped desert areas. But county 
officials have said they have neither enough funds nor staff to adequately 
enforce laws against dumping in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents have complained about the discarded goods, others, such 
as Standish, have looked for treasures that may be mixed in with the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several local leaders said that before Friday, they had never heard of 
an explosive device turning up among the discards. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral service for Standish is scheduled for 1 p.m. Thursday at 
Pearblossom Foursquare Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Cheryl Baker, a close friend of Standish and her family, will 
officiate. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is accepting donations to help with the family's expenses. Baker 
said checks can be mailed to P.O. Box 440, Pearblossom, Calif. 93553.

SENSORS IN SUBWAY PASSENGER AREAS URGED; HEALTH: CONGRESSMAN AND OTHERS CALL 
FOR DETECTORS AFTER DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS GASES IN RED LINE 
STATIONS. SUCH DEVICES WERE FIRST RECOMMENDED IN 1986. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gas detectors should be installed within passenger areas of the Los Angeles 
subway to provide the level of safety recommended at the outset of 
construction, said local transit officials, a medical specialist and a member 
of Congress on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came in response to a Times report Monday that methane and 
hydrogen sulfide gases are regularly entering the 15-month-old subway. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of safety experts recommended in 1986 that sensors be placed 
inside the stations at the passenger platform level to help monitor hydrogen 
sulfide, a toxic gas that is heavier than air. But the subway was built with 
the sensors inside exhaust ducts, almost at street level. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Kaye H. Kilburn, a professor of internal medicine at USC who specializes 
in researching the effects of exposure to hydrogen sulfide, said Monday that 
sensors should be installed in the passenger areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's far better that it show up on the (gas) probe than to have somebody 
hospitalized," Kilburn said. "It doesn't look like a very complex issue to me." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority reiterated Monday 
that emergency fans disperse both hydrogen sulfide and methane before the gases 
reach dangerous concentrations. Technicians with the MTA have said that they do 
not believe gas detectors are needed within the stations because trains mix the 
air, allowing the detectors in the exhaust ducts to monitor methane and 
hydrogen sulfide. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, the agency's chief executive, said he has asked his staff 
to further study the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Passenger areas of the stations normally are not the areas in which our 
engineers would expect any gas buildup because of the ventilation caused by 
fans and trains," White said. "I have asked, however, that our engineers take a 
look at the issue and report on it to the board of directors at its June (22) 
meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Monday that elevated levels of methane, an odorless gas 
that is lighter than air, have reached the MTA's warning or alarm levels more 
than 350 times during the past 15 months. The warning and alarm levels are far 
below the concentration at which methane becomes explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hydrogen sulfide, which smells like rotten eggs, is present at as many as 
three of the subway stations. The gas has been detected at up to 9.9 parts per 
million, within the range in which health authorities say people exposed to it 
could suffer headaches, nausea or eye irritation. Hydrogen sulfide can be 
lethal at 150 p.p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilburn said his studies of workers and residents around oil refineries have 
found that exposures of one to 10 p.p.m., in open-air environments, adversely 
affect balance and reaction time. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas has reached the MTA's warning or alarm levels a handful of times and 
is most noticeable at the Civic Center station. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be no possible reason not to have the sensors at the lowest 
possible points," said Marvin L. Holen, an appointee to the MTA. Holen said he 
was skeptical of relying on train movements to adequately mix the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to tell you, there's a lot of wind in that (Civic Center) station," 
Holen said. "And it smells awfully gassy to me." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) said the news of the gas 
incursions into the subway should prompt increased congressional oversight. In 
response to Waxman's safety concerns nearly a decade ago, the subway project 
was modified to guard against a methane-gas explosion such as one that blew 
apart a Fairfax District clothing store. 
</P>
<P>
 Local transit officials designed the stations and tunnels with a lining of 
plastic to seal out gases. Congress, as a condition of providing nearly half 
the funding for the first segment of the $1.45-billion Red Line, outlawed 
tunneling on Wilshire Boulevard in the Fairfax area. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, the City Council responded to Waxman's concerns by forming 
the panel of safety experts, who recommended that gas detectors be placed 
within passenger areas of the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Waxman said, "I think the disclosures that have come out (this week) with 
respect to the methane gas danger underscore the need for congressional 
oversight, by way of hearings or investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman said that he would write to the chairmen of the House committees that 
control transportation spending. "I'm going to be looking at all the things 
Metro Rail is doing, to see that the promises are kept," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, spokeswoman for Mayor Richard Riordan, said that the mayor 
is concerned about the gas problems and has asked White to address the issue at 
Wednesday's MTA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Patsaouras, an appointee to the MTA who has criticized the quality of 
subway construction and inspection, called on White to place the gas detectors 
inside the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see why we should not do it," said Patsaouras, who is an engineer. 
"It cannot hurt, and it can help. I don't care what it costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The article Monday also reported problems with the installation of the plastic 
gas barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, an MTA board member, said that 
officials had been "sold a snake-oil membrane" at a cost of $2 million per mile 
of tunnel. Antonovich called the installation part of a "pattern of neglectful 
oversight, mismanagement and disregard for standard industry practice." He, 
too, called for installation of gas detectors within the stations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contractors who installed the plastic lining said the material was difficult 
to handle. Some of them have said that its design was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham, the firm that supervised construction, 
have said they needed more inspectors for the first subway tunnels and 
stations. They have said they are doing a better job of supervising ongoing 
construction.

ELECTIONS / 45TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT; POLITICIANS BATTLE OVER NON-LATINO 
CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an area with a long history of Latino representation, the Democratic 
primary race in Northeast Los Angeles' 45th Assembly District has sparked a 
dispute among some politicians about whether a non-Latino should inherit the 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The race in the heavily Latino district not only pits candidates backed by 
political rivals -- county Supervisor Gloria Molina and Assemblyman Richard 
Polanco (D-Los Angeles) -- but it also has divided Latinos who have strongly 
supported Polanco. He is the district's current representative but is vacating 
the seat to run for the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Polanco supporters are upset that he is endorsing his chief of staff, 
Bill Mabie, who is white, to fill the seat that has been held by Latinos since 
1972. Molina is backing a Latino candidate, Antonio Villaraigosa. 
</P>
<P>
 The area has been the site of a decade of battles between Latino candidates 
representing the Molina camp and a competing group headed by Polanco and Los 
Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre. But in this year's primary, the 
dynamics have become more complex because ethnicity has been injected into the 
mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the major, if not the major race, in the Latino community," 
said David Ayon, a political scientist at Loyola Marymount University. "This is 
going to be a preview of barrio-based politics to politics beyond the barrio. . 
. . Eventually, most Latino voters will be facing situations like this because 
they don't live in Latino-majority (voting) districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina beat Polanco in an adjacent Assembly district in 1982. Polanco won his 
current seat in a bitter 1986 contest against current Los Angeles Councilman 
Mike Hernandez, who was backed by Molina. This year's race is shaping up to be 
no less confrontational. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa has accused Mabie and Polanco of distorting the facts surrounding 
his arrest in 1977 on an assault charge. Mabie and Polanco deny that they have 
sought to taint Villaraigosa's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's current boundaries stretch from Highland Park to Hollywood and 
Boyle Heights, taking in Mt. Washington, Silver Lake and Echo Park. Latinos 
make up 63% of the district's 370,000 residents but only 36% of its 83,311 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Northeast Los Angeles has been the focus of lengthy civil rights battles that 
resulted in court-ordered reapportionments to create Latino-majority districts 
for the City Council and county Board of Supervisors during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Polanco supporters charge that he has turned his back on those 
hard-fought victories by endorsing Mabie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of maintaining and electing Latino candidates, especially in a 
district where we have fought so hard for Latino representation," said state 
Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). "Certainly, candidates who are not Latinos 
would have ample opportunity to run in other districts." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres has not endorsed either candidate, saying he will consider giving his 
nod to Villaraigosa if the race gets ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, he and other Latino lawmakers say, just because Mabie is white 
does not mean that he will not be sensitive to the needs of the district's 
Latino residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's a difference when someone is Latino, knows Latinos, and can speak 
to the issues as a Latino," said Assemblyman Joe Baca (D-San Bernardino). "When 
you face prejudice, only you yourself can feel what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre, Polanco's longtime ally, said he has not endorsed either candidate 
but added that he believes a Latino should represent the district. "At this 
point in our history, we should be attempting to elect and assist Hispanic 
candidates," Alatorre said. "Every other race does the same thing. I expressed 
that to Richard. But I respect his decision (to back Mabie)." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco said there were several Latinos that he wanted to endorse, such as 
Leticia Quezada, president of the Los Angeles Board of Education, but none were 
willing to run. He said he decided to support Mabie because he was the most 
qualified candidate. In all, five Democrats are running in the district's June 
7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not, on the knee-jerk, going to support someone who will not be the best 
candidate based on the color of their skin," Polanco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mabie and Villaraigosa maintain that ethnicity is not a factor in the 
election and say that voters are more concerned with issues such as crime, 
education and the economy.

<P>
 "I think it's demeaning to both of us to package us as white and Latino 
candidates," Villaraigosa said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Mabie: "I believe that my abilities, my accomplishments and my commitment 
to representing the residents of this district are what matter most." He added 
that he has worked hundreds of hours to help elect Latino candidates in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa acknowledges that he was arrested in 1977 for what he says was an 
assault on a man who attacked his mother during a "big melee" at a Mexican 
restaurant near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He accuses Polanco and Mabie of spreading rumors that the arrest was for a 
felony stabbing. Villaraigosa says he only hit the man with his fists and was 
charged with misdemeanor assault. He says he was acquitted by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Records for the 17-year-old case could not be located. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Villaraigosa was named Antonio Villar. But when he 
married in 1988, he dropped the r in his last name and added his wife's maiden 
name, Raigosa. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie denies knowing that his opponent had an arrest record. "I don't know 
what the heck he is talking about," Mabie said. "I'm running a good, clean 
campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanco did not return several telephone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of Villaraigosa's past arrest was reviewed by the Peace Officers 
Research Assn. of California several weeks ago, after it and other labor groups 
endorsed Villaraigosa. After the review, it stood by its endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Villaraigosa, 41, was born and raised in East Los Angeles and has engaged in 
activities ranging from voter registration to union activism. He is a past 
president of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California and is 
Molina's alternate to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board of 
directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabie, 32, is a fluent Spanish speaker who spent two years with the Peace 
Corps in Honduras, where he designed and managed fish hatcheries. He is 
president of the Highland Park Chamber of Commerce and is the founder of 
Gardens for Kids, a nonprofit organization that builds gardens at urban schools 
in Los Angeles to train youths for science and agricultural careers.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; RESERVOIR 
WILL BE CLOSED TO RECREATION UNTIL FRIDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hollywood Reservoir will be closed for recreational activities until 
Friday morning for disinfection testing and treatment, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Water and Power workers will inject chlorine into the 
1.3-billion-gallon reservoir to help control bacterial growth that typically 
occurs during this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Public access to the popular jogging and cycling area will be restricted 
temporarily, DWP spokeswoman Debra Sass said, because portable chlorination 
equipment will be placed on the reservoir's perimeter road.  
</P>
<P>
 There will be no interruption of water service to customers during the 
treatment process, she added. The reservoir will be returned to service as soon 
as water quality testing is finished.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING JURY 
ASKS JUDGE'S HELP IN DEFINING TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The jury considering punitive damages in Rodney G. King's lawsuit asked the 
judge for help Monday in defining some terms that use-of-force witnesses 
mentioned during the trial.  
</P>
<P>
 The panel made its request in a note, the seventh in five days of 
deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 The six women and three men wanted to know the definitions of "combative 
resistance, aggressive resistance and active resistance." These were terms 
bandied about repeatedly during trial, especially by the use-of-force 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge John G. Davies told the panel those terms were "not 
subject to legal interpretation. Give them whatever definition you think is 
appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel that awarded King $3.8 million in compensatory damages on April 19 
has spent more than 30 hours deliberating in the second phase of the trial.

 At least the Southland has one world champion: We mean the Long Beach Little 
Leaguers, of course, whose 1992 and 1993 title seasons are profiled in "The 
Little Team That Could." The book, by coach and ex-major leaguer Jeff Burroughs 
and Long Beach columnist Tom Hennessy, reveals: 
</P>
<P>
 * The team had two sleepwalkers, a pianist who could play Chopin, a player who 
pounded his bat on the plate to "summon up the home-run god" and a pitcher who 
was too nearsighted to read the catcher's signals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little League World Series rules prohibit players from eating sunflower 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the team was asked to donate items to a fund-raising auction, one 
player, whose parents objected to the time he spent on the bench, contributed a 
handful of splinters. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Filipino team, which forfeited its 1992 title because several players 
were older than 12, including some who reportedly had body hair removed, wasn't 
the only suspicious entry. The Dominican Republic's players, viewed in the 
shower, "looked like managers and coaches . . . anatomically speaking," the 
authors say. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Filipino reporter whose articles led to his country's forfeit was 
awarded a key to the city of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * There were several emotional moments, such as the time Burroughs became 
teary-eyed while speaking before the team's last game. Kevin Miller, one of the 
players, interjected: "Gee, coach, get ahold of yourself. I mean, what a dork!"

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CHINATOWN; WOMAN PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY IN ALLEGED SCHOOL ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles woman was held on $2-million bail Monday after she pleaded not 
guilty to firing a gun at school children last week in Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was hurt in the incident Thursday, in which prosecutors contend that 
Charlotte De La Torre, 31, fired on children at a school on Alpine Street.She 
is charged with two counts of attempted murder and two counts of assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members who were in court for De La Torre's arraignment denied that she 
had fired at schoolchildren. They say the school is nearly two blocks from the 
shooting scene and that the woman was shooting instead at her roommate's car, 
which was parked in front of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 They described De La Torre as having a mental illness that led her to believe 
someone was trying to harm her.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AUTOMATIC 
GAS SHUTOFFS FOR NEW BUILDINGS URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Automatic valves that would shut off gas lines in an earthquake should be 
installed in new and remodeled buildings, the head of a key Los Angeles City 
Council panel said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Marvin Braude's recommendation differs from a previous, 
wider-ranging proposal to retrofit industrial and commercial buildings and 
apartment complexes with at least five units.The council rejected that plan two 
weeks ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The Public Safety Committee chairman wants the automatic valve requirement to 
be effective July 1, 1995. The recommendation would cover all renovations 
costing more than $1,000.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the ordinance prepared, if that's possible," said Braude, who 
expects the full council to vote on it June 14. "Maybe the Fire Department can 
also help determine those standards."  
</P>

 The valves cost $250 each, but critics say the devices are plagued by false 
alarms and some did not go off during the Jan. 17 Northridge quake.

HELD FOR QUESTIONING ABOUT MURDER OF OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigration agents Monday arrested a deportee in Virginia who Los Angeles 
detectives want to question about the murder of Manhattan Beach police officer. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old man "is not considered a suspect" in the Dec. 27 killing of 
Martin Ganz, but "he has similar features described in the composite (drawing 
of the killer) and in one of the clues received by the task force" of 
investigators, said George Ducoulombier, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force investigating the crime has received more than 1,800 tips, 
Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was arrested on a no-bail warrant from California for failing to leave 
the country, Ducoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ganz's killer is described as an Asian, possibly Filipino, age 25 to 39, and 
possibly 5 feet, 6 inches to 5 feet, 10 inches tall with a medium build.

2 SLAIN IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two 18-year-old men were killed in a drive-by shooting Monday when they 
stopped their gray Cadillac at a traffic light in Altadena, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two victims, whose names were not released pending notification of 
relatives, were shot by at least one of three occupants of a green Cadillac 
that pulled alongside them about 3 p.m. at Lake Avenue and New York Drive, 
Sheriff's Lt. Ray Peavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims stumbled out of the car and staggered about 20 feet to the 
curb, where he collapsed, witnesses said. The driver managed to drive the car 
through the intersection, Peavy said.

MURDER DEFENDANT A STUDY IN CONTRADICTIONS; TRIAL: PROSECUTOR QUESTIONS MARY 
ELLEN SAMUELS' CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE AFTER RECEIVING $500,000 AS RESULT OF 
HUSBAND'S SLAYING. 'I LIVED NORMALLY,' SAMUELS SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Mary Ellen Samuels told it, she was a shy person whose spending habits 
changed not a whit after her husband was murdered in 1988 and she received 
$500,000 in insurance and inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid bills. I lived like I normally did," Samuels told a jury last week as 
she testified in her own defense at her murder trial in Van Nuys Superior 
Court. "I bought a new car." 
</P>
<P>
 But a different portrait of Samuels emerged Monday after she endured a 
prosecutor's cross-examination in the double murder-solicitation case. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the new car was a $75,000 Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, denied that she hired a hit man to kill her estranged husband, 
then two other hit men to do in the executioner. She has testified that the 
prosecution witnesses -- many of them once her closest friends -- all lied when 
they linked her to the murders of her husband, motion picture camera operator 
Robert Samuels, 40, and the suspected killer, reputed cocaine dealer James 
Bernstein, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi's questioning, Samuels stuck to her story 
that $500,000 did not change her lifestyle, even if she did spend most of it in 
about nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the cross-examination wore on, Samuels' description of living like she 
"normally did" seemed to fit the dictionary definition of life in the fast 
lane: limousines, fur coats, the Porsche, nightclubs, a country club birthday 
bash, a condo in Cancun, trips to Las Vegas and San Francisco and loans to 
friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, she testified that when her husband was alive, "there never seemed to 
be enough money." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi's questions made it clear she considers Samuels anything but a demure 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You testified you are very shy," Maurizi stated, then asked Samuels about a 
photograph taken months after she was widowed. In the snapshot, she is wearing 
nothing but $20,000 in cold cash and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels responded that she had had a few drinks when the picture -- her 
boyfriend's idea -- was snapped in a motel room in Cancun. Her testimony 
contradicted that of the boyfriend, Dean Groover, who earlier told the jury 
that the pinup pose had been both his and Samuels' idea and that Samuels had 
not been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor pressed Samuels about the time she showed up at a boyfriend's 
hotel room, wearing only a fur coat and teddy, and about "cheesecake" 
photographs that Samuels insisted were taken for a mother-daughter contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was short on specifics about the mother-daughter contest. Last week 
she testified she wore a teddy for the photos. Monday, she objected to the term 
cheesecake and denied wearing the teddy. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other contradictions, large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Samuels said she left her husband in October, 1986, then changed it 
to November. On Monday, she said it was in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi dug into the credit card records, the insurance records, the divorce 
papers, even the telephone records in confronting Samuels. She asked the 
defendant why Bernstein, a reputed cocaine dealer, would keep her name and 
Social Security and bank account numbers in a notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chief topic was money. Maurizi, alleging that Samuels killed for 
financial gain, is seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels conceded that she received about $500,000 in insurance proceeds and 
real estate after her husband's death. Had they divorced, she said they had 
agreed that she would receive about $30,000 and support payments of $1,200 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month after her husband died, Samuels traveled twice to Las Vegas. On 
one trip she charged two fur coats, worth about $1,600.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of those was a full-length coat, the other was a jacket. If they were 
real fur, it would have been more than that for one," Samuels explained. 
</P>
<P>
 She had outfits custom made at a store called Trashy Lingerie, running up 
bills of $1,500, four for $1,100, one for $800 and another for $900. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you still say your lifestyle didn't change?" Maurizi persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I got to do more things, naturally."

AL MARTINEZ: ORDEAL AT CHARLIE'S MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was a kid in Oakland, I stole a bag of doughnuts once from a grocery 
store on East 14th Street. They were glazed doughnuts in a brown bag. I did it 
because we were poor and I was hungry, and because it was an exciting thing to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 I hid the doughnuts inside a jacket and sidled out of the store as casually as 
I could, but I was a clumsy thief and the grocer, a man named Fred Barnes, saw 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 He shouted "Hey!" and came after me, red-faced and snorting fire, and cornered 
me in an alley about a block away. 
</P>
<P>
 I made a run at him to try knocking him out of the way, but he caught me by 
the nape of the neck, marched me back to the store and took my name and 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he'd be notifying my parents and juvenile authorities and I would be 
catching everyone's hell in just a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to Aldo Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 He stole a box of cookies from a place called Charlie's Market in Lynwood, and 
also was a clumsy thief. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the market, Michael Kim, saw him. Aldo, a 14-year-old, took off. 
Kim jumped in his car and caught him three blocks away. Then he shot him. 
</P>
<P>
 He did it, Kim said, because the boy with Aldo had a knife. No knife was 
found, but a screwdriver was later recovered. He did it, Kim said, because Aldo 
appeared to be reaching for a weapon. There was no weapon, but Aldo admits 
hiking up his shirt and reaching into his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 There was just that damned box of cookies scattered on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were filed against Kim because the kid stole cookies, 
didn't he, and Kim feared for his life, didn't he? Cookie thieves are notorious 
for murdering grocers. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was instantly compared to the killing of 15-year-old Latasha Harlins 
in Compton three years ago. She was shot dead by grocer Soon Ja Du after the 
two had struggled over a $1.79 bottle of orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Du was fined $500 and placed on probation. Few killers are granted such an 
easy way out. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldo didn't die. The bullet fired from Kim's .38 missed his heart. The D.A.'s 
office announced magnanimously that it would not file shoplifting charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
 There are similarities between the shootings of Latasha and Aldo. Both guns 
were fired by Korean Americans, though Latasha was black and Aldo is Latino. 
Both shootings were set in motion by the theft of items worth less than $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said no charges would be filed against Kim because no 
prosecutable crime occurred. Commentators, defending Kim's actions, pointed out 
that 35 Korean American owners of small businesses have been shot in L.A. in 
the past year. He had a right not to become No. 36. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chicano activist Armando Sotomayor cut through the statistics and legal 
justification when he stood on the steps of the Criminal Courts Building and 
said, "You don't shoot a 14-year-old boy over a 49-cent box of cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are those who see the shooting of a Latino by a Korean as a racial 
incident. I don't. I see it as a metaphor of the time and place in which we 
live, in a society packaged by violence and summarized by clashing rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldo Vega had no right to steal from the store. Michael Kim had a right to 
pursue him. Aldo Vega had no right to make a threatening gesture. Michael Kim 
had a right to defend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Rights are endlessly debated in a nation that revolves around them. But the 
debate ends when guns are fired. 
</P>
<P>
 There are an estimated 200 million firearms in private hands in this country, 
and arguments are increasingly terminated, and rights defended, by their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners shoot at intruders, car owners shoot at thieves, property owners 
shoot at trespassers . . . and grocery store owners shoot at kids who steal 
orange juice and cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever know whether Kim actually feared for his life or was trying, 
in his way, to teach a lesson. Give him the benefit of the doubt. He was in a 
state of terror. 
</P>
<P>
 But I can't help wondering what would have happened to me those many years ago 
had similar conditions existed. Would Fred Barnes have armed himself, pursued 
me and shot me dead when I lunged at him? 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt it. We were a different world back then, less prone to cause pain and 
more inclined to weigh the value of a human life against the loss of a grocery 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes took my name, but never turned me in. I lived in fear for weeks that he 
might, and the fear stamped its message on my life. The grocer taught a lesson 
without a shot being fired. 
</P>
<P>
 You didn't shoot a kid over a bag of doughnuts back then. Sadly, things have 
changed. Michael Kim and Aldo Vega, thrust together in the context of petty 
crime and excessive punishment, will symbolize that change for a long time to 
come.

ONE ELECTION DOES NOT A DEMOCRACY MAKE; REFORM: FORMERLY AUTHORITARIAN STATES 
NEED HELP IN PERMANENTLY GIVING UP THEIR OLD, BAD HABITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALISON BRYSK, Alison Brysk is an assistant professor of politics at Pomona 
College and author of The Politics of Human Rights in Argentina (Stanford 
University Press.) 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Photos of newly enfranchised voters thronging polling places have become 
commonplace, from Russia to South Africa to El Salvador. But just as Americans 
begin to replace our image of the guerrilla with the citizen, nagging rips 
appear at the edges of the new picture. Why has democracy been reversed so 
quickly in Peru, Haiti and Serbia? Will political openings in Mexico and 
Indochina be endangered by social unrest?  
</P>
<P>
 We Americans are notorious for our optimism, our pragmatism -- and our lack of 
historical consciousness. As the world democratizes, our optimistic assumption 
of a clean slate imperils the pragmatism necessary for making policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Elections, we must remember, are a necessary but not a sufficient condition 
for democracy. If elections do not include major sectors of society (like 
peasants or former communists) or address key issues (like land reform or 
economic adjustment), new citizens will quickly become alienated and 
anti-system. Democracy must also include human rights, civilian control of the 
military and some measure of accountability for the new government once it has 
been elected. Citizenship implies empowerment, and elections are only the first 
step in that process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than treat emerging democracies as infant republics, it is appropriate 
to see them as "recovering authoritarians." Like recovering alcoholics, new 
democracies emerge damaged by a pattern of learned behavior to which they will 
always be especially susceptible. The bad news is that these countries' 
heritage will often war with their institutions. The good news is that this 
heritage is not cultural or eternal; learned behavior can be unlearned and the 
analysis of common patterns may help manage recovery. Thus, we should not be 
surprised at the problems shared by recovering authoritarians in all parts of 
the world: poverty, policing and polarization. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the previous level or path of economic development, recovering 
authoritarians experience poverty because unaccountable states have been 
inefficient and predatory economic managers. This is more than the conventional 
wisdom about distorting markets; market-oriented authoritarians have also 
dismantled infrastructure and looted the national patrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 New democracies often face a crisis of policing because social order has never 
been rooted in a social contract that rewards restraint with security and 
opportunity. When massive coercion is removed -- or shifted from the military 
or secret police to the police proper -- no "thin blue line" can stem the tide 
of self-seeking, anti-social behavior by citizens bereft of social guarantees 
or guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, democratizing societies quickly polarize along lines of ethnicity, 
class and ideology. Civil societies never developed where social institutions 
such as churches were controlled by the state or closed off entirely. In many 
cases, a society temporarily integrated by the authoritarian regime -- or by 
opposition to it -- suddenly collapses with the transition to democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 What is to be done? As sympathetic outsiders, we cannot repair the damage of 
authoritarianism but we can support, with our policies, the general principles 
of recovery. First, the recovering polity itself must accept responsibility and 
come to terms with the past. This may involve measures such as human-rights 
investigations (as in Chile) or reconstruction of social and economic 
infrastructure (as in East Germany). We also need to make it clear that new 
democracies cannot afford the "first drink" of a postponed election or 
suspended constitution. Finally, the world community can form support groups 
for democratization and its challenges. The Organization of American States 
seems to be moving toward this role for Latin America. Different cases will 
require different levels of U.S. involvement. Where possible, however, we must 
provide reparations and multilateral support. At the same time, we must shed 
the dysfunctional bonds that all too often propped up the previous 
authoritarian regime.

MARTINA'S ADIEU SAID WITH HASTE; FRENCH OPEN: IN HER FINAL SINGLES AT ROLAND 
GARROS STADIUM, NAVRATILOVA LOSES IN THE FIRST ROUND TO OREMANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martina Navratilova's final French Open singles match ended Monday with a 
smash. It was not, however, the mark of a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Navratilova slammed her racket to the red clay surface after a 6-4, 6-4 
defeat by No. 50 Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands, it was an emotional 
outburst that underscored a disappointing return to Roland Garros Stadium after 
a six-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
 She then threw the twisted racket into a trash can, where a fan claimed it as 
a souvenir. And then she left Court 1 without looking at her fans as she waved 
goodby. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, 36, still is playing doubles and mixed doubles here, but Monday's 
elimination obviously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never done that before," she said of smashing her racket. "And I hope 
I never will again. But at that point I was too disappointed to care about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, playing in her final French Open, had hoped for a farewell worthy 
of her 18 singles titles in Grand Slam tournaments, including two in Paris. Her 
worst performances here before Monday were in 1988 and 1983, when she lost in 
the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova had not lost in the first round of a Grand Slam event since the 
1976 U.S. Open. Oremans was 3 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova, ranked fourth, was the biggest loser on the French Open's first 
day, which also marked the debut of a new 10,000-seat showcase stadium, Court 
A. Joining her on the sidelines, though, was No. 13 Magdalena Maleeva of 
Bulgaria, who was upset by No. 96 Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania, 6-3, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Steffi Graf, trying for her fifth consecutive victory in a Grand 
Slam event, rolled to a 6-2, 6-2 victory over Katarina Studenikova of Slovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova's loss did little to help the women's competition, already lacking 
former stars Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she will be missed very badly, not only from the public, but from the 
players," Graf said of Navratilova. "She is such a personality that she is 
going to leave a big gap." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a bigger gap between Navratilova and Oremans. Oremans, 21, 
looked like the veteran, forcing Navratilova to chase balls across the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martina had nothing on her shots," said Virginia Wade, a former Wimbledon 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The match seemed to turn on the sixth game of the second set with Navratilova 
leading, 3-2. She had a chance to take a 4-2 lead when she fended off two game 
points, and took the advantage. But Oremans' aggressive net play saved the 
serve as she won three consecutive points to pull to 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martina has always been a front-runner," Wade said. "After losing that game, 
she starts looking depressed, not sure if she is going to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Oremans sensed as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was telling myself, 'If I win this game, I have got a lot of chance (to 
win),' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's victory was one of the first positive moments of the year for 
Oremans, who lives in a village in the southern Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a village with 9,000 inhabitants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And eight clay courts. 
</P>
<P>
 She dropped dramatically in the rankings this year after suffering a torn leg 
muscle before the Australian Open. She played anyway, aggravating the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Oremans said that with rest and treatment, she recuperated and her 
hard-hitting game returned. For Navratilova, it could not have happened at a 
worse time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I finally will get to go the Louvre," Navratilova said. 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova said she did not want to think about ending a long career at 
Roland Garros, where she played in six finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get misty eyed," she said. "I think that is why I was more affected by 
losing, because I know this is the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think because I played so many years, it is that much more difficult to let 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday she had no choice.

STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS; DEVILS' NICHOLLS MAKES GOOD 
USE OF ENFORCED REST 
</P>

<P>
 Bernie Nicholls' one-game suspension didn't help the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it might have hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls scored two goals for the New Jersey Devils, who moved within a game 
of the Stanley Cup finals with a 4-1 victory over the Rangers on Monday night 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 He had missed Saturday night's game after NHL officials ruled his shot at the 
Rangers' Alexei Kovalev had been a premeditated cross-check. The Devils won 
anyway, 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension actually helped him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first rest in a couple of months, and I had a lot of jump in my 
legs," Nicholls said Monday. "Regardless of whether I deserved it or not, I did 
get suspended. I felt I let my team down and was excited to get out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Devils, with a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven Eastern Conference final, can 
finish off the series with a victory in Game 6 Wednesday night at the 
Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers, whose longest losing streak during the regular season was three 
games en route to the best record in the NHL, lost for the second consecutive 
time in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey, which lost all six regular-season games to the Rangers, took 
control of this one with tough defense and opportunistic offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholls' first goal came in a short-handed situation and his other on a power 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 It was pretty much the Devils' game from start to finish. They held the 
Rangers to 26 shots and not many quality scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is our positional play," New Jersey's Scott Stevens said. "They're a 
team that thrives on other teams running around. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did that in the first few games, but as the series has gone on, we've 
gotten better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Peluso and Tom Chorske scored the other goals for New Jersey. Goaltender 
Martin Brodeur was within 3:27 of his second playoff shutout before giving up a 
goal to Esa Tikkanen. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's confidence "has taken a hit, no question," Ranger Coach Mike Keenan 
said. "Atthe same time, the Devils have boosted theirs. They've earned that."

MORNING BRIEFING: QUEBEC STILL CARRIES A DEBT OF OLYMPIAN PROPORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1971, when Montreal was awarded the 1976 Olympics, then-mayor Jean Drapeau 
said, "The Olympic Games can no more have a deficit than a man can have a 
baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
 As writer Jeffrey Ulbrich recently put it, citizens of Montreal are now 
looking for pregnant men. The province of Quebec still owes $304 million for 
the Olympics and the debt grows every year. Montreal Olympic Stadium is known 
locally as "The Big O," but many spell it: "The Big Owe." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen years after the Olympics, the Games have cost about $1.7 billion, 
including roughly $750 million in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest? Michael Jordan's attempt to succeed in pro baseball -- he was 
batting .221 after Sunday -- reminds former Times sportswriter George Kiseda of 
a decades-ago conversation with NFL Hall of Famer Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during the time Wilt Chamberlain was considering a one-fight boxing 
career, against Muhammad Ali, with Brown as Wilt's manager," Kiseda said. "I 
ran into Brown at Wilt's Harlem nightclub and asked him, 'What makes you think 
Wilt can just announce he's going to be a boxer and then go out and do it? 
Nobody's ever done that.'  
</P>
<P>
 "Brown said to me, 'Don't tell me what nobody has ever done. We're talking 
about the greatest athlete who ever lived.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What catcher holds the major league record for fewest passed 
balls in a season (in 150 or more games)? 
</P>
<P>
 Score error: The other day, after San Diego pitcher Wally Whitehurst was hit 
by a line drive in a game against the Chicago Cubs, Chicago announcers Harry 
Caray and Steve Stone told of how a line drive hit by Gil McDougald in 1957 had 
ended the career of pitcher Herb Score. However, in a 1987 interview with The 
Times, Score said McDougald's liner had nothing to do with the early end to his 
career. Score was temporarily blinded by the ball, which hit him flush on the 
right eye on May 7, 1957. He was 25 that night. At 29, he was out of baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "The McDougald line drive had nothing to do with my career ending early," 
Score said. "I came back in '58 throwing as hard as ever. I had a good spring. 
I had 13 or 14 strikeouts in an early season game. . . . But late in a game I 
felt elbow and forearm pain and I didn't get the ball to the plate on two 
straight pitches. It was an elbow tendon injury. . . . After that, I never had 
any snap on my pitches." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Gary Carter, who had one passed ball for Montreal in 152 games 
in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Brother Ray Page, a teacher at St. Anthony High School in Jersey 
City, N.J., at a recent roast for St. Anthony grad Bobby Hurley: "He once asked 
me if Beirut was named after that famous baseball player who hit home runs."

THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT; AMID 'HUMAN' ERRORS, PLAYOFF OFFICIATING DEEMED 
BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Think the officiating in the playoffs isn't as good as it should be? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some nights, I'd agree wholeheartedly," said Bryan Lewis, the NHL's director 
of officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the time, he believes the NHL has identified its best referees and 
linesmen and they're doing the best possible job of making quick decisions 
under intense pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't mean they're not going to make errors," Lewis said. "There's 
certainly human judgment involved. I was at a game (last week) in Toronto and 
there were certain things I wish hadn't happened. There was a game Kerry 
(Fraser) did in New York that I could pick out a couple of things I didn't 
like, but in the context of the entire game, you understand it." 
</P>
<P>
 Referees and linesmen are monitored during the season and rated at season's 
end. The ratings aren't revealed to the officials. The NHL chooses playoff 
officials on merit, as does the NBA. Postseason baseball umpiring assignments 
are determined on merit but with restrictions, such as a minimum amount of 
experience, and no umpire can work both the playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials' contingent starts at 11 referees and 19 linesmen. It's cut to 
eight referees and 10 linesmen in the quarterfinals, six referees and eight 
linesmen in the semifinals and three referees and four linesmen in the finals. 
Eliminations are based on judgments by Lewis and series supervisors, who 
include former referees Dave Newell and Wally Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 The system isn't perfect. Andy van Hellemond, long rated among the top 
referees, has ignored a lot of restraining fouls and has allowed several games 
to get out of hand. He also missed Pavel Bure's brutal elbowing of Shane 
Churla. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marouelli has been behind plays and Terry Gregson has been so-so, although 
both New Jersey Coach Jacques Lemaire and the Rangers' Mike Keenan complained 
about him last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis wouldn't comment on specific officials, but said he is satisfied with 
the overall quality of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of complaints and issues, we haven't had anywhere near this year 
what we had last year," he said. "Our ability to pick apart what officials are 
doing is greater because of technology, and there's not a damn thing wrong with 
that. If the right team wins and the officials have made minimal errors, then 
they've done their job, and I firmly believe we are." NICK KNACK 
</P>
<P>
 In the pantheon of King general managers, Nick Beverley ranks in the middle of 
the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't as bad as Larry Regan, who traded the draft picks that became Reg 
Leach, Steve Shutt, Pierre Mondou and Mario Tremblay. And he wasn't as bad as 
George Maguire, who gave up the first-round pick Boston used to draft Ray 
Bourque and the first-rounder Buffalo used for Phil Housley. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wasn't as good as Rogie Vachon, who got Kelly Hrudey from the New York 
Islanders, Tomas Sandstrom and Tony Granato from the Rangers, Mike Donnelly 
from Buffalo for Mikko Makela, and Paul Coffey from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverley's peers lined up behind him when he and Coach Barry Melrose clashed 
over personnel moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good hockey man," they said, a euphemism meaning he's a member of the 
old-boys' club and Melrose is a brash, young pup. Melrose was out of line in 
that case, but Beverley was no genius. Still, he worked under difficult 
circumstances. The Kings' front-office setup meant decisions had to be approved 
by Beverley, club President Roy Mlakar, Melrose and Vachon. Too many voices, 
too little decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those who suggest Melrose should have become general manager, we say 
no. He showed no great eye for talent when he asked Beverley to get him Gary 
Shuchuk, Phil Crowe and Marc Potvin, and his affinity for Doug Houda is 
mystifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose was summoned to Los Angeles last week to meet with club officials, who 
told him his coaching job is safe -- for now. MELROSE AT THE MIKE 
</P>
<P>
 As ESPN's studio analyst, Melrose has learned much about the game -- including 
how easy it is to coach when you've got replays and assorted camera angles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched a lot of hockey and really gotten to watch players closely," he 
said. "I know the NHL better than I ever knew it before. I'm not 
second-guessing (other coaches), more watching what they do. Sometimes I say, 
'Geez, I might have done that differently.' It's been hard, seeing the 
excitement, knowing what's going on, not being there after being there last 
year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "What (doing commentary) has done is reinforce what I believe should be done 
with our team. The teams left are the big teams with physical guys who can 
skate and grind and make the big play when they need to." ONE IN SEVERAL 
MILLION 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Barnett, who represents top-rated draft prospect Radek Bonk, denied 
reports the Czech teen-ager is seeking a five-year, $20-million deal. Last 
year's top pick, Alexandre Daigle, got $12.5 million over five years from 
Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There haven't been any numbers discussed with anyone," Barnett said. "Most 
teams are playing things close to the vest. And we did not sit down and have an 
absolute, predetermined dollar amount and number of years." BAFFLING BRUINS 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a puzzler: Boston General Manager Harry Sinden is considering John 
Ferguson to fill the vacancy left when Mike Milbury resigned as assistant 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinden had planned to retire after next season and give most of his 
responsibilities to a younger man. At 55, Ferguson doesn't quite fit that bill. 
Ferguson, formerly general manager of the Rangers and the Winnipeg Jets, is 
Ottawa's director of player personnel. He and Sinden have been cronies since 
the 1972 "Super Series" against the Soviets. SLAP SHOTS 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver goalie Kirk McLean takes a 135-minute 23-second shutout streak into 
tonight's potential clincher against Toronto. The Canucks' speedy forwards have 
also played key roles in building a 3-1 series lead. Bure, who has a 14-game 
point-scoring streak, has been nearly unstoppable, and left wing Geoff 
Courtnall and center Cliff Ronning are creating havoc. . . . When Ranger Coach 
Keenan benched Brian Leetch, Brian Noonan and Craig MacTavish Saturday, he was 
trying to cover up shoulder injuries suffered by Leetch and MacTavish and 
Noonan's knee injury. Mark Messier is slowed by rib and hip problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Corey of Montreal will probably succeed Bruce McNall as chairman of the 
Board of Governors, but Calgary co-owner Harley Hotchkiss is also a strong 
candidate. . . . Jay Leach, coach of the Flyers' American Hockey League farm 
team, is favored to replace Terry Simpson in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Whaler players didn't respect 32-year-old Coach Pierre McGuire. Firing him 
"was the best thing that could have happened," winger Pat Verbeek said. . . . 
The Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League won the Memorial Cup 
(Canadian junior championship) with a 5-3 victory Sunday over Laval of the 
Quebec League. Kamloops center Darcy Tucker, a 1993 Montreal draft pick, was 
the tournament's most valuable player.

 The teen-agers said they were attacked when one taunted Coleman and teammate 
Jayson Williams after the Nets had lost to the New York Knicks in the NBA 
playoffs. The youths have sued Coleman for $7.6 million.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

 Oscar De La Hoya says he will be making the first and last defense of his 
World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight title Friday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 No, he doesn't expect to lose to prohibitive underdog Giorgio Campanella at 
the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is simply that De La Hoya -- who stands 5 feet 10 and must make 130 at the 
weigh-in Thursday -- is 21 and growing in size, ambition, and maturity. He has 
won all 12 of his professional bouts. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "My good matches upcoming are at 135 pounds for the WBA, WBC or IBF titles," 
he said the other day after sparring the championship distance of 12 rounds at 
Larry Goossen's Boxing Gym in Big Bear. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The IBF lightweight champion is Rafael Ruelas, who will defend his title on 
the same pay-per-view card Friday against Mike Evgen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some night, Ruelas of Sylmar vs. De La Hoya of East Los Angeles will pack an 
arena in the Southland. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural," said Ruelas' trainer, Joe Goossen. "I don't think it will be 
that much longer before it's made." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe next year," De La Hoya said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they already have fought one another. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We boxed three times in the junior amateurs when we were 13, 14 years old," 
Ruelas said. "I beat him two out of three. He's fast and strong and very good, 
but I know I can beat him." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya said, "I recall boxing him when we were 9 or 10, but I can't 
remember how many times or exactly what happened. He's a brawler, but I don't 
see a lot of skill there. He has a lot of conditioning, but that's about it." . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Both trained the last few weeks in clean air at 7,000 feet altitude, but lived 
about 10 miles apart and rarely saw one another. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 By late next year, though, they should be getting together up close and 
personal. . . .  
</P>

<P>
 The New York Knicks, who could use a scorer, might sign Dominique Wilkins. . .

 Somehow, I don't think NBC wants an Indiana-Houston NBA final or ESPN a 
Vancouver-New Jersey Stanley Cup final. . . .

 The U.S. Senate has approved a Bear Bryant postage stamp. . . .

 Jimmy Johnson not only will appear on NFL shows for the Fox and HBO networks, 
he will be the co-host of a Monday night pregame show in Dallas. . . .

 Wayne Lukas, who likes to use sports analogies, says he will "take a little 
more off his fastball" while training Preakness winner Tabasco Cat for the 
Belmont Stakes. . . .

<P>
 Alexis Arguello, 41, ought to forget about his comeback after suffering a 
broken rib in training. The three-time champion was supposed to fight for the 
first time in six years Saturday in Lake Charles, La. . . .

 It turns out that the New York Rangers do have a couple of finalists for 
awards -- the City of Hope Victor Awards. Mike Keenan has been nominated for 
pro hockey coach of the year and Mark Messier for comeback player of the year. 
The presentation ceremony from the Las Vegas Hilton will be televised June 11 
on Prime Ticket. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens High sophomore Michael Granville's 1:48.98 clocking in the 800 
meters in the CIF Southern Section interdivisional finals Saturday was nearly a 
full second faster than the winning time in the Pacific 10 Conference meet the 
same day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ask Philadelphia Manager Jim Fregosi about the importance of injuries. Only 
six Phillies spent time on the disabled list during their National League 
pennant-winning year last season. Less than two months into this season, the 
Phillies have had 10 players on the DL. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How can the Texas Rangers, who gave up 40 runs during the last three games of 
their series at Seattle, build a team that is so powerful, but so weak in 
pitching? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Five American League hitters -- Joe Carter, Julio Franco, Kirby Puckett, Robin 
Ventura and Ken Griffey -- are driving in at least one run a game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Add the Baltimore Orioles to those reportedly interested in Ron Gant. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers' position in the National League West standings and their team 
unity strengthen my belief that, for the benefit of all concerned, they should 
release Darryl Strawberry and let him try a comeback somewhere else.

SOCCER / JULIE CART; AS USUAL, FIFA'S HAVELANGE GETS HIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That Joao Havelange got his way at last week's FIFA executive committee 
meeting was no surprise, considering that the question carried potent financial 
and political ramifications. Expanding the World Cup finals from 24 to 32 
teams, as the executive committee unanimously approved for the 1998 tournament, 
has long been a pet project of Havelange. And Havelange usually gets what he 
wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, the expanded tournament has the same obvious appeal as lowering 
taxes. Havelange brilliantly appeased both the developing areas of soccer -- 
Africa and Asia -- and the powerhouse continent of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange wanted the expansion in Africa and Asia to reflect the sport's 
growth in the developing world, where, coincidently, the voting members see the 
Brazilian as their champion. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Havelange got European officials to approve the change after 
promising Europe's allocation would not be cut. Having gained that "concession" 
from Havelange, the Union of European Football Assns. withdrew its challenge to 
his reelection next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Africa already had gained a third spot in the finals, after the success of 
Cameroon in the 1990 World Cup. Asia is due at least another place with the 
candidacy of both Japan and South Korea as host of the 2002 World Cup. It is 
expected that four of the additional eight teams will come from Africa and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Europe can hardly complain. Thirteen of the 24 teams in next month's World Cup 
are European and, according to one newspaper, The European, Europe will have a 
shot at the four other new spots through a playoff, with fourth and fifth-place 
teams from the other zone qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials' allocation of the new berths is expected in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, the idea is a flat-out boon. Ratings in North America 
notwithstanding, television adores the World Cup and more games involving more 
countries make television very, very happy. And, as Havelange knows, rights 
fees can now be raised to reflect the larger tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 All very tidy, except for the French, who now have a much larger tournament to 
organize for '98. FIFA is quick to point out that even with eight groups of 
four teams, the World Cup will not be any longer and each team will play the 
same number of first-round games. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but the costs associated with eight additional teams will not be small 
for an already financially unwieldy creature. The organizers of this summer's 
World Cup had to cut the stadiums from 12 to nine to keeps costs in line. How 
will the French cope? 
</P>

 U.S. goalkeeper Brad Friedel has signed a contract with Newcastle United, 
which finished third in the English Premier League this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He will become the third American keeper working in England and no doubt will 
be held to the high standards of the two others. Kasey Keller at Millwall, who 
was recently cut from the World Cup roster, had 17 shutouts and allowed 51 
goals in 45 games. Juergen Sommer at Luton Town, who was named to the World Cup 
team, had eight shutouts and allowed 50 goals in 47 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedel's prodigious work habits may impress Newcastle's coaches more than the 
U.S. team staff. Friedel has been nothing but professional and focused during 
the months of speculation about which keeper -- he or Tony Meola -- will start 
in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola's reputation is one of slacking off in practice but coming on strong in 
big games. Friedel is always working hard, but seems to have bad luck in games. 
Goalkeepers can accept their own mistakes that lead to goals easier than the 
mistakes of others. Saturday's game against Bayern Munich was another example 
of defensive breakdowns leaving Friedel exposed to one-on-one plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he starts a game in the World Cup Friedel, at 23, can still have a 
long professional career. And it is going to pay an immediate dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he was not with another pro club and had not signed a contract with 
the U.S. Soccer Federation, he will get to keep all of his transfer fee, a 
reported $525,000, instead of giving 90% to the USSF. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some snickered at the news that German Coach Berti Vogts opened his team's 
training camp with his roster of 22 players, his coaching staff and doctors and 
. . . a World Cup referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't pass the idea off as "German fastidiousness." Hellmut Krug, a World Cup 
referee from Germany, will work the team's scrimmages and, "explain the latest 
FIFA guidelines," Vogts said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is just the sort of preparation that pays dividends. As in most sports, 
there are standards of play during the regular season and then there's what's 
allowed in a World Cup game. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Germany's experienced international players will benefit from training 
under World Cup conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefiting even more would be the U.S. World Cup team. The defensive players, 
in particular, have a habit of sloppy tackling and losing body control in the 
air. Tackling from behind will not be tolerated and FIFA promises such fouls 
will be met with a yellow card. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team can ill afford to compound its problems with the loss of a 
player to yellow cards or expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 And, even with all their accumulated international experience, the U.S. 
players haven't seen the level of acting from opposing players they will be 
subject to in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other notes to come out of the FIFA executive committee's meetings: Officials 
in Washington, D.C. have halted their fence-building at RFK Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are continuing at Dallas regarding the construction of fences 
around the playing field and at Palo Alto, where a low fence already exists. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. County sheriff's call for a tactical alert -- to begin with the June 
4 U.S.-Mexico game and run through the World Cup -- may be standard at big 
events, but it's also clearly timed to offset the L.A. police union's rejection 
of a new contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has been using the World Cup as a bargaining chip in its talks with 
the city and even launched a short-lived advertising campaign pointing out the 
dangers of living in or visiting Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last word: The response of U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, now coaching his third 
different World Cup team, to the expansion of the number of World Cup teams: 
"It's good. It means you have more places now to find a job."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; DREIFORT'S FILL-IN ROLE DRAWS PRAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the return of Todd Worrell on Monday, Manager Tom Lasorda gave high marks 
for the job Darren Dreifort did as the fill-in closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year when he signed with the Dodgers, if someone would have told him he 
would be the closer with the Dodgers this season, he would have said, 'No way!' 
" Lasorda said."Last year he was a junior at Wichita State University, he 
should be finishing his senior year right now, but he's the closer for a team 
in first place. It was like throwing him into a lion's den, and he deserves a 
great deal of credit to have the self-confidence and poise and determination to 
be put in that position and do the job. He's going to be one of the top 
relievers in baseball someday." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 17 days Worrell was sidelined, Dreifort had an 0-2 record with 
three saves in seven games, one blown save and a 9.45 earned-run average. He 
gave up seven earned runs in 6.2 innings. Overall, he has a 4.68 ERA in 20 
appearances and 25 innings. He will return to a setup role. Omar Daal was sent 
to Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few notable numbers: Before Monday's game, the Dodger outfield was batting a 
collective .435 over the last 10 games, with Brett Butler batting .419, Raul 
Mondesi .450 and Henry Rodriguez .438. . . . The team leads the league in 
batting average, at-bats, runs, hits, total bases, triples, sacrifice hits, 
slugging percentage and on-base percentage. . . . Seven of Mike Piazza's nine 
home runs have tied the score or given the Dodgers a lead. MARYANN HUDSON

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BREWERS' LOSS TIES A RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brewers stopped Rafael Palmeiro's hitting streak at 24 games Monday night 
at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee dropped a 5-3 decision to the Baltimore Orioles, extending the 
Brewers' losing streak to a club record-tying 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least something good happened," losing pitcher Ricky Bones mused about 
stopping Palmeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Bones (3-4), who entered the game with an AL-best 1.89 earned-run average, is 
winless in his last five starts. He gave up five earned runs and nine hits, 
including home runs by Jack Voigt and Mark McLemore, in 7 1/3 innings Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brewers, who were in first place when they last won on May 11, matched the 
club record set from May 3-19, 1987, with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a good joke," Milwaukee Manager Phil Garner said. "It's tough right 
now. You've got to keep patting them on the back, telling them good things will 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6, Cleveland 5 -- Joe Carter, the majors' RBI leader with 54, singled 
home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning at Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out, Devon White doubled off Jose Mesa (3-2). After Domingo Cedeno 
struck out and Paul Molitor was walked intentionally, Carter's line drive to 
right drove in White. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Hall (1-1) pitched a perfect ninth inning for his first major-league 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 7, Seattle 5 -- Brent Gates' four hits overcame Ken Griffey Jr.'s 21st 
homer as the Athletics broke a six-game losing streak by winning at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffey set a major-league mark for the most home runs in the first two months 
of the season with a bases-empty shot off Bobby Witt (4-4) in the seventh 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle hit 20 in the first two months of the 1956 season.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; CARDINALS PUT CORMIER ON DISABLED 
LIST 
</P>

<P>
 St. Louis Cardinal left-hander Rheal Cormier, who has a back injury, was 
placed on the 15-day disabled list for the second time this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier warmed up but did not throw a pitch in his last scheduled start at 
Florida on Friday night after suffering torn muscles in his back. He was placed 
on the disabled list retroactive to May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Joe Torre said team doctors have prescribed several days of rest 
followed by a rehabilitation stint for Cormier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cormier, who is 2-1 with a 5.74 ERA in five starts, also was on the disabled 
list from April 28 to May 12 because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals activated right-hander Rick Sutcliffe, who had been sidelined 
because of a hamstring injury, from the 15-day disabled list. Sutcliffe, 1-1 
with an 8.31 ERA, will start Wednesday night against Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro officials denied a Houston Post report that they were trying to 
trade reliever Mitch Williams. They said their main goal was helping the 
struggling left-hander regain his effectiveness. He is 1-4 with five saves and 
an 8.00 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always a possibility," the paper quoted Astro General Manager Bob Watson 
as saying of a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk to clubs every day. That's one of our basic operating procedures, to 
check with other clubs and see what interest there might be for someone in our 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams gave up a two-run homer to San Diego's Phil Plantier in the eighth 
inning Sunday, giving the Padres a 7-6 victory. Watson and Manager Terry 
Collins met after the game, but Watson said it did not concern Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say we are disappointed that he didn't do his job," Watson said. 
"Those things happen. I didn't even talk to Terry about that." 
</P>

 Scott Erickson, who pitched the American League's only no-hitter this season, 
has been placed on the 15-day disabled list by the Minnesota Twins because of a 
strained muscle on his right side.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: SOFTBALL HUMILIATIONS DEMAND RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winning a softball playoff game, 48-0, may be one for the record books, but it 
accomplishes little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Templeton Coach Valerie Reynolds said she was embarrassed by her team's 
lopsided victory over Ly Lycee of Los Angeles last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of a score isn't good for the winning or losing team," Reynolds 
said. "Our kids weren't getting a kick out of it, and I'm sure theirs weren't 
either." 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round Southern Section Division VI game started badly and got worse. 
Host Templeton, 20 miles north of San Luis Obispo, had a 16-0 lead when it 
scored 12 runs in the fifth inning. Reynolds said she played her entire team 
and could have avoided the rout only if she had instructed everyone to strike 
out on purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the section's leagues use the "mercy rule" during the regular season, 
which calls for a game to end after five innings if one team is ahead by 10 or 
more runs. The rule is not used during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Templeton's one-sided victory was not the only one in the first round of the 
softball playoffs. Cerritos Valley Christian defeated La Verne Lutheran, 35-0; 
Lakewood beat Hawthorne, 20-0, and Lancaster Paraclete defeated Los Angeles 
Baptist, 19-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Such scores indicate a need for discussion of the mercy rule being used during 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never brought the issue up before because we've never seen scores like 
this," said Karen Hellyer, Southern Section administrator in charge of 
softball. "I know many of the teams who suffered big losses last week are 
scheduled to change divisions next season, but we'll certainly discuss the 
mercy rule at our wrap-up meeting next month." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Andre DeSaussure of Woodland Hills Taft made a big splash last track season by 
winning the 100, 200 and 400 meters at the City Section finals. He went on to 
finish second in the 400 at the State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Washington-bound senior has cut back on track this season and said he 
might skip next month's state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track is just not what I'm thinking about right now," said DeSaussure, who 
hopes to play wide receiver in college. "Football is the No. 1 sport with me. 
Track is second." 
</P>
<P>
 DeSaussure will not defend his 100 and 200 titles at the City finals Thursday 
at Van Nuys Birmingham High. He will run the 400 after posting the best time in 
last week's preliminaries in 48.52 seconds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Startled by a record number of incidents in recent months, Southern Section 
officials took the initial step toward improving sportsmanship Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The section held the first of many meetings with a newly formed task force 
made up of administrators, coaches, athletes and media representatives. Its 
objective is a guide for improving sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behavior is getting out of hand at high school sporting events these days," 
said Donn Clickard, athletic director at Atascadero. "It's time we stopped 
talking about the problem and put our money where our mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will meet again in the fall and hopes to have tough new policies 
in place in the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The City Section football playoffs will undergo a major format change next 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of designating the section's six conferences as either Division 4-A or 
3-A, divisional placement will not be done until after the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference champions will get automatic berths into the more prestigious 4-A 
playoffs, and a committee of coaches will pick the remaining 10 best teams to 
fill out the bracket. The committee will then select the 16 teams for the 3-A 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only difficulty I can see is who's No. 16 in the 4-A and who's No. 1 in 
the 3-A," said City Commissioner Barbara Fiege. "You're either thrown to the 
wolves or you're the big cheese." 
</P>
<P>
 Prep Notes 
</P>
<P>
 A scheduling conflict has prompted the City Section to change the date of its 
baseball championship doubleheader at Dodger Stadium. The Division 4-A and 3-A 
title games have been moved from June 9 to June 6, a Monday. "A Monday is not 
the best night to showcase our games," said City Commissioner Barbara Fiege. 
"But the coaches did not want to leave Dodger Stadium, so that was our only 
alternative." . . . City Section coaches will once again be allowed to have 
contact with their athletes in the off-season. In a rule reversal, coaches and 
players can compete together during a three-week period. The time frame will 
vary by sport. This will allow football teams to participate in spring passing 
drills. Times' Top 20 Baseball Poll

 Top-ranked USC moved into the final of the NCAA Division I men's tennis 
championship by beating Mississippi State, 4-0, in the semifinals at South 
Bend, Ind., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will play second-ranked Stanford, which defeated UCLA, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Coach Andy Jackson of Mississippi State (21-7) and Dick Leach of USC 
(21-3) agreed the Trojans' winning doubles point was the key. 
</P>
<P>
 In what turned out to be see-saw match, Mississippi State's Laurent Orsini and 
Remi Barbarin pushed the Trojans' Lukas Horvorka and Adam Peterson to a 
tiebreaker before losing, 9-8. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a turning point, it was in the doubles," Leach said. "We have won 
20 of 22 doubles points this year . . . we expect to win that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jackson: "I honestly felt the doubles point was very important to us, 
especially if you're going to upset a team." 
</P>
<P>
 USC won or was leading in all six singles matches. "I give credit to USC," 
Jackson said. "They ran us out of the match in the singles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the No. 1 singles, top-seeded Wayne Black of USC beat the second-seeded 
Orsini, 6-2, in the first set. Orsini was ahead, 5-4, in the second set when 
the match was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Black has won nine matches in a row and is 26-4 this season.

 Fourth-seeded Seth Denawetz of Kalamazoo College rallied to beat fifth-seeded

GOLF / SOUTHERN SECTION INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIP; PAR FOR THE COURSE: WOODS WINS 
AGAIN WITH A 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some might believe Tiger Woods is now too big for high school golf, what with 
his unprecedented three U.S. Junior Championships and his PGA Tour experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods, a senior from Anaheim Western High, saved his best prep round for 
last, shooting a five-under 66 to win the Southern Section individual 
championship at La Cumbre Golf and Country Club on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods broke the section final record of 67, which was shared by three, the 
most recent being Larry Springer of Rolling Hills in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive section title for Woods and the third overall. 
Only two others -- Long Beach Wilson's Boots Porterfield (1942-44) and Santa 
Monica's Mac Hunter (1945-1947) -- have won as many. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, had never seen the La Cumbre course, but said he figured it would 
take a low score to win because it is only 6,352 yards long. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I just went out and attacked the course," said Woods, who will attend 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the 10th tee, Woods made birdies on four of his first six holes 
and missed birdie putts on the others. 
</P>
<P>
 After making the turn at five-under 30, he made a five-footer for birdie on 
his 10th hole and seemed to be threatening the course record of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a double-bogey 7 on the sixth hole, Woods finished four strokes 
ahead of Fullerton Sunny Hills' Terry Noe, Anthony Marciano of Simi Valley 
Royal and Michael Chavez of Santa Barbara San Marcos. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 22 players, excluding Woods and those who already qualified with their 
team, advanced to the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. Championships June 6 
at Redlands Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods will be in Rye, N.Y., preparing for the PGA's Buick Open.

L.A. UNIVERSITY BEAT / WENDY WITHERSPOON: TWIN TRIUMPHS FOR USC SPRINTER MILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The time is now for USC's Inger Miller. Finally. 
</P>
<P>
 After three injury-marred track seasons, Miller won the 100 meters in 11.45 
seconds and the 200 in 23.27 at the Pacific 10 Conference meet Saturday at 
Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just really happy. More so than happy about the win, I was just happy I 
was able to make it through (the race)," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations were high for Miller when she arrived at USC. In her senior year 
at Pasadena Muir High, Miller had the best girls' prep times in the nation in 
the 100 and 200 meters, 11.48 and 23.57. 
</P>
<P>
 But until now, Miller has been unable to live up to her potential. She had a 
stress fracture in her foot her freshman year. A hamstring problem bothered her 
as a sophomore, she pulled it again last year in the NCAA semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Miller sprained her ankle while running the 200 at the Mt. San 
Antonio College meet in April. The Pac-10 meet was only her second since the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has done a lot of conditioning and a lot of stretching, but no really 
hard running," said Barbara Edmonson, USC coach. "So this was a test, and she 
got an A." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is the daughter of Lennox Miller, a former Trojan star and Olympic 
silver medalist in the 100 meters for Jamaica. 
</P>
<P>
 She has a good chance to do well in the sprints at the NCAA meet at Boise, 
Ida., June 1-4, provided she can stay injury-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, you want to knock on wood," Edmonson said. "You really don't 
want to say anything until it's over." 
</P>

 The NCAA women's tennis committee apparently thought so little of 12th-ranked 
Keri Phebus of UCLA that it didn't even seed her for the NCAA women's singles 
tournament at Athens, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't really given a satisfactory answer why she wasn't seeded," said UCLA 
Coach Bill Zaima. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phebus ignored the slight and advanced to the final last Saturday, where 
she lost to third-ranked Angela Lettiere of Georgia, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus was only the second, unseeded player to advance to an NCAA women's 
singles final. The first was Clemson's Gigi Fernandez in 1983. Phebus also is 
the first woman from UCLA to advance that far. 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus, a 6-foot-1 sophomore from Newport Beach, was named the Intercollegiate 
Tennis Assn. player to watch last season.

 The UCLA women's softball team, which has won four NCAA championships in the 
last six years, was on the brink of elimination in the NCAA Region 4 tournament 
at Columbia, S.C., this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 2-1 record in the double-elimination tournament, UCLA played Nevada Las 
Vegas, unbeaten in the tournament, Sunday in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Howard, a sophomore all-American at second base, hit her first two home 
runs of the season to give UCLA a 2-1 victory and force a second game. UCLA won 
that one, too, 3-2, and advanced to the NCAA College Softball World Series at 
Oklahoma City, Okla., beginning Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference track title won Saturday by the UCLA men's team was 
the sixth in the last eight years for the Bruins. They won consecutive Pac-10 
titles from 1987-89, missed in '90 and '91, and now have won three straight 
again. Said UCLA Coach Bob Larsen, "I think it is always a special feeling to 
get that third (title) because it is not always the same people (on the team), 
so it is a challenge to keep it at a real high level, competitively." Added 
Larsen, "The weather on the first day was just brutal. It was cold, rainy and 
windy. Just miserable. Everybody in the Pacific Northwest was rubbing their 
hands, thinking that they would have better chances in that kind of weather, 
but our guys really responded well." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Park shot a four-over-par 223, good for a tie for 19th place, in leading 
the UCLA women's golf team to a fifth-place finish at the NCAA West Regional 
tournament, May 12-14, at Albuquerque, N.M. That put UCLA into the NCAA 
tournament, which begins Wednesday at Eugene, Ore. The Bruins couldn't have 
asked for a better place to play the NCAA tournament, It will be held at the 
University Golf Course, home of the Oregon Invitational. UCLA won that 
invitational last year and finished second this year. . . . Renee Baumgartner, 
in her first year as USC women's golf coach, led the Trojans to a sixth-place 
finish at the West Regional and they, too, will be playing in the NCAA 
tournament. Baumgartner, 28, played at USC from 1984-87 and spent the last six 
seasons as Oregon's coach. Jill McGill, a senior from Denver, shot a 219 for 
the Trojans, good for 11th place individually. McGill won the U.S. women's 
amateur tournament last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Andrews of the Pepperdine men's golf team tied for fourth place with a 
four-under-par 212 at the NCAA West Regional tournament at Tucson, Ariz., last 
week, to qualify for the NCAA tournament at Stonebridge Country Club at Dallas 
June 1-4. . . . The singles and doubles divisions of the NCAA men's tennis 
tournament begin Wednesday at Notre Dame. Singles entrants include top-ranked 
Wayne Black and 18th-ranked Jon Leach of USC; third-ranked Robert Janecek of 
UCLA, and 13th-ranked Charles Auffrey and 47th-ranked Ari Nathan of Pepperdine. 
Doubles teams include second-ranked Sebastien LeBlanc and Eric Lin of UCLA, 
11th-ranked Black and Leach, 29th-ranked Lukas Hovorka and Adam Peterson of 
USC, and 17th-ranked Nathan and Cary Lothringer and 27th-ranked Simon Aspelin 
and Troy Budgen of Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 If a pattern of the last three years runs true to form, UCLA should win the 
NCAA College Softball World Series. in the last three years, the second-place 
finisher in the Pac-10 has won the NCAA title. This season, top-ranked Arizona 
(60-3, 23-1 in conference play) won the Pac-10. Fifth-ranked UCLA (41-12 and 
16-6) finished second.

 Today's pairings (at UCLA): Division 4-A -- Woodland Hills El Camino vs. San 
Pedro, 5 p.m.: Division 3-A -- Tujunga Verdugo Hills vs.Sepulveda Monroe, 3 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's champions: Division 4-A -- San Pedro; 3-A -- Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Top-seeded San Pedro (20-4) is playing for a third consecutive 4-A 
title, having defeated Wilmington Banning in the title game last year, 7-0. San 
Pedro is led by pitcher Petrina Martinez, who threw a three-hit, 2-0 shutout 
against Chatsworth in the semifinals last week. Martinez and shortstop Victoria 
Brucker were the 1993 4-A co-players of the year. El Camino Real (19-4) also 
has strong pitching. Jennifer Gould recorded 12 strikeouts and allowed only 
four hits in a 7-0 semifinal victory over Sylmar. In 3-A, Verdugo Hills (18-3) 
didn't lose much after last year's starter, Rachel Maldonado, left the team 
early in the season. Verdugo Hills' new starting pitcher, Schannon Schoonover, 
is 15-0 since replacing Maldonado. First baseman Maryanne May is Verdugo Hills' 
most productive offensive player. She led the Northern League in home runs with 
nine. Monroe (16-2) committed six errors in its semifinal game against 
Westchester but still won, 12-2, after receiving multiple hits from five 
players. GREG SANDOVAL

AGASSI ADVANCES; BECKER FORCED TO WITHDRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Agassi missed three easy overhead smashes in the first set Monday, then 
made the shots he needed to start the French Open with a 6-2, 7-5, 6-1 victory 
over three-time winner Mats Wilander on center court. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, ranked 19th, advanced to the second round against clay-court 
specialist Thomas Muster of Austria. No. 11 Muster defeated Andrei Cherkasov of 
Russia, 6-0, 7-5, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The only casualty in the men's draw was No. 10 Boris Becker, who withdrew 
because of a pulled back muscle minutes before he was scheduled to play 
Jonathan Stark, the former Stanford All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, the three-time Wimbledon champion, reached the final of the Italian 
Open in Rome last week, but was in too much pain to play at Roland Garros 
Stadium here, said his coach, Nick Bollettieri. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Becker, who has never won the French Open title, suffered the injury 
during the semifinals in Rome, although Becker did not mention it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker played an exhibition Sunday against MaliVai Washington and practiced 
early Monday, but decided he was unable to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark took advantage of the withdrawal by defeating Becker's replacement, 
Brent Larkham of Australia, 6-2, 6-3, 6-7 (7-4), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing to the second round with three-set victories were top-ranked Pete 
Sampras, over Alberto Costa of Spain, and No. 4 Andrei Medvedev of Russia, over 
Wally Masur of Australia. In an all-Southern California matchup, Jeff Tarango 
of Manhattan Beach defeated Chuck Adams of Pacific Palisades, 6-4, 6-2, 3-6, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi, who is returning from wrist surgery, is a two-time French Open 
finalist. He last played Wilander in the 1988 French Open, when the Swede won 
his last championship here. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not like a first-round match," Agassi said. "I really felt a sense 
of nerves, sense of pressure, excitement." 
</P>
<P>
 It showed in the first set when he hit three lazy overhead shots long. But 
Agassi was patient enough to overpower Wilander. He held off five set points in 
the second set to take control. ELLIOTT ALMOND

INDIANAPOLIS 500 DAILY REPORT; GOODYEAR'S A NON-QUALIFIED SUCCESS AGAIN AS DAVY 
JONES GOES TO LOCKER 
</P>

<P>
 For the second time in two years, a qualified driver has been bumped from 
Sunday's Indy 500 to make room for non-qualified Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Davy Jones, who had put one of car owner Kenny Bernstein's Lola-Ford Cosworths 
in the field with a 223.817-m.p.h. run last Saturday, was withdrawn in favor of 
Goodyear, Bernstein's team driver. "No matter how you cut it, we're forced to 
make a very tough and complicated decision" Bernstein said. "We have two 
excellent drivers, but just one car in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear was the last driver bumped Sunday when his 220.737 qualifying speed 
was bettered by rookie Marco Greco. Because of the driver change, Goodyear will 
start 33rd. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Goodyear replaced Mike Groff as the driver of Derrick Walker's 
car under similar circumstances. He started 33rd and finished second behind Al 
Unser Jr. in the closest 500 in history. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rahal-Hogan cars of Bobby Rahal and Groff will return to Indianapolis 
Motor Speedway today with a new look. 
</P>
<P>
 Both cars, leased from Roger Penske, were red and white when Rahal and Groff 
qualified them last Saturday. They were taken from the track Sunday to be 
repainted in their new colors. 
</P>
<P>
 Five painters worked around the clock to convert Rahal's car to his black and 
yellow colors and Groff's to white, blue and red. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost $4,000 a car to repaint them and put on new decals in time for a photo 
session on Thursday. 
</P>

 Tom Sneva, the 1983 Indy winner, was wandering through Gasoline Alley when 
someone asked him if he planned a retirement announcement along the lines of 
Johnny Rutherford, who drove A.J. Foyt's car for a ceremonial lap. "If I did, 
it wouldn't be in A.J.'s car," said Sneva, a bit of a maverick. "It would more 
likely be on a Harley roaring through Gasoline Alley." 
</P>

 Leo Mehl, director of racing for the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., said that 
10,000 tires will be used at Indy before the race ends Sunday. The average team 
uses 25 sets. SHAV GLICK

THE FOURTH TRIMESTER; THINK IT TAKES ONLY SIX WEEKS TO BOUNCE BACK FROM 
CHILDBIRTH? WRONG. RESEARCH SHOWS NEW MOMS NEED MONTHS TO RECOVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARI ROAN, TIMES HEALTH WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a nurse, Carol Ann Friedman thought she knew what to expect during her own 
postpartum recovery: 
</P>
<P>
 If she had a Cesarean section, she would need eight weeks to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 If she had a vaginal birth, six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, she figured, her life would be back to normal. She would be rested, 
ready to return to work, adjusted to her baby, with the household running 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Right? 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me much longer than eight weeks," she recalls. "I felt better about 
the eighth month. " 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent her career nurturing others back to health, the irony of the 
situation didn't escape Friedman, a certified lactation consultant in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of women would categorize having a baby as a joyous event, 
full of rewards and moments of sheer delight. But when the tears flow, it's 
often because society's benchmark for when new mothers should be recovered -- 
six weeks to eight weeks -- is unrealistic for many. 
</P>
<P>
 "A joke," says one woman, aptly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous," says another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost brutal," says Friedman. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific studies -- and new mothers themselves -- attest to a much longer 
adjustment period, something akin to a fourth trimester. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study published last year, researchers found that most women need months 
-- maybe as much as a year -- to fully recover from childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 One month after delivery, women still complained of breast problems, fatigue, 
hemorrhoids, poor appetite, constipation, increased sweating, acne, hand 
numbness or tingling, dizziness and hot flashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after delivery, many of these symptoms continue, the study 
reported, while 40% of mothers also reported pain during sexual intercourse, as 
well as respiratory infections and hair loss at three to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at nine months postpartum, many women said they experienced vaginal 
discomfort and constipation. 
</P>
<P>
 And 20% reported problems related to sexual function one year after 
childbirth, says researcher Dwenda K. Gjeringen of the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, as many as 10% of women suffer postpartum depression in the months 
following childbirth, other research has shown. Postpartum depression is a 
severe mood disorder linked to changing hormones in which stress and fatigue 
can play a major role. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without experiencing such a serious postpartum illness, "Recovery from 
childbirth often requires more than the six weeks traditionally allotted," 
Gjeringen says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baby is now 2 months old and signs are everywhere that Mother should be up to 
speed. 
</P>
<P>
 At six or eight weeks, disability payments usually stop -- a not-so-subtle 
hint that a woman should now be ready to return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, according to Gjeringen's study, the postpartum adjustment period is 
especially hard for women who return to the work force -- about half of all new 
mothers -- soon after childbirth. The average working woman takes eight weeks 
off for childbirth, according to 9 to 5, National Assn. of Working Women. 
</P>
<P>
 At six weeks, the last visit with the obstetrician takes place. That is when, 
according to medical textbooks, the uterus has returned to its non-reproductive 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Using that as the benchmark of recovery, physicians pronounce most of their 
patients fit and ready to resume sexual relations. Never mind that the typical 
patient is still 20 pounds overweight, exhausted and sore. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a tacit assumption in many quarters that the mother should have 
her baby on some kind of schedule at six weeks. After all, when are the in-laws 
ever wrong?  
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the postpartum adjustment period differs greatly among women, and 
recovery simply cannot be predicted or planned, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it depends on whether the baby is an easy baby or not," says Sandy 
Hill, the owner of an Orange County parent-care service called After the Stork. 
For example, some babies have health problems, develop colic, are hard to feed, 
sleep fitfully or are ill-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women often say, 'What's wrong with me? I'm not adjusting. Why is this so 
hard?' But it's usually because the baby is a difficult baby," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Physically, too, recovery varies widely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physical recovery is usually much slower than what people expect," says 
psychologist Georgiana G. Rodiger, a mother of five and founder of the Rodiger 
Center in Pasadena. "Childbirth is a much more traumatic -- especially for a 
first birth -- than most people care to describe. And one of the worst parts is 
you don't get sleep. That goes on for months." 
</P>
<P>
 Some new mothers also feel pressure to lose all their added weight a couple 
months after childbirth. If a woman is returning to work at six weeks, she's 
lucky if her regular clothes even fit, Friedman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us have body-image issues at that time," she says. "But it's very 
natural not to have lost the weight at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 Postpartum recovery is clearly on the fast track these days, beginning from 
the moment of birth. 
</P>
<P>
 It is common now for women who have an uncomplicated vaginal birth to be 
discharged in one day and women who undergo C-sections in three days. 
</P>
<P>
 And, under some insurance policies, childbirth is just a pit stop: Women with 
vaginal births go home in eight to 12 hours. "These mothers are still in a 
fog," Friedman says. "I'm trying to tell them how to change a diaper and 
they're saying 'What? ' " 
</P>
<P>
 The early discharge trend can throw the entire postpartum period out of kilter 
by placing too much on a new mother too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Friedman says, breast-feeding rates in the United States declined 
in the 1980s (they have since stabilized), possibly because a new mother may 
have little help during the difficult first few days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critical period in breast-feeding is the first three days, and these 
women are already home," she says. "They need someone to nurture them. That's 
what nurses used to do. But they are not around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in early discharge and a light-speed postpartum recovery sometimes 
seems like a backlash to the days a generation ago when new mothers spent five 
to seven days in the hospital and came home to a supportive extended family and 
a neighborhood full of casserole-bearing, stay-at-home moms. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, the mother was in bed and everyone said, 'Oh, that's 
ridiculous -- this isn't an illness,' " notes Susan, a Los Angeles woman who 
asked that her full name not be used. "Then it became a thing of who can get 
out the door the quickest." 
</P>
<P>
 But those women racing out the door, new baby in tow, may find the world an 
inhospitable place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women who have babies don't get a lot of support from society or their 
families," says Lola Clark Tirre, a herbalist and mother of three who lives in 
San Clemente. "I think women are expected to be back to normal in less than six 
weeks. If they have other children, they are expected to hold down the fort, to 
car pool, to get everyone to their activities. You see a lot of women out with 
newborn babies. You never used to see that. It's shocking." 
</P>
<P>
 New mothers who refuse to get with the program are subject to ridicule, Tirre 
adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's respected if a woman says she is going to stay home and 
bond with her baby for several weeks. People think you are kind of kooky." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many women have the luxury of staying home and cocooning, says Linda 
Juergens, director of the New York-based National Assn. of Mothers' Centers, a 
network of nonprofit discussion groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certain societies have ways of relieving new mothers of duties as she 
recovers and having a mentoring period with other mothers. In our society, we 
have nothing built in to support a new mother. The extended family is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Coinciding with this decline of a support system, she notes, is an increase in 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has gotten to a point where people think the mothers can do everything," 
Juergens says. "They can take care of the newborn. They can physically 
recuperate and can get back to all the things they did before the baby. But no 
one is asking, 'Are you ready for this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Least of all employers, say new mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Family Leave Act provides for four months of maternity leave 
while guaranteeing job security, few employers provide paid maternity leave to 
supplement disability payment. And most women can't afford to stay home without 
a regular paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who runs a parent-care service, recalls one mother, six-weeks 
postpartum, crying when Hill left at the end of her shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it was that I was leaving and she had no more help. And part of it 
was that she had to start thinking about getting back to work," Hill says. "She 
was forced to bring her adjustment to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan recalls bringing her first child home after having a C-section. A 
co-worker called her and mentioned that Susan's boss was wondering when she 
would be returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard that and I started to cry," she says. "I thought, 'I just had 
surgery!' But I guess he felt it was different than another kind of surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the solution to the cultural crisis facing today's new moms may be a 
return to old customs. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, new moms are increasingly joining breast-feeding or parenting 
organizations, says Friedman, the owner of two stores that carry lactation 
equipment and clothing. At her Mothers with Style store in Glendale, women meet 
weekly for support. 
</P>
<P>
 Women are not only helped individually, but a forum is created for them to air 
their concerns, says Juergens, of the National Assn. of Mothers' Centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a national organization, our hope is to raise the consciousness among 
people about these issues," she says. "We want to expand the maternal voice and 
get women to feel entitled to make their needs and wants known." 
</P>
<P>
 Another trend reflecting the needs of new mothers is the surge in for-profit 
postpartum care services -- organizations that dispatch trained workers to do 
light housekeeping, cooking, baby care, grocery shopping and answering the 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 90 such businesses operate nationwide, charging from $15 to $25 per 
hour, according to the National Assn. of Postpartum Care Services. Insurance 
providers rarely cover these services, and only a fraction of women can afford 
it, Juergens says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, she adds: "The recognition that that is valuable and needed is a step 
toward saying that everyone needs it." 
</P>
<P>
 Postpartum experts are also pressing for friendlier workplaces that feature 
flexible working hours and a private, comfortable place to pump breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Old hands at motherhood say the best advice for new parents is to relax their 
own expectations about what their lives should be like after having a baby and 
focus on enjoying the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman says that when she imparts this wisdom, new mothers often burst into 
tears -- of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the best advice to moms is to take it day by day -- to be realistic 
about what you can do, and that you can't be an incredible mother, lose all 
this weight and be perky and happy. What your baby needs the most is your love, 
not your being thin or organized."

FIXATIONS / JIM WASHBURN: A CRANE REACTION; MANUEL SANTOS OF COSTA MESA CLAWS 
HIS WAY TO THE CARTOON-DOLL TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First I went for the creature on top of John Lennon. There was a whirring 
sound as the three heavily chromed prongs of the claw moved over the prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "More. . .more. . .a little more. OK, drop it!" commanded Manuel (Manny) 
Santos, and I pushed the red button that sent the claw spiraling down -- down 
to ensnare the fuzzy alligator and lift it off the ex-Beatle, who was now in 
the open. "OK, now go in for the kill," Santos said. 
</P>
<P>
 I was playing Rainbow Crane, and it wasn't pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 They're just about everywhere, in arcades, bowling alleys and finer 
restaurants, and chances are Santos has played them all. You've seen them, 
these glass bins full of stuffed toys, with a few expensive character dolls 
thrown in as a lure to customers. Maybe you've put a couple of dollars in one 
-- it's 50 cents a try -- and walked away empty-handed, educated in the 
capriciousness of the crane. 
</P>
<P>
 Santos prefers to call the game Rainbow Claw, and that does have a menacing 
comic book charm: "Yes, Rainbow Claw, we obey. Please not to be using death 
grip on us, Rainbow Claw, please." 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Santos talk, the game practically is sentient, with moods and whims. 
"It tries to antagonize you, to tease you. It changes from day to day, like 
it's really sensitive right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Under his tutelage, I had been doing pretty well, snatching a baby Tasmanian 
Devil and the gator with only a few tries. And let me tell you, it's quite a 
feeling of accomplishment when for a mere dollar or two you can get a stuffed 
doll you don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 Once I'd started going for the harder stuff like the Lennon doll, though, I 
quickly lost $9, and that's $9 I'm going to be very hard-pressed justifying on 
an expense voucher. 
</P>
<P>
 At his peak, Santos, a 33-year-old handyman, was spending $25 to $30 a day 
playing. Now, he just directed me, refusing to touch the controls himself. See, 
this is Santos' Rainbow Crane swan song. 
</P>
<P>
 In his small Costa Mesa home, the guest bedroom is filled with his winnings. A 
long glass case displays his character dolls, those that will fit in it. He 
might have 100 of them, each with a retail value from $12 to $40, not to 
mention the plastic lawn bags he has crammed with the cheaper stuffed toys or 
the scores he's given away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get kind of possessed," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 He has all four Beatles, Batman, Robin, Superman, Lucy and Ricky, Waldo, the 
Three Stooges, Gilligan, the Skipper too, Dagwood, Krusty the Clown, the 
Wolfman, the Blues Brothers, Wayne and Garth, Freddy Krueger and dozens of 
others. He has multiples of several of them, such as his six Tin Woodsmen from 
the Wizard of Oz. The easiest snags, he says, are Star Trek, the Next 
Generation dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are like taking candy," he says. "The claw seems to wrap better around 
those bodies." Unlike friends who had been trying for months, Santos even 
snagged the Holy Grail of Rainbow Crane, a Homey the Clown doll for a mere 
$1.50 effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "So where's the challenge?" he asked, beginning to sing "The Thrill is Gone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Fixations readers might recollect this isn't Santos' first visit with 
us. We talked with him in 1992 about his collection of scales. He had amassed a 
bunch of vintage weighing devices: doctor's baby scales, gold scales, lab 
scales and sundry. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, experienced Fixations hand that he is, he had a prepared statement, 
so when we sat in his kitchen, it was with several stapled sheets of paper in 
front of him.  
</P>
<P>
 He prompted, "You're supposed to ask me, 'How long has it been?' " 
</P>
<P>
 How long has it been, Manny? "It's been around two years, and I'm still buying 
scales here and there," he read, continuing onto his recent interest: "Dolls 
for a guy doesn't sound good, but these are not ordinary dolls. These are 
creator cartoon dolls." 
</P>
<P>
 He explained how he'd chanced to meet two local "masters" of Rainbow Crane, 
Richie Schneeweis and his dad, Everett, and how they got him interested in the 
game. He watched them play carefully, he said, and started playing himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Santos read on, delving into the Zen of Rainbow Crane.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to know what is the secret of this game. Two and a half years later 
I found it, and believe me it was expensive. You learn which toys you can get, 
and the different ways to pick up the toys to get them out of this machine. . . 
. You have to be precise in your coordination on getting the claw to the area 
where you are aiming at. Therefore you have to have good judgment, accuracy and 
eye coordination to drop the claw to your destination. My suggestion is to not 
play the claw when impaired by drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get what you need, not what you don't want. . . . You don't just go in there 
and take 'em, take 'em, take 'em. I have met people who just go in there and 
are hogs with no consideration for others. I'm different. I like to share. The 
game actually is for kids, but adults have more money so they play it more." 
</P>
<P>
 He offered further ruminations on the game, how through it "everybody's 
creativity is allowed to blossom in such a positive way" -- It's New Age 
Rainbow Claw! -- and then he got to the farewell speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he was glad to get the dolls and the "chance to see what Rainbow Crane 
is all about," he said, "Now, it's immensely taking over me. It becomes a 
gambling fever. I have won the game in my mind, heart and wisdom. I need to 
stop playing this game, because it is becoming a part of me, and now I need to 
let it go. I need to move on to a new hobby. I am not saying that the game is 
good or bad. I have completed what I wanted to get out of this machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also must remember the kids like to pay the claw too. It is especially 
magical to young children, so when they see a stuffed animal that looks to easy 
to get out and you don't particularly want it, leave it alone. Maybe a 
youngster will get the chance to win and really make their day. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's it," he said, putting down his notes. Maybe it's not quite up to Lou 
Gehrig's tearful retirement, but there it is. He says he's now going to apply 
himself to filling out his Popeye the Sailor collection.  
</P>
<P>
 He said that since backing off from the game a few months ago he's 
occasionally played a dollar or two but doesn't want to risk starting up again. 
Even feeling he's achieved all there is to achieve with a chrome claw, he said, 
"Sometimes I see things I want, but I have to swear it off. Because if I don't 
it'll start all over again, and I don't need another two years of what I had." 
</P>
<P>
 As others have noticed, money is neither so plentiful nor goes so far these 
days, and he can't afford a $30-a-day Rainbow Crane habit. He hasn't kept 
count, but he says that even putting that much into the machines he got more 
out of it, considering the retail cost of the dolls he won.  
</P>
<P>
 Couldn't he apply all the skill he developed playing the game to something 
more profitable, like surgery or deep sea exploration? 
</P>
<P>
 "No way," he said, explaining that working the claw is an imprecise form of 
precision. "When the claw drops, it might have a spin, so you can never be that 
accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Santos was unwilling to play the game, he was more than willing to get 
me hooked on it. At the Ma Barker's restaurant near his home, he introduced me 
to the claw. Sometimes a waitress would come by to watch, and we'd make the 
smallest of small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Lustily working the crane, as Santos offered advice on how to snag Cookie 
Monster by the arm, I asked the waitress, "Hard to believe we're adults, isn't 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-huh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Rainbow Crane, it soon becomes evident that the claw isn't designed 
for the player's benefit. If it was my kind of claw, it would grip the dolls 
like a vise and perhaps even inject them with something. Instead, it is this 
thing that spins and flops around like a squid, only rarely gripping the 
intended toy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santos has his methods: Your best bet is to aim for areas that the claw 
can entirely close around, such as under-arms, he says. Sometimes you can get 
it to grab a head, but the doll will often vibrate free as the claw is 
transporting it to the exit chute. He does find, though, that Mickey Mouse 
heads travel well, so well that he's retrieved about 60 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he's even been able to get two dolls on one try, snaring one and 
knocking another into the chute on the way. The best dolls, such as those from 
the Wizard of Oz series, are another story. They typically are pushed up 
against one of the glass walls.  
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to a Scarecrow in this machine's left rear corner, he suggested, "To 
get it you'd have to clear the area, because anything pressed up against that 
glass won't come out because it's shoved in there, held in by the other dolls. 
So you have to move them out to get him loose. (This is why Santos has lawn 
bags full of unwanted stuffed toys.) Once you've done that, then this claw will 
fall on his head and lean him forward like this, then you grab him from the 
back of the neck." 
</P>
<P>
 Like you would a kitten? 
</P>
<P>
 "Right." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't even try for that, exhausting my dollars on the Lennon doll (a tough 
prospect because he's wrapped in plastic and has a slick backplate) and then 
anything else I thought I might redeem myself on. I left with my alligator and 
purple Tasmanian Devilette, thinking black thoughts about Rainbow Crane.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as we were getting into our cars, Santos was still shouting advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just remember, always go for the smaller part of the doll. John Lennons and 
things wrapped like that, always go for the head. And Mickey. Otherwise, don't 
ever go for the head. Remember, the more the claw can close, the better your 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, hey, maybe I'll call you in two years with my Popeye collection."

TO HEAL THE SPIRIT; RELIGION: THROUGH HIS RELIEF ORGANIZATION, MUFID SOKOLOVICH 
AIDS BOSNIAN MUSLIMS. BUT HE ALSO WORKS TO NOURISH THE SOUL -- BY TALKING ABOUT 
HIS FAITH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On his day off, Mufid Sokolovich rises at 2:30 a.m. to phone his family in 
Zagreb, Croatia. He asks his brother to arrange for a lamb to be slaughtered 
and its meat distributed to the poor. It's every good Muslim's duty during the 
Eid Al-Adha, a feast celebrated this past weekend around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokolovich is a computer consultant based in Costa Mesa. But he moonlights as 
president of the charitable American Bosnia-Herzegovina Assn. "For a good 
Muslim, religion covers every aspect of living," he says. "Humanitarianism is 
just part of it. We do everything in the name of God." 
</P>
<P>
 Now approaching 40, he has considered becoming an imam, a Muslim clergyman, 
which would require several years of formal training. Whether or not he takes 
that step, religion is the center of his life. Along with managing the relief 
program he founded two years ago, he helps organize conferences and gives 
lectures about Islam or the Bosnian war. There is rarely a day he doesn't 
promote his faith. 
</P>
<P>
 Sokolovich would say that this is his obligation, but there is more to it. He 
has made himself a tireless voice for Bosnian Muslims in California. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been a little-known entity, even among other Muslims, largely 
because their European heritage sets them apart. When a local Islamic center 
recently put on a program for members with cultural roots in Pakistan, North 
Africa, Malaysia and the Middle East, some who attended didn't know there were 
Muslims in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Less well-known, perhaps, is that fewer than 20% of Bosnian Muslims practice 
their faith, experts say. Most are born into the culture of Islam but don't 
follow its religious traditions. Under communism, that was discouraged. As a 
high school teacher living in Sarajevo through the 1970s, Sokolovich attended 
the mosque in secret. "If my supervisors knew, I would have been dismissed from 
the school," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, he left the country in 1979 to attend graduate school at the 
University of Southwest Louisiana. He left his parents and his brother, Sekib, 
a medical doctor behind. Sekib later followed Mufid to Southern California and 
set up a practice. But he returned to Bosnia to help his people when the war 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother just married two days ago," Sokolovich says. He, as yet, has not. 
"Maybe I'm too picky," he shrugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he's too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the war began two years ago, he figures that 250 Bosnians have come to 
Southern California. He has sponsored several, arranging for medical care, 
housing, food and clothing. And if he had his way, he would make good Muslims 
of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Saturday, Sokolovich drove to the house his organization rents in 
Cerritos. Six Bosnians are staying there temporarily, as they await surgeries 
and follow-up treatments. Most of the treatments are donated by local doctors. 
One young man lost both legs to sniper bullets, a middle-aged woman was shot 
through the chest and arm, and a 15-month-old has had two open-heart 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, furnished with donations, is immaculate. Still, the women tell 
Sokolovich that they need a vacuum cleaner. The baby's mother serves Turkish 
coffee and asks Sokolovich to arrange for the boy's circumcision, a religious 
ritual practiced by Muslims as well as Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation is in Bosnian; here and there, Sokolovich translates. "Now they 
are asking, 'When is the Eid?' " he says, smiling awkwardly. "They thought it 
was next Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with supplying life's necessities, Sokolovich supplies what he considers 
necessary -- education about the faith. "You have to be very careful," he says. 
"If you are helping people in need and you talk about going to the mosque, they 
might do it for the wrong reason. They might go just to please you, to do what 
they think you want." 
</P>
<P>
 His approach is more subtle. "I like to come to the house when it is close to 
prayer time," he says. For a Muslim, that is five times each day. "I'll say, 
'I'm going to pray now. Why don't you join me?' 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our duty to spread information about our faith," he explains.  
</P>
<P>
 There are some 500,000 Muslims in Southern California and more than 40 
mosques. But finding one that feels familiar is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Sarajevo, every street has its own mosque," says Adina Londrc, a physician 
who was in California on vacation when the war broke out and never went home. 
The first Los Angeles mosque she attended was far from her Altadena home and 
from Good Samaritan Hospital, where she now works. She consulted with 
Sokolovich, whom she knew in Sarajevo. He told her about Mas Jid Omar Ibn Al 
Khattab Mosque, near the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Londrc has seen Bosnians at the mosque whom she never saw praying in Sarajevo. 
"Maybe because of the war," she says, "something is being born in them." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even some Bosnian Americans who haven't practiced the faith in years 
are finding strength in the religious community. "I turned to the mosque 
because I didn't know what to do," says longtime resident Subha Sulejmanagic. 
</P>
<P>
 At her mosque, the Islamic Center of Southern California, half a dozen 
Bosnians sit in on Sunday morning classes for those discovering -- or 
rediscovering -- religion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bosnian Muslims are not very well trained in their faith," says J. Dudley 
Woodberry, associate professor of Islamic studies at Fuller Theological 
Seminary in Pasadena. "Under communism, there was little opportunity for 
religious instruction or practice."  
</P>
<P>
 Some talk about building their own mosque here, as Bosnians did in Chicago. 
About 500 people have recently relocated to that area, which has a large and 
long-established Bosnian community with two mosques. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing to persuade the refugees is (that) it's normal to practice 
their faith in the U.S.A.," says Senad Agic, imam for the Islamic Cultural 
Center of Greater Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Agic and others see a growing sense of unity among Muslims. At a rally last 
spring in Washington, D.C., Muslims from around the world, an estimated 50,000, 
marched in support of Bosnians. Omar Suleimanagich, a Los Angeles dentist with 
Bosnian roots who helped organized the rally, estimates that 50,000 took part.  
</P>
<P>
 Every Muslim country has a Bosnia relief program in place, says Dr. Nezib 
Sacirbey, Bosnia's ambassador-at-large to the United Nations. Local mosques 
advertise relief efforts, and Sokolovich receives calls from Muslims of varied 
backgrounds, offering money, clothing, even cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all touched by the tragedy in Bosnia," he says. "They call and ask 
me what they can do. It is understood -- we may not all be Bosnians, but we are 
all Muslims."

FIRST PERSON: BODY WATCH; WHY THE Y? THINK AGE, LATITUDE; FORGET THE RICE CAKES 
AND SWANKY OUTFITS. AROUND HERE, REAL MEN CAN BE THEMSELVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 To be appropriately hip and upwardly mobile in the '90s, you need to pay 
particular attention to three status symbols: 
</P>
<P>
 Your significant other. 
</P>
<P>
 Your car. 
</P>
<P>
 And your gym. 
</P>
<P>
 I know this because all three have been "Seinfeld" episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 I've worked hard to stay chic: I'm happily married. I drive a Miata. And I 
spend my mornings at the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not one of those places patronized by people who talk about which 
"Melrose Place" cast member they are most often compared to. I'm just not that 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
 My workout spot of choice is a perennially unfashionable neighborhood YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to pretend that I go for altruistic reasons, since the Y is known for 
its charity work. Or that I go because it's significantly cheaper than 
trendier, better-known gyms. Unfortunately, the real reasons have to do with 
the three As: age, attitude and appearance. You're Not Getting Older  
</P>
<P>
 There's something to be said for a place where I can be in my mid-30s and 
still be one of the youngest people in the Nautilus room. By half. During my 
early morning workouts, the average age of my fellow athletes hovers somewhere 
between grandparent and George Burns. At some fancy health club, guys show off 
their biceps. Here, they swap viewings of quadruple-bypass scars. 
</P>
<P>
 One particular advantage to this age difference is the sneak preview. Seeing 
these folks trudge naked around the locker room gives me a pretty good idea of 
how I'm going to look in about 30 years -- which also gives me incentive to 
keep working out for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the best thing about exercising in the only place this side of Palm Beach 
where I'm still called "young man" is the way it appeals to my competitive 
side. As a kid, I was horrible at sports. I tried hard but came in dead last in 
every high school track meet. The towel boy for the chess team seemed to have a 
better 800-meter time. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Y, though, I can finally get the ego boost that comes from being among 
the fastest, the toughest, the strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, after I'd finished doing 10 pullups, I turned around to find a 
fellow Y member twice my age and girth applauding me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well done," he said before heading off to the steam room. (If this had been a 
non-Y, my face would have appeared in the locker room on a Least Wanted poster 
for doing only 10 pullups.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sure it's kind of pathetic, but I was thrilled at the recognition. If I ever 
get my bench press above 200, I'm expecting a "wave" cheer. Attitude, Baby  
</P>
<P>
 The mood of the Y was captured perfectly a few months ago while I was grunting 
my way toward the end of a set of sit-ups. A Y-mate stretching next to me 
groaned: "That's the problem with all this. For exercise to do any good, you 
can never stop." 
</P>
<P>
 This grudging acceptance of working out is the YMCA workout attitude: Exercise 
isn't something you enjoy, it's something you endure. 
</P>
<P>
 And nothing makes a workout go smoother than sweating alongside others who 
will later go out for a big bacon-and-pancake breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 At a slick health club, on the other hand, people seem be having a good time. 
They always look so happy about getting up at 6 a.m. to run a dozen miles and 
aerobicize for hours. It's disgusting -- to say nothing of those rice cakes 
they chow down on afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, that's what these trendy gyms are for. They're like singles bars with 
treadmills and a stricter dress code. They're not there for you, but more for 
everyone else -- to be on display and admired by all. Or to be interrupted on 
the StairMaster by the jerk who asks, "Whatcha reading?" 
</P>
<P>
 From that, an oppressive, competitive attitude is born. 
</P>
<P>
 Since all eyes are upon you, you feel pressured to live up to their standards. 
You work harder to keep up. Which means more time at the gym. Which means more 
feelings of insecurity.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a vicious, stressful cycle, defeating the whole purpose of working out. 
If you wanted to give up your own sense of self-worth just so you could satisfy 
the expectations of everyone around you, you wouldn't have gone to the gym. You 
would have gone into politics. You Look Marvelous  
</P>
<P>
 One of the central theories behind exercising is that it will make you look 
good. The change is a gradual one, with months going by before you see even the 
slightest evaporation of fat. So why is it that everybody looks good to begin 
with at those health clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 It's different at the Y. This is where you go when you look like someone who 
sweats it out to a Siskel and Ebert workout tape. You can go at your own pace 
free of the "American Gladiators" wanna-bes. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the swank sportswear adorning the crowd at the clubs. These 
outfits are so colorful, so tight and so revealing you'd think these exercisers 
double as dancers in a Vegas lounge show. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this contrasts with the deliberately uncool outfits Y denizens wear. 
There's the official gold T-shirt and blue shorts, which look remarkably 
similar to the stuff you wore in junior high. Equally popular is my personal 
choice: the souvenir T-shirt from last year's vacation mismatched with the 
running shorts permanently out of style and on sale at the Sports Chalet. 
</P>
<P>
 Which means working out at the YMCA is kind of like being married. Yeah, 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 It feels comfortable and, because the pressure to dazzle others with your 
appearance is pretty much over, you could probably wander around in slippers 
and boxer shorts all day without attracting attention.

BODY WATCH; MUSIC TO THEIR EARS; ANTIBIOTICS? SURGERY? OR NOTHING? FOR PARENTS 
AND DOCTORS WONDERING HOW TO TREAT CHILDREN'S CHRONIC EAR INFECTIONS, NEW 
GUIDELINES MAY OFFER SOME ANSWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Michael Artinian's ear infections began within weeks of his birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few weeks, says his mother, Chris, the baby would fret and fuss with the 
pain of a new infection. 
</P>
<P>
 His pediatrician tried antibiotics for months. The milder ones did nothing and 
infections even flared up when Michael was taking the strongest antibiotics. 
(Because Michael was born with a cleft lip and palate -- which are being 
corrected with surgery -- he was highly susceptible to infection.) 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when Michael was 8 months old, the doctor suggested a surgical 
procedure called a tympanostomy -- in which ear tubes are inserted to drain 
fluid from the middle ear and clear up infection. The Artinians agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents often wonder if they are doing the right thing by choosing surgery to 
heal chronic ear infections, which generally occur as a result of a cold, sore 
throat or other respiratory infection. Their doubts stem from disagreements in 
the medical community about whether the procedure is overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never easy to put your child through surgery," says Artinian, who lives 
in Glendale with her husband, Robert. "But, as a parent, you have to get hooked 
up with the right doctor -- a doctor you are in sync with." 
</P>
<P>
 But now parents may have more to rely on than just their doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 An article in last month's Journal of the American Medical Assn. suggested a 
set of guidelines for tympanostomy (while noting that as many as one-fourth of 
all ear-tube surgeries now performed may be unnecessary). 
</P>
<P>
 And, this summer, the federal Agency for Health Care Policy and Research will 
release guidelines for doctors and parents on the treatment of childhood middle 
ear infection (otitis media).  
</P>
<P>
 Otitis media is the most common reason for doctor visits in children under 6, 
accounting for about 30 million visits a year. Yet there are no clear-cut 
guidelines to help doctors and parents know which of several treatment options 
-- antibiotics, surgery to insert ear tubes or doing nothing -- work best and 
with the least risk to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we suggest certain disorders for the guidelines is that there is 
substantial variation in care," says Rose Findley, an agency spokeswoman. "One 
doctor treats it one way and across town, there is a completely different type 
of treatment pattern. There isn't much consensus. And, (the nation) is spending 
a lot of money on it, but we don't know what the best or most appropriate 
treatment might be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are highly anticipated, not only because of the magnitude of 
the problem, but because of the contentiousness that has arisen between doctors 
on how to treat otitis media. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts who contributed to the new federal report, joked one doctor, "will 
then enter the government's Witness Protection Program." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of conflicting scientific studies, experts have been loath to 
recommend one right way to treat chronic ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies have suggested that antibiotics work well while others say they 
have failed. Some studies show good results on tympanostomies; others contend 
that the procedure is dramatically overused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a fair amount of data, but I think it's confusing and 
difficult to synthesize," says Dr. Lawrence C. Kleinman, a Harvard physician 
and author of the JAMA report. In that study, a panel of doctors reviewed 
research on tympanostomies to develop criteria on when the surgery should be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 There is enough known, Kleinman says, "that the panel of experts were able to 
definitively say that a fair amount of the surgeries were appropriate or 
inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Using the panel's criteria, the study found that of the 670,000 tympanostomies 
performed each year, 41% were for appropriate reasons, 32% had equivocal 
indications and 27% were found to be inappropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 An appropriate reason to choose surgery, the article states, would be for a 
child who has fluid trapped in the middle ear behind the eardrum (called otitis 
media with effusion) that does not clear up despite treatment with antibiotics. 
The tiny tube inserted in the eardrum during surgery allows the fluid to drain 
and restores a child's hearing, which can be muffled when fluid has collected. 
The tubes remain in the ear for several months to a year and fall out on their 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery is considered inappropriate, for example, if a child had fewer than 
four ear infections a year or had not been treated sufficiently with 
antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Kleinman acknowledges, it is impossible to predict how any child will 
fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always impossible to say, on an individual basis, who will benefit or 
who won't. This is an attempt to say, 'Who would you expect to benefit?' There 
is no question that there is a good deal of individual variation in response to 
various treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 But because the guidelines suggested in the JAMA article are among the first 
on this topic, they should become a helpful tool to doctors and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now parents and physicians can have a discussion that includes in it, 'Well, 
what did the experts think about this for my child?' They are able to make a 
better informed decision. And that, to me, is the key here," Kleinman says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines might also divert surgeries that take place out of frustration, 
he adds. Recurrent ear infections can cause misery for families, causing the 
child a lot of discomfort and parents many sleepless nights. Moreover, doctors 
and parents worry about the small chance that ear infections will cause hearing 
loss and speech delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the level of frustration with ear infections can lead to hasty 
actions that are not well considered," Kleinman says. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines should be especially useful in cases where, according to the 
study, the need for ear tube surgery was equivocal. An example of this kind of 
case is a child with frequent ear infections (more than three in six months or 
four in a year) who also has an infection while taking antibiotics to prevent a 
recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would argue that this is where family preference should most strongly be 
taken into account," Kleinman says. 
</P>
<P>
 No guidelines -- whether they are from the federal government or published in 
JAMA -- should revoke the right of doctors and parents to individualize their 
decisions, says Dr. David Bergman, a Stanford University physician who worked 
on the federal guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line, to me, is that you have to take each case individually and 
not use expert consensus as a way of driving your decision one way or another," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergman says he is concerned that any suggested guidelines might be used by 
insurance companies to deny surgeries that don't fit tightly within the 
criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal guidelines will try to avoid that problem, he says, by concluding 
that "there is a variety of treatment options for this, but no one option is 
overwhelmingly supported by scientific evidence. There are many ways to treat 
it, but there is no way to know whether one is better than the other." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the decision on treatment, parents should explore their feelings on 
having their child take antibiotics for a long period and on surgery -- both of 
which have risks and benefits. Costs should also be considered. A tympanostomy 
costs about $1,200 as an outpatient. 
</P>
<P>
 To help consumers, the federal guidelines will be released in two forms, one 
for health care professionals and one for parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many family preferences here, and families should be involved," 
Bergman says. ECHOING CONCERN

 Middle ear infection (otitis media) usually occur as the result of a cold, 
sore throat or other respiratory infection. Ear infections decline as the tube 
matures and a child's immune system becomes more resistant to germs (both about 
age 6). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 1. Eustachian Tube 
</P>
<P>
 Germs or bacteria travel to the middle ear through the Eustachian Tube, an 
airway that connects the nose and throat area with the middle ear. (Ear 
infections are common in chhildren under 2 because the tube is shorter.) 
</P>
<P>
 2. Middle Ear 
</P>
<P>
 Once the infection reaches the middle ear, fluid often collects in the middle 
ear space and the eardrum becomes inflamed.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; ALL THE FUN OF 'AN AFFAIRE TO REMEMBER'; A DINNER,

 Those little knit dresses that have made the Irvine-based St. John a famous 
name in fashion were everywhere at a gala staged by the Cinderella Guild of 
Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Event co-host Neiman Marcus presented a fashion show that featured models clad 
in the new fall collection from St. John, while many of the more than 300 
guests wore their favorite St. John dresses to the benefit Friday at the 
Newport Beach Marriott. Called "An Affaire to Remember," the $100-per-person 
dinner, fashion show and casino night was expected to net $80,000 for CHOC's 
outpatient clinic in Orange. Seeing Double 
</P>
<P>
 Sparkling St. John gowns and cocktail suits were the preferred attire of the 
women. When two guests, guild president Lynn Voigt and Claire Ringer, surprised 
each other by turning up in identical black St. John gowns, they just laughed 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to hide on the other side of the room," Ringer said. "This is St. 
John. What are you going to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Voigt, "Everyone here has excellent taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests gambled for prizes at a makeshift casino and bid for items at a silent 
auction before adjourning into the hotel ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As a tribute to the movie classic "An Affair to Remember," event organizers 
led by chairwoman Gail River chose a sleek black and white New York-style decor 
for the ballroom. Black and white slipcovers adorned the chairs, while crystal 
vases filled with white flowers decorated each table. Guests were served a 
dinner of filet mignon, chicken stuffed with crab meat and, in honor of the 
Cinderella Guild, a chocolate slipper filled with white chocolate ice cream. 
Fall Preview 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County isn't the only place where St. John can be seen at most dressy 
functions, said Marie Gray, St. John founder and designer, who attended with 
her husband, Bob, the company chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got back from Washington, where I attended a congressional wives 
luncheon. There were a lot of St. Johns," she said. "I think women like them 
because they work for a lot of different occasions." 
</P>
<P>
 She sported -- what else? -- a black St. John suit with a high-neck white 
blouse covered in tiny crystals that didn't make it into the fall collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Models showed off Gray's latest designs, including plenty of black and 
champagne gold gowns, cocktail suits, tunics and vests. 
</P>
<P>
 Staging a fashion show was a first for the 46-member Cinderella Guild of 
Newport Beach. In past years the guild has raised money for CHOC by offering a 
tour of elegant Orange County estates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so much work, and it was difficult to get people to agree to open up 
their homes for tours," Voigt said. "We were looking for a new event, and then 
Neiman Marcus approached us with the idea of a show." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the guests were: Matt Schafnitz, the auctioneer, and his wife, Tina; 
pianist Jim Roberts; Carol Horowitz and Billur Wallerich from Neiman Marcus; 
Dennis and Joni Allison, Michael and Marcia Birney, Robert and Ruth Borders, 
Carola Campbell, Lynn Cancilla, Thomas and Dorothy Doan, James and Bette 
Dobrott, Steven and Lee Drummy, Gerald and Etelka Greer, Scott and Mary Lou 
Hornsby, Earle and Sonia Ike, Elliot and Kim Lazarus, Hans and Doris Linhardt, 
Thomas and Jean Mahoney, Robert and Fran Morgan, Louise Schwennesen, Wanda 
Shelton and Robert and Kay Stockmar. KATHRYN BOLD

FIRST PERSON: BEING BLACK REMAINS AN ISSUE IN ORANGE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE TASSY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The strangest things have happened to me since I moved to Orange County from 
Los Angeles in January. 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen clerks and shoppers do double takes as I walked down the aisle of a 
Costa Mesa grocery store. I've been tailed by a police car -- lights off -- as 
I walked at night outside my Newport Beach apartment. And in stores throughout 
the county, in my gym and at movie theaters, I've been stared at when I wanted 
no attention or service, and ignored when I did. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not a criminal or a freak show. I am a black woman living in a county 
where 2% of the population is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I moved here, I heard stories from my brother, who spent a summer in 
Irvine, and from friends of several races about some white Orange Countians 
reacting to black people with looks, body language, comments and actions they 
felt were racist. I heard about other black reporters who felt unwelcome or 
uncomfortable here and moved away because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I learned I would be living in Newport Beach for five months as a 
reporter trainee for The Times, I hoped what I'd heard was untrue. Yes, I've 
been in the minority most of my life, but in places like New York City, 
Washington, D.C., and Northeastern suburbs with a higher percentage of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 What I found was troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 I have had no problems with most of the people I've met and worked with in 
Orange County. Nevertheless, this was the first time my brown skin and braided 
hair have elicited reactions that made me feel so alien.  
</P>
<P>
 About six weeks ago, a neighbor who joined me in my apartment's sauna began a 
conversation by saying, "I'm glad I'm not black." I moved to an adjoining 
sauna; a security guard apologized for my having to listen to him.  
</P>
<P>
 A few months earlier, I was covering an event in an Orange County public 
school when a cafeteria worker -- without introducing herself -- came within 
half an inch of my face, asked if she could touch my hair and immediately 
reached to fondle my braids. I told her "no," taking giant steps backward. But 
she pursued me until I was almost pinned to a wall, then wanted to know, "Are 
they real?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another time a chiropractor in South County, standing behind me doing an 
adjustment, picked up a braid and marveled, "Ooh, did you do this yourself?" 
When I told her I did not want her to touch my hair, she said, disappointed, 
"Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Because such treatment makes me feel like an object, a mannequin or 
statue, rather than someone with feelings and a need for her personal space to 
be respected. 
</P>
<P>
 It strikes me as rude, just as it would be to ask a stranger with dark roots 
and a bright yellow ponytail, "Is your hair bleached?"  
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the incident when police followed me as I walked from my 
apartment to a nearby store -- I still don't know why. It was about 9 o'clock 
on a Sunday night, and there were no other people walking. There were few cars 
on the street, no accidents, no commotion. As I walked to the convenience 
store, the police car crept passed me with its lights off, drove to a corner, 
turned around and drove slowly by me again. Leaving the store, I saw the same 
police car waiting at a nearby intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 A black male co-worker has had similar experiences: He says Newport Beach 
police have stopped him twice since January to ask what he was doing. And when 
he goes to grocery stores, he hears audible clicks -- the sound of car doors 
locking just before he gets too close.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Do ordinary people, and the police, instinctively suspect that blacks here are 
prone to crime? 
</P>
<P>
 A news story last month is the kind of event that causes me to wonder. City of 
Orange police handcuffed and detained a black couple for more than three hours 
because they mistook them for suspects in a robbery. The suspects had been 
described as two men in a green car, and this couple was a man and a woman in a 
white car who had proof of being elsewhere when the robbery occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the woman, Armenia Guice, 35, says she has had trouble coping. She 
said she quit her job because she cannot bear to drive past the place where she 
was detained. Her boyfriend can't sleep at night, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt just like someone had raped me," said Guice, who has lived in Santa 
Ana just over a year. "I know I didn't do anything, but still I felt 
humiliated. Every time I see a police car, I freak." 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange police official said at the time that the couple "were basically in 
the wrong place at the wrong time. We determined they weren't involved; they 
were released, and our apologies were given. It's just part of the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Although nothing so extreme has happened to me, I know how she feels. While 
any one incident I've experienced could be considered a fluke, the layering of 
incident upon incident horrifies me. There are times now when I'm wary about 
leaving my apartment, simply because I don't know how others are going to react 
to me. I say to myself, "Can I combine two outings in one so that if I 
encounter offensive behavior, at least I will have gotten more than one thing 
done?" 
</P>
<P>
 I shouldn't have to worry like that. I should be able to walk freely, without 
fear that others will shut me out just because I do not look like them. I 
should not be treated like a suspect because I am black, nor as an object 
without human feelings.  
</P>
<P>
 I should be treated the way everyone wants to be treated, with common courtesy 
and respect.

THE WEEK AHEAD: BOGOTA; APATHY AT THE POLLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Colombians vote Sunday for a new president in a close race, marked by apathy, 
that is expected to force a runoff between candidates from the country's two 
main parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal Party candidate Ernesto Samper has a small lead over Conservative 
Andres Pastrana in opinion polls.If none of the 18 candidates receives more 
than 50% of the vote, a second round will be held in three weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Samper and Pastrana have been hurt by their past association with corrupt 
or unpopular politicians. There is little difference in their platforms, with 
both candidates supporting the government's policy of leniency toward cocaine 
traffickers who turn themselves in, a controversial practice that has been 
criticized by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The constitution prohibits President Cesar Gaviria of the Liberal Party from 
succeeding himself.

 After two weeks of post-election euphoria and some much-needed rest, President 
Nelson Mandela and the government of the newly democratic South Africa go to 
work today.  
</P>
<P>
 At 2:15 p.m., after a military salute parades in the streets of Cape Town, 
Mandela will rise before a joint session of the all-race Parliament to deliver 
his first state of the nation speech. He is expected to lay out a legislative 
and policy agenda to transform a nation still saddled with the social and 
financial inequities of racist rule.

 But how much Mandela will be able to achieve as he begins to govern is a 
considerable question. A severe reality check may be the first order of 
business for the Government of National Unity -- the official name for the 
fragile multi-party coalition dominated by Mandela's African National Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Put simply, economic equality will be more difficult to achieve than political 
equality. Three and a half centuries of colonialism and apartheid have left 
probably the most unequal society in the world, and little has changed since 
the votes were counted.  
</P>
<P>
 The 13% white population owns 86% of South Africa's land and more than 90% of 
its wealth. Nearly half of the 30 million blacks are unemployed and illiterate; 
17 million live in abject poverty. Whites earn, on average, 10 times more than 
blacks. Whites own computers and swimming pools. Millions of blacks do not have 
electricity or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 But severe fiscal limits may undermine Mandela's campaign promises to improve 
social programs for the poor. Unless he violates another campaign pledge -- not 
to frighten foreign investors or the business community by increased taxes and 
heavy borrowing -- he will be hard-pressed to meet his commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is Mr. Mandela has promised more than the new government can 
deliver," said Sampie Terreblanche, an economist at the University of 
Stellenbosch near Cape Town. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, for example, repeatedly pledged that his first priority in office 
would be to implement the ANC platform known as the Reconstruction and 
Development Plan.  
</P>
<P>
 Trumpeted at nearly every campaign stop, it promised voters that the ANC will 
build 1 million homes, create 2.5 million jobs through public works programs, 
provide quality schools and supply free health care for children, among other 
pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem was the plan never said how, or how much it would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed, ANC officials estimated the cost at $11.5 billion over five 
years, but insisted that the money could come from savings in the government's 
$36-billion annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, an ANC think tank, the National Institute for Economic Policy, went 
public with their own estimate: The redevelopment plan would cost at least $23 
billion, and there is a prospect of precious few savings in the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the government's first budget will not be presented until June 22, 
Terreblanche said the higher estimate may be optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be easy to get an apartheid dividend," he said. "They will have to 
raise taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets, which reached a similar conclusion, have reacted in near 
panic to the sudden specter of a soak-the-rich administration awash in red ink. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johannesburg Stock Exchange dropped sharply. And the South African rand 
fell to record lows against almost every other currency.  
</P>
<P>
 The Star, an English-language paper here, complained of a credibility gap. 
Since the new government has yet to do anything, the charge may be premature. 
But it suggests that Mandela's honeymoon will have some limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians are notorious for flirting with tough truths, especially at 
election time," the Star said. "But to bandy about discrepancies as huge as 
this is to court disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Another disaster looms in the re-incorporation of the country's 10 former 
all-black homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new constitution, all were formally reabsorbed into South Africa on 
Election Day. It ended a cruel system created under apartheid in which millions 
of blacks were forced from their homes and farms and dumped on land that was 
invariably desolate, dry and distant. 
</P>
<P>
 Six homelands were ostensibly self-governing, but with massive subsidies from 
Pretoria. The other four were nominally independent, but equally dependent on 
the white rulers who had formulated the fiction. The only constant was 
appalling rural poverty for millions of blacks and widespread corruption by 
their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, John Kane-Berman, director of the Johannesburg-based South 
African Institute of Race Relations, argues that the re-incorporation of the 
former homelands, and their 14 million residents, may be as problematic as the 
unification of East and West Germay after the fall of the Berlin Wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our experience will be much the same, or worse, than in Germany," he said. 
"We assume we can reincorporate on the cheap. It's going to cost a bloody 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the government forcibly removed people and dumped then in the homelands, 
they didn't build houses for them or put them in hotels," he added. "They just 
dumped them, and so the housing and other needs are much greater than in say, 
Soweto." 
</P>
<P>
 Although duplicative government infrastructure may be eliminated with the 
consolidation of departments, for example, the savings may as elusive. Take 
education. The ANC has pledged to equalize spending for black and white 
students. About three times more is now spent for each white student than each 
black, according to official government figures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kane-Berman said the real disparity is far greater when children from the 
homelands -- who were not counted by the government -- are included. 
</P>
<P>
 He said about 70% of all black children live in the now-defunct tribal areas, 
and the spending on them is less than half of what is for black students in the 
rest of South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 By his estimate, just to spend the same amounts on rural children in the 
former homelands as is now spent for black education in urban townships such as 
Soweto would add more than $8 billion to the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he said, "to bring those black children up to the level of 
children in Soweto will cost far more than bringing the children in Soweto up 
to the level of spending on whites." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "This is going to be the land mine under the new government's 
spending policy. It talks about the post-apartheid dividend, but there isn't 
one. If apartheid wasn't a net savings to Pretoria, it would have been 
abandoned a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the ANC promised to guarantee the jobs and pensions of at least 
450,000 civil servants in the former homelands. It also vowed to increase their 
salaries to match those given to South Africa's 750,000 civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge played a key role before the election, since it led to strikes by 
civil servants in Bophuthatswana and Ciskei against leaders who had sworn to 
boycott the elections and defy the new government. The unrest ultimately 
brought down the two regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the ANC pledge will cost another fortune, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the Witwatersrand, says 
pay parity for the former homelands would increase the national budget by at 
least 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they concede this issue, they've almost written into the ground any 
significant expenditure for social services," he said of Mandela's government. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to that a commission's proposal to give huge pay hikes to members of 
Parliament and other government leaders, as well as promises to incorporate 
thousands of former guerrillas from the ANC's Spear of the Nation and other 
rebel armies into the nation's defense forces, and payrolls will skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before Nelson Mandela has opened his mouth, we have a government that's 
practically increased by 50% the expenditure on salaries," Lodge said. "That's 
not a good start for a government committed to fiscal austerity, to increased 
social spending and to luring foreign investors." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign governments will listen to hear what Mandela says about foreign 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus is likely to be local: Mandela wants to improve relations with the 
rest of Africa. He is expected to visit Tunis next month to formally join the 
Organization of African Unity, a move with enormous symbolic and emotional 
import for the former pariah state. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, South Africa is expected to rejoin the British-led Commonwealth 
within coming weeks, a link sundered after apartheid was imposed in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits for the former British colony will include greater access and 
involvement to international sporting events, fellowships and cultural links. 
</P>
<P>
 Many diplomats fear Mandela has gotten off to a shaky start, however, by 
appointing Alfred Nzo as his first foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The little-known Nzo was ousted as ANC general secretary in 1991, ostensibly 
for incompetence. Critics say Mandela's appointment of his longtime friend 
smacks more of cronyism than statesmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Pienaar, national director of the independent South African Institute of 
International Affairs, said Nzo's appointment has "caused a great deal of 
bewilderment." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "It was a surprise. We could have thought of many qualified people 
in the incoming government." Racially Divided In South Africa: 
</P>

health services, by race. Some statistics show the task at hand:

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; ALL EARS ON U.N. CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time of tense relations between the United States and the United Nations, 
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali arrives in Washington Thursday to 
deliver the commencement address at Johns Hopkins University's School of 
Advanced International Studies. The visit is unofficial and no calls at the 
White House or State Department are planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boutros-Ghali sometimes irritates the Clinton Administration with speeches 
brimming with complaints about its U.N. policy. He believes that the White 
House has unjustly blamed him and the U.N. for the debacle in Somalia, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials, on the other hand, believe that Boutros-Ghali is trying to 
aggrandize his role on the world stage. His words will be noted by far more 
than the Johns Hopkins graduates.

 Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn, Russia's best known author, is due to end 20 years 
of exile Friday with a flight across the Pacific to the Far Eastern port city 
of Vladivostok, where he will start a cross-country journey to Moscow and a new

</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn flew from his homeland in handcuffs with a KGB escort in 1974 
after his writings angered the Soviet regime.Stripped of his Soviet

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; S. KOREA SEES DOUBLE AS IT LOOKS TO NORTH; A SPLIT NATION IS 
SPLIT ON VIEWS. NORTH KOREANS ARE EITHER BROTHERS WHO WANT A REUNION OR 
SCHEMERS WHO WANT A WAR. 
</P>

<P>
 In the streets of the South Korean capital, under the shadow of the North 
Korean nuclear threat across the border, a substantial distance separates Kim 
Joo Ki and Kim Li Na -- generationally and politically. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Joo Ki, 69, the owner of a furniture firm, is convinced that the South 
needs to develop its own nuclear weapon as a counterthreat to the North, which 
he fears may be ready to blast South Korea away. 
</P>
<P>
 That is nonsense to Kim Li Na, 21, a history major at Ehwa Women's University 
in Seoul. She says the United States and Japan are "picking on North Korea," 
which she believes would never use nuclear weapons against its southern 
brethren. 
</P>
<P>
 These two South Koreans illustrate the sharp dichotomy here in attitudes 
toward the North. It is a tension between an emotional yearning to think the 
best of their fellow Koreans and a hardheaded view that the Communist regime of 
Kim Il Sung is dangerous, unpredictable and responsive to nothing but force. 
</P>
<P>
 These polarized views are evident from the South Korean grass roots to the 
office of President Kim Young Sam and have been blamed for sowing discord and 
disarray in the government's North Korean policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang's abrupt announcement 10 days ago that it had begun removing fuel 
rods from an experimental nuclear reactor in defiance of international demands 
may unify Kim's government around a firmer view. The president earlier this 
month created a special council to coordinate North Korean policy in an effort 
to eliminate disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a country where everyone has an opinion on North Korea, strongly held 
and often passionate, unifying the disparate views may not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government is still cohabited by forces that are mutually suspicious," 
said Lee Dong Bok, a self-proclaimed hawk who was a key architect of South 
Korea's northern policy for the last 20 years before being fired in December. 
"It is causing a bloodletting, and it is weakening the foothold of President 
Kim's government." 
</P>
<P>
 The tension is evident in the very labels used to describe the two sides. 
Those who doubt Pyongyang's motives and advocate a hard line, including 
sanctions and even military action if necessary, call themselves pragmatists 
and professionals. Their opponents call them outdated Cold Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who counsel flexibility and concessions, including generous economic 
aid, regard themselves as liberals. But they are criticized as romantics and 
amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most prominent hawk is Lee. He was fired after revelations that he had 
unilaterally refused to sign an agreement with the North in defiance of orders 
from then-President Roh Tae Woo while serving as South Korean representative 
for high-level South-North talks. Many regard Kim Deok, the director of the 
National Security Planning Agency, as Lee's ideological soul mate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are prepared to graduate from the legacy of the Cold War, but we cannot do 
it unilaterally," Lee said. "As long as one party remains Cold War-oriented . . 
. you have got to lock horns in some manner." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side is Han Wan Sang, former deputy prime minister and minister 
for unification of the two Koreas. He strongly supported a package deal giving 
North Korea economic aid and dropping joint U.S.-Korean war games in exchange 
for Pyongyang's return to compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
But Kim also fired Han in December because of suspicions that he was leaking 
unification board secrets to bolster his softer line. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that we can settle the nuclear issue by isolating, suffocating and 
sanctioning North Korea is a Cold War outdated myth," said one analyst 
sympathetic to the liberal side. "North Korea is facing a crisis of the system 
itself. If they are suffocated, they don't have any option but to attack in a 
joint suicidal-homicidal mission." 
</P>
<P>
 The firings of both Lee and Han removed the government's most glaring 
dichotomy between hawk and dove. But even since then, Kim has continued to 
waver between the two camps, confusing many here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts here were stunned when Kim, in his inaugural speech in February last 
year, proclaimed that "no ideology or political belief has priority over 
national kinship." The implication was that North Korea is more important to 
South Korea than the United States is. Seoul's "spin doctors" quickly moved in 
to explain that the president meant nothing of the sort. 
</P>
<P>
 The next month, Kim released a convicted North Korean spy in a gesture of 
magnanimity to Pyongyang -- and the next day the Communist regime announced 
that it would withdraw from the non-proliferation treaty. Hard-liners here who 
saw the spy's release as a unilateral concession felt vindicated, but Seoul 
implored Washington not to convene the U.N. Security Council to ask for 
economic sanctions against Pyongyang because it bolted from the nuclear-control 
pact. 
</P>
<P>
 By June, however, Kim had taken a tougher line. He declared before Asian 
Pacific bankers that "we will not shake hands with anyone with nuclear 
weapons." When he met in August with Rhee Sang Woo, a Sogang University 
professor and chairman of Kim's 21st-Century advisory committee, he was a 
changed man. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me: 'Do not be deceived by North Korea. They are not people to be 
trusted,' " said the bemused Rhee, who has long advocated a firm line. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after U.S. officials began talking about cutting a package deal with 
Pyongyang in November, Kim continued his hawkish line, throwing out roadblocks 
to a deal in his meeting with President Clinton. Officials here were worried 
that Seoul might be sacrificed in such an agreement, especially if Washington 
allowed Pyongyang to keep a nuclear bomb or two in exchange for pledges not to 
manufacture or sell them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 By December and January, as consensus grew in U.S. intelligence circles that 
North Korea might already have developed one or two crude atomic weapons, Kim 
began saying he did not believe North Korea possessed the bomb. He also said he 
would be willing to meet with North Korean leader Kim Il Sung to settle the 
issue.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, South Korea has generally toed a softer line, despite Pyongyang's 
recent threat to turn Seoul into a "sea of fire." Analysts say Kim may be 
heavily influenced by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, who made it clear when 
they met in March that he opposes sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, South Korea's ambassador to China, Hwang Byung Tai, stunned reporters 
at the time by announcing what seemed like a major policy turnabout: Seoul 
would begin giving China weight equal to that of the United States in 
consultations over strategy on North Korea, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's aides forced Hwang to retract his statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Such incidents, including a similar turnabout on Seoul's position on 
presidential envoy exchanges between North and South, have raised repeated 
charges of confusion and conflict in Kim's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone is complaining, of course. One U.S. official praised Kim's team 
for taking a "very constructive and intellectual approach." This official said 
past Seoul administrations were dominated by "slash-and-burn" conservatives 
bent on destroying the North Korean regime. The official said they sabotaged 
high-level contacts between Pyongyang and Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts insist discord is inevitable. Although hawks and doves always 
existed in the past, the voices of appeasement were often repressed by military 
governments who used the North Korean threat to justify their existence. Kim, 
as the first civilian president, does not need the issue to legitimize his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the policy conflicts are more visible in the more open, 
democratized nation: More officials leak details of meetings, and more 
newspapers report them. More people also play politics with the issue, 
criticizing Kim for being too soft or hard, too close to Washington or overly 
influenced by China, too neglectful of Seoul's political interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who has a flair for reading the public mood, often responds to those 
concerns. The result can be "conducting foreign policy by reading local 
headlines," as one critic told a newspaper here. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the president must tread a delicate line between two top policy 
concerns that in some ways conflict: resolving the nuclear issue and 
strengthening the nation's international competitiveness -- particularly after 
agreement in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks to open up markets 
globally, said Ahn Byung Joon, a Yonsei University professor of political 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we give the impression that the nuclear issue is more important, we run 
the risk of arousing concern about the safety and credibility of Korean 
industry," Ahn said. "President Kim can't just take an aggressive stance. He 
has to please several different constituencies." 
</P>
<P>
 Some hotels, such as the Westin Chosun, report that occupancy rates are down 
compared to last May and say the nuclear threat may be one reason. But in 
general there is no obvious sense of crisis: Letters of credit and tourism are 
up over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market remains as active as shopping districts, where people gaily 
fill coffee shops, restaurants and movie theaters. College student Chung Young 
Rim, 25, said her friends outside South Korea are more worried about the threat 
than she is.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems they know more about North Korea than I do. I'm wondering if the 
government is hiding something from us."  
</P>
<P>
 Rhee, the Sogang professor, says the new coordinating committee should make a 
big difference in unifying policy. The reason, he says, is highly Confucian and 
therefore Korean: Newly appointed Unification Minister Lee Hong Koo went to 
Seoul National University with fellow committee members Han Sung Joo, the 
foreign minister; Kim, the national security chief, and Chung Jong Uk, senior 
presidential secretary for foreign affairs and national security. Lee also went 
to the same high school as Han and Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all his juniors, and he is the boss," Rhee said. "They cannot say no 
to him. He will be able to unify the government." A President on Both Sides of 
the Issue 
</P>
<P>
 There is division in South Korea between the dovish view that North Koreans 
are follow countrymen and the two nations should be reunited, and the hawkish 
view that the Communists are dangerous and unpredictable. South Korean 
President Kim Young Sam appears to waver from one view to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young Sam: 
</P>
<P>
 "No Ideology or political belief has priority over national kinship." 
(February, 1993) 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not be deceived by North Korea. They are not people to be trusted." (June, 
1993, quoted by Prof. Rhee Sang Woo)

PROFILE; ITALIAN TYCOON TACKLES BUSINESS OF RULING; HE OWNS EVERYTHING FROM TV 
STATIONS TO A SOCCER TEAM. BUT CRITICS ASK IF HIS MIDAS TOUCH CAN APPLY TO A

<P>
 Billionaire entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi leaped improbably to power this 
spring as a new political product that disgruntled Italian voters would buy. 
Now the question is whether he can run a government as successfully as he has 
run his businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Berlusconi really clean better? Can he build a fresher, brighter Italy? 
</P>
<P>
 Tune in later. First, the man who has everything must establish credibility as 
a national leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The media mogul turned prime minister is a political rookie on the national 
stage, and so are most members of Italy's new Parliament. Nearly all of the two 
dozen Cabinet officers are making their ministerial debut, and inexperience is 
the common denominator as the 57-year-old Milan tycoon launches the first 
frankly conservative government in Italy since World War II. Berlusconi must: 
</P>
<P>
 * Put forward specific initiatives to address urgent national needs -- from 
unemployment to organized crime, from tax reform to health care. 
</P>
<P>
 * Convince skeptical Italians that he will not abuse power to further his own 
economic interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harness fractious neo-fascists and federalist allies making their debut in 
government in order to convince Italians -- and Western allies -- that they are 
truly committed to democracy and national cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands on Italy's 53rd postwar government are apparent, as are the 
resentment and uncertainties Berlusconi has roused at the head of a new party 
with the catchy name Forza Italia (Go, Italy). 
</P>
<P>
 "This strange coalition of neo- and post-fascists and Forza Italia formed in 
two months directly from a large business (and) governed by one man like a 
business . . . is not reliable as a democratic European government," complained 
leftist Sen. Eduardo Ronchi, who voted against the new regime's narrow 
confirmation by the Italian Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
 A dynamic risk-taker who is one of Europe's richest men, Berlusconi seems 
undaunted by the tasks and unimpressed by critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite common for politicians to go into business. Why is there such a 
negative attitude about a businessman becoming a politician? Everything I have 
done in business has been transparent with respect to the law," he said last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi is a free-market man; economically he would be at home with 
Margaret Thatcher or Ronald Reagan. His two main coalition partners, by 
contrast, are preoccupied less with economics than with the structure of 
government and society: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Northern League, under Sen. Umberto Bossi, seeks a decentralized Italy 
that would devolve into three regional, largely self-governing republics. 
</P>
<P>
 * The National Alliance, headed by Gianfranco Fini, is the direct descendant 
of Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party. Claiming to be "post-fascist," it speaks 
evocatively of law, order and morality. Like the Northern League, the National 
Alliance wants strict controls on immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The thrust of the ruling triumvirate represents a major shift for Italy. The 
first 52 governments after World War II were dominated by the centrist 
Christian Democrats. They preached social consensus and built a major state 
role in the economy, recently diminished by a privatization scheme that 
Berlusconi will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 One price for a closed circle of power that became a partitocrazia -- an 
aristocracy of the ruling parties -- was inefficiency and ever-greater 
government deficits: The parties created too many do-little government jobs for 
too many supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Another price was massive corruption. As demands of ever-growing party 
superstructures required more money, illegal payoffs to political parties for 
government contracts became institutionalized. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation that began in Milan in 1992 has now spread to virtually every 
major city. 
</P>
<P>
 One London bank estimates payoffs of $10 billion to $20 billion in 12 years, 
and some Italian magistrates say the total is even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The probes have thus far implicated five former prime ministers, seven former 
party leaders, 39 former ministers and more than 2,000 leading businessmen and 
managers, including Berlusconi's brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful to select ministers untainted by any hint of impropriety, Berlusconi 
has vowed to give magistrates a free hand to pursue their investigations into 
official corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also pledged to continue the government's campaign against the Mafia, a 
crackdown that had made unprecedented progress in the last two years but is now 
under counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Berlusconi's new Interior minister, Roberto Maroni, rushed to the 
Mafia stronghold of Sicily to reassure small-town leftist mayors who have been 
targets of firebombings and other leave-us-alone warnings from the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters who carried Berlusconi to office are mainstream Italians fed up with 
crime and corruption and intrigued by the economic promises of a man who has 
shown that he can make his ideas work in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi says, with few specifics so far, that he will attack an 
unemployment rate of 11.3% by creating 1 million jobs over the next 30 months. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of free-market legislation now being prepared will be tax relief 
for entrepreneurs who expand production and incentives to hire young workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The new premier has promised tax reform as well, designed to slash the jungle 
of complicated, oft-evaded legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 If Berlusconi brings economic good times back to a country listlessly mired in 
recession, among the large beneficiaries will be Fininvest, his many-tentacled 
and heavily indebted business empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's new prime minister is a short, balding, impeccably tailored and 
tightly controlled man. He has scant patience with criticism and is an 
articulate, if not riveting, speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 From his early days as a scrambling real estate developer in Milan, he has 
become a man of many parts: He owns Italy's biggest advertising agency, three 
national television channels, magazines, insurance companies and Europe's 
champion soccer team, the powerhouse Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new prime minister's enormous wealth and newfound political power do 
not endear him to his political opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is incompatibility when a head of a government is also head of a large 
business. Democracy is not served by the coincidence of these two roles. There 
needs to be a separation," complained Sen. Cesare Salvi of the Democratic Party 
of the Left, the former Italian Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 That Berlusconi named his personal lawyer as defense minister and a political 
talk show host from one of his TV channels as minister for relations with 
Parliament does not inspire great confidence either. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi has placed the management of his holdings in the hands of longtime 
aide Fedele Confalonieri and named three guarantors to ensure that he does not 
mix public and private roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitution and the law are sufficient for those who know how to apply 
them," Forza Italia Sen. Enrico la Loggia declared of the remedies available to 
control any transgressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's new leader presents his government as representing a continuity of 
Rome's global interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a fan of President Clinton's, he is more at home with Italy's 
partnerships with the United States and Western Europe than some Europeans are 
with his government. That owes to the presence in his Cabinet of five 
neo-fascist ministers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Fini, too young at 42 to have more than schoolbook memories of 
Mussolini, the National Alliance portrays itself as a capitalist and democratic 
right-wing party. 
</P>
<P>
 Fini, though, sends shivers across Europe when he says that Mussolini was the 
greatest statesman of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi entered politics in the first place because he feared victory by 
the former Communist Party in the national elections of March. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week he forcefully denounced xenophobia, racism and anti-Semitism in a 
parliamentary speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Italians are not as sanguine as their new prime minister about the 
presence of neo-fascists in government. 
</P>
<P>
 So a rich man more accustomed to giving orders than to building a consensus 
asks for time and understanding as he takes the reins of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge us by facts and not prejudice," Berlusconi implored. Name: Silvio 
Berlusconi

ETHNIC DISCORD; THREAT OF U.N. PULLOUT RAISES A 'NIGHTMARE SCENARIO' IN BOSNIA; 
FRUSTRATIONS HAVE LED TO CALLS FOR DEADLINES ON TROOP USE. THE BLUE-HELMETED 
LIFELINE WOULD COLLAPSE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Threats by Western countries to pull U.N. troops out of embattled Bosnia may 
be as hard to deliver on as earlier promises to protect civilians here, but the 
prospect has nevertheless stirred fears of devastating consequences for all of 
the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 As fighting in the region grinds through its third year and hopes for a 
negotiated solution evaporate, fatigue and frustration have prompted countries 
contributing troops to the U.N. command to impose deadlines for a peaceful 
settlement or a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 France has put UNPROFOR, the U.N. Protection Force, on notice that it will cut 
its 6,800-troop contingent by 2,500, and Britain has threatened to withdraw all 
3,300 of its soldiers if the Bosnian government and Serbian nationalist rebels 
have not made peace in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 While those and similar warnings by other NATO-member countries give the 
impression of a new, get-tough attitude with the Bosnian combatants, the 
consequences of such a pullout could be lopsided and would almost guarantee a 
widening of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 British Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander for 15,000 troops in Bosnia, 
said in interviews he is certain all sides recognize that a pullout would lead 
to "a nightmare scenario." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go, who is going to feed the 2.7 million people here who are totally 
dependent on aid?" Rose asked. "Who is going to push the peace process? The 
cease-fire in Sarajevo would unravel. Even in central Bosnia, where there is 
already a political agreement, there is the risk that everything would come 
unstuck." 
</P>
<P>
 Without U.N. troops to protect aid convoys trying to reach hungry civilians 
trapped behind the front lines, deliveries to besieged pockets and this 
encircled capital city would have to stop, confirmed Kris Janowski, spokesman 
for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo, which the refugee agency uses as a base for feeding 440,000 Bosnians 
on both sides of the encircling confrontation line, is served by a humanitarian 
airlift now operated and protected by U.N. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If UNPROFOR pulled out, the airport would stop functioning and there would 
probably be a huge escalation in the fighting," Janowski predicted. "And UNHCR 
cannot run an airlift under conditions of total warfare." 
</P>
<P>
 The eastern Bosnian pockets of Gorazde, Srebrenica and Zepa would also likely 
lose their aid lifelines, because there would be no U.N. troops or armor to 
muscle deliveries through the Serbian rebel cordons entrapping more than 
150,000 people, mostly Muslims, in those U.N.-designated havens. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations and its aid agency have observed strict neutrality 
throughout their nearly two years in Bosnia, feeding nearly all of the 
population still left here after 200,000 deaths and the flight to other 
countries of as many as half of the 2 million displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the dependent Serbian civilians live in areas adjacent to their 
patron state of Serbia or Croatian land conquered by fellow Serbs during an 
earlier phase of the regional war, the nationalist rebels have less at risk 
with the food pipeline if they defy the peace deadline than the Muslim-led 
government, whose backers would be left to starve. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inequity of aid deliveries that would result from a U.N. 
withdrawal, officials of the Balkans force see counter-pressures that they 
believe should compel the Serbian rebels to quit while they are so far ahead 
and get what they can through negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Implicit in a pullout is lifting of the arms embargo," one officer said, 
pointing to the mounting pressures in Washington and Western Europe to nullify 
a 1991 U.N. prohibition of arms deliveries to what was then Yugoslavia but has 
since fractured into independent republics, each of which holds widely 
disparate shares of the old federation's weapon stockpile. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia inherited the arsenal of tanks, heavy guns and aircraft that belonged 
to the massive Yugoslav People's Army, the fourth-largest force in Europe, 
which has given its Serbian rebel proxies in Bosnia the military might to 
conquer more than 70% of this republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the U.N. is forced to leave, the chances of the Serbs getting 
(U.N.-imposed economic) sanctions lifted is zero and they have to worry about 
the Muslims being rearmed," another European officer noted. "In both respects, 
time would not be on the Serbs' side." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Muslims and Croats had been fighting each other in a war-within-a-war 
until March, when a U.S.-brokered agreement restored their alliance against the 
Serbian land grab. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Serbs have so far refused to commit themselves to a proposed Bosnian 
federation of ethnically based ministates, preferring to press on with a quest 
to annex their conquered Bosnian territory to a Greater Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Bosnian government have reacted with pique to the threats of 
a pullout. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic denounced Britain's two-month deadline as an 
attempt to force the leadership of a U.N.-member state to cave in to its own 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States recently joined Russia and European Union nations in 
demanding that the Bosnian combatants accept an immediate cease-fire and agree 
to a split of the territory that would give the Serbian rebels internationally 
recognized authority over half of this republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There does seem to be a attitude throughout the international community now 
that Bosnia is already dead and it just needs a proper burial," said a Western 
diplomat here who regards the ethnic partitioning ordered by the major powers 
at their May 13 conference in Geneva as a solution that would be a short-term 
one at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers believe, though, that the threats are having the desired effect 
of confronting the two sides with no other option but to sit down and 
negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirko Pejanovic, a Bosnian vice president who is a non-nationalist Serb, said 
he sees little chance of a U.N. pullout and growing signs that the leadership 
is ready to compromise on the issue of how long they will cease military 
activities to give the peace process a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 The foreign ministers who met in Geneva insisted that both sides agree to a 
four-month cease-fire and resume negotiations that deadlocked early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbs insist that four months is too short, because they hope to draw out 
the negotiations endlessly so as to strengthen their grip on all the territory 
they now hold. The government, fearing that delaying tactic, wants a finite 
term by which a fair settlement is negotiated or the intransigent party 
punished for refusing to bargain in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it is one, two or three months isn't what is important," Pejanovic 
contended. "There is no military solution to this conflict, so both sides must 
realize there is nothing to be gained by continuing to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 A well-known political analyst for the Sarajevo daily Oslobodjenje, Merhet 
Husic, agrees the risk of a U.N. pullout is extremely slim, for the same reason 
cited by Pejanovic -- that the two sides are likely to accept the logic of 
negotiations. But he also believes that the international community's prestige 
is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're bluffing," he said of the British and French threats to withdraw from 
Bosnia. "They have to be here for the sake of their own political futures. They 
don't care about Bosnia, but if they leave this place while war continues, they 
would be admitting they are nothing, that not even NATO can protect people from 
senseless killing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the obvious dangers of a U.N. pullout, officials warn that political 
realities in the parliaments of Europe could pressure those governments to put 
a limit on their patience and a mission whose costs and casualties have become 
increasingly difficult to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will come a stage where they have to say, 'That's it,' " Rose's aide, 
Lt. Col. Simon Shadbolt, said of the growing sentiment for giving the 
combatants an ultimatum to make peace. "We are not yet at that stage, and the 
mission will continue. But if we have provided the conditions for the peace 
process and both sides make clear they do not want peace, there will come a 
stage where we have to ask ourselves what the hell we're doing here."

NEXT STEP; SMITH'S DEATH SENDS PARTY SCRAMBLING; A LEADERSHIP FIGHT COULD SET 
BACK GAINS LABOR HAS MADE AGAINST BRITAIN'S CONSERVATIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain's opposition Labor Party, running way ahead of the ruling Conservative 
Party in opinion polls, is suddenly facing just what it doesn't need: a 
bruising fight for the party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 After a discreet silence following the unexpected fatal heart attack on May 12 
of John Smith, the man who had stepped forward to give Labor a firm hand at the 
helm, speculation and maneuvering has begun over who will take over the 
leadership at this crucial point for the resurgent party. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is chosen stands an excellent chance of becoming prime minister in the 
next national election -- a post Labor has not held since the victory of 
Margaret Thatcher's Conservatives in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Conservatives do not have to call an election until 1997, Smith's 
death has sharpened the focus on national politics. It has also put a spotlight 
on the potential for a rancorous political fight which, political observers 
say, could damage the responsible image that Labor Party chieftains had 
painstakingly built under Smith. Infighting has increased in the absence of an 
election date for party leader. It could be set Wednesday at a meeting of 
Labor's executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the modern Labor Party has been one of knock-down, drag-out 
battles, which, while providing entertaining material for political 
journalists, has hurt the party's chances in national elections. Conservative 
Party leaders Thatcher and her successor John Major have successfully depicted 
the Labor Party as a fractious bunch of socialists, incapable of governing 
properly over the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But under Neil Kinnock and his successor as Labor leader, the 55-year-old 
Smith, a fresh and talented group of Labor lawmakers has emerged. The leading 
members of this group now form the party's shadow cabinet, ready to step in 
should the Conservatives lose a national election. In opposition, shadow 
cabinet members act as Labor spokespersons in and out of Parliament for the 
various areas of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Five have emerged as the leading contenders for party leader: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tony Blair, 41, the handsome, personable spokesman for domestic affairs, a 
front-running candidate representing the moderate-right wing of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gordon Brown, 43, the Treasury spokesman, who is an ally of Blair as a 
leading voice for the centrists inside the party. He could step aside to allow 
Blair to dominate the field for the moderates. 
</P>
<P>
 * John Prescott, 55, employment spokesman, a bluff, combative orator who 
represents the center-left of the party, and is considered tough competition 
for Blair and Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * Robin Cook, 48, a brilliant, bearded spokesman for trade and industry, who 
represents the traditional left of the party and its insistence on government 
ownership, a welfare state and full employment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Margaret Beckett, 51, the deputy party leader who may contest the leadership 
but is given only an outside chance of winning it. 
</P>
<P>
 The leadership election could be held at any time but is expected to be 
delayed until after the June 9 European Parliament elections at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor moderates would like to see a July date to avoid a prolonged wrangle 
that could tarnish the unified image that the party established under Smith. 
But supporters of Prescott, the center-leftist, are promoting an autumn date in 
order to build support for him. And they would like to see an American-style 
campaign that would test the contenders openly against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rushed election would be an insult to members in the constituencies and the 
unions," said Alan Simpson, a Labor Member of Parliament. "The most realistic 
and democratic timetable would be to hold the election at the party's annual 
conference in October." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the complex rules of the party leadership, the decision will be made by 
a cumbersome balloting of an electoral college consisting of a one-third each 
of union members, Labor members of parliament and party members. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief interest lies in the possible fight between Blair and Brown -- good 
friends but possible antagonists -- since many analysts believe that if one 
steps aside the other could easily win the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech Sunday, Brown spelled out the moderate Labor view of the political 
future: party unity and a "fair" and "socially just" society with "full and 
fulfilling employment." 
</P>
<P>
 As for unity, Brown declared: "We've struggled too long for harmony to allow 
discord now." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's friends say he is the natural heir to Smith's mantle, and could serve 
as the bridge between the left and right wing of the party -- but so far 
support seems to be favoring Blair, who, in a clever departure from past Labor 
positions, has lifted the law-and-order issue from the Tories with the slogan: 
"Tough on crime but also tough on the causes of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of a Blair-Brown political fight, with undertones of lacerating 
battles among Labor leaders in the past, alarms moderates who believe that it 
would derail the continuing moderation of Labor's policies and image. 
Furthermore, it could jeopardize their close working relationship between the 
two men in making the party more palatable to crossover Tory voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gordon is hanging in there," said a colleague of the Treasury spokesman. 
"Blair's team is in a state because they expected Brown to fold immediately, 
but he hasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Prescott has dismissed Blair and Brown as Labor's "beautiful 
people," and believes the next national election will focus on his own 
specialties: employment and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 That view is shared by most of the contenders, and opinion polls show that the 
electorate is deeply concerned about job losses and the erosion of welfare 
benefits, particularly health, under Major's Conservative government. Major's 
chancellor of the exchequer, Kenneth Clarke, said last week that work and 
welfare were dominant themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier address, sounding almost Labor-like, Clarke declared: "Families 
need a sense of security in their personal finances; their home ownership 
depends on mortgage finance, and their old age requires adequate pension 
provision." 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Smith has also changed the political calculus in the Conservative 
Party, where Trade Secretary Michael Heseltine has been considered the leading 
successor to the 51-year-old Major should his unpopularity force him to step 
down. Smith's death directed attention to Heseltine's own serious heart attack 
last year and caused doubts about his ability, at age 61, to take over as prime 
minister. Clarke, considered the second-strongest challenger to Major's 
leadership, appears in no hurry to challenge the prime minister so Major may be 
safe for some time, particularly if, as Conservative MPs believe, Britain is 
headed for an economic upturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Oxford-educated Blair keeps Labor's torch burning in frequent 
television appearances and engaging parliamentary debate, putting forward an 
image of youth and modernization. 
</P>
<P>
 As one Conservative MP put it, with a note of chagrin: "People will vote for 
Tony Blair without feeling that they are voting for Labor."

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; OUT OF EXILE, PALESTINIANS PACK IN TUNISIA; THE SOUND OF 
CLOSURE HERE IS THE CLICK OF SUITCASES AS PLO OFFICIALS PREPARE TO RETURN TO 
GAZA AND JERICHO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A blustery wind pushed through the broken arches that were the headquarters of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization's elite Force 17 security unit before it 
blew apart one October morning in a booming ballet of flying stones and bodies 
afire, propelled into history and the blinding turquoise of the Mediterranean 
Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away an amiable sheep poked its nose among the graves of some of the 
70 men who died that day in 1985 when a fleet of Israeli warplanes, dispatched 
by then-Prime Minister Shimon Peres and his defense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, 
hit the PLO's headquarters-in-exile in Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew what was happening," recalled Ahmed Abdul Karim Hih, a senior 
diplomat in the PLO foreign ministry who helped Chairman Yasser Arafat pull 
bodies from the rubble. "We can recognize the sound of Israeli aircraft like 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack at Hammam-Shat came barely three years into the PLO's 12-year exile 
in this remote North African outpost, a period that has seen the assassination 
of Arafat's two top lieutenants and, on the stage of history, the journey of a 
straggling band of defeated commandos in Lebanon on the road to peace with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Israeli journalists broadcast interviews with PLO leaders from the Tunis 
Hilton and drive out to see the place where Israeli commandos gunned down 
Khalil Wazir (Abu Jihad), Arafat's second-in-command, in his bedroom in a 
whitewash-and-cobblestone suburb of Tunis in the middle of the night in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 And the PLO, the nomadic revolutionary movement that has carried its guns and 
angry posters in exile from Jordan to Lebanon to Tunisia, is preparing to make 
the most important journey of all: the voyage home. The first elements, PLO 
police, are already in place. 
</P>
<P>
 As all but a few of the PLO's departments anticipate moving to Jericho and the 
Gaza Strip in coming weeks with the beginning of Palestinian self-rule, 
Palestinian officials and employees all over Tunis are packing, drawing up 
lists of who stays and who goes, and preparing for another uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole operation is like a huge jump in the air," one senior PLO official 
said. "And for that, there are many things people are not sure of. Will they 
live well when they go to Gaza? Will they have jobs? Some of them are 
hesitating."

<P>
 The Al-Quds school near the Tunis airport, which has educated a generation of 
young Palestinian exiles in mathematics, Arabic and the geography of a 
nonexistent country called Palestine, moved up its year-end exam schedule and 
plans to close its doors forever. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinian news agency WAFA is negotiating with Italy to build a 
$3-million news-gathering facility in Jericho in coming weeks. The social 
affairs, information, education, cultural affairs and economics departments are 
all moving within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Staying behind in Tunis will be the political department, the equivalent of 
the PLO's foreign ministry, to oversee the Palestinians' more than 90 embassies 
and offices around the world; the international relations department, whose 
operations inside the territories are barred by the autonomy accords, and the 
office overseeing Palestinian refugees around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming exodus has generated a whole new jockeying for position within 
the politically tumultuous organization and a re-evaluation of commitment to a 
revolution that is entering a new phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a different life," one longtime Arafat adviser said. "For those 
who were fighters or militants, they move to a question, a very hard question, 
for the first time in 30 years. And don't forget some of them began at 20 years 
old, and now they are near 55. They are ready to retire. You want to be sure 
that if they are going inside that they will be effective. If so, they go. If 
not, they will be in a very hard place." 
</P>
<P>
 One young former fighter -- who wandered with the Palestine Liberation Army 
from Lebanon to Iraq, Libya, Yemen and finally Tunis, where he signed on as a 
bodyguard and office manager for a top PLO official -- has married a Tunisian 
woman and decided he will stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a child and I didn't see Palestine, but when my father and grandfather 
would speak about Palestine, I loved Palestine. When I came to the revolution, 
I loved Palestine more and more, so we kept fighting, and it got in my blood, 
and I became used to the PLO," he said, talking quietly in a deserted Tunis 
villa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the years I tried to leave the revolution, but I couldn't. But you know, 
when I woke up, I found my age going on 31 years. I'm thinking, my father was 
31, he had 10 children." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he decided not to join the Palestinian police force moving into 
Gaza and Jericho. "Now the time is a time of peace. . . . There are no fights. 
You have to look for yourself," he said. "I gave enough. I will leave it to the 
other children." 
</P>
<P>
 Most PLO families worry that with hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
already tightly packed into the rundown housing of the Gaza Strip, there will 
be nowhere for them to live when they start arriving in the weeks ahead.  
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't any family to live with there, and of course I'm worried," said 
Mohammed Abdullah, a teacher at the Al-Quds school who will move to Gaza with 
his wife and four children. "But we have to wait to achieve some of our hopes. 
Everything is still unknown, but we hope there will be some financial aid and 
we can build new homes and more facilities and improve our lives. Life is good 
here in Tunis, but suppose each one he lives in paradise, he will not feel 
happy because he is attached to his homeland." 
</P>
<P>
 At a high-rise apartment complex near the outskirts of Tunis, Bizyada abu 
Youssef, exiled from the Gaza Strip, runs out to her balcony and hauls in a 
folded tent, her most important preparation for the move to Gaza with her 
husband, an administrator in the PLO education department. 
</P>
<P>
 As she sits in her elegantly furnished apartment, she begins to cry as she 
recounts the family's journey in 1948 from their home in Beersheba to a refugee 
camp in Gaza with the creation of the state of Israel. From there, they moved 
to the Arabian Gulf state of Qatar and lived comfortably until the outbreak of 
the Persian Gulf War, when all Palestinians were expelled. They washed up in 
Tunis and began furnishing this apartment. Bizyada says she began growing the 
philodendron that has now stretched across the ceiling and walls of the living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Qatar we were expelled; we left three cars without selling them. They 
ordered us to leave within 72 hours. We left half our clothes there and all our 
belongings," she says, her voice shaking as she points to the vine. "I grew 
this tree as you would grow a child. And now I'm forced to leave it. In every 
country, I am forced to grow, to buy and finally to leave. . . . We hope, God 
willing, this is the last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomatic sources say only about 500 to 600 names are on the tentative list 
of PLO employees to go to Gaza and Jericho, out of about 1,000 PLO employees in 
Tunis. PLO officials say up to 85% of those in Tunis will go and that jobs will 
be provided in the autonomy zones for anyone who doesn't want to stay behind or 
who isn't attached to a department remaining in Tunis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That remains to be seen. "Everybody is worried about the future. The future of 
the people, and the future of the PLO. From Tunis to where? From outside to 
inside, but where? Nothing is clear," PLO envoy Hih said.. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a few days, the Palestinian police will find themselves face to face with 
the people who led the uprising for seven years," he said. "It will not be 
easy. I think the matter of implementing this agreement, it is different than 
signing the agreement. To sign it was almost impossible. And to implement it, 
it will be unbelievable!" The Long Way Home 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 to 600 people are scheduled to go to Gaza and Jericho, out of about 
1,000 PLO employees in Tunis. Some Palestinians, such as Bizyada abu Youssef, 
have moved from country to country. Her family moved from Beersheba to Gaza to 
Qatar to Tunis and is packing for Gaza again.

PROPERTY VALUES: BUILDERS GALLOP AHEAD DESPITE LOW HOUSING SALES; ANTELOPE 
VALLEY: EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF BUYERS NOW, DEVELOPERS SAY 
POPULATION TREND AND JOB GROWTH POINT TO HIGHER DEMAND FOR HOMES. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite continuing weak sales of new homes in the Antelope Valley, home 
builders are readying several new large-scale projects that could produce more 
than 30,000 new homes over the next 15 years.  
</P>
<P>
 The developers of Ritter Ranch are planning to start construction within the 
next few months on the first of 7,200 residences to be nestled in the Sierra 
Pelona Mountains at the southwestern edge of the Antelope Valley. Kaufman & 
Broad is close to getting approval for 5,200 residences at a project currently 
named City Ranch in Palmdale. Another 4,700 homes have been approved at Serrano 
Ranch in the Lancaster area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months that ended Feb. 15, 1,844 new home sales were reported in the 
Antelope Valley, according to The Meyers Group, an Encino research firm. At 
that rate, it would take about 17 years to sell out the major projects 
currently on the drawing board in the Lancaster and Palmdale areas alone. 
</P>
<P>
 A seemingly endless supply of new homes and bank-owned properties has 
seriously hurt the property values of many Antelope Valley homeowners. One 
can't help but wonder what's driving all these major development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 While all these building plans might seem to be adding to the oversupply, many 
of the proposed projects have very long-term development times, according to 
Bob Bray, managing director for The Meyers Group. The large, master-planned 
communities that will be built "take a very long time to bring on line and to 
sell," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patience is the key to success in home building, said Jeff Mezger, division 
president at Kaufman & Broad Home Corp. in Palmdale. He added that while there 
seem too many projects proposed in the Antelope Valley, "there is a difference 
between projects proposed and actually brought on-line. Just because a project 
is proposed doesn't mean it will get financed. The financial institutions are 
being fairly conservative." That means that the surviving builders will be 
those who have deeper pockets and who can be patient. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Antelope Valley, the resale market posted a strong 2,400 homes that 
closed escrow last year, said Tom Thompson, owner of the Palmdale-based 
research company MarketMasters. Thompson said that many of the resales were 
nearly new homes that were sold by distressed homeowners and by financial 
institutions that foreclosed on these residences. Through May 8 of this year, 
there have been 865 home sales in the Antelope Valley, Thompson said. By the 
end of 1994, he said, "there may actually be a shortage of new homes 
available." 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at longer-term trends of population and job growth and those trends 
point to more demand for housing," said Richard Worthington, project manager 
for Ritter Park Associates, developer of Ritter Ranch. Population in the 
Antelope Valley doubled from 1980 to 1990 to about 250,000 residents and the 
area is expected to grow about 4% a year though 1995, Worthington said. It is 
this growth, he said, that will help sell the 7,200 Ritter residential units 
and the other commercial developments planned on 10,625 acres 60 miles from 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years of planning and negotiation has yielded development guidelines 
three-inches thick for Ritter Ranch. The developer isn't expecting instant 
demand, Worthington said. There is a 15-year build-out planned, with new homes 
available in late 1995 or early 1996. "Our concept is to deliver homes for 
every market segment -- everything from starter homes to luxury estates," 
Worthington said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Weissman Group of Northridge is planning 1,100 homes on 300 acres in 
California City, an Antelope Valley community near Edwards Air Force Base. Most 
of California City was divided into 52,000 subdivided lots in the 1950s and 
1960s by another developer. Now, The Weissman Group hopes to finally get 
California City going with new homes and other construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a loan from California City's redevelopment agency, The Weissman 
Group has completed infrastructure work for 70 homes, with four built and 
another 11 under construction, said Andrew Weissman, president of the 
30-year-old development company. He has been marketing "The Villages" at 
California City for six months, but sales have been slow. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Weissman said, he is hoping to attract a supermarket to the area as a way 
to attract more home buyers. Currently, buyers have to drive about 20 minutes 
to the nearest supermarket and about 40 minutes to the nearest large shopping 
mall. But, Weissman remain optimistic. With the growth of nearby employers and 
home prices starting at just $89,900, Weissman said it is only a matter of time 
before his project in California City starts to get more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some builders are trying to create a sense of urgency by predicting shortages 
of finished lots and price increases," said Kaufman & Broad's Mezger. "But, we 
don't see this happening soon." 
</P>
<P>
 While there may soon be a shortage of so-called finished lots with all 
infrastructure and entitlements in place, Mezger said, there are still plenty 
of semi-finished lots to keep up with demand. As a result, he doesn't see any 
price increases in 1994. "Maybe in 1995," he said.

BRIEFING PAPER; FOREIGN 'VISITORS' TO KEEP EYES FIXED ON MEXICO'S ELECTION ; 
INTERNATIONAL SCRUTINY IS SEEN AS PART OF AN EFFORT TO CONFER LEGITIMACY ON A 
PROCESS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAS BEEN HEAVILY TAINTED. 
</P>

 The Background: 
</P>
<P>
 The Aug. 21 Mexican presidential election promises to be historic for a 
variety of reasons, not the least of which is the presence of officially 
acknowledged foreign "visitors," in effect, election observers. 
</P>
<P>
 This will mark the first time Mexico has invited international scrutiny of its 
elections and is generally seen as part of an effort to confer legitimacy on a 
process that traditionally has been tainted by vote-rigging and back-room 
deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more international focus on Mexican elections than ever," U.S. 
Ambassador James R. Jones told a small group of foreign reporters recently. 
"What private investors in the United States and elsewhere will be looking for 
is the transparency of the election. It will affect investment decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Mexican officials asked U.N. advisers to review the 
vote-counting computer system and to counsel Mexican poll watchers. The review 
is important because a computer crash in the 1988 vote count led many Mexicans 
to suspect that the presidential election was stolen by the ruling 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the government is taking bids -- open to foreign companies -- for 
an audit of the voter registration lists. Recently passed electoral reforms 
permit the government agency in charge of elections to invite foreign visitors 
to attend the polling. 
</P>
<P>
 The reforms also outlined an extensive role for Mexican citizen-observers. 
Acting informally, citizen observers and poll watchers from political parties 
have played an increasingly important role over the six years since the last 
presidential race in detecting irregularities and fraud in state and local 
elections. The Parties: 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Electoral Institute, a government agency that runs elections in 
Mexico, is charged with inviting foreign visitors and deciding the basis and 
criteria for their attendance. Foreigners may be authorized to witness any 
phase of the election process, which would presumably include vote-counting. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy within the government over foreign poll watchers was resolved by a 
compromise that made the United Nations the outside organizing agent, avoiding 
the Organization of American States, which is perceived to be heavily 
influenced by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides evaluating the computer system, the United Nations plans to work with 
Mexican civic groups that are organizing citizen-observers. The program will be 
overseen by the National Civic Alliance, an umbrella agency for about 400 
organizations nationwide that has coordinated poll watchers in recent state 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's nine political parties will also have their own poll watchers. The 
opposition National Action Party -- a pioneer in election observing -- expects 
to cover about 95% of the country's precincts, while the governing PRI is 
shooting for 100%. The third major political force, the Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), currently has observers committed to all Mexico City 
precincts and two-thirds of those nationwide. By election day, party officials 
say they expect to have 100% coverage. The Issues: 
</P>
<P>
 Protests accusing the ruling party of vote fraud in state elections reached 
levels in recent years that forced the government to negotiate with opposition 
leaders to restore order, often by naming interim governors.  
</P>
<P>
 To avoid such unrest in August -- a development that would be certain to upset 
foreign investors and jeopardize the country's economic program -- the 
government is promising "squeaky clean" elections. However, opposition parties, 
notably the PRD, are already questioning the reliability of the upcoming vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The electoral process is being conducted based on the partiality of the 
electoral authority, an unreliable voter registration role, illegal and 
inequitable financing and access to the media and the lack of an effective 
judicial resource to make voting effective," PRD presidential candidate 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas wrote in a letter to U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali. The letter was sent the day after the government requested U.N. 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments anger PRI officials, who say the country has made major strides 
in electoral reform. "It would be understandable from people who had not been 
involved in the process, but they know better," charged Jose Angel Gurria, 
director of international affairs for the campaign of PRI candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo. The Process: 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican poll watchers will apply for nationwide accreditation at their local 
or district election offices. They must attend courses approved by the Federal 
Electoral Institute. The United Nations is expected to offer such courses. 
</P>
<P>
 On election day, the poll watchers will have the right to observe the 
installation of voting apparatus at the precinct, the voting, vote counting, 
posting of results outside the precinct, closure of the precinct and the report 
of precinct officers to district officials. They will have the right to report 
on what they observe to the Federal Electoral Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for foreign visitors are less clear because the Mexican Congress has 
left the details to the electoral institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican Constitution does not permit foreigners a formal role in Mexican 
elections. However, international groups have routinely attended state and 
mid-term congressional elections in recent years, commenting freely on any 
irregularities they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the only foreign visitors formally invited are the U.N. advisers, they 
will see the voting and will undoubtedly comment on it, Mexican political 
analysts say. The 1988 Race Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari won the 
1988 election with by far the weakest showing in the six-decade history of the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Opposition groups claimed fraud in 1988 
returns. Here are the results of that election: 
</P>
<P>
 * Carlos Salinas de Gortari, Institutional Revolutionary Party: 50.36%  
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, National Action Front: 31.12% 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel J. Clouthier, National Action Party: 17.07% JUANITA DARLING

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; A DACHA DUEL IN CRIMEA BETWEEN RUSSIA, UKRAINE; UNDER COVER 
OF POLITICAL CHAOS, A LAND GRAB RAGES IN SEVASTOPOL, HOME OF THE BLACK SEA 
FLEET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A sailboat bobs on the gentle tide of Sevastopol's Azure Bay, a sea gull 
soaring against the setting sun. It is a picture of tranquillity, an imaginary 
scene painted on an admiral's house. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of the atmosphere in this historic naval port on the Crimean 
peninsula is heated, a conflict between Ukraine and Russia over who owns what, 
including Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
 "This dacha belongs to the former commander of the Black Sea Fleet, Adm. 
Mikhail Khronopulov," explained Boris Nesterenko, a retired officer, as he 
admired the spacious three-story house. Five other big dachas shared the bluff 
overlooking the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumor has it that the deputy commander of Russia's Pacific Fleet owns one of 
them," Nesterenko said. "Naval officers from throughout the (former) U.S.S.R. 
have built dachas here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the hierarchy of military dachas, size reflects rank. So, junior officers 
in the 81st Marine Brigade, stationed just minutes away from Khronopulov's 
exclusive enclave, rate only tiny cottages crammed into a field outside their 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those weren't there a year ago," Nesterenko said. "But in the last two years, 
the military has been exploiting the political chaos to seize city land for 
itself."  
</P>
<P>
 This is Ukraine, but the military here is mainly Russian. With the conflict 
over political control of Sevastopol heating up, the " dacha factor" may make 
it impossible to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the picturesque cliffs and seaside location, the marines' dacha 
community is no Malibu. But for their owners, the cottages are all that they 
can call home. Their forces nearly tripled from 800 in 1992 to 2,200 today, the 
elite marines are reportedly preparing for what many here call the Third 
Defense of Sevastopol. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Defense of the strategic port was against England, France and Turkey 
in the Crimean War. The second, against Nazi Germany.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, the enemy is Ukraine. "Those boys are being trained to hate Ukraine," 
Nesterenko said. "And they will kill for their dachas ."  
</P>
<P>
 For the generals and politicians in Kiev and Moscow, the two-year custody 
battle over the Soviet naval force in the Black Sea is a geopolitical problem. 
"Whoever controls the fleet controls Sevastopol, and whoever controls 
Sevastopol will control Crimea," said Capt. Akhmet Aivazov, a Crimean Tatar 
serving in Ukraine's nascent naval force. 
</P>
<P>
 With only four ships, the Ukrainian navy is not much of a force, and it is an 
uneasy neighbor to the hundreds of Black Sea Fleet warships in Sevastopol's 
South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, those ships are jointly commanded by Ukraine's President Leonid 
Kravchuk and Russia's Boris N. Yeltsin. In practice, however, Moscow calls the 
shots and some officers have already sewed the insignia of Russia's armed 
forces on their uniforms.  
</P>
<P>
 Ships are a different matter. Under an accord reached last month, Ukraine 
would have gotten 164 of the Black Sea Fleet's 833 ships -- about what it 
needs, according to naval officers. Russia would have taken the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks broke down, however, when both sides insisted on basing their navies in 
Sevastopol. Ukraine suggested that the Crimean port of Donuzlav about 30 miles 
north of Sevastopol would be a splendid base for the Russians. The latter 
countered that Sevastopol suits them fine and suggested Ukraine ship its navy 
to Odessa, west of Crimea. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask any sailor in Sevastopol about the future of the Black Sea Fleet and he'll 
talk about his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Sergei Zinchenko, a 32-year-old patrol boat commander born and bred in 
Sevastopol, has no intention of leaving. "Where am I to go?" he asked. "My 
family, my home is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the less fortunate, who are still on waiting lists for government-issued 
apartments, have a lot to lose. If they move to a different city, they must go 
back to the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing is not just a problem for the Black Sea Fleet and its Russian sailors. 
Sevastopol-based officers who swore loyalty to Ukraine and transferred to its 
navy are also tied to the city by apartments and dachas.  
</P>
<P>
 "If Russia forces us out of Sevastopol, those officers will have to abandon 
their homes," said Oleh Chybuk, a spokesman for the Ukrainian navy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the improbable event that Moscow's portion of the Black Sea Fleet was 
forced to set sail for naval bases in frigid Murmansk or Vladivostok, serving 
in the Russian navy would be less attractive. But sunny Sevastopol has always 
been considered a plum posting. 
</P>
<P>
 The natural beauty and Mediterranean climate of the "Crimean Riviera," the 
Soviet Union's summer fun playground, with its mountains, beaches and wineries, 
are just an hour's drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 Secret cities hide inside Sevastopol like Matrioshka dolls. Even the dachas 
overlooking the Azure Bay conceal a subterranean city below their basements, a 
World War II command post massive enough to house 70,000 soldiers and 
underground airplane hangars. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Sevastopol's secrets are buried underground. A Byzantine cave 
monastery carved out of sandstone cliffs village awaits. And the ruins of 
Chersonesus Taurica, the first city to arise on this jagged corner of Crimea's 
coast, are fenced off from modern Sevastopol in a huge preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sevastopol residents picnic and sunbathe amid its excavated ruins in 
the summertime, inspiring one wistful visitor to scribble: "I so want to return 
here" on a column in one of the Byzantine basilicas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sevastopol lifestyle has its downside. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is expensive. Water, manufactured goods, bread, meat, electricity -- 
nearly everything except produce, wine and fish -- are shipped from the 
Ukrainian mainland at subsidized but still high prices. So, when locals chant 
the famous phrase: "Sevastopol is the city of Russian glory," Kiev retorts: 
"Sevastopol is a city of Ukrainian subsidies," siphoning more per capita 
spending out of the Ukrainian budget than any other city.  
</P>
<P>
 But the bottom line is not persuasive in a city that never had to balance its 
own books. A June 26 plebiscite among Sevastopol residents declaring the city 
to be "the main naval base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet" is widely expected 
to pass. And Friday the Crimean parliament declared the peninsula independent 
of Ukraine, a move the Ukranian government promptly rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine should have insisted on dividing the fleet two years ago," said Boris 
Nesterenko as he contemplated the hundreds of dachas, crowned with 
Mediterranean red tile, dotting the hills around Sevastopol's South Bay. 
"Russia will never leave now," he said.

 NO GUARANTEES: Cal State Fullerton's baseball team, as expected, was picked 
early in the at-large selections for the NCAA tournament Monday. But Coach 
Augie Garrido is relieved at the selection -- there are no guarantees. Three 
years ago, he told his team: "There are always some surprises each year." He 
didn't realize the surprise then was that the Titans, Big West co-champs that 
year, would be passed over. But Monday, the Titans (41-13) were assigned as the 
No. 2 seed for the NCAA Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla. (C5).

 Three men accused of murdering American student Amy Biehl were released after 
posting a small amount of bail Monday and left the courthouse to be cheered by 
their supporters outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus did not oppose the bail request and asked that it be 
set at 250 rand (about $70) each. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's new constitution stipulates that bail must be granted in all 
but extreme cases. While the bail was relatively low for a violent crime, the 
defendants are from one of Cape Town's poorest townships.

 The three blacks accused of killing Biehl, a 26-year-old white Fulbright 
scholar from Newport Beach, were told to return Aug. 15 for the next hearing. 
All three belonged to the militant Pan Africanist Congress.

ON THE TRAIL OF A KILLER; BLOOD TEST DEVELOPED AT UCI MAY DETECT OVARIAN CANCER 
EARLIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new blood test for ovarian cancer developed at UC Irvine has become the 
focus of a national study to determine if eventually it could speed detection 
of the disease, which often kills its victims by growing undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
 With the approval of the National Cancer Institute, 140 women with ovarian 
cancer will be followed from their original diagnosis through two years of 
treatment, including surgery and chemotherapy, to see if the test can 
accurately detect changing levels of malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Gale Granger, a UCI microbiologist who pioneered the basic research behind 
the new test, said that when it was tried on stored blood from 53 ovarian 
cancer patients, it proved much more sensitive than the standard blood test now 
used to monitor ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the study shows the test can detect changes in malignancy in women known to 
have cancer, it is hoped it eventually could be used as a screening test for 
early detection of ovarian cancer. No such test exists now. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger cautioned, however, that although the new test shows promise, this 
larger study of current patients -- not one that uses stored blood -- is needed 
to confirm the preliminary results. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationwide study is being jointly conducted by UCI and Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center. The Gynecologic Oncology Group, a national research coalition 
of major medical centers funded by the National Cancer Institute, will provide 
the cancer patients and their blood samples. 
</P>
<P>
 Gynecologists have long been waiting for a diagnostic test for ovarian cancer 
that would be comparable to a Pap smear for cervical cancer, said Dr. Philip J. 
DiSaia, director of gynecology oncology at UCI, whose department has 
collaborated with Granger's researchers in developing the new assay. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSaia said the standard test for ovarian cancer, which looks for an antigen 
produced by cancer cells called CA 125 in the bloodstream, has many 
shortcomings and is not sensitive enough to be used as a screening device. The 
test works by detecting the level of CA 125; a higher level means more 
malignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a woman has a tumor the size of a hen's egg, there is only a 50% chance of 
having a positive CA 125 test," he said. Moreover, he added, more than half of 
the time when the CA 125 level drops to zero during therapy, exploratory 
surgery will still find active cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test works by detecting the level of a protein molecule emitted by 
cancer cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another problem with CA 125 is that it occurs in low levels when women 
have medical problems not related to cancer, such as endometriosis and uterine 
fibroids. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Otis Browley, program director in the National Cancer Institute's division 
of cancer prevention and control, agreed that a more accurate test for ovarian 
cancer would be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it has high sensitivity for cancer still in the ovary, it would be 
wonderful," he said, noting that ovarian cancer diagnosed at this stage can be 
cured more often than when it has spread to other body organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Women whose cancers are detected in the earliest stage -- while confined to 
the ovaries -- have an 88% chance of surviving five years after their 
diagnosis, according to the American Cancer Society.  
</P>
<P>
 But ovarian cancer, which will kill about 13,600 American women in 1994, 
usually shows no obvious symptoms until late in its development; only 23% of 
ovarian cancers are discovered early. Most often by the time the cancer is 
discovered, it has spread beyond the ovaries, when the chance of survival for 
five years after diagnosis plunges as low as 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI officials say the new ovarian cancer test was developed after basic 
researchers at UCI teamed with gynecologists working at UCI and Long Beach 
Memorial Medical Center. For 20 years Granger's research group at UCI has 
studied protein molecules called tumor necrosis factors, which the body's 
immune system produces to kill cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Until five years ago, researchers were puzzled why these weapons didn't do 
their job very well. At that time, UCI scientists discovered that cancerous 
tumors secrete blocking agents that intercept and, in effect, defuse 
cancer-killing TNF. These blocking agents mimic the receptors on the cancer 
cells that the TNF uses as an entryway to the malignant cells. As a result, 
many of the TNF cells spend themselves attacking false targets. The researchers 
isolated these agents and developed a laboratory test to detect them in body 
fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a gynecologist fellow at UCI, who was working with the basic 
researchers, who had the idea that the microscopic blocking agents found in the 
fluid surrounding ovarian cancers could be used as a marker for ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if we can pick it up in the fluid, maybe we can pick it up in the 
blood." said Dr. Elizabeth A. Grosen, who now is completing her specialty 
education at the City of Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 To test her hypothesis, Grosen applied the new test to blood belonging to 
ovarian cancer patients whom DiSaia had treated over the years at UCI Medical 
Center and Long Beach Memorial Medical Center.  
</P>
<P>
 She found that the TNF blockers, called soluble TNF receptors, were elevated 
in the blood of women with diagnosed cancer and declined as cancer therapy 
progressed, mirroring the decline of CA 125. An article on the research was 
published last year in Gynecologic Oncology. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the TNF blockers continued to be detectable through blood 
testing after CA 125 had disappeared from the blood of patients who still had 
cancer even of microscopic size. These malignancies were found through biopsy 
or surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the results of the testing they have done at UCI, it looks 
promising," said Dr. Edward Trimble, who gave the National Cancer Institute's 
approval to the expanded study. He said other medical centers also are looking 
for markers such as antigens produced by cancer tumors that in combination with 
CA 125 might be more effective in detecting ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood samples collected by the Gynecologic Oncology Group will be tested 
at Memorial Cancer Institute of Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. The test 
results then will be sent to the Gynecologic Oncology Group office in 
Philadelphia where they will be statistically analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 The gathering of blood samples for the new study began in March, Granger said. 
He emphasized that if the study determines that TNF blockers are a better 
measurement of cancer than CA 125, a much larger future study will be needed to 
learn if this new test is accurate enough to be used as part of a routine 
examination to screen women for the first signs of ovarian cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Granger said there is also some evidence that TNF blockers may indicate the 
presence of other kinds of cancer. "It is kind of opening a door," he said of 
the research under way. The Body's Battlefield 
</P>
<P>
 How the body tries to fight ovarian cancer and how cancer fights back. 
</P>
<P>
 How cancer defends itself: When white blood cells releases TNF, cancer cells 
responds by releasing countless imposters. TNF is neutralized if it latches on 
to an imposter. Receptor: Vulnerable spot of cancer cell where TNF can attach. 
Imposter: Phony receptors released by cancer cell to fool TNF. TNF: Powerful, 
tumor-fighting protein released by white blood cell. White blood cell: Fights 
infections. How white cell fights cancer: White blood cell releases TNF; it 
searches; for the real receptor. If TNF finds real receptor, it connects like a 
jigsaw puzzle piece and begins killing the cancer cell.

SEAL BEACH PIER DAMAGE EXCEEDS FEARS, CITY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damage to the Seal Beach Pier from a fire on Saturday is worse than originally 
thought and exceeds the damage caused by a similar blaze two years ago, city 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 They estimated that the fire caused at least $350,000 in damage and might have 
burned several important pilings that help support the historic wood pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really did a number. It burned a lot of wood," Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings said. "This fire was more devastating because it burned from the 
bottom of the pier to the top. In 1992, the fire burned from the top and the 
sides down into the pier." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the pier could be repaired temporarily and reopened within a few weeks 
if engineers conclude that the boardwalk is structurally secure. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders spent Monday working with county fire investigators, a city-hired 
consulting firm and Southern California Edison Co. trying to determine what 
sparked the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said the fire was probably caused by a small 
explosion under the pier, perhaps an arc of electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will spend the next few days closely examining the electrical 
system, which consists mainly of copper wiring that powers lamps along the 
boardwalk and high-voltage conduit that supplies power to the Ruby's restaurant 
at the end of the pier. Investigators and electrical experts suspect that only 
high-voltage wires could cause such an intense blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The examination is design to find out whether the entire system is faulty or 
if just a portion of it needs to be repaired, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to assure the public that everything is being done to modify the 
electrical system if that is what is needed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into the 1992 fire -- which, like Saturday's, occurred in the 
middle of the pier -- failed to find a precise cause. The investigation did 
determine that a ruptured gas line and a breached electrical line under the 
pier contributed to the blaze, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators doubt any sort of gas leak was involved in Saturday's fire, 
which temporarily trapped more than 100 people at the end of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some beachside residents who witnessed the 1992 fire said that Saturday's 
blaze seemed less severe because they saw fewer flames and less smoke. But a 
close examination of the pier by city and fire officials detected greater 
damage to the wood supports. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest fire charred a slightly smaller area than the 1992 blaze but was 
significantly more intense, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to determine later this week how extensive a repair effort 
is needed. Bankston said the damage could top $450,000 if many wood pilings 
must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The city might consider making temporary repairs to the pier so that it could 
reopen within 10 days. Then, after the busy summer tourist season, it would be 
closed while permanent repairs are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shouldn't have happened twice," Mayor George Brown said. "We are going 
to make sure it doesn't happen a third time." 
</P>
<P>
 The damage is covered by insurance, but the city must pay a $100,000 
deductible, just as it did after the 1992 fire, which caused about $180,000 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has faced severe fiscal problems in the past few years and had to 
raise the utility tax last year to close a budget shortfall. Before the fire, 
Bankston said he planned to propose a 1994-95 budget that began to rebuild the 
city's reserves. That process might have to delayed by a year.

 Federal housing authorities on Monday approved a plan to convert a General 
Telephone & Electric building here into 24 low-cost apartments for people 
infected with the AIDS virus, said a consultant to the nonprofit organization 
spearheading the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the most creative housing project in Orange County," City 
Councilman Robert F. Gentry said. "It brings together funds from federal and 
local government and begins to meet a housing need that is critical for those 
who have HIV in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed Flory, financial consultant to Affordable Housing Projects of Orange 
County Inc. which will develop the housing, said approval from the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development came just in time, because the purchase option 
on the concrete building at Mermaid and 3rd streets would have expired June 1.  
</P>
<P>
 Flory said that now, to meet an HUD-imposed deadline, the two-story building, 
with a basement used for parking, must be converted into apartments that will 
be ready for occupancy in a year. Flory said although HUD, the cities of Santa 
Ana and Laguna Beach and the county of Orange previously agreed to help fund 
the project, it was extremely difficult to find a location that met zoning 
codes and budget constraints and was close enough to services such as shopping 
and public transportation. The GTE building, he said, was the fifth site 
considered for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have looked at sites ranging from foreclosed buildings along (Coast 
Highway) to hotels and motels and vacant parcels," he said Monday. HUD's 
approval was essential, he said. "Until today we didn't have a project."  
</P>
<P>
 Gentry said many HIV-infected people are too disabled to work but can take 
care of themselves for many years before they die of the disease. The housing 
project will not be a hospice for the dying but instead will be designed for 
people capable of "independent living," Flory said. 
</P>
<P>
 With 350 diagnosed cases of AIDS in its population, Laguna Beach is the most 
AIDS-impacted city in the county, Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Fleming, director of social services for AIDS Services Foundation, said 
"about 70% of the clients we work with are living on a monthly income of about 
$600 or less" in disability support, while the average one-bedroom apartment in 
the county rents for $700.  
</P>
<P>
 If the 24 one-bedroom apartments in the new project are not all rented to 
HIV-infected people, they could be rented to low-income people with other 
disabilities, Flory said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based AIDS Services Foundation and Housing for Independent Persons, 
a San Jose group, co-sponsored the HUD housing application, which was submitted 
to the federal agency in September. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD will provide the largest portion of funds for the project, Flory said, 
including $1.8 million for acquisition and rehabilitation of the GTE building 
and $1.6 million in rental subsidies. No tenant, he said, will pay rent 
equivalent to more than 30% of their gross adjusted income, and the monthly 
rents are expected to average $250. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to HUD funding, he said, the project will receive $650,000 from 
Laguna Beach, $500,000 from Santa Ana and $236,000 from the county. He said 
plans for the former GTE office building, which will be purchased for $1.4 
million, include selling one floor of parking to the city.

IRRIGATION WATER HOLDS LEGIONNAIRE'S BACTERIA; HEALTH: ORGANISM CAUSING 
SOMETIMES FATAL DISEASE IS FOUND IN TREATED WATER USED IN MILE SQUARE PARK. 
SCIENTISTS ARE UNSURE IF PEOPLE ARE ENDANGERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bacteria linked to the cause of Legionnaire's disease have been detected in 
treated waste water used to irrigate local public properties including Mile 
Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley, according to Orange County Sanitation 
Districts research. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials, however, said the study had not determined whether 
people could be infected by the bacteria found in water samples taken from the 
Orange County Water District and the Irvine Ranch Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hildy Meyers, the county's epidemiologist, said Monday that she only 
recently became aware of the study and could not determine whether there was 
any immediate cause for alarm. So far this year, only one case of the disease 
has been reported in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The type of testing performed doesn't tell whether the organism is alive or 
not," Meyers said. "We'll be following through to see what (the sanitation 
agency) plans to do. We don't know whether they have reached a level of 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 The disease, which can be fatal, was discovered nearly two decades ago when it 
struck an American Legion convention in Philadelphia. Local health officials 
said the legionella bacteria grow in water and can be spread through the air by 
large air-conditioning systems, decorative fountains or other water systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria cause a pneumonia-like illness that sometimes includes muscle 
aches and coughing. In its most advanced stages, it can cause respiratory 
failure and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the two-year research project involving local sanitation agency 
scientists, which was partially funded by the National Water Research 
Institute, were to be presented this week to the American Society of 
Microbiologists convention in Las Vegas. The study has been the subject of much 
debate in Orange County, specifically at the sanitation agency, where much of 
the research has been performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The research controversy is yet another dispute in the sanitation agency, 
whose various operations are the subject separate inquiries by the California 
Occupational Health and Safety administration, the Orange County district 
attorney's office and an internal sanitation agency investigation of safety 
codes at the agency's Huntington Beach treatment plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials have been conducting a criminal investigation of a February 
flash fire at the Huntington Beach plant where two contractors were killed. And 
prosecutors have been reviewing claims that sanitation officials had accepted 
gifts from contractors doing business with the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the recent bacteria discoveries, Margaret H. Nellor, the sanitation 
agency's acting director of technical services, said the new research report 
contained "numerous errors" and should be labeled as containing only 
"preliminary findings." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, co-authors of the study, including sanitation agency scientist 
Carol Palmer, have reportedly described Nellor's criticisms as an attempt to 
"censor" the document and alter research findings, according to sanitation 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer could not be reached for comment Monday, but Nellor said Palmer and 
others have made their concerns known to her and others in the sanitation 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The study's most critical shortcoming, Nellor said, was that the bacteria 
detected had not been tested for the possibility of human infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think there is any evidence to suggest a public danger," Nellor said 
Monday. "But some people who will be looking at this study are not going to be 
scientists or engineers and could misinterpret the findings. It's not being 
truthful." 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 17 memo to the sanitation agency's environmental sciences laboratory, 
Nellor said that she was "astounded and appalled that anyone representing this 
agency would be so cavalier in their approach as to the preciseness or 
accuracy" of such information. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the study's failure to address the possibility for infection, 
Nellor said the researchers did not accurately describe the water treatment 
process at the Orange County Water District and the Irvine Ranch Water District 
or the chemical dosages used in the treatment of reclaimed water. 
</P>
<P>
 Water district officials could not be reached for comment.

LAGUNA SEEKS 3RD OPINION ON SLIDE AREA; GEOLOGY: CITY WILL HIRE ANOTHER FIRM TO 
DETERMINE WHETHER THE ANCIENT SLIPPAGE ACTUALLY EXISTS UNDER FIRE-SCARRED 
MYSTIC HILLS NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Faced with the emotionally charged question of what to do about an ancient 
landslide that has halted rebuilding in one fire-scarred neighborhood, the 
Laguna Beach City Council voted Monday to get a third opinion on whether a 
landslide actually exists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the council voted to take steps to establish an assessment 
district that would raise money for work to stabilize the hillside, if that 
becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The special meeting followed an intense 3 1/2-hour session Saturday between 
residents, geologists and city staff, which yielded no consensus about what the 
city's next step should be. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, property owners whose homes burned and others whose homes did not 
expressed widely varying viewpoints. While some have tentatively endorsed plans 
for an assessment district to raise $1 million for stabilization work, most who 
spoke at Monday's council meeting demanded another opinion from outside 
geologists. 
</P>
<P>
 David Horne, president of the Mystic Hills Homeowners' Assn., urged the 
council to move quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important that this thing move along as quickly as possible. This 
is not business as usual," he said. "It is critical that people get back on 
track. It is critical that people feel there is a light at the end of the 
tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have questioned whether an ancient landslide is a threat to 
anything other than property values in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of hurt going on," said Robert L. Stollar, a member of the 
Mystic Hills Homeowners' Assn.'s landslide committee, whose home burned in the 
blaze but whose property is above the landslide area. "People lost their homes 
in the fire, want to rebuild and can't. So it's a real tough one." 
</P>
<P>
 The city is refusing to issue building permits until at least the question of 
who will pay for the hillside restabilization project has been answered. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank had strongly recommended that property owners 
unite and form an assessment district to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But owners of homes that survived the Oct. 27 fire are not required to do 
anything, and it has been unclear how much cooperation the city could muster. 
</P>
<P>
 Ursula Denny, a Skyline Drive resident, said she is being asked to join in the 
assessment district although no stabilization work is required on her lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's fair. If I need to do work on my property, I will do work 
on my property. But I don't think I need to pay for somebody else's property 
three blocks away." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank has said all residents will benefit by helping to resolve the problem 
since news of the ancient landslide has caused area property values to plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are never going to be restored until it is corrected," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Monday's unanimous vote, Mystic Hills property owners and city 
staff will choose from one to three geologists to review other geologists' 
previous findings and to determine if the slide exists and if it's stable. The 
city also appropriated $12,500 to pay for the additional work. Affected 
residents may reimburse the city for a portion of that later. 
</P>
<P>
 A special meeting will be held at City Hall at 7 p.m. Wednesday to select the 
latest geologist. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing for the possible formation of an assessment district has been 
scheduled for June 14.  
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen lots, including 14 rendered vacant by the Oct. 27 blaze, sit atop 
the Mystic Hills slide area. Some 38 properties could be directly or indirectly 
affected, according to a report.  
</P>
<P>
 Geofirm, the company that made the report, suggested a complex plan for 
securing the hillside which involves various measures from installing a 
retaining wall to sinking 90-foot rods into the earth and tying them back with 
cables.

MAN, DOG WERE KILLED OVER TRUCK, D.A. SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A 19-year-old Port Hueneme man who may face the death penalty in the March 
slaying of a Simi Valley man committed the crime to steal the victim's truck, a 
prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley's comments outside court reveal for the 
first time prosecutors' theory of why Andy Lee Anderson, 24, and his Australian 
shepherd, Sheila, were gunned down at an Ojai campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Chrestman was indicted for murder and four other charges Friday by the 
Ventura County grand jury. The murder charge included a special circumstance -- 
robbery -- making Chrestman eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 An arraignment for Chrestman on Monday was postponed until June 21 to allow a 
defense attorney time to review a transcript of the grand jury proceedings in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher said the extra time also will allow 
prosecutors time to decide whether to seek the death penalty against Chrestman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That certainly gives them a month to do background checks and determine what 
penalty they want," Asher said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley, however, said the decision whether to seek a date with the gas 
chamber for Chrestman may not be made until well after the arraignment. He said 
his office is still investigating the defendant's background. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to murder, the grand jury charged Chrestman with robbery, grand 
theft, animal cruelty and petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The petty theft charge was filed in connection with a pair of binoculars 
Chrestman stole from his own father after he killed Anderson, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Anderson was slain, Chrestman took the victim's 1987 pickup truck and 
planned to use it to leave the area, Frawley said. But the defendant was 
arrested at Zuma Beach in Los Angeles County before he could leave, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley called Anderson's death senseless. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was murdered for a truck," the prosecutor said. "A truck is not worth 
killing someone for, but it was to this fellow." 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley said Chrestman, who lived with his parents, wanted to leave Port 
Hueneme. He said Chrestman apparently had robbery in mind when he went to the 
Lion's Campground near the Rose Valley Recreation Area in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to leave town," Frawley said. "And he saw Andy with the truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson had been at the campground fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Chrestman shot Anderson in the neck around noon on May 4, as 
the Simi Valley man stood next to his truck preparing to drive home from a 
half-day fishing trip. Chrestman then shot the dog, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman has one criminal conviction on his record, authorities said. He was 
found guilty of misdemeanor drug possession last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the prosecutor trying a murder case -- in which a special 
circumstance has been alleged -- meets with senior district attorney's 
officials to decide whether to seek the death penalty after the background 
check on the defendant is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury makes the final decision on the 
issue, Frawley said.

DROP-IN CENTER SEEKS OK TO OFFER BEDS TO HOMELESS; VENTURA: THE DOWNTOWN, 
DAYTIME FACILITY FOR THE MENTALLY ILL WOULD EXPAND TO ALLOW 10 CLIENTS TO SPEND 
NIGHTS. REACTIONS OF AREA BUSINESS OWNERS ARE MIXED.

<P>
 A downtown Ventura center for the mentally ill would expand its services to 
allow 10 homeless men and women to spend the night there, under a proposal 
before the city Planning Commission today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turning Point Foundation, located at Thompson Boulevard near California 
Street, is now a daytime center where the mentally ill drop in for food, health 
care and companionship. The proposal would allow the facility to roll out as 
many as 10 beds each night for its homeless clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a responsibility to all the members of our community," said Ted 
Temple, a Planning Commission member who favors the proposal. "I know there 
will be people affected by this . . . but you have to look at the overall good 
of the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But some neighbors fear that expanding the center programs would only increase 
loitering and vagrancy in the Thompson Boulevard area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this thing for the homeless or the bums?" asked Sammy Abdulhai at Clarks 
Liquors, on California Street near the center. "I don't care if some women and 
their children stay there. But I don't want bums from the (Ventura) river 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are mentally ill. They panhandle. They harass my customers." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, Abdulhai's opposition arises from a 1991 incident, when he was shot 
by a panhandler he had asked to leave the storefront. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge William Peck, who owns an apartment 
building next to the homeless center, also opposes the expansion of services. 
"We already have difficulty caused by the current operation, people urinating 
on our property, yelling back and forth," Peck said. "They have to go 
somewhere, and I wish they weren't right next to my apartment complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Other nearby businesses, though, voiced no opposition to the planned shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to put beds over there and take them in, I'm for it," said Hilda 
Cooper, manager of Livery News & Books on California Street. "If they had a 
place to go to sleep, maybe things would get better" for them. 
</P>
<P>
 At B.J.'s Restaurant, across Thompson Boulevard from the center, employees 
routinely give food to the homeless visitors and let them use the restrooms. "I 
think that they seem to respect us," said manager Sabrina Yates. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city first approved the center in 1987, Cooper and other neighbors 
protested loudly. But since then, she said, the homeless people and staff 
members she met have persuaded her that the project is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Chris Dodge said, "The people around here really look at us as 
a service, because we keep people off the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The center has a roster of 269 mentally ill men and women who drop in at least 
three times a month. As many as 20% of them live in the Ventura River bottom or 
in abandoned cars around the city, Dodge said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday afternoon, about 20 people filled the center, playing pool, 
listening to music and talking to each other. Turning Point expects to add 
laundry facilities and showers for the homeless as soon as promised funding is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 With roll-away beds and partitions for privacy, the community center could 
turn into a shelter at night. In addition, Turning Point has already received 
approval to turn the second story of the building into single rooms for 10 
homeless people. Construction on that project should begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming a nighttime shelter, the center has agreed to meet certain 
conditions, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * Homeless residents would spend no more than 90 nights in a row at the 
shelter; 
</P>
<P>
 * At least two employees would remain on duty at all times; 
</P>
<P>
 * Lighting would be added to the back of the building to discourage homeless 
people from sleeping there; 
</P>
<P>
 * Guests who leave the shelter after 9 p.m. would not be allowed back in the 
building.

COMPANY PLANS $100-MILLION RECYCLING CENTER; TRASH: THE COMPLEX WOULD BE 
LOCATED A FEW MILES AWAY FROM CITY OF OXNARD'S PROPOSED PLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura County's trash wars heated up again Monday as a Ventura company said 
it would go head-to-head with the city of Oxnard in competing for the county's 
recyclable rubbish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ignoring critics who say there may not be enough trash to go around, Gold 
Coast Recycling announced it will build a $100-million recycling facility a few 
miles away from another state-of-the-art plant planned by the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast's 80,000-square-foot facility, proposed for 19 1/2 acres of 
farmland off Victoria Avenue near the Ventura Freeway, could take in up to 
1,500 tons of garbage per day from cities across the county.  
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, the plant would share the property with offices for 
environmental-oriented firms, a natural gas fueling station, and a cluster of 
manufacturers who will turn the recyclables into consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast officials originally hoped to locate its recycling plant in 
Camarillo, but residents rejected the idea. For years, Gold Coast and Oxnard 
officials have been competing to build a recycling plant that would handle most 
of the county's trash. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, city officials continue to pursue their own recycling plant. In 
December, they pledged $20 million for a plant that could sift recyclables from 
2,777 tons of trash each day. The Oxnard facility is slated to open in about a 
year, and Oxnard-based BLT Enterprises will run it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not quite so optimistic as some people that this area can support two 
(regional) recycling plants," said Ventura City Councilman Gary Tuttle. "I'm 
afraid one is going to suffer big time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast now processes about 400 tons of trash a day at a Ventura facility. 
Oxnard, in conjunction with BLT, processes about 45 tons of city garbage daily 
at a temporary recycling site on Oxnard's Commercial Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the refuse for both new facilities would come from west Ventura County 
cities because Simi Valley, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks now send the bulk of 
their recyclables to east county sorting yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, however, transports one-third of its residential recyclables 
and 80% of its commercial recyclables to Gold Coast. Thousand Oaks officials 
said they are talking to Oxnard officials about shifting their recyclable 
rubbish to that city's new plant when it opens in mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Oxnard can do a better job, because as a government-owned facility, 
there will be no property taxes on it, no requirements to pay income taxes," 
said Thousand Oaks City Councilman Alex Fiore. "So in theory, they should be 
able to do the job for less money." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Monday, Gold Coast officials unveiled their proposed 
facility, saying the plant would move the county a giant step forward in 
reducing waste headed for the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold Coast officials marshaled a host of supportive politicians, including 
three county supervisors and a dozen city leaders, including six of seven 
Ventura City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that what we are seeing here today is a first step into the 
future," Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they planned to exploit the competing recycling 
plants to save their city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may put some pressure on Gold Coast to keep our rates down," Camarillo 
City Councilman Michael Morgan said. Camarillo now sends its trash to Gold 
Coast's facility. "But we'd have to consider any new proposal that comes along. 
We'd be pound foolish if we didn't." * 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Campbell, a Fillmore councilman, said he would prefer to use Gold Coast 
because he favors allowing private business to handle trash and he likes the 
concept of having on-site manufacturers converting the recyclables into usable 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, he would not let principle stand in the way of a good bargain. 
"Of course, what I will be looking for is the most inexpensive way for the city 
to get rid of trash." 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Coast facility would be located at the corner of Golf Course Drive 
and Nicolle Street. The proposed Ventura Environmental Business Park, including 
the manufacturers and other businesses, would be up and running in about three 
years, officials say. It would employ 250 people, 130 more than at Gold Coast's 
operating facility in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Recyclables separated by residents at the curb would be hauled to the new 
plant, where workers would separate newsprint, plastic and other materials 
before handing them over to on-site manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The manufacturers would then convert the recycled items into consumer 
products. One neighboring business, as outlined in the proposal, would turn 
used newsprint into material for doors and cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Oxnard's plant, planned for the southwest corner of Sturgis Road 
and Del Norte Boulevard, would only separate recyclables, not convert them into 
other materials. BLT officials, however, say they plan to build such a 
manufacturing center on a nearby lot, and are trying to line up businesses for 
such an industrial park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to figure out why Ventura and Gold Coast are doing this," said BLT 
President Bernard Huberman. "We're in a much better location related to the 
surrounding use. We're in a heavy industrial zone -- they are in a light 
industrial zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are right by the (most congested) on- and off-ramp in the county," he 
said, referring to the Victoria Avenue off-ramp of the Ventura Freeway. "It's 
again, another bad idea by Gold Coast." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defending their proposed Ventura location, Gold Coast officials say their 
facility will not bother their neighbors because operations will take place 
inside a building. They say they plan to help finance construction of an 
improved Victoria Avenue off-ramp as part of their development agreement with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Slack, the facility's project manager, said he is sure there will be 
enough garbage in the county to keep both plants going. He added, though, that 
he is sorry there has to be competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best solution is for everybody to pool their resources," he said.

SAFER NURSERIES; 2 HOSPITALS INSTALL ALARMS TO PREVENT BABY KIDNAPINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County hospitals are turning to high-technology security systems 
to prevent kidnapers from stealing newborn babies from their maternity wards. 
</P>
<P>
 At Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura, sensor systems similar to 
anti-shoplifting devices at retail stores have been installed at every exit on 
the maternity floor. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly undetectable tag attached to the baby sets off an alarm if an 
unauthorized person tries to leave with an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine or 10 years ago, we didn't even have to lock the doors of our nursery," 
said Carol Dimse, Community's director of patient care services. "But over the 
years we've had to evolve more and more with our security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't imagine anything worse that could happen to a patient than having 
their child abducted," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, where a new obstetrics 
unit is under construction, sensors are being installed at each of the floor's 
nine exits and should be working by September, when renovations are complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way anyone will be able to get off this floor with a baby," said 
Joanne Askew, Los Robles' chief nursing executive. The Los Robles system, 
slightly different from Community's, has a feature that automatically locks all 
doors when the alarms are activated.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, newborn 
abductions are relatively rare; 19 infants were taken from California hospitals 
or homes from 1983 to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear of kidnapings and the lawsuits that can follow has prompted 
hospitals to lock maternity ward doors, put up surveillance cameras and install 
card-key entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some baby abductors manage to elude those security systems, including a woman 
who was accused of taking a baby earlier this month from White Memorial Medical 
Center in Los Angeles. She allegedly followed an employee through a card-key 
controlled door. 
</P>
<P>
 A surveillance camera in the hospital helped police identify the suspect and 
return the baby safely to its mother. But as Askew pointed out, the camera did 
not stop the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "With TV cameras you can look at the film, but the baby is already gone," 
Askew said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Community and Los Robles said they turned to the sensor systems 
because they are the most advanced safety alternative on the market. While 
there is no guarantee with any system, they said the sensors give both staff 
and patients a heightened sense of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Two companies market the sensor systems: Sensormatic, a Florida-based company 
that has sold its Security Tag Systems to hundreds of hospitals nationally, 
including Community Memorial, and West & Associates of Los Gatos, which has 
installed its SecureCare sensors in 65 hospitals throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Robles bought the SecureCare system from Lynn West, a registered nurse who 
started the company four years ago. The first systems she sold were meant to 
keep elderly nursing home patients from wandering off the premises. But she 
soon changed her focus toward maternity ward security. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a problem and I saw a very sad need," West said. She said her system 
successfully stopped three abduction attempts in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals usually place the tags on a wrist band, a leg band or a diaper. Some 
even put them on the umbilical cord clamp, which remains on the baby for three 
to four days after birth. West recommends this method. 
</P>
<P>
 "That works really well," she said. "Most people, even some nurses, are afraid 
to touch the umbilical cord clamp." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Poprock, director of maternal health care at Los Robles, said the 
hospital has not decided where to position the tags on newborns yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might even move them around," she said. Either way, she said, it's 
important to maintain secrecy about the system for it to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial's Dimse agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do tell parents about the system, but we don't like to advertise it," 
Dimse said. "The people who might try to steal a baby -- well, the more they 
know about how the system works, the more at risk the babies are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the nine months since the nearly invisible security blanket was installed 
at Community it has been activated a few times, but only accidentally, by 
parents or staff. 
</P>
<P>
 When it goes off, a panel of lights behind the nurse's station begins to 
flash, showing where the baby is. At the sound of the alarm, a code is called 
out over the hospital intercom, alerting staff to block off the exits on the 
street level. 
</P>
<P>
 West said she has given price quotes to about 80% of the hospitals in Southern 
California for the SecureCare system. But even though interest is high in her 
product, some hospitals worry it might not be worth the cost, about $2,000 for 
each sensor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of on our wish list," said JoLynn de la Torre, spokeswoman for Simi 
Valley Adventist Hospital. "But it's extremely expensive and we're not sure as 
to whether or not we can afford it or how well it actually works." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Nahirny, a case analyst with the National Center for Missing and 
Exploited Children, said the sensor systems do seem to be an effective 
deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said, one result of better hospital security may be that people 
desperate enough to steal a baby will target private homes instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also encourages hospitals not to depend completely on the systems, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having wonderful high-tech systems is great," Nahirny said. "But it's just as 
important to have well-trained staff. No system is foolproof."

 An 18-year-old woman who ran from behind a bus into the path of a gas tanker 
died Sunday from her injuries, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandi Adams, who lived at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, died at 5:30 
p.m. at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, California Highway Patrol Officer 
Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said Adams got off an Orange County Transit Authority bus on C Street 
just west of 9th Street on the marine base about 1:15 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 She then ran into the street behind the bus and was struck by the gas tanker, 
which was moving eastbound on C at about 25 m.p.h. The driver, Dennis P. 
Sobanski, 41, of Long Beach, was not cited, Johnson said.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; SURFING MAGAZINE CELEBRATES 30 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the glossy office building, above the walls covered with cheerful graffiti 
("Stay Hardcore," "Skate, Surf, Snow"), the pace is what Nick Carroll would 
call "killer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an intense year for Carroll, 34, an Aussie surfer who became 
editor-in-chief of the San Clemente-based Surfing magazine less than a year 
ago. The magazine is celebrating its 30th anniversary, and one of California's 
biggest surfing events in years is just months away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next three months, Carroll has to produce three collector's editions 
and a special How-to-Surf-Better guide, as well as plug the U.S. Open of 
Surfing, an international professional tour de force in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The November issue will also include a 30-plus-page special insert dedicated 
to the U.S. Open of Surfing. The magazine is the official publication of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Open will be visiting the mainland for the first time in several years, 
giving locals a chance "to see the world's best surfers all at one event and at 
one time," said Bob Mignogna, publisher of Surfing. It takes place Aug. 3-7 in 
Huntington Beach, after the 13th Annual Op Pro Surfing Championship July 26-31. 
</P>
<P>
 It was great timing for Surfing's 30th anniversary to have the two-week surf 
open and the release of "Endless Summer II," the sequel to the classic surfing 
movie, in the same year. But it was just a coincidence, Mignogna said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Mignogna and the mag's staff, the events signify the upswing of surfing's 
popularity after a slump in the '80s. And of course, if the industry booms 
again -- as it did in the mid-'70s -- all the better for the magazine, said 
Mignogna, who has worked for the magazine for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, the magazine -- with a circulation of 100,000 -- has never 
lost any of its own enthusiasm for the sport, Mignogna said. "We invest more 
and more energy, time and dollars to make things happen for the professional 
sport," he said. "I believe it's part of our responsibility to assist the 
development of the (surfing) business." 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its 30th year, the magazine is looking ahead, though it has its share 
of nostalgia, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 He points to the How-to-Surf-Better guide, coming out in June, as an example. 
The collector's items look back on "30 Epic Photos" (March), "The 30 Best 
Things in Surfing" and "Five Great Tales" (August) and "The 30 Biggest Waves 
Ever Ridden" (November). 
</P>
<P>
 "My trip with surfing is that it's a sport full of energy, life -- it's today, 
now that counts," Carroll said. "It's not really about yesterday or what's old. 
Surfing is about a youthful attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 For Carroll, the mellowed-out Aussie surfer whose first story for Surfing in 
1979 described visiting the "jungle" of Southern California, his new job means 
there's less time to surf. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll grew up riding the waves of Sydney's beaches, where harsher waves 
produce a more powerful but less flexible style than in California. He turned 
pro as an adolescent, winning several championships, then worked for surfing 
and non-surfing publications before Surfing recruited him in 1990 full time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd take a break from surfing," he said, "but I was too addicted to 
it. Around 1990 . . . I said, 'Look, accept your lot in life.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Surfing will go on forever." 
</P>
<P>
 He could have been musing about either the sport or the magazine -- more 
likely, both.AILEEN CHO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TO CHILDREN, FREE SHOTS NO BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Darlene Tovar, 4, sat sniffling next to her mother a few minutes after 
receiving three shots Monday. Her face had been painted by a clown before the 
shots, but Darlene still wiped away tears. She nodded her head when her mother 
asked if it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 She was among children who received free inoculations from doctors at Chapman 
General Hospital's Pan American Clinic in Santa Ana. The vaccines were donated 
by the county's Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you only have one income, it's really nice to get them for free," said 
Darlene's mother, Yolanda Tovar. The Anaheim resident said her husband is a 
painter but she has no income-generating job. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic gave shots to protect children against diphtheria, whooping cough, 
tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella, polio and meningitis, Dr. Heidi A. Winkler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the vaccines were combined; a child got three shots at most, Winkler 
said, adding that the full course of vaccines would normally cost $75 at the 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although doctors had prepared to vaccinate up to 500 children, only about 40 
had arrived by the time the free session was half over, Winkler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although parents who came to the clinic at 1206 E. 17th St. were pleased about 
the free shots, their children were less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgina Venegas of Anaheim, who brought her twin girls for vaccines, had 
praise for the speed with which Alicia and Diana, 2, were treated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to wait in long line until my babies are attended to," Venegas said of 
the Anaheim clinic where her children receive care. "But here I was one of the 
first in line," and it was only minutes before her daughters got the two shots 
they needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseann Gonzalez, Hispanic community liaison for Chapman General, said that 
fewer than half the county's children are properly immunized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lack of knowledge in the community about the vaccinations," 
she said. About 300 children are seen at the clinic each month, Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman dressed as the popular television character Barney mingled with the 
youngsters to cheer them up after their shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're healthy, you feel good," proclaimed the purple dinosaur as she 
hugged children and shook their hands. WILLSON CUMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PASTRY MAKERS SWEETEN TRIP OF JAPANESE COOKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After trimming a white layer cake with borders of matching white frosting, 
Oxnard College student Mike Lodi announced to his audience of Japanese visitors 
that he would now add a scroll-like design. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly the Japanese tour guide who was translating Lodi's presentation 
Tuesday at Oxnard College stopped talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabbing his Japanese-English dictionary, the guide hurriedly opened to the 
section listing English words and searched for an unfamiliar term: "scroll." He 
found it and then promptly continued his narration. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such language barriers, the Oxnard College students who gave the 
pastry-making demonstration said they believe their Japanese audience followed 
most of what they were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may not understand your words," said Coral Elandt, a student in the 
college's Hotel and Restaurant Management program. "But when you show them 
something with your hands, they understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Japanese students who were in the audience are not new to baking. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all cooking-school majors at Kokusai Business College outside Tokyo, 
part of a group of 200 Kokusai students who have been visiting the Oxnard area 
since Friday. Kokusai is a sister school of Oxnard College. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the Kokusai students said they are unfamiliar with American-style 
culinary arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kouichi Koyama said he had never before seen "a square cake" such as the 
rectangular pan cake that Lodi decorated. In Japan, he said, cakes are usually 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 And Yuiko Usui, 17, said she noticed that Americans make French-style pastries 
with more sugar and less salt than the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jet lag," said Yuiko, explaining why some of her classmates had let their 
heads droop to their chests and others had slouched low in their seats. It was, 
after all, 2:30 a.m. Tokyo time, even though it was 10:30 a.m. in Oxnard. MAIA

<P>
 Home and business owners who suffered damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake have an 
extra 60 days to apply for disaster assistance, federal and state officials 
have announced. 
</P>
<P>
 With agencies receiving more than 1,600 assistance applications daily, the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency and Governor's Office of Emergency Services 
decided to extend their filing deadlines until July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The new date also applies to the Small Business Administration's disaster loan 
program, but the agency's economic injury loan program will still operate on an 
Oct. 17 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 550,761 people have applied for assistance since the Northridge 
quake, which caused billions of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has already given out $782.7 million for disaster housing, and the Small 
Business Administration has provided $1.4 billion in loans. A state grant 
program has given $27.7 million to families and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 To register with FEMA, people should go to the Earthquake Service Center in 
Simi Valley or Fillmore in Ventura County. Or they may register by phone by 
calling (800) 462-9029. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MORATORIUM WEIGHED FOR ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about a possible influx of adult-oriented businesses, Camarillo 
council members on Wednesday( will consider adopting a 45-day moratorium on 
processing permits for adult businesses, pending a legal review of the city's 
current ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Boden, the city's director of planning and community development, said 
staff raised the issue after several individuals recently inquired about city 
rules concerning adult bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's current ordinance, adopted in 1978, permits the news rack sale of 
adult-oriented publications and the operation of adult-oriented businesses with 
a council-granted permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Both adult-oriented news racks and businesses must be located at least 500 
feet from any residential zone or any holder of a license to sell alcoholic 
beverages. They must also be 1,000 feet from any church, school or other 
previously established adult-oriented business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Boden said the moratorium will give the city time to study how it can 
strengthen the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose said he will vote for the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe these businesses have a place in Camarillo and I am in 
support of doing what we have to do, short of violating any constitutional 
protections, to prevent them from operating here," Gose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's proposed moratorium comes on the heels of similar actions in Santa 
Paula and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 16, the Santa Paula City Council adopted a 45-day urgency ordinance to 
allow its city attorney time to draft a tougher anti-adult business ordinance. 
That same day, the Ventura City Council approved an ordinance that bans 
adult-oriented businesses except in industrial sections. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo City Council will consider the issue Wednesday at 5 p.m. at City 
Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J.E. MITCHELL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; 6 INJURED IN WRECK INVOLVING SCHOOL VAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Six people, including an elementary school student, were injured Monday 
afternoon when a car apparently ran a red light at a busy intersection and hit 
two other vehicles before slamming head-on into a school van, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries were all described as moderate to minor by Officer Bruce Lian of 
the California Highway Patrol. Witnesses said the school van's only passenger, 
a Viejo Elementary School student, suffered a bloody nose and the van driver 
had a neck injury and was taken to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 3 p.m. when a Cadillac traveling southbound on 
Moulton Parkway ran a red light and struck a Honda traveling eastbound on 
Laguna Hills Drive, Lian said. The impact spun the Honda around and sent the 
Cadillac careening off of a pickup truck and into the school van., Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision pushed the van back about 30 feet into another car waiting 
behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Cadillac) just shot up in the air and hit the bus," said Jason Hayes, 
23, of Huntington Beach, who was parked in front of the van in his pickup. "The 
wheels just kept on spinning after he hit the bus. He must have still had his 
foot on the accelerator." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Keil was in his car next to Hayes' truck when the accident occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the guy coming but I had no place to go," said Keil, 30, of Laguna 
Hills. "All I could do is just hope for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 The impact knocked Hayes' truck into Keil's car. In all, five cars and the van 
were involved in the accident, Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could have been a lot worse with the school van and all the cars 
involved," Lian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured included two people in the van, three in the Cadillac, and one in 
the Honda. No identifications were immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident, which remains under investigation, was the second in recent 
weeks involving a Capistrano Unified School District vehicle. On April 22, a 
student was killed in Laguna Niguel when he was hit by a truck after getting 
off a district bus.LEN HALL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SUSPECT BELIEVES HE IS JESUS, LAWYER SAYS 
</P>

<P>
 A former oil-field worker who is charged with kidnaping a Ventura auto 
salesman during a test drive and later leading police on a chase to Universal 
City believes he is Jesus and cannot help in his own criminal defense, a public 
defender said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson entered pleas of not guilty in 
Ventura County Municipal Court during an arraignment for defendant Daryl Lynn 
Simpson, 32, who is charged with kidnaping and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Steven Hintz ordered a hearing today to determine if a 
psychologist should be appointed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants are considered incompetent if schizophrenia or other mental 
problems leave them incapable of assisting in their own defense, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Simpson was test-driving a black, $27,000 Camaro Z-28 from Paradise 
Chevrolet on Victoria Avenue when he told salesman Russell Phelps that he was 
God and wanted to go to radio station KLOS in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove south on the Ventura Freeway to the San Fernando Valley, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps escaped in Encino when Simpson exited the freeway to make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police spotted the car in Van Nuys, triggering a chase in which 
speeds reached 90 m.p.h. Simpson was finally arrested when the car's tire 
flattened after he exited the freeway and struck a curb on a dead-end street in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipson said family members first began noticing Simpson's mental problems 
about eight months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, Simpson appeared to be living a normal life, Lipson said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a girlfriend and held various jobs doing oil-field work, the lawyer 
said. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 A 25-year-old man pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in connection with 
the Mother's Day slaying of an Oxnard woman who was his former girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Michael Rose, who neighbors say moved to Oxnard just several weeks before 
the May 8 shooting, faces one count of murder with use of a firearm.He is being 
held at Ventura County Jail in lieu of a $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily nor Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald 
C. Glynn could be immediately reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say that Rose shot 31-year-old Victoria Ramey in her La Canada Avenue 
home about 9:30 p.m. He called police to the scene after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of the victim say Rose moved to the area from Indiana and was staying 
with Ramey until he could find a job. Ramey, who neighbors said liked to help 
people, had been engaged to the defendant several years ago, friends said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER WATER RATE INCREASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City residents may notice a $2 hike in their monthly water bill beginning this 
summer, according to the city manager's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2 hike represents a 7% overall increase in water rates for the average 
Newport Beach customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The city buys its water from the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California, which, in turn, imports the water from the Colorado River and 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The MWD also establishes the cost of water, which is passed on to local water 
districts, then to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, water rates were increased by 13% and last year went up another 
20%, according to City Manager Kevin J. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach residences use an average of about 10,000 gallons of water per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the city may begin charging an extra 50 cents on a 
resident's monthly sewer charge. That increase will be used to help pay for 
upgrades in an aging sewer pump system. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider both rate hikes at its June 13 meeting at City 
Hall.BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; $20 MILLION IN COCAINE SEIZED, 18 ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities seized 249 pounds of cocaine and $2.3 million in cash and arrested 
18 people following an eight-month investigation by a regional task force, the 
Orange County Sheriff's Department said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested include Samuel Moreno, 46, identified by the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department as a "high-level narcotics trafficker" and the "kingpin" 
of a drug operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug ring, code-named throughout the investigation as "Telemundo," 
operated mainly in Southern California but reached areas throughout the United 
States, according to a statement from the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities did not say when or where the narcotics were seized, but the 
statement said they had a street value of $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The ring trafficked with narcotics and laundered the transactions' money, 
officials said. Task force investigators used wiretaps extensively to close in 
on the ring, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those arrested are 11 Colombians, two of them naturalized U.S. citizens, 
six Mexican nationals and one American citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force includes the Orange County Regional Narcotics Suppression 
Program, the Los Angeles district attorney, the Inland Regional Narcotics 
Enforcement Team, Los Angeles Impact, Southeast Cities Against Narcotics, and 
the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. FERNANDO ROMERO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OCTA POSTPONES DIAL-A-RIDE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority decided Monday to postpone a vote 
on the future of the Dial-a-Ride program until June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation agency is considering discontinuing the same-day taxi 
service for seniors to free up funds for a disabled riders' program. 
</P>
<P>
 Elderly Dial-a-Ride users swamped an OCTA meeting earlier this month, 
requesting that the board not pit senior citizens against disabled riders. 
</P>
<P>
 "The postponement will give (the board) an opportunity to incorporate the 
public input we have received and respond to that public comment," said Elaine 
Beno, an OCTA spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Beno said the League of California Cities had asked OCTA to postpone its 
decision. The agency said it is facing a slim budget at the same time the 1990 
Americans With Disabilities Act requires it to make it easier for disabled 
people to use mass transit. The act did not earmark federal funds to help the 
agencies meet the mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has suggested phasing out Dial-a-Ride for individuals by Sept. 11, while 
leaving it intact for groups. The money saved would be used to expand ACCESS, 
the program for disabled riders.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; TRUSTEES TO CONSIDER STATUS OF CLAS TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a school board meeting tonight, Santa Ana Unified trustees will consider 
withholding the standardized tests students took earlier this month from the 
state and requiring parental permission before students take the controversial 
tests in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Chaffee, a trustee who has strongly opposed the California Learning 
Assessment System test since it was introduced, suggested the idea of 
withholding the results as a form of protest against the exam, which has been a 
subject of growing criticism statewide. Chaffee previously led a move to allow 
Santa Ana parents to exempt their children from the CLAS exam, which the board 
passed 5 to 0; 122 district children formally opted out of the test this 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to withhold the tests would apply to those taken this spring, while 
the parental permission would be required for future CLAS exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this would be a very strong message to the state," Chaffee said of 
withholding the tests. "Listening to the parents that have been calling me, I 
see that major problems and the major complaints, and I see that I didn't go 
far enough (with the opt-out provision). I want to take it the next step 
further to show the state that parents are tired of these things going on in 
our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffee has dim hopes for the proposal to withhold the tests but is more 
confident about the plan to require parental permission. Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District adopted a similar measure several weeks ago, and as a result 
only about one-fifth of that district's eligible students took the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAS is a performance-based assessment program that tests fourth-, fifth-, 
eighth- and 10th-graders in reading, writing, math, social studies and science. 
More than 1 million students in some 7,000 schools statewide were scheduled to 
take the exams this spring at a cost of $26 million, but mounting protests from 
conservative religious groups have led thousands of parents across the state to 
exempt their children from the tests. JODI WILGOREN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; OFFICER'S WORK WITH YOUTHS RECOGNIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her third year of teaching the city's drug abuse education program to local 
youths, Police Officer Robin Sells hopes she has made a difference in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope you instill that there's always hope . . . that drugs and gangs 
aren't the answer," Sells said. 
</P>
<P>
 That dedication inspired her peers to name Sells, 38, the department's Officer 
of the Year for her work in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you become a police officer, you think you can change the world," said 
Sells, who began her career with the Buena Park Police Department eight years 
ago and has been a patrol officer and a burglary detective. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sells said that when one becomes a DARE -- Drug Abuse Resistance Education 
-- officer, "you feel you can make a difference. You're looked up to as a role 
model, and there's a good feeling. There's nothing that can compare in police 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 She was recognized for her efforts in teaching the DARE program to children in 
local schools and for her outstanding effort in working with youths in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's neat when the schools give recognition," said Sells, a mother of one 
daughter and two stepdaughters. "But when you get it from your peers, it makes 
you feel like they respect the job that you've done." 
</P>
<P>
 Sells, who worked as a police dispatcher before becoming an officer, said that 
through the DARE program she is able to show "that police officers are human 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Richard M. Tefank said that Sells' enthusiasm and initiative 
stand out among her fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recognition by her peers is reflective of the quality of work that she 
does," Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the fourth annual Police Recognition Luncheon last week, sponsored by the 
Buena Park Chamber of Commerce, 25 other officers were commended for their work 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One civilian employee was given special notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Myra (Myke) Spiegel, a records clerk with the department for the past four 
years, was given an award as non-sworn employee of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was recognized for her day-to-day hard work and her enthusiasm for 
assisting officers in processing police reports," Tefank said 
</P>
<P>
 The award for reserve officer of the year went to Larry Ungles, who donated 
more than 500 hours to the department last year. Reserve officers are required 
to volunteer at least 20 hours a month to the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ungles, a reserve officer for 10 years, has become an experienced traffic 
investigator whose expertise has been a plus for the department, Tefank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The luncheon was dedicated to Kenneth B. Jones, a retired police sergeant and 
former City Council member and mayor, for his 41 years of public service. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; COUNCIL TO REVIEW RELOCATION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will review a plan calling for the owner of a 23-acre 
mobile home park to pay for relocating tenants and will consider strengthening 
a recent campaign-reform ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Campanula Properties Inc., owners of the Orange Tree Mobile Home Park next to 
The Pond of Anaheim, wants to close the 236-space park and possibly replace it 
with a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner John Stanaland has said rising vacancy rates, traffic problems and the 
25-year-old park's deteriorating condition led to the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will examine a May 2 Planning Commission directive that Campanula 
Properties pay up to $10,000 per tenant in relocation costs for scores of 
mobile home owners still living in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The company originally had offered to waive $5,000 in rent to tenants if they 
left the park by Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Campanula Properties has until tonight to appeal the Planning Commission's 
action to the City Council. If an appeal is made, the council may set a date 
for a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the council is not expected to take action. Stanaland was not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider adding two provisions to a campaign-reform ordinance 
that went into effect in July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Political activists Shirley Grindle and Alexander Carrassi II urged the 
council to toughen the ordinance by requiring officials to report more 
thoroughly on campaign contributions and payment of campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city attorney rejected a third suggestion by the activists, 
saying it would probably violate the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Grindle and Carrassi want the ordinance to prohibit candidates for Anaheim 
office from using campaign funds raised while seeking an office outside 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the pair argued in a letter to the council, candidates who could 
transfer funds would have an "unfair advantage" against local candidates "who 
would be raising all of their funds under the more restrictive Anaheim 
ordinance." 
</P>
<P>
 But City Atty. Jack White said such a prohibition might be ruled 
unconstitutional since it limits spending of campaign funds after the money has 
been contributed.MARTIN MILLER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; THE 'SQUIRREL LADY' MOVES TO FILLMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kathleen Adams, the self-proclaimed "squirrel lady" who angered a neighbor by 
feeding the rodents in her back yard, has moved from Thousand Oaks even though 
a judge tossed out a lawsuit against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy and Nancy Hecht had filed a suit accusing Adams of creating a 
neighborhood squirrel infestation by feeding the animals in her hillside back 
yard.But Superior Court Judge John Hunter recently ruled that the suit was 
unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the victory, Adams last week opted to move out of her home of 
nearly 14 years, citing the stress and discomfort of the neighborhood dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had just gotten to be too much," Adams said. "I couldn't even go into my 
back yard anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hechts' attorney, Leigh Datzker, said his clients were happy with the 
outcome of their two-year legal battle. "Mrs. Adams moved out, so we've 
dismissed the case," Datzker said. "We could have pursued it further, but now 
there's no need." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hechts had argued that squirrels lured into the area by Adams ravaged 
their lawn, fence and roof, causing $12,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adams contended that squirrels are native to the area, and said her 
feedings did not prompt the fuzzy-tailed rodents' frequent visits to her yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties complained of verbal harassment stemming from the dispute, and 
said they argued even after the Hechts took legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 Those encounters, Adams said, led to her move last week to Fillmore. She said 
she would miss the hillside neighborhood near Wildwood Park.

 "A lot of my friends are there and I loved the area," she said. "But the worst 
part is that there are no tree squirrels in my new place. I'll miss them the 
most." MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER FREE LIBRARY 
ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members tonight will consider granting non-residents 
three months of free library access to make up for the main branch's prolonged 
post-earthquake closure. 
</P>
<P>
 While Thousand Oaks residents can use both the main library and the Newbury 
Park branch for free, out-of-city readers must pay $55 a year.Several 
cardholders have called the city to complain that they lost three months of 
access when the main library closed for repairs to the ceiling, carpet and 
children's reading room. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park branch remained open, with extended hours, while the main 
library was dark. But much of the main library's reference material remained 
inaccessible to researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 To give non-residents a full year's worth of service, Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
has suggested extending each cardholder's renewal date by three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a good gesture," Lazar said. "We recognize that people who paid 
for their library cards deserve a full year's use out of them." STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BANK ROBBERY DONE QUIETLY; FEW NOTICE

<P>
 Using a maroon-colored folder and silver handgun, a bank robber strolled into 
a Thousand Oaks bank on Monday and performed a robbery so quietly that other 
customers and bank employees did not notice the crime until after he had left, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:30 p.m., a man approached a teller at the Long Beach Bank on West 
Hillcrest Drive and opened his folder, which had a demand note taped to 
it.Beside the folder, the robber held a silver handgun, FBI Special Agent Larry 
Dick said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber didn't say a word to the teller, who gave him the money without 
resistance, Dick said. The robber then walked out of the bank and fled. The 
amount of money the robber made off with was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was done very quietly," Dick said. "There were about five people in the 
bank, and only two people knew that there had been a robbery -- the teller and 
another bank employee who happened to be near her." PEGGY Y. LEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; FATAL CRASH INVOLVING DEPUTY 
INVESTIGATED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic officers on Monday were investigating a fatal crash involving a 
Ventura County sheriff's deputy that claimed the life of a Thousand Oaks man 
over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Eduardo Melendez Martinez, 25, was thrown from his car and killed when 
his car was broadsided by a sheriff's cruiser driven by Deputy Brad Guzzard. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzzard had been driving the 1991 Ford Crown Victoria cruiser along Westlake 
Boulevard at 2:45 a.m. Sunday when Martinez drove across the road and into his 
path, said Lt. Mike Brown, who is investigating the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Guzzard suffered back and neck sprains in the crash, and will be off duty for 
at least five days, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez and two of his passengers, who suffered minor injuries, apparently 
were not wearing seat belts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A witness who saw the crash said the officer was approaching a green light, 
and (Martinez's) car came out from the right-hand side and practically drove in 
front of the unit," Brown said. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY SEEKS TO ANNEX GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the request of homeowners, the Calabasas City Council has proposed annexing 
a gated community that abuts land slated for the massive Ahmanson Ranch project 
in Ventura County's Simi Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexing the 825-acre Mountain View Estates would give Calabasas control over 
a larger section of the Los Angeles County portion of Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
-- a proposed access to Ahmanson Ranch -- but would not block plans for the 
mini-city, said Calabasas Planning Director Steve Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas must get permission to annex the land from the Los Angeles County 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees boundary changes. Calabasas 
sent its application to the commission this month, Harris said, but the review 
process often takes as long as a year.  
</P>
<P>
 The application was filed after 49 residents of the area north of the Ventura 
Freeway between the city line and Crummer Canyon Road petitioned Calabasas 
officials, saying they wanted to enjoy the benefits of living in the city. The 
area includes Gates Canyon Park. KURT PITZER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; PLAN WOULD BEAUTIFY FLOOD CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who live near Imperial Highway may soon see fencing and beautification 
work along a portion of the county flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The channel, on the south side of Imperial Highway, has been an eyesore to 
residents since 1991 when the county began construction of a flood control 
waterway. 
</P>
<P>
 To correct the problem and lessen the noise spilling into adjoining 
neighborhoods from Imperial Highway, La Habra City Council members recently 
approved a county plan to build a sidewalk, a block and chain-link fence and 
shrubbery along the channel from Euclid Street to Lakeview Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will cost the county about $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans must approve the work, which is next to a state road, before it can 
begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Alonso, of the county Environmental Management Agency, said he 
expects approval within a month and construction to begin in July and be done 
by October. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Lee Risner said the city is pleased with the plan, as are the 
residents of the Landmark and Classic homes neighborhoods, which adjoin the 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed four-foot-wide sidewalk will meander along the channel, and vines 
will be planted to cover the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the channel) is going to look more like a linear park," Alonso said. 
"When the project is complete, it will beautify the area and block out some 
noise, that's for sure." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; 2 SCHOOLS TO RECEIVE EXCELLENCE AWARDS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A.G. Currie Middle School and Foothill High School in the Tustin Unified 
School District have been selected to be among this year's winners of the 
California Distinguished School award. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners were picked based on their school programs, the teaching and learning 
environment, and parent and community support.A team from the California 
Department of Education, which sponsors the annual competition, visited the 
schools earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen other Orange County schools won the award. They will be honored at an 
awards ceremony Friday at the Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara. 
Each winning school will get a plaque and a Distinguished California School 
flag. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 180 middle and high schools throughout the state competed for the 
awards, which became an annual event in 1985 to encourage improvement of 
California schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been striving to become a model multicultural school," said A.G. Currie 
Principal Dan Brooks. "We're thrilled to receive this award." 
</P>
<P>
 The school was commended for such programs as Spanish information hot line, 
Bilingual Community Service Club, international fairs, parenting and adult 
English classes and partnerships with local businesses. The school has 1,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill High School, located in an affluent area of North Tustin, was 
recognized for high student achievement. About 40% of the school's 1,500 
students are on the honor roll and 80% are involved in school activities. Its 
dropout rate is less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 About 93% of Foothill students attend college after graduation. The school's 
academic decathlon team placed among the top three 20 times in county and state 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to prepare students to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing 
world," said Foothill Principal Janis Jones, "while maintaining our tradition 
of excellence in academics, arts and athletics."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; $761,000 IN FEDERAL GRANTS ALLOCATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly $761,000 in federal grant money has been earmarked for local community 
programs next year. The City Council recently allocated Community Development 
Block Grant money for programs such as housing and mobile home rehabilitation, 
neighborhood revitalization and code enforcement activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Perea, planning services manager, said the city is expected to receive 
$389,000 in federal grant money for 1994-95 and will carry over $371,934 left 
from the 1993-94 budget. Some of the carry-over money includes $225,000 the 
city received from the sale of property for an affordable housing project, 
Perea said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, $74,150 for the construction of a Boys & Girls Club facility at 
Mile Square Regional Park will be carried over, he said. Because of unexpected 
increases in construction costs and the need to raise more money, the club 
project has been on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the programs being funded, $58,350 has been set aside for public service 
programs such as those for the homeless, abused children and runaway youth. 
</P>
<P>
 About $70,000 will be spent on administrative costs, which include personnel 
and operating expenses to manage and coordinate the federal grant program. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also designated $7,968 for the city to contract with the Fair 
Housing Council of Orange County. Fair housing services will include mediation 
and resolution of housing discrimination disputes as well as technical 
assistance and training opportunities to housing industry professionals, such 
as real estate agents and apartment managers and owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In efforts to spruce up low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, $42,372 was 
appropriated for a code enforcement program.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; MOBILE HOME PLAN GOING TO CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly a year of delay, a proposed ordinance designed to regulate the 
conversion of mobile home parks to other uses finally will go before the City 
Council today. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal has the support of mobile home park residents, but mobile home 
park owners have described it as unfair and have indicated they may challenge 
it in court if adopted by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It borders on taking property without just compensation," said Norm McAdoo, 
part owner of Villa Magnolia and Kensington Garden mobile home parks. "It may 
not stand a legal test." 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of the city's 18 mobile home parks said the ordinance would 
provide them with better protection if the park closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, for example, would require the owner to find space in a 
"comparable park" within 35 miles. In addition, the park owner would have to 
pay for all relocation costs, including a daily allowance of $145 per adult and 
$40 per child for each day a family must stay in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mobile home can't be relocated, the park owner is required to buy the 
mobile unit, including accessories, at a negotiated price. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicky Talley, who works for an association of county mobile home park owners, 
said under the ordinance park owners may have to pay up to $30,000 for every 
mobile home that would be relocated. The average relocation cost is about 
$5,000 under state law, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ethel Hirsch, one of the leaders of a group of mobile home park residents, 
said that without assistance many of the residents would end up homeless. She 
said that elderly people, who make up a majority of the 5,000 residents of the 
city's 18 mobile home parks, are particularly vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission voted early this month to recommend the adoption of 
the ordinance.BERT ELJERA

SOCIALITE CONVICTED IN SCAM BEGINS 16-MONTH SENTENCE; CRIME: LAWYER SAYS SUSIE 
AMASH HERNANDEZ REPORTED TO A FEDERAL CAMP IN PHOENIX. HER HUSBAND IS ALREADY 
SERVING SIX YEARS. 
</P>

<P>
 Susie Amash Hernandez, the once-wealthy Orange County socialite convicted with 
her husband of a precious metals scam, reported to the women's Federal Prison 
Camp in Phoenix on Monday to start her 16-month sentence, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's husband, Danny Hernandez, 41, who authorities said masterminded 
the scam, is serving a six-year sentence at the Boron Federal Prison Camp near 
Brawley, said Joan Politeo Freeman, a deputy federal public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman, who defended Susie Hernandez at the couple's trial, said the Phoenix 
prison is a minimum-security facility in which the inmates work in the 
commissary, the kitchen, the laundry and at other jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 2, Susie Hernandez, who had pleaded guilty to counts of tax evasion, 
asked the court to delay the start of her surrender from Monday to June 20, 
saying she needed more time to arrange for the care of her children, ages 7 and 
5. An Orange County Superior Court judge denied the request. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, Freeman said, will be taken care of by family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Hernandez, 42, who could be released in a year with good behavior, plans 
to return to Orange County, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wants to settle back down here; she's happy here," Freeman said. "She has 
friends who are very supportive of her." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez "knows that she can't live her life the way she has in the past 
and that when she gets out, she will start her life all over again," Freeman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before their arrest in February, 1993, the Hernandezes drove Rolls Royces and 
Mercedes-Benzes, lived in expensive homes in Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel 
and vacationed in Paris and Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 They were known as philanthropists, donating thousands of dollars to Orange 
County charities, and socialites, throwing lavish parties at their two homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But their fortune, valued at the time at $9 million, was ill-gotten, 
authorities said. Danny Hernandez earned less than $60,000 a year working for 
PGP Industries of Santa Fe Springs, a precious metals dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, an unidentified person tipped off the Internal 
Revenue Service about the discrepancy between what Danny Hernandez earned and 
the couple's lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS found that the couple had reported only $410,000 from 1985 to 1990, at 
a time when millions of dollars went through their bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 Government investigators found that during the 11 years that Danny Hernandez 
had worked at PGP Industries, he had transferred precious metals between 
company clients, arranged for PGP to buy the transferred metals, then asked PGP 
to pay for the transaction by check or wire to the customers' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the accounts were controlled by Susie Hernandez, who would then 
siphon the money and put it in the couple's own account, government officials 
said at the time of the couple's trial.

IRVINE WOMAN VOWS TO FIGHT EXTRADITION IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Irvine woman who has been charged with murder in the death of her adopted 
baby daughter in Illinois 18 years ago will fight extradition from California, 
her lawyer said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief court hearing, lawyer Keith Ross of Santa Ana said Victoria Neal 
does not want to give up her right to an extradition hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, described by police as a 44-year-old interior designer, was arrested at 
her Irvine home on Thursday on the strength of Illinois indictments charging 
her with murder in the death of 1-year-old Danielle Christine Neal, who died in 
a hospital in Peoria, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in Tazewell County, Ill., said Neal told an Orange County social 
worker last year that she was responsible for the baby's death on Sept 2, 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Monday, Ross denied the allegations, saying Neal was "going through a 
very difficult time." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Ross said: "Eighteen years ago, a child died in a 
tragic accident. There was a full investigation and death was found to be 
accidental. It is an election year in Illinois and one has to wonder why this 
has been brought up" again. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Neal was being held in County Jail. Bail was set at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross asked Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner to permit Neal's 14-year-old 
daughter, Tressa, to visit her mother in jail. The judge said he would consider 
the request and rule later. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenner also transferred the matter to Municipal Court for a hearing related 
to her extradition today.

VENTURA LOOKS OUTSIDE FOR INTERIM CITY MANAGER

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its city manager leaving July 1, Ventura will look outside City Hall for 
an interim administrator to serve in the top post until the City Council picks 
a permanent replacement, Councilman Jack Tingstrom said Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, council members said they would ask Ventura's four department heads 
about standing in as temporary city manager.However, Police Chief Richard 
Thomas and Public Works Director Ron Calkins said they did not want the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Adelman, the city's director of management resources, and Community 
Service Director Everett Millais both turned down the opportunity when they 
learned they would not be eligible to compete for the position of permanent 
city manager if they assumed the job in the short term, Tingstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have said they do not want the person who serves as interim 
city manager to apply for the permanent position, because it would appear to 
other hopefuls that a favorite was already in place, discouraging applicants 
from outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles-based firm has been hired to look for a permanent replacement 
for City Manager John Baker, who announced his retirement last month. CONSTANCE

RULING CLEARS WAY TO BUILD YOUTH CLUB; SIMI VALLEY: STATE SUPREME COURT 
DECLINES TO HEAR LAWSUIT SEEKING TO HALT CONSTRUCTION OF FACILITY. 
</P>

<P>
 The state Supreme Court has declined to hear a lawsuit filed by a Simi Valley 
businessman who had sought to halt construction of a Boys & Girls Club in the 
city, clearing the way for the $3.2-million project to be built. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they learned Monday that the court last Wednesday denied a 
petition for review filed by CPC Enterprises, owner of the Park Plaza office 
complex adjacent to the proposed site. 
</P>
<P>
 Developer Lloyd Green, managing partner in CPC Enterprises, and his son, 
attorney Matt Green, have objected to the site behind Park Plaza, on Alamo 
Street and Lemon Drive at Rancho Tapo Community Park. They say the clubhouse 
would block their tenants' views of mountains from the office complex windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a victory for the youth of our community," Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton said in a prepared statement at Monday's City Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court's action follows a March 1 decision by the state Court of 
Appeal, which sided with Simi Valley in ruling that the city acted properly in 
approving the project without a full environmental review. A Ventura County 
Superior Court commissioner had earlier rejected the request for an 
environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council in April, 1992, voted unanimously to approve the project 
despite protests from the Greens, who wanted an environmental review addressing 
the mountain view issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greens could not be reached for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has delayed construction of the facility for at least a year. When it 
was first approved, officials had hoped to open the club in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials have said the facility is desperately needed to provide 
a place for the growing number of teen-agers in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25,000-square-foot clubhouse will include a gymnasium with basketball 
courts, a weightlifting room, a learning center, an arts and crafts room and a 
photography lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club, which has 2,000 members, now rents space at a former 
school. PEGGY Y. LEE

CONROY TO ANNOUNCE PADDLING BILL PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) plans to announce this morning in 
Sacramento whether he will introduce a bill to require paddling of juvenile 
graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a cue from the celebrated Singapore case in which an American youth was 
caned for spraying paint on cars, Conroy suggested earlier this month that 
corporal punishment would be a potential cure for the plague of tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative colleagues and legal experts scoffed at the idea, but Conroy's 
staff continued to draft the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aide Chris Manson would not say Monday whether Conroy will, in fact, introduce 
a paddling bill, but Conroy is scheduled to announce his decision in the 
governor's press office at 10:30 a.m. today.

MAJOR CRIME RATE UP 8% ON UC IRVINE CAMPUS; VIOLENCE: STATISTICS WERE LOWER FOR 
THE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM AS A WHOLE OVER THE PREVIOUS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Major crime increased 8% at the UC Irvine campus in 1993 over the previous 
year, while the rate was lower for the state's university system as a whole, 
according to University of California police. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the increase from 651 cases to 706 cases was a significant rise 
in property crimes, such as burglary and theft. However, violent crime at UCI 
dipped slightly, from 14 to 13 incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI still ranked fourth in violent crime among nine UC campuses, behind UCLA, 
UC Berkeley and UC Riverside.  
</P>
<P>
 The UCI Medical Center, which is located off campus, had 27% fewer major 
crimes in 1993 compared to 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 Major crimes are classified as homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, 
burglary, theft and arson. 
</P>
<P>
 For violent crime, UCI compared favorably to the rest of the UC system, which 
overall had a 24% jump in violent crime -- from 162 to 200 cases -- from 1992 
to 1993. More than a quarter of those crimes -- 65 incidents -- occurred at 
UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 Some authorities cautioned against drawing conclusions from the statistical 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with very small numbers (of crimes) to begin with," said John 
A. Anderson, UC San Diego police chief and coordinator of UC system's Police 
Services. "So, the percentage increases look much larger than they would be in 
a large municipality." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, theft led the list of most common crimes, according to the report 
issued by university police. Statistics indicate that about 150 bicycles were 
reported stolen from the UCI campus in 1993, up 46% from the previous year. 
Statistics show that no bicycle theft cases were solved in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bike thefts have been problematic on campuses for several years," Anderson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI police started their first bike patrols last year. Five UCI police 
officers were trained at the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department in 
bike-assisted policing, and now use mountain bikes to move around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's proven itself in that we're able to access areas faster than we would on 
foot," UCI Assistant Police Chief Dennis Powers said. "It also touches on 
community-based policing because officers can meet people one-on-one." 
</P>
<P>
 Although bicycle theft was up at UCI, statistics show 4% fewer bicycles were 
stolen throughout the entire UC system. 
</P>
<P>
 But robbery jumped 25% and aggravated assaults grew 31% systemwide, and 
Anderson said assaults are often due to "pub fights, fights that break out at 
football games, and the like." 
</P>
<P>
 A challenge now facing UCI and UC San Diego, Anderson said, "is that these 
campuses have become much more urban and accessible. They used to be more 
remote, but now areas are becoming built up around them."

WITNESS TO FIGHTS DEFENDS MOM'S BITING OF TEEN-AGER; TRIAL: CHARLOTTE RUSSO'S 
SON-IN-LAW SAYS THE ACCUSED CHILD ABUSER ACTED IN SELF-DEFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Charlotte Russo bit her teen-age daughter on the arm twice in self-defense 
during a violent confrontation the day before she was arrested on child-abuse 
charges last May, Russo's son-in-law told a Ventura County Superior Court jury 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Darin Eugene McLeish -- the husband of Russo's oldest daughter, Teresa -- said 
he was reading a newspaper in the kitchen of the family's nine-bedroom home on 
May 23 when the girl confronted her 52-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, 15 at the time, swore at Russo and threatened to run away before 
challenging her physically, McLeish testified under direct examination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw (the girl) take three or four steps towards Mrs. Russo and hit her 
twice on the shoulder," said McLeish, who said the incident stunned him and 
left Russo in agony. "She screamed. She yelled out. Then I saw (the girl) grab 
Mrs. Russo's clothes around the collar." 
</P>
<P>
 Russo attempted to loosen the girl's grip from her collar and finally bit her 
when all else failed, testified McLeish, who said he raced over and separated 
the mother and daughter after they fell to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish was one of several family members who testified on behalf of the 
defendant Monday, as Russo's highly emotional trial on child-abuse charges 
stretched into its fifth week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination, Deputy Dist. Atty. Dee Corona noted that McLeish lived 
with the Russos from 1987 to 1989 while attending college and suggested his 
testimony was biased. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish acknowledged that Russo and her husband, Richard, also bought him a 
car and paid insurance on it while he was in school. But he said he paid rent 
while living in their home and paid back the money they spent for the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe them nothing," he declared. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish described the girl as being incorrigible and said she frequently lied, 
cheated and stole. The girl, he said, seemed to have set her own rules for 
living in the house, and ignored the wishes of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Charlotte Russo were arrested the day after the fight in the 
kitchen. The girl told investigators that the fight was only one of many times 
she was either bitten, punched, scratched or slapped by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 She also has testified that she was forced to live in a back-yard racquetball 
court off and on for a two-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo has denied physically abusing her daughter, but conceded that 
her husband ordered the girl to sleep in the racquetball court for two weeks 
last year for failing to complete her homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Russo -- a 50-year-old stockbroker -- pleaded guilty to misdemeanor 
child abuse and has served a 30-day jail term. He is also on three years 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Russo faces up to three years in state prison if convicted of the 
two charges against her -- felony and misdemeanor child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 During his testimony, McLeish described the Russo household as a loving but 
chaotic place. Yelling, he said, "was the standard way to get someone's 
attention" in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination from Corona, McLeish said the girl slept in the house 
and was not treated any differently from other family members during the two 
years he lived with the Russos. 
</P>
<P>
 He characterized the teen-ager as having "thinking errors." The phrase, he 
said, means that the girl could not distinguish right from wrong and that she 
would not change bad behavior even when someone would instruct her on the right 
way to do something. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that prior to the kitchen fight, he had not seen either of the 
Russos batter the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would it surprise you to know that your mother-in-law admitted to hitting 
(the girl) and leaving a bruise?" questioned Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I would not be taken aback by that," said McLeish, who said he believes 
corporal punishment is acceptable in certain instances. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish seemed ruffled when Corona accused him of lying to a process server 
who was trying to subpoena his wife before the trial. Attacking McLeish's 
credibility, Corona asked the witness about the day he refused to accept his 
wife's subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you tell the process server that you were your wife's cousin?" Corona 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall," McLeish answered, as several jurors broke out in laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, McLeish denied lying to the process server. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the kitchen fight, Corona asked McLeish why he waited until after his 
mother-in-law was arrested to tell other family members about what he allegedly 
witnessed. 
</P>
<P>
 McLeish, who has a degree in criminal justice, said he did not consider the 
incident "extremely important" at the time.

PROPOSED BUS PASS PROGRAM WOULD LINK CITIES; TRANSIT: THE PROGRAM IS PART OF A 
MAJOR EFFORT TO EXPAND LOCAL SERVICE. THE THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL IS SET TO 
DISCUSS THE ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to link Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley by public bus for the first time, 
the Thousand Oaks City Council tonight will consider offering residents a 
monthly transit pass good on bus routes throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The pass is part of a major expansion of local bus service that will provide 
four new bus lines to link cities across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission has already agreed to sell the 
regional transit passes offering unlimited trips on all county and city buses. 
</P>
<P>
 However, before the transportation commission can go ahead with the program, 
councils in each of the participating cities must approve the service, which is 
scheduled to begin July 5. Most major cities in the county have approved the 
bus service and pass program. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grant will pay most of the estimated $600,000 annual countywide cost 
of the service for the first two years. After that, cities would be responsible 
for paying for the service, called VISTA, or Ventura Intercity Service Transit 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of monthly passes would range from $31 for seniors to $50 for a 
standard adult pass. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, the pass would be good on local buses, including the shuttle 
to Moorpark's Metrolink station, Councilman Frank Schillo said. Residents could 
also use the pass to travel on VISTA buses elsewhere in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 And starting in July, pass-holders would enjoy unlimited use of a new east 
county and Conejo Valley VISTA bus linking Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Simi 
Valley, Westlake Village and Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are going to ride any kind of transportation regularly, they might 
be better off having a pass," said Schillo, who also sits on the transportation 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One VISTA line will replace Interconnect, a commuter bus service linking 
Thousand Oaks, Camarillo and Ventura. In addition, new routes will run to large 
area employers such as Camarillo State Hospital and the Navy base at Point 
Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 Introducing the pass will not affect Thousand Oaks coffers because the city 
will receive a share of revenues from the sale of countywide passes, according 
to city transportation analyst Roy Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar praised the plan, but said she is concerned that the 
city will be forced to continue the service after two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In theory, the idea of an interconnected system is great," Lazar said. "But I 
need to feel comfortable that we're not going to be required to continue this 
when the federal dollars run out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the transportation commission, has told 
city and county leaders that if the buses do not attract enough riders to meet 
federal fare box requirements, the commission can halt the service. Gherardi 
has estimated that daily ridership throughout the new system will average about 
600. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lazar said she wants to make sure that the city of Thousand Oaks can pull 
out if ridership falls short. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could run into problems if there is not sufficient ridership," Lazar said, 
"Without enough riders, this could be a very expensive system to operate."

BROKEN PROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The April 26 edition published an article headlined "Flynn, VanderKolk to 
Rescind Salary Cuts for Their Assistants." Within the article, it mentioned 
that these supervisors were submitting paperwork to reinstate the full salaries 
of their assistants. Furthermore, their executive aides could have their car 
allowances reinstated retroactively, and at that time, Flynn's secretary had 
already received approximately $1,200 in back car allowance, and that the 
requests from aides for Supervisors VanderKolk and Howard were about to be 
approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me! Are Flynn and VanderKolk not the very same supervisors who last 
year distributed to the news media (before sharing with their colleagues) a 
list of 15 absolutely Draconian reductions in salaries and benefits for all 
county employees as well as a host of other suggestions? Did not this list 
cause overwhelming anxiety and loss of morale and a great deal of upset for 
weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Board of Supervisors was going to accept a reduction similar to the one 
they were asking all other departments to take, five positions would be lost, 
or some other alternative had to be found. Didn't each member of all five 
staffs voluntarily agree to the reduction so that none of their colleagues had 
to go out the door? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we not just two months away from when next year's budget will be 
deliberated and adopted? 
</P>
<P>
 If all five offices agreed to this reduction, are we to infer from this newest 
development that only two members of the board are willing to stick to a 
commitment they have made to the public that elected them? And where are the 
kudos for Supervisors Lacey and Kildee who, along with their staffs, have 
restated their intent to honor that commitment? 
</P>
<P>
 To have three supervisors renege on their commitment a mere two months before 
budget hearings are scheduled is appalling. Maybe these salaries, hours and car 
allowances should be reinstated. I personally think so. However, it should be 
done in public view during budget hearings and no part of the reduction should 
be retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
 Those staff members going back on the deal ought to be ashamed of themselves 
and of their bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel pretty betrayed by my colleagues at this point. Knowing their staffs 
would now be the only ones subjected to the reduced salary and benefits must 
have made the decision by Supervisors Lacey and Kildee all the more difficult. 
I for one am very proud to be working for Supervisor Lacey.

 I am active in the ballot initiative to put into law the Ventura comprehensive 
plan that retains portions of present agricultural land which may at some 
future time be converted into parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1965 when my family and I were assigned to Ventura from Pisa, Italy, 
where I was an engineering consultant for two years, we experienced the immense 
growth of Ventura.In my former engineering assignments we had traveled and 
lived in parts of the United States, Europe and Asia and came to the conclusion 
that Ventura is the most beautiful and best suited area to settle our family. 
</P>
<P>
 A new majority of City Council members now appears intent on changing the 
character of our city by overturning our former City Council's comprehensive 
plan of retaining open space of farms, parks and orchards in favor of an 
asphalt jungle. Although there is already allocated over 4,000 new homes, 
developers Hertel and Jones (who, by the way, have excellent reputations for 
building quality homes) want to change the status of designated agriculture or 
park land because they hope the new majority in the City Council will approve. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel that although our mayor and City Council members are well intentioned 
and likable people who are trying to create jobs for our citizens in difficult 
economic circumstances, they are also destroying the environment and quality of 
life that made Ventura such a desirable place to live.

BAKER'S MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in response to the article you ran regarding the vacation benefits 
accrued by Ventura City Manager John Baker ("City Manager to Leave Job With 
Nearly $50,000"). I am outraged that you would run such a story.The implication 
was that somehow Mr. Baker was undeserving of these benefits. Mr. Baker is one 
of the finest city managers in all of California. One only has to look to 
Ventura's fiscal soundness to conclude that. It is near tragic proportions that 
he is leaving us. What was the point of your article? To manufacture scandal? 
To make unpleasant the final days of the career of a fine and dedicated public 
employee?  
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Lee Measures and James Monahan expressed outrage at Mr. Baker's accrued 
benefits. Are they suggesting that the next city manager be paid overtime 
instead of being granted vacation benefits? Mr. Baker could have doubled his 
annual salary if that had been the case. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be thanking Mr. Baker for not taking the vacation time to which he 
was surely entitled and probably needed and sticking with us during some really 
hard times. Maybe if someone would have insisted that he take more vacations, 
he wouldn't have to be leaving us now. 
</P>
<P>
 I am extremely concerned about the City Council's attitude. We need a quality 
person to guide our city while the City Council bickers away and accomplishes 
nothing. Quality people need to be compensated at the going rate. This includes 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be falling on our knees and begging Mr. Baker to stay rather than 
complaining about him not using his vacation time. People of Ventura, we're in 
a lot of trouble.

AHMANSON A BAD PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The irony of urban planner William Fulton ("Writer Pens Critiques of County 
Projects," May 16) listing Ventura County's Guidelines for Orderly Development 
as one of our county's best planning decisions and at the same time supporting 
a glaring breach of these guidelines indicates he is more urban than planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Justifying Ahmanson City, a massive encroachment into natural open space, 
because he believes it is inevitable defies the intent and contents of our 
guidelines and plans, which would allow only ranches on these lands. In fact, 
Ahmanson City will be an extension of Warner Center into Ventura County and is 
one of the worst planning decisions in Ventura County.

TRIM THE OLIVE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am one of the many unhappy residents of Varsity Street. You only have to 
drive down our street to see why.This year, we had an overabundance of olives 
due to the trees not being sprayed last year and the heavy rains we experienced 
last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 I have a big, ugly, loaded tree right outside my house. From November through 
April, huge overripe olives have rained down on my driveway, sidewalk (which is 
now solidly black) and street. 
</P>
<P>
 I have written to the Parks Department, personally spoken with (Councilman) 
Gary Tuttle and even the mayor, Tom Buford, to no avail. There "just isn't any 
money available" to trim the trees on Varsity Street until the year 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, while walking around the neighborhood, I notice the trees on Aurora 
(Drive) are all nicely trimmed, the trees on Princeton (Avenue) are all cut 
down, and the trees in Camino Real Park are all being trimmed, unnecessarily 
so, I believe; it just makes them look prettier. Meanwhile, the residents of 
Varsity are still living in "Olive Hell." You just can't imagine what it is 
like stepping in those big fat squashy olives. I know if a tree such as I 
describe were outside the home of Tom Buford, Gary Tuttle or any parks and 
recreation employee, the problem could be taken care of immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 I went door-to-door on Varsity and had most of the residents sign a petition 
requesting the mayor do something about our problem. Nothing was done. Imagine 
our chagrin when we read that the city now seems to have enough money to 
replace some trees downtown to improve the ambience, while the residents of 
Varsity slog through olive mush. 
</P>
<P>
 We are homeowners, taxpaying, hard-working citizens, and I think we deserve 
better.

DUMP A BAD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your article April 29, Moorpark council member Scott Montgomery said he 
found the protracted debate regarding the ill-conceived idea to establish a 
huge garbage dump in Weldon Canyon "a disturbing trend." 
</P>
<P>
 What I find disturbing is that Montgomery, chairman of the Ventura County 
Waste Commission, has endorsed a proposal that would benefit a single 
out-of-county corporation, at the cost of the health and economic well-being of 
the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
 By virtue of the size of this proposed monstrosity, garbage would have to be 
imported from throughout Southern California -- in part to bail out the failed 
projects already installed by the same corporation Montgomery supports. 
</P>
<P>
 And I have news for Montgomery: The garbage won't arrive by helicopter. It 
will travel in thousands of pollution-spewing garbage trucks. It will pass 
through his district and through most cities in Ventura County. In economic 
terms, a dump at Weldon Canyon would harm tourism, destroy the incentive for 
recycling and therefore threaten the tax base. It would make compliance with 
trash reduction laws virtually impossible, increase cancer rates and threaten 
water quality -- all of it solely for the benefit of this shady group of 
investors -- and, Mr. Montgomery hopes, for the advancement of his political 
career. But his divisive political opportunism apparently blinds him to such 
economic nuances.

 Don't go for the dump initiative. Forget the morality of passing the buck 
because you're scared and opting for a dangerous facility next to working-class 
people you might not like. Sure, it's right up there with cowardice and ethnic 
cleansing, but that's not the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is practical -- smarts. Interstate Commerce Commission rules won't 
allow any private dump to choose its customers. Are you dumb enough to support 
outside garbage interests and open up Ventura County as a super dump for half 
the state? 
</P>
<P>
 If the garbage industry's initiative passes, Ventura County will quickly 
become the dumping ground for Southern California and, soon after, for any 
county or state that wants to dump beyond its borders. Believe it.

SETTLER ALSO AFRICAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the April 10 article "Park District in a Squeeze," the reporter writes of 
the Pico family, who built the Simi Adobe, the oldest structure in Simi Valley. 
The article mentioned the family as "the first Spanish settlers in Simi 
Valley."  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't this the same Pico family as Pio Pico, California's governor from 1832 
to 1833 and again from 1845 to 1846, who was of African descent? It would be 
nice if the African ancestry of the family was mentioned along with the 
Spanish.

'MIND FILTH' NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pornographic news racks will never appear in Simi Valley again due to the 
signing of AB 17 by Gov. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, I participated in an effort to stop pornographic news racks in 
Simi Valley, which proliferated around town like a cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hundred people went to the City Council, the city acted to get 
rid of these news racks. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of years later, summer of 1992, some news racks came back, and again 
we organized to get rid of them. And we did. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight is now over. There is absolutely no reason for Simi Valley, Moorpark 
or any other city to have a pornographic news rack in their city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, thanks to AB 17, our city attorney will be able to prosecute the 
violators. Finally, pornography will not be on our street corners, and the 
citizens of Simi Valley and the state of California have themselves and their 
tireless work to thank for this. Congratulations to the people of our community 
for getting rid of "mind" pollution from the streets.

FIGHT THE OJAI TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you know that the people of Ojai, Oak View, Meiners Oaks, Casitas Springs, 
Santa Paula and north Ventura are being exposed to radiation daily? 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of men, women, children and family pets are being exposed daily to 
unnecessary radiation.Thanks to our government. 
</P>
<P>
 Over Thanksgiving weekend, the National Weather Service erected a very 
powerful microwave radiation tower in a populated area of Ojai. The government 
admits that the tower's radiation can be harmful. It didn't stop them -- it was 
built anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no environmental impact study, there was no local notification and 
the federal government condemned land that belonged to an 86-year-old woman. 
This was done because of a court ruling that prevented the federal government 
from illegally using a private road to build this massive microwave transmitter 
tower. They wanted the land, so they seized it. 
</P>
<P>
 We all must fight this. This tower may not be in your neighborhood or mine, 
but we must show the government that we will not sit by and let them expose 
innocent people to radiation. 
</P>
<P>
 We must let them know that we want this tower moved to a more remote and 
suitable area, far enough away from residents so that there would be no health 
risks. 
</P>
<P>
 We must not cover our eyes. This could be in our neighborhood. We must all get 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Please write to Rep. (Elton) Gallegly, Sen. (Dianne) Feinstein, Sen. (Barbara) 
Boxer. We must support our neighbors in the Ojai area and let the government 
know that we will not sit back and let them do this to our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, contact CARE (Citizens Against Radiation Exposure) at 
656-6656.

SUPPORTS 'THE BLOCK' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teacher in my hometown has just been suspended from his coaching position. 
With 14 years of teaching experience at Simi Valley High School, he was a 
positive influence on many students. 
</P>
<P>
 His coaching technique, known as "the block," could be a motive for his 
suspension. This procedure had to be voted on and approved unanimously by the 
team players. The parents of each player were informed of this style of 
discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would bid on who would take a swat on a fellow teammate, for reasons 
such as forgetting equipment or missing a practice game. These players insist 
they would rather have a single swat from a hand than missing an entire game 
and losing a possible opportunity from a major college baseball scout 
witnessing their athletic prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally, I feel "the block" is an exceptional way of teaching discipline. 
If this man is still coaching by the time I have children, I will definitely 
encourage my child to play under his guidance.

SAN CLEMENTE RAISES WATER RATES MOST FOR BIG USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newly restructured water and sewer rates adopted recently will increase costs 
10% to 15% overall and carry stiffer penalties for late payers. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest water consumers face the biggest increases, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 4 to 1 last week to approve the new rates, which were 
based on a recent city review and analysis of its water billing system, 
officials said. Councilman Thomas Lorch cast the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rates are made up of a fixed service charge plus an additional charge 
that is based on the amount used. The more water used, the more it costs, 
according to the new formula. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joseph Anderson said the new rates are fair because they are based 
more on usage, rather than flat rates. He described the new formula as "not a 
rate increase as much as a redistribution of costs." 
</P>
<P>
 "The object is to make the system as fair as possible, that's what we are 
trying to accomplish," Anderson said. "If you look at the total revenue, for an 
equal amount of water it will cost about 3% more. But there will be significant 
variations to individual consumers depending on how much water they use." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorch said he voted against the increase because he didn't understand the 
reason for the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The explanation of what is driving the new costs was glossed over," Lorch 
said. "It was not explained whether it was new administrative costs or what." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorch also objected to new penalty provisions in the agreement. Customers who 
are 25 days late with their payment will be subject to an added 10% increase in 
their bills and those who are 35 days late could have their water shut off, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's unfair considering we are switching from a two-month billing 
period," Lorch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system also includes a special low rate for low-income families who 
earn less than $15,700 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rates are scheduled to become effective July 1.

CITY SEEKING TO ANNEX LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the request of homeowners, the Calabasas City Council has proposed annexing 
a gated community that abuts land slated for the controversial Ahmanson Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexing the 825-acre Mountain View Estates would give Calabasas control over 
a larger section of Thousand Oaks Boulevard -- a proposed access to Ahmanson 
Ranch -- but would not block plans for the mini-city, said Calabasas Planning 
Director Steve Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas must get permission to annex the land from the Los Angeles County 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees boundary changes. Calabasas 
sent its application to the commission this month, Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
 The application was filed after 49 residents of the area north of the Ventura 
Freeway between the city line and Crummer Canyon Road petitioned Calabasas 
officials, saying they wanted to enjoy the benefits of living in the city. The 
area includes Gates Canyon Park.

WINNING HIS MIND GAME; BASEBALL: NEW ATTITUDE AND EXTRA BATTING PRACTICE HAVE 
HELPED ANGEL SHORTSTOP GARY DISARCINA MATURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For players assured of spots in the starting lineup, the two most important 
aspects of spring training are stretching and remembering to put sun block on 
the back of your neck. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a time for languid preparation, not instant revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gary DiSarcina claims the turning point of his career came during one trip 
to the plate in Arizona. And a most unlikely turning point it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best at-bat I've had this year," DiSarcina said. "(San Diego's) 
Andy Benes struck me out on three pitches and I didn't swing at any of them. I 
can remember walking by Rod (Carew) and he was just waiting for me to throw my 
helmet or explode, but it didn't happen. It was the first time I ever just gave 
a pitcher his due and tipped my hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was turning point for me in terms of maturation. Two or three years ago, I 
was such a hot-head that I'd be messed up two or three days because of one bad 
call. It might cost me 10 at-bats. It's taken me a long time to learn that it's 
a marathon, not a sprint. If you go 0 for 4, you can't beat yourself up." 
</P>
<P>
 Self-inflicted pain is out of the question these days. DiSarcina has gone 0 
for 4 only once since April 17. Armed with this new maturity, DiSarcina is 
hitting .327. He's third on the team with 29 runs scored and even has two home 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they send a thank-you note to Benes, the Angels might want to give 
Carew, their hitting instructor, a pat on the back. DiSarcina, a career .236 
hitter, isn't doing this Cal Ripken Jr. impression solely on lack of emotion. A 
couple hundred hours of extra batting practice hasn't hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary had it in his mind that he was going to be a great fielder and hit 
.240," Carew said. "I told him, 'I'll be damned if you're going to hit .240. 
You're going to hit .285 at least. And we're going to work until you've 
disciplined yourself to that point.' I didn't want him to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of drills, working with his hands and he's getting the bat on the 
ball more consistently. And he's taking what the pitchers are giving him, not 
trying to juice the ball to a certain area." 
</P>
<P>
 Carew, who made it look so simple, can make it sound simple too. But 
DiSarcina, who at 26 is in his third year as the Angels' starting shortstop, 
admits there were times when he was satisfied to concentrate on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could do better," he said, "but you can get comfortable in the big 
leagues when you're doing really great in the field and there's no one there to 
push you. There's no higher league, nowhere else to aspire to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember going two or three months of working really, really hard on 
hitting my first year and not seeing any results. You say to yourself, 'Why go 
through all this? Just be happy with what you're doing.' But then in the 
off-season, I'd look at the numbers and say, 'I can do so much better.' And I'd 
vow to keep working no matter what, and not get disheartened." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a case of simply refining raw talent. DiSarcina, who is smooth 
and quick in the field, is not a gifted hitter. But he has attacked the first 
quarter of this season with an almost military approach, using a combination of 
a solid tactics and skills learned by repetition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not blessed with the best swing or the strong hands that you would expect 
from a talented hitter," he said. "But I take pride in how relentlessly I've 
worked with Rod on my swing. When you have the luxury of being around a guy who 
has that much knowledge about the art of hitting for three years, it starts to 
rub off. I really think most of the credit has to go to him." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of other factors that are playing a part in DiSarcina's 
sudden emergence as a bat man: HAROLD AND REX 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he felt the burden of being the leader of an inexperienced 
infield. Now, when he looks to his left, he sees a veteran, Harold Reynolds or 
Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Seattle, I went through being a young guy surrounded by young guys and 
being expected to be a leader," said Reynolds, who was signed as a free agent 
during the spring. "It's not easy. I think with Hud and Spike (Owen) and myself 
around this year, it takes a lot of pressure off him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just having experienced guys around to reassure you that you're making the 
right (defensive) calls, gives you confidence and no doubt that's carrying over 
to his hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina said playing alongside Reynolds and Hudler, coupled with sitting 
next to veteran shortstop Owen on the bench and in the clubhouse, has had a 
distinctly calming effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep me from pressing the panic button," he said. "They just won't allow 
it because they know that not trusting yourself is the worst thing that can 
happen to you in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insecurity is your enemy." MONEY MATTERS 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, DiSarcina signed a three-year contract worth almost $1 million a 
year. He was paid $265,000 in 1993 and was being offered $350,000 for this 
season until the Angels came up with the multiyear deal. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows he might have done better had he waited, but then he might not be 
doing so well if he had waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my career, I can solely concentrate on one thing, 
helping this team win," he said. "And it's going to be very nice not having to 
spend the off-season on the crap that goes with working out a contract, 
worrying over what's fair and what's not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I know what's in front of me for the next three years, whether I hit 
.220 or .320, and that relieves the pressure of a 'must' season. People react 
differently to that kind of pressure, but for me, I think it allows me to relax 
and play my game." THE BUM THUMB 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina had played in 211 consecutive games before a fastball by Baltimore's 
Ben McDonald broke his right thumb on Aug. 26 last season. The streak wasn't 
going to scare Ripken, but this was the first time an injury had kept DiSarcina 
off a baseball diamond. And it scared him. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a very happy new year in the DiSarcina house in Massachusetts. Four 
months after having three pins surgically placed in the thumb, he still 
couldn't bend it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see how I would be able to hold a bat by spring training," he said. 
"The thumb was definitely not where it should've been and I was just hoping I'd 
be able to swing a bat again some day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts things in perspective, to be physically removed from the game and 
have to sit and watch someone else do your job. I not only learned not to take 
the game for granted, but it also rekindled a lot of desire in me." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina doesn't figure to win any batting titles and he certainly doesn't 
have to hit .300 to have a successful year. He is, after all, a shortstop and 
fielding his position is No. 1 on his job description. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's steady offensive output -- he had a career-best 12-game hitting 
streak stopped Saturday and has only gone hitless in consecutive games twice 
this season -- is merely a bonus when compared to his even-more-consistent 
defensive performance. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina has made only two errors, the last coming almost a month ago, and 
his .989 fielding percentage is second in the league to Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball people want consistency out of that position," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said, "and to have a shortstop that you can play every day who's not 
only good defensively but can contribute offensively, is a great foundation for 
a ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing is, I'd much rather have a guy who makes the routine plays all day 
long than the guy who makes a great one here and there but blows a routine one 
every once in awhile. There are a lot more routine plays in a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, who set a National League record for shortstops by playing the first 63 
games without committing an error for Montreal in 1990, thinks the "steady" tag 
pinned on DiSarcina is a bit of a bad rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary has a knack for making great plays and making a lot of tough plays look 
easy too," Owen said. "You can make a routine ground ball look flashy if you 
want, but that's not the way he plays and I think that's why he makes some 
really great plays that kind of go unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I don't see too many that are better and I'm not saying that just 
because he's on my team. He's quick. He has very good range. And he's really 
smooth out there and to me, that's more of a compliment than saying a guy is 
spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who has learned over the years that some of a shortstop's best 
plays are the ones he doesn't try to make, isn't going to start turning 
somersaults after he throws the ball to first in an effort to get more air time 
on This Week in Baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people don't give me a fair shake, call it underrated or whatever," 
he said, "but I know I'm not an embarrassment to this team. The shortstop has 
to be the anchor out there." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the Angels manage to stay moored near the top of their division, he'll 
probably be high on their list of reasons why.

TIMBERWOLVES BECOME MINNESOTA'S LATEST LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Orleans, which has lost one NBA team, got another Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota has now lost two. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years after joining the NBA as an expansion team, the Minnesota 
Timberwolves announced Monday they are moving to New Orleans for the 1994-95 
season. Timberwolves owners Harvey Ratner and Marv Wolfenson said a group led 
by Top Rank of Louisiana will pay $152.5 million for the team. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second major league franchise lost to Minneapolis in the last 11 
months. The NHL North Stars moved to Dallas for this season after 26 years in 
the Twin Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's the second NBA team lost to Minnesota. The Lakers moved from 
Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner and Wolfenson said they had been willing to take $88 million from 
buyers wanting to keep the team in Minneapolis, but none came forward. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA Commissioner David Stern, clearly disappointed by the move after moving to 
have the league's 1994 All-Star Game in Minneapolis as a show of support for 
the Twin Cities, disputed that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marv Wolfenson and Harvey Ratner have received substantial offers to purchase 
the team and keep it in Minnesota," Stern said. "Regrettably, they decided 
against accepting these offers." 
</P>
<P>
 The latest offer came Monday from Magic Johnson, who said in Tokyo -- where he 
is touring with an all-star basketball team -- that a group that included him, 
singers Prince and Janet Jackson and Minnesota music producers Jimmy Jam Harris 
and Terry Lewis were trying to buy the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, led by former Minnesota insurance executive Bill Sexton, also 
had expressed interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolfenson said no one put an offer in writing and that, even in informal 
discussions, no one came close to paying the money necessary to retire Target 
Center's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfenson and Ratner had built Target Center to house the team, but found that 
with the debt load they were losing about $6.25 million a year, even through 
crowds were near capacity and the team itself made money. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the Minnesota Legislature believed it had taken a major step 
toward keeping the team when it approved a $42 million public buyout of the 
arena. Gov. Arne Carlson signed the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wolfenson and Ratner owed $76 million on the arena, which they opened in 
1990 in time for the team's second season. They said they were willing to put 
in $10 million of the difference, but weren't willing to eat the remaining $24 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they would use the New Orleans money to pay off the Target Center 
debt and would continue operating the arena without public subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big blow to Minnesota and the city of Minneapolis," Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter now goes before the NBA's franchise relocation committee, where the 
transaction is expected to be approved.

JIM MURRAY: INDY MIXES OLD, NEW WITH STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Indianapolis 500 is as American as, well, as American as an auto race. 
</P>
<P>
 Or apple pie, or hot fudge sundaes or harvest moons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as modern as fuel injection but as old-fashioned as the bustle. It's 
nostalgic as moonlight on the Wabash, as Midwestern as a quilting bee. It is as 
much a part of Americana as soap operas, barber shop quartets, the Lincoln log 
cabin or the scent of new-mown hay. It is part picnic, part county fair and 
part band concert, although the music is made by 33 of the most highly tuned 
combustion engines in the world howling like banshees in the humid May air. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a sporting event that makes a Super Bowl seem like an intruder because it 
goes back to a kinder time four wars ago, when the cars -- and the society -- 
were not proceeding at near-sonic speeds.  
</P>
<P>
 There are certain things that will happen in an Indy 500 now: 
</P>
<P>
 1. It will be won by a foreigner. Foreign drivers have won three of the last 
five. 
</P>
<P>
 2. If the winner is not a foreigner, it will be an Unser. The race has been 
won eight times by two generations of Unsers. 
</P>
<P>
 3. If there is a fatal accident, it will probably be caused by a rookie 
driver. Rookies have racked up the field in about a dozen fatalities or 
near-fatalities, the most noted, the deaths of Pat O'Connor in 1958 and Eddie 
Sachs in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Don't consider the parade lap a formality. In 1992, Roberto Guerrero, who 
was on the pole as fastest qualifier, no less, crashed in the pre-race turn 
around the track, hit the wall and was out of the tournament. Which was kind of 
like drowning in your own bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Malloy hit the wall on the pace lap in 1970, making it the first time the 
race started without 33 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace car crashed into a photographers' stand in 1971, injuring a dozen, 
one near-fatally. They used to let auto dealers and auto execs pace this thing 
but now they pick guys who could be in it -- like Parnelli Jones this year. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Expect a close finish. The old days when drivers had to maintain their 
positions under caution conditions are no longer and cars can now close up and 
bunch behind the leader, who loses what might have been a half-lap lead. So, Al 
Unser won a race by 43 thousandths of a second in 1992. And Gordon Johncock won 
by 16 hundredths of a second in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Don't look for a rookie to win it. Six rookies have won it but one of them 
was Ray Harroun in 1911, when technically every driver was a rookie because it 
was the first Indy race. The last rookie to win was Graham Hill in 1966 but 
Hill was not really a rookie either, except here. He was a blooded, longtime 
Formula One driver who had won a world driving title. The last real rookie to 
win it was George Souders -- in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Don't necessarily expect the pole sitter to win it. In 77 runnings, it has 
been won only 14 times from the pole, by 11 drivers. Rick Mears won it three 
times from there and Johnny Rutherford twice. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Don't think you're safe in a seat or behind a fence. Four spectators have 
been killed by flying wheels or flying cars, not counting firemen in the pit or 
pit crewmen. Spectators also have been burned by crashing cars spewing flames 
through homestretch fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 9. You have to know the Indy qualifying rules are by Rube Goldberg out of the 
Red Queen in "Alice In Wonderland." In 1974, Johnny Rutherford won it from the 
25th position. But he had qualified faster at 190.446 m.p.h. than everyone but 
the pole-sitter! On time posted, not on day of the week, he would have been in 
the front row instead of the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Bobby Rahal starts from the 10th row -- but he qualified faster 
than the next 21 cars in front of him! Don't ask me to explain it. I get a 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Don't look behind the third row for the winner. Since Rutherford won from 
Row 9 in 1974, only two winners, both Unsers, have come from behind Row 3. Al 
Unser won from 20th, the middle of Row 7, in 1987 and his son, Al Jr., won from 
12th position, outside in Row 4, in 1992. In fact, of the rest, only Danny 
Sullivan in 1985 started as far back as the third row. 
</P>
<P>
 11. Is the race really as American as apple pie? Uh-uh. More like fish and 
chips. With the Offenhausers long gone, most of the successful power plants in 
Indy cars have been made in England, including the "Chevy" engines of recent 
years, the Ford-Cosworths and even this year's highly touted Mercedes-Benz 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
 12. Are the fans just a lot of morbid thrill seekers waiting for an accident? 
Nah! Of the quarter of a million people there, most will be frying chicken or 
drinking beer during the race. They used to have an infield club that fined 
anyone caught so much as looking at a race car. It's a holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 13. Are race drivers great athletes? The ones who weren't are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 14. Where's the best place to watch the race? Los Angeles or New York. Channel 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 15. Do race drivers have a death wish? No, they have a money wish. There's 
$7.5 million put up for this thing. They want to live to enjoy it. People with 
death wishes don't get in race cars, they get on bridge railings. 
</P>
<P>
 16. Are race drivers brave? Would you do it? 
</P>
<P>
 Gentlemen, start your imports!

WORLD CUP '94 / 24 DAYS AND COUNTING; '90 SHOOTING STAR'S FAME IS FLEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The last time World Cup frenzy gripped Italy, ecstatic fans wrote songs about 
Salvatore Schillaci. This year, they have written him off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sleeping, don't wake me up, let me enjoy the dream," the square-cut 
striker sighed four years ago at the crest of a gossamer summer that turned a 
Sicilian slum kid into a national hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toto" Schillaci is awake now: The closest the high scorer of Italia '90 will 
get to USA '94 is his television set -- with a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've a yen to see Toto play this summer, try the J-League highlights from 
Japan and look for a dynamo striker wearing a Jubilo Iwata jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody remembers Toto's piercing eyes. They haven't changed, but the legs 
have," said sportswriter Giorgio Tutino, who has covered Italian soccer for 30 
years. "He had a boom. He gave us nights of magic but he never flew so high 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 What nights. What magic. In 1986, Schillaci, who grew up in a Palermo housing 
development, labored for third-division Messina as an acrobatic, 
dribbles-too-much attacker. Promoted to first-division Juventus, he scored 15 
times in his first season and won a place on the 1990 national team bench. 
</P>
<P>
 There he sat for most of Italy's opening game against Austria. Then, entering 
a scoreless game in the 78th minute, he headed a deep pass into the net with 
his first touch. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest is history. He scored against Czechoslovakia, Uruguay, Ireland, 
Argentina and England, leading all Cup attackers, and carried Italy to a 
third-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy danced to Schillaci's beat. In choruses of 70,000 they sang: "To-to! 
To-to!" When wife Rita back in Sicily gave Toto a son, all Italy cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout it all, Schillaci never lost touch with who he was, or how far he 
had come. The poor boy who'd made good was humble, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "My secret? It's no more than the fact I never feel sure of my place; not with 
the national team, not with Juventus," he said at the time. "I don't feel 
important. I'm not a star. I'm different this year because I'm playing with the 
stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Toto Schillaci was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The myth ended," Tutino said. "He returned to being the player he really 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Not the fame, or more money then he ever dreamed of, or a sprawling nouveau 
riche mansion in Sicily bought Schillaci happiness. It wasn't long before the 
tabloid press blossomed with "Rita Tells All" stories of a marriage gone bad. 
It was a nasty divorce. And along the way, for Toto, a procession of injuries 
-- and slumping production. Schillaci last played for Italy in a friendly match 
against Bulgaria in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 When Italy failed in the European Championship tournament the next year, 1990 
World Cup coach Azeglio Vicini was fired and Schillaci went, too, one of the 
players purged in the housecleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Schillaci moved from Turin's Juventus to Internazionale of Milan. 
Injuries went with him, notes sportswriter Enzo Palladini. In 21 games last 
year, mostly playing off the bench, he scored six goals. In the 1994 season, he 
played in only nine games, scoring five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, this spring, 29-year-old Toto Schillaci became an explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese promoters building a professional league came with a fistful of 
dollars: $3.1 million to Inter, and $2.5 million for a two-season contract for 
Schillaci through the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give me a house, a car, an interpreter, and a lot of money," he said. 
"Let's be frank. In the end, this is what we play for. I'm certainly not 
stupid. This can be an important experience for me and I'd be crazy to refuse. 
It will mean making a sacrifice for a year and a half, and I will hardly see my 
children. But I have no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
 Exporting a player is role reversal for the Italian first division, long the 
magnet for foreign stars. Schillaci is the first Italian professional soccer 
player to go to Japan, but he will not be the last, says Palladini. He offers a 
powerful drawing card, and skills and experience to an ambitious young league 
short on both. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the early returns, Schillaci is enjoying himself more on the 
field than off. In his first two games, he had an assist and a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finds the living difficult, though, having to go everywhere with an 
interpreter," Palladini said. "And he can't get used to the traffic there -- 
driving on the left -- so he has to have a driver, too. He's with his new 
girlfriend, Prisca Rossi, but it's a tough transition."  
</P>
<P>

KINGS TURNING TO MCMASTER; HOCKEY: HE WILL SUCCEED BEVERLEY AS GENERAL MANAGER. 
VACHON WILL RETURN TO A LARGER ROLE UNDER THE NEW SETUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam McMaster, described by hockey associates as a sound administrator with an 
excellent eye for talent, will become general manager of the Kings today. The 
club has scheduled a noon news conference at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster will succeed Nick Beverley, who was fired last week. His hiring 
continues the restructuring of the Kings' front office, a shake-up that 
includes the return to prominence of former general manager Rogie Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduced to a largely ceremonial role during Beverley's two-year tenure, Vachon 
and Bruce McNall, who went from sole owner to minority owner with the sale of 
72% of the team to Joseph Cohen and Jeffrey Sudikoff, will have considerable 
influence in day-to-day operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Vachon, the Kings' general manager for more than eight years before he was 
given the title of assistant to the chairman, has the NHL expertise that 
McMaster lacks. McMaster, who spent 13 years as a junior hockey executive but 
has no NHL managerial experience, probably will key on the Kings' scouting and 
minor league operations. McNall, who still owns 28% of the club, will have a 
voice in personnel decisions, although his exact role remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster's ability to judge talent will be useful to the Kings as they prepare 
for the annual entry draft, which will be held June 28-29 at Hartford, Conn. 
His knowledge of junior-level players will help fill the vacuum created when 
Beverley and Bob Owen, the Kings' director of player personnel and development, 
were fired. Rick Dudley, the Kings' director of pro scouting, left the 
organization this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster could not be reached for comment Monday. However, he said Sunday that 
he had discussed his vision for the Kings during an interview in Los Angeles 
last week with Cohen, McNall and Vachon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have two plans," he said. "The Kings have got some quality older 
players, and they've got to try to make them a winner within two years. You've 
also got to build some young talent in the organization, and that's one thing 
they're lacking. You've got to build through the draft or trades. That's the 
route I would go." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Kings nor their top farm team, the Phoenix Roadrunners, made the 
playoffs thisseason. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster's only NHL experience is three seasons as a scout with the Washington 
Capitals, but he is highly regarded by executives of NHL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good man, and very knowledgeable," one club official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said another NHL source: "He's been a good hockey man for decades. He's 
probably most widely recognized for what we call in the business having a good 
hockey eye, a very keen eye toward talent and assessing players' strengths and 
weaknesses." 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster has been general manager of four Ontario Hockey League clubs: the 
Niagara Falls Flyers, Toronto Marlboros, Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds and 
Sudbury Wolves. All have been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 He also guided a team of Ontario players to the world under-17 championship 
last year in a tournament that included teams from four other Canadian 
provinces, the United States, Russia, Sweden and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster, 50, recently resigned his Sudbury job after six years to pursue an 
NHL position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sudbury is a good place to live, so you tend to wait for people to come to 
you," he said. "This time, I decided to force myself (into contention) and make 
myself known."

THOMAS LIKELY TO OWN 10% OF NEW TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isiah Thomas, long-time superstar of the Detroit Pistons who retired recently, 
is expected to become one of the few substantial minority owners in pro sports 
with an estimated 10% share of the new Toronto NBA franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Times' sources, the announcement of Thomas' new position with the 
Raptors will be made as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said Thomas would play an active daily role in the administration 
of team activities. The Detroit Free Press reported he would be the team's vice 
president of basketball operations. The sources also said that, while the 
percentage of ownership might not be exactly 10%, it would be very close to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 The development comes at the same time that long-time Thomas rival Magic 
Johnson and a group failed in its bid to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves, who 
were sold to a New Orleans group.

NBA PLAYOFFS / EASTERN CONFERENCE FINALS; KNICKS REGROUP, CONFRONT MIRROR IMAGE 
IN HOT PACERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Those dreaded Huns from the Midwest, the Chicago Bulls, have finally been sent 
away, leaving the New York Knicks to use Monday to heal from an emotional and 
physical seven-game series and to also remember one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Those weren't even the conference finals.These are, the best-of-seven meeting 
with the Indiana Pacers beginning tonight at Madison Square Garden. For the 
Knicks, it's a showdown with the league's hottest team, with a trip to the NBA 
Finals on the line. Ready or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won, but it's a dead issue," Knick guard John Starks said of the Bulls 
series. "We have to worry about Indiana because our season doesn't stop with 
the Chicago Bulls." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pacer Coach Larry Brown of the Knicks: "They've prepared themselves to 
play. The Knicks have talked all along about what great shape they're in. They 
know what it is to play in big games and big series, and that's something that 
may be in their favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Experience is an obvious Knick advantage, although the biggest might be the 
home-court edge. The Pacers, off since Thursday night, had never before made it 
out of the first round but went 7-2 against Orlando and Atlanta, despite being 
the lower-seeded team in each matchup, then waited out the final two games of 
the New York-Chicago series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks swept the season series, 4-0, and held Indiana to 84, 91, 82 and 82 
points. So what? Indiana split with the Magic during the regular season and 
then went 3-0 in the playoffs, and lost the season series to the Hawks, 3-2, 
but needed only six games to beat the East's No. 1 team in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, New York broke 100 only once in the four earlier meetings.

BASEBALL / NCAA TOURNAMENT; USC, LONG BEACH ST., FULLERTON AWARDED BERTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mostly, college baseball teams in the West breathed sighs of relief Monday 
when the NCAA announced the 48-team field for the Division I playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, Long Beach State and Cal State Fullerton were among 10 teams from the 
region picked for eight six-team, double-elimination regionals that will 
determine the field for the 48th College World Series at Omaha, Neb., June 
3-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, Arizona State, Washington, Nevada, Santa Clara, Brigham Young and 
Fresno State also were selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four teams earned automatic bids by winning a conference championship, 
conference tournament or a play-in against another conference champion. The 
other 24 teams received at-large berths based on their records and strength of 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools in the West were bracing for the worst after the regional sites were 
announced last week. For the first time since the tournament adopted a regional 
format in 1975, no regionals are in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has not advanced to Omaha since winning its 11th national title in 
1978, will travel to the South Regional at Baton Rouge, La. The second-seeded 
Trojans (38-18) open Thursday against North Carolina Greensboro (37-16), which 
is making its first playoff appearance. The regional also includes defending 
national champion Louisiana State, the No. 1 seed; Southeastern Louisiana, 
Tulane and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 USC played at Baton Rouge in the 1990 playoffs. The Trojans won their first 
three games before losing twice to LSU. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any complaints," said USC Coach Mike Gillespie, whose team 
finished third in the Pacific 10 Southern Division. "I think (the regional) is 
very winnable. There's no reason to be intimidated by this deal. Obviously, LSU 
is LSU and it's their yard. . . . All in all, it's as much as we could have 
hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State travels to the Midwest II Regional at Wichita, Kan., perhaps 
the deepest regional in the tournament. Second-seeded Long Beach (39-17), 
shooting for its fourth World Series appearance in six seasons under Coach Dave 
Snow, opens Friday against Washington (42-16) in a regional that also includes 
top-seeded Georgia Tech, Wichita State, West Coast Conference champion Santa 
Clara and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to get a No. 2 seed, but even though Georgia Tech is No. 1 and 
we're No. 2, I still think it's Wichita State's regional," Snow said. "They've 
just come out of there so often." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (41-13) is seeded second behind Oklahoma State (46-15) in the 
Midwest I Regional at Stillwater, Okla., and will open Friday against 
Northwestern State (44-13), one of four teams from Louisiana in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (36-22), the Pac-10 Southern Division champion, is seeded a 
surprisingly low fourth in the Central Regional at Austin, Tex., and will play 
Texas in its opener. The regional also includes top-seeded Oklahoma (42-17). 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona State (39-16), second in the Pac-10 Southern Division, is seeded third 
at the Mideast Regional at Knoxville, Tenn., and will open against Western 
Carolina (45-16) in a regional that also includes top-seeded Tennessee, North 
Carolina State, Wright State of Ohio and Northeastern of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other top-seeded teams include Miami (44-12) in the Atlantic Regional at 
Miami, Clemson (55-16) in the East Regional at Clemson, S.C., and Ohio State 
(48-7) in the Atlantic II Regional at Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (33-20) will sit out the playoffs for the first time since 1990. 
The Waves' chances suffered when teams such as the Citadel (31-32) won 
conference tournaments to earn automatic berths.

RACING AGAINST TIME; OPTIMISTIC AS EVER, U.S. OLYMPIC STAR STEVE SCOTT LOOKS 
FAR BEYOND HIS CANCER SURGERY TO FUTURE GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early this afternoon at the Kaiser Hospital in nearby San Diego, a surgeon 
will drag a scalpel down the lower abdomen of three-time Olympian Steve Scott 
and begin a search for 15 possible cancerous lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the perpetually cheerful Scott, 38, who describes himself as the original 
"glass-is-half-full type of guy," the lymphatic surgery is nothing more than a 
medical inconvenience. Already, he has made plans to resume his training 
schedule come Sept. 1 . . . or Oct. 1 if his urologist, Kevin O'Brien, decides 
chemotherapy is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Scott intends to compete again. He has spent the better part of 20 
years doing exactly that, collecting six American records in the process, 
appearing in three Summer Olympics, being ranked in the top 10 for a decade and 
breaking the four-minute mile 135 times, a figure unmatched by any other 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, I know everything is going to end up fine," Scott said Monday at 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
 This is typical Scott. Positive. Emphatic. Optimistic. He isn't so concerned 
about the surgery itself, as he is about the week's stay in the hospital. His 
body, cleansed by a cardiovascular dream diet and a 90-mile-per-week training 
regimen, is ultra-sensitive to the drugs used during hospitalization. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott knows this because it was only a few weeks ago -- May 1, to be exact -- 
that he underwent surgery to remove a cancerous left testicle. The tumor was 
discovered during a routine physical for a vasectomy, though Scott now says he 
suspected something was wrong even before the examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancer itself isn't altogether different from that suffered by 
Philadelphia Phillies' first baseman John Kruk, who returned to play not long 
after diagnosis and treatment. According to O'Brien, this specific cancer is 
highly predictable, treatable and enjoys a 95% cure rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Scott briefly considered keeping his medical situation as quiet as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in the track world, things work more by way of rumor than by fact," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he went public, even allowing Azusa Pacific University, where he trains 
under Azusa Coach Irv Ray, to issue a news release on his condition. The way 
Scott figured it, his situation was better served by full disclosure than by 
whispers. It also served as a public service announcement of sorts, "that 
cancer is non-discriminatory," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see this year, especially with John Kruk, (PGA star) Paul Azinger and 
myself, and you would think, 'They're all athletes, they're healthy, they 
shouldn't get sick, they shouldn't get a cancer,' " Scott said. "Especially me, 
being a miler. I could see a golfer, a baseball player -- they're marginal 
athletes. But an endurance athlete, someone who watches what he eats, who is in 
the best cardiovascular shape of practically any athlete out there . . . coming 
down with a type of cancer. I think what it can show is cancer is one of those 
things that can affect anyone, anytime." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott's condition hasn't gone unnoticed. Since the announcement of his 
illness, the UC Irvine graduate has received cards, letters, faxes and phone 
calls from friends and admirers around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 World-class triathlete Scott Tinley called to check on his friend. So did 
Marty Liquori, the famed American miler who is battling leukemia. Eamonn 
Coghlan, the great middle-distance star from Ireland, sent a get-well fax. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a letter from a little-known biathlete that especially caught 
Scott's attention. The biathlete had been found to have near-identical cancer 
and undergone the same lymphatic surgical procedure. In what amounted to a 
cancer diary, the biathlete took Scott through the process and recovery step by 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 If Scott is scared, he doesn't show it. If you didn't know any better, you'd 
think he was going in for a sprained ankle, not cancer treatment. He said he 
was more nervous in the days before the Olympic finals than he has been for the 
trip to Kaiser Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear the word, cancer, it's, 'Oh, my God, this person is going to 
die,' " he said. "That's what we've been taught. But it's not that way anymore. 
It's not a death sentence anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there exists the chance -- 95% cure rate or not -- that the cancer 
could be fickle and cruel. The possibility has not been lost on Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst-case scenario is that I don't recover and die," he said. "There's 
not much I can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the morbidly bright side of things, Scott said that the worst-case scenario 
does bring at least one advantage -- or so he figures: He'd get to run in 
heaven with Steve Prefontaine, the American distance star who died in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think God's a track fan," said Scott by way of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Were he not undergoing the cancer treatment, Scott would be running 80-90 
miles a week, all in the name of preparing for next month's outdoor nationals 
in Knoxville, Tenn. Instead, he has to wait until at least September before he 
can jog a single step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like stopping smoking after 20 years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he does return, Scott said his goals will be the same as before. He 
wants to resume serious training by the summer of 1995, to record the first 
sub-four-minute outdoor mile by a master and to qualify for the 1996 U.S. 
Olympic trials. You know, the usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was an omen, maybe it wasn't, but Sunday night Scott had a dream. He 
said he was on the operating table, an IV in his arm. Rather than having him 
breathe anesthesia, Scott was given sleeping pills by a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way," said the nurse in his dream, "Dr. O'Brien and Dr. Kaswick won't 
be able to perform the operation. A resident is going to do it, but he's in his 
second year, so don't worry." 
</P>
<P>
 This being a dream, Scott spit out the pills, jumped off the operating table 
and, surgical gown flapping, sprinted out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 No word on his split times.

OWNERS AND UNION TALK WITH NO RESOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball's labor talks moved to Los Angeles on Monday, with representatives of 
the owners offering what Gene Orza, the union's associate general counsel, said 
was a "laundry list of disheartening and mind-boggling" proposals aimed at 
reducing and restricting player rights. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those proposals dealt with what will be the critical issues -- a 
salary cap and revenue sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen months after the owners voted to reopen collective negotiations a 
year before the agreement expired, the union continues to wait for a salary-cap 
proposal it is almost certain to reject. Richard Ravitch, the owners' chief 
negotiator, said Monday he will make that proposal the second or third week of 
June, after an owners' meeting in Cincinnati, June 8-9. 
</P>
<P>
 As Ravitch hurried to leave an airport hotel to catch a return flight to New 
York, time seemed to be narrowing in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, frustrated by the absence of a substantive economic proposal, 
continues to weigh an August or September strike, its only leverage against the 
owners declaring an impasse in the negotiations and unilaterally imposing a new 
economic system. The union's executive board will meet July 11 to consider a 
possible date, but a subcommittee might begin that process before then, Orza 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ravitch described Monday's series of proposals as 
non-economic, but Orza said they all have economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most interesting and likely to be rejected quickest: The owners want 
to eliminate the maximum salary cut of 20%; they want to eliminate service time 
for any player called up in September, a proposal aimed at delaying a young 
player's eligibility for arbitration and free agency, among other things; they 
want players on the disabled list to receive only 50% service time and they 
want to remove the rights of eligible players to veto or demand a trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "An overwhelming number of these proposals go back to the 1970s," Orza said. 
"We compromised on some of them the last time, but told them at the time, 'OK, 
but don't nickel-and-dime us again.' Yet here they are, doing it again. It's 
not the kind of stuff that makes you think the clubs really want to reach an 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Several Dodgers, including Orel Hershiser, Brett Butler, Mike Piazza, Eric 
Karros, Mitch Webster, Tim Wallach and Tom Candiotti, attended Monday's 
session.

TITANS TO START NCAA TITLE RUN IN STILLWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton team is looking ahead to "a fresh experience," in the NCAA 
baseball regional playoffs at Stillwater, Okla., beginning Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Coach Augie Garrido's view after Fullerton (41-13) was seeded second 
behind the host team, Oklahoma State, in pairings announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will really be healthy for us going to a place we haven't played 
before and playing against teams we haven't played this season, " Garrido said. 
"I'm thankful for the new experience we'll be having. None of the early season 
stuff will mean anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton will face Northwestern State (44-13) of Natchitoches, La., at 1 p.m. 
(PDT) in their opening game of the double-elimination tournament. The other 
first-round games in the Midwest I Regional will send Oklahoma State (46-15) 
against Illinois State (30-27) and Texas Christian (37-20) against Memphis 
State (50-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's selection as an at-large entry marks the team's fourth appearance 
in the playoffs in the last five years. The Titans played in NCAA regionals at 
Austin, Tex., in two of their last three appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was eliminated by two losses to USC last year in Austin after 
reaching the College World Series in 1990 and 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The team unexpectedly was left out of the regional field in 1991, despite 
sharing the Big West championship with Fresno State. Fresno State won the 
automatic bid, and Fullerton was snubbed in favor of third-place Long Beach 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans also shared the Big West championship this season with Nevada and 
Long Beach State, but Nevada claimed the conference's automatic NCAA bid by 
winning two of three games in their series with both teams. The other two Big 
West teams also were seeded second, Nevada in the Austin regional behind 
Oklahoma and Long Beach State in the Wichita regional behind Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton is ranked seventh in the nation by Baseball America and Collegiate 
Baseball. Clemson is ranked No. 1 in both.

 Garrido said he was surprised neither Pepperdine nor San Diego State were 
selected for the 48-team field. Garrido regarded that as another snub of West 
Coast baseball by the NCAA selection committee, which failed to award the West 
one of the eight regional sites this year. "Our universities also need to get 
more behind our baseball programs and realize the value of those programs, 
too," Garrido said.

 The Cal State Fullerton players gathered at a restaurant near the campus 
Monday to watch the announcement on television.

<P>
 "I'm really pumped up and ready to go," said second baseman Jeff Ferguson, who 
will go into the playoffs with a .388 average, best among Titan starters.  
</P>
<P>
 The playoffs will provide an opportunity for center fielder Dante Powell to 
bounce back from a regular season that fell below expectations. Powell is 
hitting .289, well below the .335 mark he posted a year ago as a sophomore and 
his .307 mark as a freshman.CALIFORNIA STATE

 Davis made his debut with the Dodgers in 1960 and remained the club's starting 
center fielder for the next 13 years.Nicknamed "Three Dog" because he wore No. 
3 and was "fast as a greyhound," he helped the team to three National League 
pennants and two World Series championships. He holds six of the Los Angeles 
franchise's 15 major batting records, including hits, 2,091, and total bases, 
3,094. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 54, still lives in the Los Angeles area. He and former teammate Tommy 
Davis are writing a book about the Dodgers of the 1960s.

TEN WESTERN TEAMS ARE SELECTED, INCLUDING USC, LONG BEACH STATE

 USC and Long Beach State were among 10 Western teams picked for eight 
six-team, double-elimination NCAA Division I baseball regionals that will 
determine the field for the 48th College World Series at Omaha, Neb., June 
3-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton, Stanford, Arizona State, Washington, Nevada, Santa Clara, 
Brigham Young and Fresno State also were selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams in the West were bracing for the worst. For the first time since the 
tournament adopted a regional format in 1975, no regionals are in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has not advanced to Omaha since winning its 11th national title in 
1978, will travel to the South Regional at Baton Rouge, La. The second-seeded 
Trojans (38-18) open Thursday against North Carolina Greensboro (37-16), which 
is making its first playoff appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State travels to the Midwest II Regional at Wichita, Kan., perhaps 
the deepest regional in the tournament. Second-seeded Long Beach (39-17) opens 
Friday against Washington (42-16).  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (36-22), the Pac-10 Southern Division champion, is seeded a 
surprisingly low fourth in the Central Regional at Austin, Tex., and will play 
Texas in its opener. GARY KLEIN

 Chosen by the Angels from the Baltimore organization in the 1960 expansion 
draft, Chance was 14-10 in his rookie season, 1962.But the big right-hander 
blossomed in '64, going 20-9 for a club that barely managed a .500 overall 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 His 1.65 earned-run average and 11 shutouts that year helped him win the Cy 
Young Award, the only one earned by an Angel. Chance was traded to Minnesota 
before the 1967 season and ended his career with Detroit in '71 with a 128-115 
mark. Now 52, he lives on a farm in his native Ohio.

SCHNEIDER MAKES THE RIGHT DECISION; SOFTBALL: JUNIOR SHORTSTOP, WHO QUIT SOCCER 
TEAM TO CONCENTRATE ON ACADEMICS, LEADS LOS ALAMITOS IN DIVISION I PLAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The words spilled from Michelle Schneider's lips just as the tears welled in 
her eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm quitting the team," she told her varsity soccer coach. "I just can't keep 
up with my schoolwork." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a sentence as foreign to Schneider as anything she had spoken, and it 
took all her strength to lift the phone and pronounce the words. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-sport athlete at Los Alamitos High School, Schneider is much more 
accustomed to competing, excelling and celebrating. Stopping short is for 
opponents, and she is usually around long after her competition has faded away. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently starring at shortstop for the Griffin softball team, the talented 
junior is coming off a regular season in which she batted a team-high .415 with 
three home runs and 24 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Griffins' 9-0, first-round victory over La Quinta in the Southern 
Section Division I playoffs Friday, she drove in two runs to pace the Empire 
League champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider's excellent softball season has helped her forget about the 
tug-of-war between academics and athletics that caused her to sit out her first 
sport since she started high school at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 A league champion doubles tennis player last fall and a varsity starter in 
soccer and softball since her freshman year, Schneider knows she made the right 
decision three months ago, but that doesn't mean she has to feel good about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to think about it," she said. "That was the hardest thing I had 
to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A preseason injury put Schneider on the sideline for the first few games, and 
while she watched, her schoolwork began to mount. 
</P>
<P>
 "After practice, we would go in for meetings, and by the time I got home, 
there was not enough time left for studying," she said. "Grades are very 
important to me, and I had to put school first." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider carries a 4.3 grade-point average, an example of her off-the-field 
determination. Notre Dame and Stanford appear at the top of her list of college 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, she plans to restrict her athletic load to tennis and softball, 
while increasing her academic load of honors classes. When Schneider begins 
college, she figures to leave behind the racket and focus on softball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Schneider will attempt to guide Los Alamitos back into the 
Southern Section championship game, where it lost to Simi Valley, 1-0, last 
season. In that game, the Griffins were single-handedly beaten by, of all 
people, Sara Griffin , who pitched a shutout and scored the game's only run 
with a homer over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would see Simi Valley in the semifinals if we both get that far," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is still playing for Simi Valley, but Los Alamitos has a squad full of 
them, which Schneider said is the team's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are one of those teams that is good one through nine in the lineup," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider is careful to not look too far ahead. To get another shot at Simi 
Valley, the Griffins (22-4) must get past Buena today in the second round and 
either Foothill (22-6) or Kennedy (21-5-1) in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are peaking right now," Schneider said. "Our pitcher (Deborah 
Wilson) has not been real healthy until lately, and that's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Schneider, it's the opposing pitchers who are starting to look 
queasy.

ZIEGLER, GRAVE ARE ODD -- BUT EFFECTIVE -- COUPLE; VOLLEYBALL: SENIORS LEAD 
HUNTINGTON BEACH, WHICH SEEKS TO REPEAT AS DIVISION I CHAMPIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nick Ziegler likes to shock his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 With wild eyes, the 6-foot-5, 225-pound middle blocker howls with every spike 
or block he puts to the floor. The senior from Huntington Beach had his tongue 
pierced this season, but that wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the playoffs began, Ziegler dyed his hair purple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed something new to surprise my teammates," Ziegler said. "If they 
think I'm crazy, it either relaxes them or makes them just nervous enough to 
play their best." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Grave has played his best this season, and the quiet, 6-foot-3 outside 
hitter leads by example.  
</P>
<P>
 Grave helped the Oilers finish undefeated and win the Southern Section 
Division I boys' volleyball championship last season. Friday, he served for 
match point in the Oilers' five-game victory over North Hollywood 
Harvard-Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the duo has helped push Huntington Beach (19-2) into Wednesday's 
Division I semifinals to play top-seeded El Toro (18-1). The winner will play 
in the championship match Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave and Ziegler share the common goal of back-to-back championships, but 
their methods couldn't be more different. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave is steady; Ziegler's play runs hot and cold. Ziegler is a ham; Grave 
doesn't mind blending into the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're opposites," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frack and Frick, meet Mike and Nick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Against Harvard-Westlake, Ziegler asked Ciarelli to remove him from the match 
because he lost a contact lens. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have a spare one?" the referee asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You think he has a spare? Just look at his hair," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of the ups and downs, Ciarelli still has a soft spot in his heart for 
Ziegler. After all, that's his nephew he's coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a love-hate thing," Ciarelli said. "You don't want to show any 
favoritism, so most times I'm harder on Nick. But it's been great, what else 
could you ask for than to watch your own nephew grow up and play for you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli was also an ardent Huntington Beach football fan, and followed the 
Oilers' journey to the Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler played offensive and defensive line for Huntington Beach, leading the 
team in sacks. He also earned a scholarship and signed a letter of intent with 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 And he played in a big shadow . . . alongside The Times lineman of the year, 
Tony Gonzalez, who has signed to play football and basketball for California. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's the big secret," Ziegler quipped. "I had to carry Tony for the 
whole season." 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler admits he clamors for attention, but Grave doesn't mind the shadows. 
Although he is more subdued than his teammate, Grave is not without his 
idiosyncrasies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the playoffs, Grave wears a pair of worn-out, gray running shoes he wore 
during the Oilers' championship charge last season. Why the lucky shoes? 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do anything it takes for us to win," Grave said. "On the court, if 
that means I have to be a more vocal leader, then I'll do it. Whatever it 
takes; I hate losing." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season began, Ciarelli said Grave and Ziegler would have to step 
forward as leaders for the Oilers to have a chance to repeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last season, I could just run around, yell and act crazy," Ziegler said. 
"This year my teammates are looking to me and Mike. We've been here before." 
</P>
<P>
 That championship experience is priceless. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what it takes to win, they expect to win, and they're (ticked) when 
they lose," Marina Coach Jason Bilbruck said. "Look at Grave's record and he's 
only lost twice in two seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ziegler: "You get into that mind-set that you know you can win, no matter 
what. When we played Los Alamitos in the football final, you could see that 
those guys had it in their minds that there was no way they were going to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went 13-1 in football and had a similar attitude. I feel like that with 
our volleyball team now. When you can come back from down 13-11 in the fifth 
game to Harvard-Westlake . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Grave is a big reason the Oilers' rallied for that victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Grave could have hung his head after Matt Sebree blocked his spike attempt to 
give the Wolverines a 13-11 lead in the fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset at the stupidity of the play on my part," Grave said. "But we 
were down, 13-11, in the fifth game against Capistrano Valley last season and 
won the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Grave helped turn the tide as the Oilers scored four consecutive points to 
post a dramatic 15-5, 15-8, 7-15, 4-15, 15-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike really stepped up big time in that Harvard-Westlake match," said 
Bilbruck, who was an assistant to Ciarelli before moving to Marina. "You could 
see it. He was pumping his fist, yelling at his teammates. Usually, he just 
leads by example." 
</P>
<P>
 Grave was tired of losing. 
</P>
<P>
 The last match the Oilers lost was to second-seeded Laguna Beach (18-1), which 
plays Los Angeles Loyola (20-1) in the other Division I semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciarelli was ejected from that 15-8, 15-13, 15-3 loss to the Artists in a 
nonleague match May 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw enough," Ciarelli said. "I was ready to get on the bus and go home." 
</P>
<P>
 But Grave had to play in the rest of that match, and the loss stays with him. 
"After that Laguna match, Mike has really picked it up," Ziegler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his all-around skills, UC Santa Barbara is the only college showing 
interest in Grave. "He'll play somewhere," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the coach hopes that his odd couple will help the Oilers make one more 
trip to the finals.

SOUTHERN SECTION INDIVIDUAL GOLF CHAMPIONSHIPS; WOODS SAVES HIS BEST FOR LAST; 
HE WINS WITH RECORD 66; GOLF: IN FINAL HIGH SCHOOL ROUND, WESTERN SENIOR EARNS 
SECOND CONSECUTIVE TITLE AND THIRD OVERALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some might believe Tiger Woods is now too big for high school golf, what with 
his three U.S. Junior Championship titles and his PGA Tour experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods, a senior from Western High, saved his best prep round for last, 
shooting a five-under-par 66 to win the Southern Section individual 
championship Monday at La Cumbre Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods broke the section final record of 67, which was shared by three, the 
most recent being Larry Springer of Rolling Hills in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive section title for Woods and the third overall. 
Only two others -- Long Beach Wilson's Boots Porterfield (1942-44) and Santa 
Monica's Mac Hunter (1945-47) -- have won as many. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, had never seen the La Cumbre course, but said he figured it would 
take a low score to win because it's only 6,352 yards long. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I just went out and attacked the course," said Woods, who will attend 
Stanford in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 La Cumbre didn't put up much of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting from the 10th tee, Woods made birdie on four of his first six holes 
and missed birdie putts on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
 After making the turn at five-under 30, he rolled in a five-footer for birdie 
on his 10th hole and seemed to be threatening the course record of 64. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely within reach the way I was putting," Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, he had left the rest of the field in the deep rough. He faltered 
on his 15th hole, the 522-yard, par-5 sixth, hitting his tee shot out of 
bounds. He took a double-bogey 7, but got a stroke back with a birdie on the 
next hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods finished four strokes ahead of Sunny Hills' Terry Noe, Anthony Marciano 
of Simi Valley Royal and Michael Chavez of Santa Barbara San Marcos, who each 
finished one-under. 
</P>
<P>
 The top 22 players, excluding Woods and those who already had qualified with 
their team, advanced to the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. Championships, 
June 6 at Redlands Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who won the CIF-SCGA individual title by a record 10 strokes as a 
freshman in 1991, won't be playing in Redlands because he will be in Rye, N.Y., 
preparing for the PGA's Buick Open at Westchester Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 He is passing up U.S. Open sectional qualifying, which is the same day, 
because the Open starts on the same day as Western's graduation ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Noe, six Orange County players advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills freshman Jin Park shot 73, finishing in a three-way tie for sixth. 
Jimmy Lee of Tustin and Greg Uberuaga of Huntington Beach each shot 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar's Bill Sarracino shot 75 and Ben Bost of Santa Margarita and 
Chris Berry of Esperanza each shot 76. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff McGraw of Servite and Kevin Rodgers of Trabuco Hills shot 77s and 
survived a seven-way playoff for the final four spots. Ryan Donovan of 
Esperanza was eliminated in the playoff. El Toro's Ben Garner, Brea-Olinda's 
Mike Peterson and Aaron Smith of Dana Hills each missed making the playoff by 
one stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry struggled most of his round but avoided the playoff by making a birdie 
on his final hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Berry, a senior who will attend Arizona, played in the foursome with Woods. He 
was frustrated with his play, but said the experience wasn't all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having fun watching Tiger play," Berry said.

GOLF / SOUTHERN SECTION INDIVIDUAL CHAMPIONSHIP; ROYAL'S MARCIANO FINISHES 
SECOND BEHIND WOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Marciano didn't look like a guy who was all broken up about finishing 
as second banana. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, he was pretty thrilled with the notion, especially since a 
player of considerable repute -- a guy named Tiger Woods -- was the lone player 
to finish in front of him Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor," Marciano said. "I'm an unknown. . . . His round was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano, a junior from Royal High, shot a solid one-under-par 70 to finish in 
a tie for second, four shots behind Woods in the Southern Section Individual 
Golf Championships at La Cumbre Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a senior from Anaheim Western High and the two-time defending U.S. 
Junior Amateur champion, shot a sparkling five-under 66, marking the third time 
he has won the section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, who started on the 10th hole, blew away the 130-player field with a 
five-under 30 over the first nine holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marciano, the Marmonte League champion, shot a two-under 34 on the front nine 
to finish in a three-way tie for second. Marciano earned the second-place 
plaque on the second hole of sudden death by making a 60-footer for birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 The low 22 individuals advanced to the CIF-Southern California Golf Assn. 
Championships June 6 at Redlands Country Club. The only other player from the 
region to qualify for the event was Brandon Jones of Agoura -- and he had to 
work overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was one of seven players to finish with a 77. Trouble was, there were 
only four SCGA berths left, so seven players teed off in a sudden-death 
shootout for the right to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones sliced his tee shot on the second playoff hole, but punched a seven-iron 
through a stand of towering eucalyptus trees and two-putted for par to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan O'Neil of Rio Mesa just missed the playoff with a 78.

<P>
 Cypress and Rancho Santiago, which have won two of the last three State 
baseball titles, start play Saturday in this year's tournament at Cerritos 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (39-10), the Orange Empire Conference champion, plays Lassen (39-9) at 
3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago (38-11), the third-place team from the same conference, plays 
Chabot (33-12) at 11 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 The tournament continues Sunday and the title game is 11 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress has won 13 in a row, including five playoff games. The Chargers have 
outscored opponents, 50-9, in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Hodges set the Cypress single-season record for home runs with 14 and 
pitcher Aaron France (12-3) has tied the single-season record for victories. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third trip to the State tournament for Cypress. The Chargers won 
the title in 1991 after finishing third in conference. Cypress Coach Scott 
Pickler has a record of 287-152 and is in his 10th season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago will defend the title won last season against host Sacramento. 
The Dons have won five consecutive playoff games this season and nine over the 
last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago Coach Don Sneddon, in his 13th season, is 421-144-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Martineau (5-3) played third base this season but has been most 
impressive as a pitcher. He gave up no runs in eight-plus innings of a 2-0 
victory Friday over Los Angeles Harbor, then came back to get his third save in 
the 6-4 victory Sunday over Citrus. Martineau, 2-0 in the playoffs, has an 
earned-run average of 2.64. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Kastelic was six for 14 in the regional and is three hits short of the 
Dons' career record of 154, held by Conrad Colby (1989-90). Kastelic, a 
sophomore center fielder, is hitting .374 after batting .438 as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore catcher Darren Troilo reached base 10 times in three playoff games 
over the weekend, including being hit four times.

announced Monday. Otta will step down as the men's tennis coach, a position he 
has held for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not an easy decision," Otta said. "It's hard to walk away from 
coaching and I'm going to miss being out on the court with the athletes every 
day . . . I'm excited the college administration has put their faith in me to 
handle this position." 
</P>
<P>
 Otta replaces Keith Calkins, who has been the dean of physical education and 
athletics as well as athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 Otta had a mark of 346-71 and won 15 conference titles, 10 Southern California 
titles and five State titles. His teams also won the Ojai invitational title 
five times.

 More people think about money than about sex during an average day, according 
to a survey released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Four out of 10 Americans said they think more often about money than sex, and 
only 13% said they thought more often about sex than money, the survey in the 
June issue of Worth magazine said. Among the rest, 25% said they thought about 
neither, 14% thought equally about both and 8% said they didn't know.

SURVEY FINDS 1 IN 3 HOMES HAS A COMPUTER; POLL: RESPONSES SHOW THE GENDER GAP 
IN PC USE HAS NARROWED, BUT EDUCATION AND INCOME ARE PRONOUNCED FACTORS IN THE 
INCREASED DEMAND FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With stunning speed, information technology has invaded Americans' lives -- 
with one in three households boasting a personal computer and 11 million people 
going on line to connect with information services such as Prodigy or 
electronic bulletin boards, according to one of the largest nationwide polls on 
technology use. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the survey of about 4,000 households, conducted by the Times Mirror 
Center for the People and the Press, found that technology's inroads are 
narrowing the much-discussed gender gap in computer use, the results suggest 
that the spread of technology is starting from the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the survey found that better-educated and more prosperous 
Americans are more likely to buy and use electronic technology. The disparity 
is especially pronounced with computers, as opposed to entertainment devices 
and services. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey adds kindling to the debate over providing universal access to 
information technology. At issue is whether the government should in some way 
assure the poor equal -- or at least minimal -- access to the emerging 
information networks of which today's on-line services are considered 
precursors.  
</P>
<P>
 Although income and technology, like income and information, have always gone 
together, the pronounced income bias of the personal computer revolution has 
some people worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about these disparities," said Anthony Pharr of the Office 
of Communications of the United Church of Christ, which Monday joined several 
other consumer and civil rights groups in asking the Federal Communications 
Commission to promote universal access. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, which includes the Consumer Federation of America, the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People and the Center for Media Education, 
contends that video dial-tone applications filed with the FCC by regional phone 
companies tend to exclude poor and minority areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of traditional forms of communications, such as newspapers and books, 
are moving toward a digitized format, and in the not-too-distant future they 
will be carried over digital computerized networks," Pharr said. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone companies rejected the coalition's criticism, insisting they intend 
to make networks bringing video programs to the home available in all areas. 
The charge that "low-income and minority neighborhoods are being systematically 
excluded is irresponsible and unfounded," said Edward Young, a Bell Atlantic 
Corp. vice president. "Typically, communications services are popular products 
in low-income and minority neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror survey found that electronic technologies other than 
computers are penetrating a broadening spectrum of American households. The 
survey found that about 47% of Americans have a bank debit card and at least 13 
million of them pay at least some of their bills electronically. About 85% of 
households have a videocassette recorder, and 64% are connected to a cable TV 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, only 7% of televisions do what TV sets did in the 1950s: simply provide 
over-the-air broadcast reception. Today, the typical television is wired to a 
host of devices and services such as cable, VCR and video game systems, the 
survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the survey, a college graduate with a household income of $50,000 
a year is three times more likely to own a video camera than a non-graduate who 
earns less than $30,000. But the difference is nearly 5 to 1 for personal 
computer ownership and 10 to 1 for ownership of both a computer and a modem, a 
device that permits access to on-line services. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, among adults, 18% of men but only 9% of women said they use a 
personal computer at home almost daily. Among children described as home 
computer users, 53% were boys and 47% girls. In at least some applications, the 
survey suggests that girls may be the heavier users. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 42% of girls used the computer "often" to do word processing, compared 
to 31% of boys, and girls and boys were equally likely to be frequent users of 
educational games or to draw computer pictures or art. The one area on the 
survey where boys outpaced girls in frequent computer use was in playing 
non-educational games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Center for the People and the Press, established and 
supported by Times Mirror Corp., conducted the technology survey in January and 
February. The margin of error, depending on the group polled, was plus or minus 
two to six percentage points.

PARTNERS TAKE GAMBLE -- AND LOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The team was an unusual one, as it turned out. One of the partners became a 
cop, the other a fugitive from the law. 
</P>
<P>
 While they were together briefly in the late 1980s, Russell Barton and Wayne 
Pedersen had hoped to make a killing by remodeling a two-story, four-bedroom 
home on Newport Beach's Lido Island and selling it for a gain of $100,000 or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they lost everything. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the 
partnership they created to buy and resell the 2,800-square-foot home could not 
overturn a foreclosure sale by later going into bankruptcy court and alleging 
that the sale price was too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton, who eventually became an Orange County deputy sheriff, couldn't be 
reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen also couldn't be reached for comment. But then, even authorities have 
a tough time finding him. The man who once reportedly boasted that he could 
sell anything, including goat manure, disappeared four years ago after pleading 
guilty to four federal counts of mail fraud in a coin-selling scam. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't show up for sentencing, and now there is a federal warrant 
issued for his arrest," said David Hoffer, an assistant U.S. attorney in Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County also is looking for Pedersen, who was known by several aliases, 
including Lynn Wayne Dieltz, after he failed to appear in Superior Court in 
1992 on a perjury charge stemming from an application for state driver's 
licenses under different names. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton and Pedersen formed a partnership in 1987 called BFP to buy the Lido 
Island home at 225 Via Genoa for about $550,000, hoping to renovate it quickly 
and sell it for a profit, said Barton's lawyer, Roy B. Woolsey of Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Houses on Lido Island jumped 50% or more during the 1980s," Woolsey said. 
"They bought materials and had plans, but they never started work on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the down payment to the seller, lawyer Sheldon L. Foreman, was based 
on the value of some rare coins under Pedersen's control. But after Pedersen 
was indicted, Woolsey said, Foreman refused to accept the coins and settled 
instead for a modest amount of cash and a junior mortgage in the amount of 
about $200,000. Foreman couldn't be reached Monday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Imperial Savings Bank in San Diego held the primary mortgage for about 
$350,000, he said. But BFP soon fell behind and couldn't make the monthly 
payments. Imperial eventually issued a notice that it would foreclose on the 
property and sell the house to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedersen forced the partnership into bankruptcy in December, 1988, and Barton 
retained Woolsey to get the petition dismissed. Meantime, though, the 
bankruptcy action halted any sale of the home through foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey said that Imperial gave him and Foreman assurances that they would be 
notified of a new date for the foreclosure sale if the petition were dismissed. 
Foreman had wanted to take over the payments mainly to protect his stake in the 
junior mortgage, Woolsey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bankruptcy petition was dismissed in June, 1989, but Imperial never 
notified them of the new sale date. It sold the house on July, 12, 1989, for 
$433,000 to a purchaser named Paul Osborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, BFP went into bankruptcy voluntarily. The partnership 
sought to use a provision in bankruptcy law that allowed courts to set aside 
earlier transactions if the sale prices were well below the market value. BFP 
argued that the house was worth $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bankruptcy Court refused to undo the foreclosure sale, and the judge's 
decision was upheld by the appellate courts and, Monday, by the U.S. Supreme 
Court. The nation's high court ruled that if foreclosure sales are completed in 
accordance with state laws, then debtors cannot use bankruptcy proceedings to 
unwind the deals -- regardless of the sale prices. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of January, 1990 -- little more than six months after he bought it 
-- Osborne sold the house for $660,000.

U.S. AND JAPAN REPORTEDLY REACH TRADE SETTLEMENT; COMMERCE: THE ACCORD WILL 
ALLOW THE TWO COUNTRIES TO RESUME THEIR MARKET-OPENING TALKS, WHICH COLLAPSED 
IN FEBRUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. and Japanese negotiators broke through a three-month deadlock in 
high-stakes trade talks Monday, forging a compromise that ended five days of 
intense deliberations, according to sources close to the discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade officials from the two countries met last night at the headquarters of 
the U.S. trade representative, putting final touches on an agreement that would 
strike a middle ground between Japanese fears of U.S.-imposed market quotas and 
American demands for measurable results in opening Japan's economy, sources 
said. The accord was to be announced this morning, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement will enable the two countries to resume their so-called 
framework talks, formal market-opening talks that were launched by President 
Clinton in July but collapsed in February after a White House summit with 
Japan's then-prime minister, Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the past week's discussion was about the semantics of the framework 
talks, which had been a major reason for the breakdown in those negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The key points of Monday's compromise, according to U.S. officials, included a 
formal acceptance by the Japanese government that measurable results be the 
gauge of whether the Japanese market has opened to foreign products, as the 
Clinton Administration had sought. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Japanese government agreed that the results-oriented standard 
would apply to specific sectors of the market, not only to the economy as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the United States would assure Japan in writing that it will not 
rely solely on "numerical targets" to determine progress on trade issues. The 
Japanese government had rejected that phrase, saying it was tantamount to 
negotiated market quotas and a form of managed trade. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insist they have never sought assurance of specific market 
share or managed trade. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement should clear the way for working-level negotiators to resume 
meeting on trade disputes in specific sectors, including automobiles, auto 
parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries hope to make progress in settling their differences in those 
areas before Clinton and new Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata are to meet 
at the summit of leaders from the Group of Seven major industrial nations in 
Naples in July. Essentially, the agreement culminates an elaborate series of 
talks about whether to have more talks. The United States and Japan remain at 
loggerheads on a host of critical issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's discussions were only the latest turn in a long-running and deadly 
serious dispute between the world's two largest economies about how to resolve 
their nagging trade differences. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the confrontation is Japan's bloated trade surplus with the 
United States, which this year is expected to top $60 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern that the two governments would be unable to rein in Japan's trade 
surplus -- and the perception that the United States would use a weak dollar to 
bludgeon Japan into concessions -- have tempted currency traders to sell 
dollars, pushing down their value and raising the likelihood that the Federal 
Reserve Board would have to raise interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York on Monday, the dollar traded at 104.36 yen, up from 104.05 on 
Friday. The volatility of the currency markets has helped change perceptions on 
both sides of the Pacific Ocean about the need for visible progress in the 
framework talks. At the time of their February meeting, Clinton and Hosokawa 
each saw domestic political advantages in talking tough. But now both sides are 
rethinking that stance.

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: SHORT OF THE GOAL; MANUFACTURERS SHY AWAY FROM 
WORLD CUP PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the chance to market World Cup merchandise came rolling toward Mickey 
Novak, his reaction was swift. 
</P>
<P>
 He ducked. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, Innovative Time Corp., makes all sorts of time pieces -- from 
Flintstone clocks to National Hockey League watches. But after asking his 
retail clients for their opinions on the World Cup, he decided not to give the 
soccer tournament the time of day. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you do with World Cup Soccer merchandise the day after the World 
Cup?" posed Novak, president of the Carlsbad, Calif., company. "There is no 
value to something that no one wants." 
</P>
<P>
 While it is too early to make any definitive judgment about sales of World Cup 
merchandise -- the monthlong tournament doesn't begin until June 17 -- some 
manufacturers say that initial product sales in the United States are slower 
than they had hoped. Others say they turned down overtures to make World Cup 
products specifically for that reason. And one Los Angeles licensee noted that 
even before the games have begun, he knows of retailers in three major cities 
that have already marked down prices on some World Cup items. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cities, it just hasn't caught on," said Bob Davidson, vice president 
of sales at Los Angeles-based JH Design, which is making $1,500 World Cup 
leather jackets. Although his jackets and hats have so far sold extremely well, 
he said, in Detroit, Dallas and Boston -- three of the nine cities that will 
host the tournament -- sales of World Cup souvenirs by some smaller vendors 
have generally been "cold." 
</P>
<P>
 One Woodland Hills licensee said sales of his World Cup products so far have 
not matched his early hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am disappointed -- particularly based upon my expectations of what could 
have been," said Bob Solomon, president of Dakin Inc., which is making plush 
figures, key chains and coffee mugs. "My initial anticipation was that it would 
be bigger than the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Solomon said, he expects to post only one-fifth of the $25 million in 
sales his company racked up during the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest the real problem is the game itself: Americans have hardly 
embraced the sport, so why would they buy the merchandise? Others say the 
one-month duration of the tournament -- far less than a football or baseball 
season -- is not enough time to mount a massive merchandising campaign. And 
though all of the World Cup games will be televised, the sport has received 
little previous TV exposure in the United States, a fact that could hurt 
product sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a number of the estimated 300 product licensees worldwide -- 100 of 
them American companies -- insist there is gold to be mined from the 
merchandising of the World Cup. Perhaps the biggest market is the 3.5 million 
visitors expected to come to the United States to watch the games. World Cup 
officials project that worldwide merchandise sales could top $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The World Cup is the single largest sporting event in the world," said Ralph 
O. Irizarry, vice president at Time Warner Sports Merchandising, which is 
overseeing the global licensing of World Cup products. "Every year since 1984, 
participation in the sport of soccer has grown in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the merchandise looks nifty enough. Some of the World Cup T-shirts and 
tank tops made by Magic Johnson T's have an ultra-hip, urban look.  
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to be specific, Irizarry said that after a slow start, 
World Cup merchandise sales have recently been snowballing in the United 
States. But two-thirds of the overall product sales will probably take place 
outside of America, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the basic shopper at the Mall of America is concerned, well, I 
doubt they will have much interest in it," said Karen Raugust, editor of the 
Licensing Letter, a Brooklyn, N.Y., newsletter. "There are still many Americans 
who have no idea it's even taking place." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason Mike Dickerson, president of College Concepts, passed up 
World Cup overtures from Time Warner. His company makes boxer shorts with team 
logos, from the National Football League to the National Basketball Assn. But 
he turned thumbs-down to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk factor is too great for us," Dickerson said. "As a merchandiser, we 
need the kind of year-round TV exposure that the NFL and NBA give us that 
soccer cannot." 
</P>
<P>
 Other licensees who signed on are keeping their fingers crossed. "It hasn't 
been like the kind of sales you see during a Michael Jordan championship, but 
no one expected that," said Jay Jacoby, executive vice president at American 
Marketing Works, which is making 30 different T-shirts with World Cup designs 
for Magic Johnson T's. 
</P>
<P>
 At many airport shops -- particularly those in international terminals -- 
sales of World Cup souvenirs appear to be brisk.  
</P>
<P>
 "We already look upon World Cup as a success story," said Richard Hunter, 
North American president of DFS Group, which operates gift shops at airports 
across the country. But Hunter declined to be specific about product sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Davidson of JH Design said retailers are snapping up his World Cup 
leather jackets to sell at $1,500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wealthiest 2% of the people on the planet will come to this event," 
Davidson said. "For our customers, paying $2,000 for a jacket is similar to how 
most people feel spending $20 for a T-shirt." Briefly . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Venice-based Chiat/Day has lost the estimated $6-million ad business for 
Carlsbad, Calif.-based Upper Deck, which moved the account in-house. . . . LA 
Ads Advertising & Marketing has been tapped by Mt. Sinai Memorial Park & 
Mortuary in Los Angeles to handle its ad business. . . . No Excuses Jeans, 
which once featured Marla Maples and Donna Rice in its ads, is about to break a 
new campaign featuring socially conscious ads, including one with the headline: 
"There Are No Excuses for Violence."

SANDOZ TO GOBBLE UP GERBER FOR $3.7 BILLION; ACQUISITIONS: THE SWISS 
CONGLOMERATE SHOCKS MANY ANALYSTS BY OFFERING $53 A SHARE FOR THE U.S. BABY 
FOOD GIANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baby food giant Gerber Products Co., whose foods have been a staple in 
American parents' cupboards for nearly 70 years, agreed Monday to be acquired 
by Swiss pharmaceuticals conglomerate Sandoz Corp. for $3.7 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would allow Gerber, which claims more than 70% of the large but 
stagnant U.S. baby food market, to seek faster growth overseas through Sandoz's 
international network of subsidiaries and distributors. Sandoz, in turn, would 
acquire a well-known U.S. brand name as it expands its own fast-growing food 
business, which includes Ovaltine malted drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 While most analysts praised the deal, many were shocked by the high price 
Sandoz offered: $53 for each Gerber share, or a 53% premium over last week's 
closing price. On Monday, Gerber's shares shot up $15.50 to close at $50.125 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "They paid top dollar," said food industry analyst John M. McMillin at 
Prudential Securities Research. "Gerber has a solid franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Fremont, Mich.-based company's franchise is virtually unknown 
outside the United States, and some analysts questioned Sandoz's high price for 
Gerber, given the costs and tough competition it faces in promoting unfamiliar 
brands in foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerber draws only 10% of its $1.2 billion in sales from overseas. Of 
particular interest have been underdeveloped countries in Eastern Europe and 
Latin America, where commercially made baby foods are not widely available. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at home, a nearly stagnant birthrate in the United States has left 
Gerber, which markets more than 250 varieties of baby food, struggling to boost 
sales and profits. Analysts said its baby food volume declined 2% last year, 
and the company launched a reorganization to cut operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 With birthrates dropping as "the thirtysomethings turn into fortysomethings, 
Gerber needs to be more global to grow, and Sandoz will help them be more 
global," McMillin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joining with Sandoz provides us with opportunities for dynamic growth in a 
much shorter time horizon and with the necessary infrastructure already in 
place in most major markets," said Gerber Chairman and President Alfred 
Piergallini. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz is one the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, selling a 
wide variety of prescription drugs and over-the-counter products, including 
Triaminic cough syrups, TheraFlu and Ex-Lax. However, more than 10% of Sandoz's 
$10.3 billion in sales last year came from its health-related foods group, 
which is also its fastest-growing division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerber's position in North America strengthens our existing base of nutrition 
products there," said Rolf Schweizer, chief executive of Sandoz. "Gerber 
provides synergies for Sandoz with advanced technologies in processing and 
packaging which we can apply in Europe and the Far East." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoz said current Gerber management would run the company as a separate 
subsidiary after the acquisition, which is subject to shareholder and 
government approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded originally as a small fruit and vegetable canning company, Gerber 
entered the baby food business in 1927 when the daughter-in-law of company 
co-founder Frank Gerber suggested selling prepackaged, strained baby foods. 
Until then, most baby food was cooked, mashed and strained at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerber on Monday reported that its fourth-quarter profit for the three months 
ended March 31 tumbled to $25.6 million from $40.6 million a year earlier. The 
company blamed much of the drop on restructuring costs. Baby Food Maker Turns 
Swiss 
</P>

Products, the world's No. 1 maker of baby foods.

NEW INFLATION FEARS PUSH DOW DOWN 24 POINTS; MARKETS: COMMODITY PRICE INDEX 
HITS A 3 1/2-YEAR HIGH, SENDING BOND YIELDS UP SHARPLY. THE DOLLAR ALSO 
SUFFERS.

<P>
 A surprising surge in commodities Monday ignited an inflation scare that 
pushed bond yields sharply higher and sparked a selloff in stocks and the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 agricultural and industrial 
commodities rose 4.67 points to 238.36, up 2% from Friday's close and its 
highest daily close since October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen commodities in the CRB index registered gains, with soybeans leading 
the way on fears of a drought-damaged crop. Only orange juice and oil prices 
were lower in a day of hectic trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean futures prices rocketed to a 10-month high on the Chicago Board of 
Trade as Midwest drought fears mounted. Soybeans for July delivery leaped 29.75 
cents to $7.32 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
 Drought worries also pushed July corn futures up 6.5 cents to $2.75 1/4 a 
bushel, July wheat up 10 cents to $3.36 3/4 and July oats up 4 cents to $1.27 
1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, near-record-low rainfall from Nebraska to northern Illinois -- 
some of the Midwest's most productive farmland -- has led to fears of a crop 
shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, cocoa prices surged 10% to a four-year high on concerns about 
pinched supplies. Coffee futures also continued to rise sharply, and near-term 
gold futures added $3.70 to $389.60 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 The commodity markets' turmoil was the last thing the battered bond market 
needed: Yields zoomed as inflation fears returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year U.S. Treasury bond soared to 7.43% from 
7.30% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates on shorter-term bonds also rose, ahead of the Treasury's sale this week 
of $28 billion in new two- and five-year notes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CRB (index) is way too strong for the bond market to handle," said Jay 
Ferguson, an analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds had just begun to settle down last week, after the Federal Reserve Board 
raised key short-term rates by half a point, at the same time indicating that 
it is finished tightening credit for now. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has been pushing up short-term rates since February in an effort to 
slow the economy and keep inflation from reviving. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gains in key commodities suggest that the economy may still be 
stronger than the Fed wants. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts say commodities are being pushed up in large part by 
professional funds that are pouring money into those markets, in search of the 
next big market "trend." Rising prices attract more buyers, which makes higher 
prices a self-fulfilling prophecy, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, many Wall Streeters worry that the commodity rally is just 
beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was a victim of Monday's inflation jitters. Its value fell to 1.643 
German marks in New York, down from 1.647 on Friday. However, the dollar rose 
slightly against the Japanese yen, to 104.36 from 104.05. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still very bearish about the dollar," said Tom Hoge, vice 
president of corporate currency trading at Bank of New York. With the threat of 
inflation looming, "nobody is comfortable holding American assets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the stock market also fell, but the damage was fairly limited. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials sank 23.94 points to 3,742.41 as bond yields rose. But 
most broad-market indexes lost little ground. The New York Stock Exchange 
composite index slipped 0.80 point to 250.78. 
</P>
<P>
 While stocks held up well, however, traders warned that more trouble for bonds 
will probably reverse stocks' recent gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Food stocks surged after Gerber got a takeover offer from Swiss drug giant 
Sandoz. Gerber soared 15 1/2 to 50 1/8. Among other food issues, CPC 
International jumped 1 7/8 to 48, General Mills gained 1 7/8 to 53 3/4, Kellogg 
leaped 1 5/8 to 52 and Quaker Oats gained 7/8 to 66. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rising interest rates hurt utility stocks again. The Dow utility index fell 
1.32 points to 182.57. Phone utilities were also weak. BellSouth lost 1 to 59 
1/4, U.S. West sank 1/2 to 40, MCI dropped 7/8 to 23 3/8 and Nynex lost 7/8 to 
37 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some tech stocks showed strength, led by Microsoft, up 1 11/16 to 50 9/16, 
and Compaq, up 2 1/4 to 113 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV show producer New World Communications leaped 1 11/16 to 10 5/8 after 
News Corp. decided to make a $500-million investment in the firm. Rival King 
World Productions soared 3 1/4 to 41 on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 226.54 points to 20,568.71, while London's 
FTSE-100 fell 18.9 points to 3,108.4. The Frankfurt market was closed for a 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index added 14.13 points to 2,431.43.

<P>
 A surprising surge in a leading commodity price index Monday to a 3 1/2-year 
high ignited an inflation scare that pushed bond yields sharply higher and 
sparked a big selloff in stocks and the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commodity Research Bureau index of 21 agricultural and industrial 
commodities rose 4.67 points to 238.36, up 2% from Friday's close and its 
highest daily close since October, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen commodities in the CRB index registered gains, with soybeans leading 
the way on fears of a drought-damaged crop. Only orange juice and energy prices 
were lower in a day of hectic trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybean futures prices rocketed to a 10-month high Monday on the Chicago Board 
of Trade as drought fears mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 Soybeans for July delivery leaped 29.75 cents to $7.323 a bushel, the highest 
daily settlement for near-term deliveries since July 19. 
</P>
<P>
 The surge ignited a broad rally in commodity prices, which drove up the key 
market index. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board has raised interest rates four times this year in a 
bid to stamp out inflation. The latest credit tightening last week -- by half a 
point in two key rates -- was viewed favorably by the markets at the time, and 
both stocks and bonds soared. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fear now is that rising commodity prices will filter down through the 
economy and produce price spirals in other goods, pushing up inflation from its 
currently benign pace and damaging the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold closed at $389.60 an ounce on the Comex, up $3.70, while silver fetched 
$5.761 an ounce, up 13.1 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year U.S. Treasury bond soared to 7.43% from 
7.30% at Friday's close, while its price, which moves in the opposite 
direction, fell 1 3/8 points, or $13.75 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CRB (index) is way too strong for the bond market to handle," said Jay 
Ferguson, an analyst at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates. "Inflation fears are 
being stirred once again." 
</P>
<P>
 The rising index also hit the dollar by raising fears of foreign selling of 
dollar-denominated securities. The dollar slumped against the German mark but 
fared better against the Japanese yen on reported progress in U.S.-Japan trade 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising U.S. interest rates, which in the past have tended to support the 
dollar, are now viewed as an indication of rising inflation in U.S. 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.643 marks, down from 
1.647 on Friday. The greenback fetched 104.36 yen, up from Friday's 104.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the higher bond rates spooked the stock market, where the Dow Jones 
average fell 23.94 points to close at 3,742.41. In the broader market, 
declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where 249.42 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 From the opening, the broad market took its cue from bonds, heading steadily 
downward until late in the session, when the Dow average and other stock market 
indicators recovered slightly. At one point, the blue chip indicator was down 
about 40 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher rates make share prices less appealing relative to interest-bearing 
investments and increase the cost of money to corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bright spot on the NYSE was Gerber, which led the most-active list, 
gaining 15 1/2 to 50 1/8 amid merger news. Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical and 
chemical conglomerate, said it will buy the U.S. baby food leader for $53 a 
share, or about $3.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other food stocks rallied with Gerber. Quaker Oats gained 7/8 to 66, 
Campbell Soup added 7/8 to 37 5/8 and Hershey Foods rose 7/8 to 42 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the few Dow components rising on the day, Philip Morris added 1 1/2 to 
55 1/4 on further speculation that it will split its food and tobacco 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * United Airlines parent UAL Corp. rose 1 3/8 to 120 3/4 after UAL revised 
terms of an employee stock ownership plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * New World Communications rose 1 11/16 to 10 5/8. News Corp.'s Fox is making 
a $500-million investment in New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in overseas markets, Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended up 
226.54 points, or 1.11%, at 20,568.71, while London's Financial Times 100-share 
average fell 18.9 points to 3,108.4. The German stock market was closed for a 
public holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index closed up 14.13 points at 2,431.43.

 Microsoft's 'Chicago' Due This Year: The next version of the Windows personal 
computer operating system, the so-called Chicago product, will be out late in 
1994, the company said. Chairman Bill Gates said the product will be more 
powerful and simpler to use than current Windows software, which adds graphic 
icons and point-and-click commands to the DOS operating software that runs 
eight out of 10 PCs. Microsoft is still refining the product and has yet to 
select a trade name for it; Chicago is just a code name.

JUSTICE DEPT., DENNY'S REACH ACCORD IN CIVIL RIGHTS SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has reached a civil rights settlement with the 
nationwide Denny's restaurant chain, which has been hit with dozens of 
allegations of bias against blacks, according to a department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the settlement were not immediately available, according to the 
official, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS reported that Flagstar Cos., the parent company of Denny's, will settle 
the lawsuits by paying $45 million and hiring an outside monitor to check on 
its civil rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The network did not provide the source for the report, saying only that it had 
learned the terms of the settlement between the Justice Department and Flagstar 
Cos. The settlement is to be formally announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar spokeswoman Karen Randall, reached at the company's headquarters in 
Spartanburg, S.C., declined to confirm or deny the report. But she said the 
company's chairman and chief executive, Jerome J. Richardson, would appear at a 
news conference in Washington today concerning "discrimination lawsuit 
settlements." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of black plaintiffs in San Francisco and a group of six black Secret 
Service officers in Maryland sued the company last spring over incidents at 
restaurants at about the same time that the Justice Department announced a 
previous civil rights settlement with Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the original agreement, signed March 26, 1993, Denny's promised to 
retrain its staff and hire a civil rights monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's also has been sued for discrimination by a former employee in Orange 
County and by customers who allege that they were refused service in a 
restaurant in San Diego. It was uncertain on Monday if the reported settlement 
was related to those suits. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil rights monitor works out of the company's regional office in Irvine. 
Joseph P. Russell, most recently a consultant in San Diego, was hired as part 
of a consent decree in which the chain agreed to monitor business practices to 
ensure that discrimination did not occur. The consent decree was signed with 
the U.S. Department of Justice and approved by the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 El Pollo Loco, another Foodstar Cos. Inc. subsidiary, has its headquarters in 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's, one of the best-known national restaurant chains, has since hired a 
minority-owned advertising firm to create a campaign aimed at black patrons who 
may have been alienated by the claims.

JUSTICES CLEAR UP BANKRUPTCY LAW PROPERTY DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A property's sale price at foreclosure, not its market value, determines its 
worth in bankruptcy proceedings, the Supreme Court ruled Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 The 5-4 decision resolves a longstanding dispute in bankruptcy law, and it 
upholds the existing practice in California.Lawyers for the state's lenders and 
title insurers applauded the result and said it removes a cloud that could have 
hung over many recent property sales. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling, which grew out of a tangled transaction involving a Newport 
Beach home, deals a setback to some property owners and creditors in bankruptcy 
proceedings. They argued that they should not have to accept the fire-sale 
prices that can result from a foreclosure sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The high court stepped in to the Newport Beach case to resolve a growing 
dispute in bankruptcy law.  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Bankruptcy Code seeks to protect creditors by disallowing recent 
"fraudulent transfers" of property if it appears the debtor was seeking to hide 
his assets or to transfer them to others. Under the law, a bankruptcy judge can 
void a transfer if the debtor "received less than a reasonably equivalent value 
in exchange" for his property. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on those words, federal courts in some regions, including the U.S. 
appeals court in Texas, have voided foreclosure sales that yielded a price far 
below the accepted market value for the property.  
</P>
<P>
 This approach, if adopted by the high court, would have called into question 
any past foreclosure sales where the price fell well below market value. 
</P>
<P>
 But writing for the court, Justice Antonin Scalia rejected this "radical 
departure" from "over 400 years . . . of Anglo American jurisprudence." A 
foreclosure sale, so long as it is announced and follows lawful rules, 
establishes the accepted price for the property, even if the amount is below 
the earlier established market price, he said.

HIGH COURT BACKS LENDERS IN RULING ON FORECLOSURE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court, in a victory for mortgage lenders, on Monday made it 
harder for debtors to have courts set aside foreclosure sales of property. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arises when a property owner is forced to sell the property at a 
foreclosure sale and files for bankruptcy within a year of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 If the foreclosure sale generated a price that was well below the fair market 
value of the property, some courts set aside the sale, reasoning that the low 
price violates the Bankruptcy Code by harming creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices rejected that practice, ruling 5-4 that a sale can't be set aside 
unless it violated state foreclosure law. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's decision is a victory for mortgage lenders, who argue that courts 
shouldn't be able to set aside foreclosure sales if they were conducted in an 
open manner and didn't involve collusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The case grew out of a savings and loan's foreclosure on a parcel of land in 
Newport Beach, Calif., owned by a real estate partnership. The thrift sold the 
foreclosed property for $433,000 in July, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate partnership, called BFP, filed for bankruptcy court protection 
less than four months later. The partnership asked the Bankruptcy Court to set 
aside the sale, arguing that the property was in fact worth more than $725,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A district court rejected BFP's request, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, affirmed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court ruled that the price obtained at a non-collusive foreclosure 
sale was a "reasonably equivalent" value that was valid under the bankruptcy 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court affirmed that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fair and proper price, or a 'reasonably equivalent value,' for foreclosed 
property, is the price in fact received at the foreclosure sale, so long as all 
the requirements of the state's foreclosure law have been complied," Justice 
Antonin Scalia wrote for the majority.

COLUMBIA / HCA TO MERGE WITH TEXAS-BASED MEDICAL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing its frantic merger activity, Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. agreed 
Monday to acquire Dallas-based Medical Care America, an operator of outpatient 
surgery centers, in a stock transaction valued at more than $860 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia/HCA said the merger, pending federal and shareholder approval, would 
expand its operations in key markets, especially in California, Florida and 
Texas, by adding 96 outpatient centers that offer oncology, orthopedics, 
cardiology and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, Ky.-based Columbia, the nation's largest for-profit hospital 
chain, and Medical Care America said they expect to see efficiencies result 
from combined purchasing contracts, overhead reduction and access to capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Columbia's strategy is to build local delivery networks," said Chief 
Executive Richard Scott. "We want to have hospital, surgery centers, diagnostic 
centers and home health care facilities in the same city so that buyers of 
health care only need to talk to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said nearly 60% of Medical Care America's centers are in 
metropolitan areas where Columbia operates hospitals. Medical Care has eight 
centers in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, which involves an exchange of Columbia stock for Medical Care 
stock, Columbia would pay between $860 million and $892 million, based on the 
average value of Columbia stock for a certain period before the deal closes. 
Columbia would also assume $232 million of Medical Care America's debt, giving 
the deal a total value of roughly $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia/HCA was created in February when Columbia Hospital Corp. and 
HCA-Hospital Corp. of America merged in a $5.7-billion deal. Columbia also 
acquired Galen Health Care Inc. for $3.5 billion in stock last September. DAVID

JUSTICE DEPT., DENNY'S REACH ACCORD IN CIVIL RIGHTS SUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has reached a civil rights settlement with the 
nationwide Denny's restaurant chain, which has been hit with dozens of 
allegations of bias against blacks, according to a department official. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the settlement were not immediately available, according to the 
official, who spoke Monday on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS reported that Flagstar Cos., the parent company of Denny's, will settle 
the lawsuits by paying $45 million and hiring an outside monitor to check on 
its civil rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The network did not provide the source for the report, saying only that it had 
learned the terms of the settlement between the Justice Department and Flagstar 
Cos. The settlement is to be formally announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 Flagstar spokeswoman Karen Randall, reached at the company's headquarters in 
Spartanburg, S.C., declined to confirm or deny the report. But she said the 
company's chairman and chief executive, Jerome J. Richardson, would appear at a 
news conference in Washington today concerning "discrimination lawsuit 
settlements." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of black plaintiffs in San Francisco and a group of six black Secret 
Service officers in Maryland sued the company last spring over incidents at 
restaurants at about the same time that the Justice Department announced a 
previous civil rights settlement with Denny's. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the original agreement, signed March 26, 1993, Denny's promised to 
retrain its staff and hire a civil rights monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's, one of the best-known national restaurant chains, has since hired a 
minority-owned advertising firm to create a campaign aimed at black patrons who 
may have been alienated by the claims.

CONGRESSIONAL NOTICE SOUGHT ON FED FOREIGN EXCHANGE ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of the House Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs Committee is 
accusing the Federal Reserve Board of meddling in U.S. foreign policy by 
participating in a new trilateral commission designed to stabilize Mexico's 
currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), the Fed's fiercest critic in Congress, said 
the agency's participation in the new commission formed by the United States, 
Canada and Mexico raises troubling questions about the ability of an 
independent regulatory body to influence foreign policy when it is subject to 
little congressional supervision.  
</P>
<P>
 In late April, the Fed agreed with the Treasury Department to enter into a 
currency exchange accord with Mexico and Canada. The Fed and Treasury will 
spend $3 billion each to support the commission, which is an outgrowth of the 
North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The currency exchange pact is intended to minimize fluctuations between the 
dollar and the peso, now that the U.S. and Mexican economies are about to 
become closely intertwined under NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said the swap amounts to a "subsidy to Mexico" and that the Fed is 
putting $3 billion of taxpayer money into the deal with no congressional 
oversight. Gonzalez said the currency arrangement will enable the Fed to help 
support the Mexican government in times of crisis, and thus will be able to 
influence foreign policy without having to consult Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 "In truth, this is a loan of U.S. dollars to Mexico," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed officials said the central bank has been involved in similar international 
currency swaps since 1962 and that they have become routine business. 
</P>
<P>
 In its foreign exchange activities, the Fed influences currency rates by 
spending dollars to buy and sell other currencies. The actions are usually 
designed to reduce volatility in currency markets or reduce the impact on 
international financial institutions from another country's currency problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Gonzalez introduced legislation that would force both the Fed and 
the Treasury Department to make more thorough public disclosure of policies 
designed to influence international currency markets, "interventions which 
sometimes mean putting billions of dollars of taxpayers' money at stake," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, the Fed chairman would be required to testify before 
Congress about exchange rate policies and the Treasury secretary would have to 
notify Congress within 24 hours of each time the Fed and Treasury intervened in 
foreign exchange.

 Boeing Co. Sees Sharp Increase in Orders: The company described a rosy future 
for both airlines and plane makers over the next 20 years and said it expects a 
sharp increase in orders for new narrow-body aircraft over the next six 
years.In its annual market survey, Boeing estimated that at least 2,800 new 
planes that seat between 70 and 170 people will be bought by airlines by 2000. 
Boeing's overall estimate of the long-term growth in the airplane market is 
about 2% lower than its estimate of a year ago, said Richard James, vice 
president of marketing for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Boeing 
estimated that $980 billion in new jetliners will be purchased by airlines 
between now and 2013.

FED SAYS BUSINESS LOAN DEMAND IS SURGING; ECONOMY: SURVEY FINDS STRONG CALL FOR 
CREDIT. AN ECONOMISTS GROUP PREDICTS NO SLOWING OF GROWTH BEFORE 1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Demand for business loans is booming, the Federal Reserve Board said Monday, 
while a leading group of corporate economists forecast robust expansion this 
year despite aggressive Fed action to curb the economic pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed surveyed loan officers at 58 domestic banks and 18 U.S. branches of 
foreign banks in May. The central bank was exceptionally frank about its 
findings: "Demand for business credit surged." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the National Assn. of Business Economists, a trade group, 
said in its latest forecast that there is no sign of growth easing before 1995. 
Even then, it sees gross domestic product expanding by 2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real GDP, which grew 2.6% in 1992 and 3% in 1993, is forecast to accelerate 
again to a 3.6% rate of increase in 1994," the NABE summarized. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong business investment -- not consumer spending as in recent years -- will 
be the engine of growth, the economists said, and that will keep corporations 
coming to the bank as they expand their plants and boost output. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times this year, including 
last week's half-percentage-point boost. But the business economists said the 
credit tightening is unlikely to put a damper on business prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really doesn't look like there's much risk for '94," NABE President 
William Dunkelberg told a news conference. "This year, what the Fed has done 
with rates will not impact growth substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's own survey of lending officers at banks suggested that, aside from 
home mortgages, demand for virtually every other type of credit is strong. Not 
only that, but banks are making it easier to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "As in the last several surveys, the results show an easing of terms and 
standards on loans to both businesses and households," the Fed said, even for 
commercial real estate loans that were once frowned on by bankers after the 
building excesses of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed pointed out that the February survey "represented the first . . . sign 
of an easing in standards for commercial real estate loans since the 
significant tightening in 1990-91."  
</P>
<P>
 Home mortgage demand slowed a bit by May, the Fed found. It said that probably 
reflected rising mortgage rates and that some banks experienced substantial 
declines. The average monthly interest rate on mortgages bottomed in August and 
has risen substantially since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed said that between one-third and half of all the banks that responded 
to its survey said demand for business loans strengthened considerably over the 
past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 That fits with the generally buoyant picture presented by the business 
economists' survey, which said 1994 is getting better all the time.

 Continental Cablevision to Offer GTE's Two-Way TV Service: The two companies 
said they will work together to provide two-way television to Continental's 
customers in Massachusetts and New Hampshire during the next three years. 
Continental, one of the nation's largest cable operators, will incorporate GTE 
Corp.'s "Main Street" interactive service into systems that reach about 500,000 
homes in the two states. The service includes much of what people find in 
computer on-line services -- news, travel guides and shopping choices -- but 
instead of using computer keyboards, viewers use TV remote controls.

PUC'S ELECTRIC POWER DEREGULATION PLAN IS DEBATED; UTILITIES: FIRST LEGISLATIVE 
HEARING DRAWS ADVOCATES FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE -- AND A MOSTLY NEGATIVE 
REACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early battle lines were drawn Monday over the state Public Utilities 
Commission's proposal to lower California's electricity rates through 
broad-scale deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The first formal -- and mostly negative -- reactions to the PUC plan came from 
a long line of California's three big investor-owned electric utilities and 
their customers, environmentalists, consumer advocates and independent power 
producers at a packed joint hearing conducted at the Capitol by Gwen Moore 
(D-Los Angeles), chairwoman of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, 
and Byron D. Sher (D-Palo Alto), chairman of the Assembly Natural Resources 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Moore said, the hearing arose out of concern that the commission is 
"trying to railroad through" its proposal without adequate fact-finding and 
public debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sher said he is concerned both by the PUC's "breathless" pace for public 
debate of the plan and by the fact that the plan "appears to be inconsistent" 
with long-held state policies to protect the environment and require a diverse 
mix of electricity-producing fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 PUC President Daniel W. Fessler repeatedly stressed that the commission 
proposal was released to stimulate such debate, and he announced a beefed-up 
series of PUC public hearings over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not interested in pursuing this matter in haste," he told the 
legislators, noting that the options for restructuring the electric utilities 
have been under debate for more than 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Fessler said the first public hearing is scheduled for June 14 in Los Angeles, 
and a second will be held in San Francisco or Sacramento on July 1. Two more at 
undecided locations are tentatively set for July 21 and Aug. 4. "And a fifth 
and a sixth if needed after that," Fessler said, insisting that he plans to 
cast "the widest possible net" to elicit public views of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 20, the PUC announced its plan for a broad restructuring of 
California's electric utilities, designed to bring down the state's relatively 
high electric power rates by creating a competitive marketplace for all power 
customers by 2002 -- from big industrial users to individual residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some states and other nations have their own plans for deregulation, 
California's is by most measures the farthest-reaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Any plan would also have to be reconciled with current state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an important new direction," Sher said before the start of the 
hearing, "and if it goes forward it will clearly need legislative involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 A major concern about the PUC plan is the prospect of an invasion of utilities 
from other states into a newly opened California market. 
</P>
<P>
 These utilities could be expected to strongly compete with California power 
companies, in large part because they would not have to meet California's 
demanding air pollution or energy diversity standards at generating facilities 
in their home states, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a 30-member group representing about 70% of the 
high-voltage-transmission entities in 11 western states announced the formation 
of the Western Regional Transmission Assn., conceived to solve the sort of 
logistical problems that retail competition would create. The group is led by 
Portland, Ore.-based PacifiCorp., a large utility that has long wanted to enter 
the California market. 
</P>
<P>
 But any PUC plan would require "reciprocal rights" for California utilities to 
compete in other service territories, Fessler said Monday. He noted that he has 
met with utility representatives throughout the western states and Canada in 
the past month and expects to discuss such reciprocity issues with Mexican 
officials soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates objected that only consumers -- and not utility 
shareholders -- are called on to pay for expensive nuclear power plants and 
other investments that would become uneconomical in a competitive retail power 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists condemned what they described as the plan's promotion of low 
energy prices -- "the cheapest electron" -- without regard to reliance on 
foreign oil, reliability of the electric power or environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
 Fessler, promising to answer a barrage of other questions in writing, said he 
expects that by October the commission will have acquired enough information 
and comment to agree on "the broad outline of where to go from here."

U.S., JAPAN PREPARING TO RECONVENE TALKS ON TRADE SURPLUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Japan are expected to announce today that they have 
found enough common ground to reconvene their trade negotiations, official 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials cautioned that further talks were to take place later Monday and 
that the scenario could yet change. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going to see an American side that's pleased, because what there is 
is an agreement on the Japanese side of a result-oriented approach," said one 
source close to the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations aimed at narrowing Japan's $131-billion trade surplus with the 
United States broke down in February. Representatives of both sides have been 
meeting here since Thursday, trying to get the talks back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any change of plan Monday night, an official announcement that the two 
sides plan to resume talks shortly can be expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get moving. There's a strong sense that they want to roll up 
their sleeves and get to work," one source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks collapsed in large part due to differences over U.S. insistence on 
"objective criteria" for measuring progress toward opening Japan's markets. 
That issue remained something of a sticking point in the current consultations, 
one source said. But another source said U.S. officials would be "very 
satisfied" on the issue.

$1-BILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST CHARLES KEATING ASSOCIATE UPHELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court upheld a $1-billion judgment against a former Arizona 
developer and business associate of Charles H. Keating Jr., but it is unlikely 
that investors in Keating's real estate and financial empire who won the 
verdict will collect anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the award 
against Conley D. Wolfswinkel for his role in the 1989 collapse of Lincoln 
Savings & Loan in Irvine and its parent company, American Continental Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfswinkel, a Tempe entrepreneur who lost a fortune when the Arizona real 
estate market fell, has filed a bankruptcy petition to reorganize his debts and 
may be unable to pay much of the judgment, said Leonard B. Simon, a San Diego 
lawyer for American Continental investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court said Wolfswinkel acted as a straw borrower who took part in 
sham real estate deals that generated artificial profits for American 
Continental and Lincoln. The S&L is the second most expensive thrift failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating, American Continental's chairman, is serving state and federal prison 
terms.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; TED TURNER LOCKS HORNS WITH WWF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forget about alliances with a home shopping network and sophisticated forays 
on the information superhighway. After conquering cable television, Hollywood 
and the world of professional sports, Ted Turner wants to put a body slam on 
the World Wrestling Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The cable mogul is spending liberally to make his World Championship Wrestling 
a serious challenger to the WWF, which has dominated the mat for more than 10 
years. So set is Turner on victory that he's even trying to wrestle the 
legendary champion Hulk Hogan back into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's motivation is partly personal, since he wrestled in high school and 
calls himself a committed fan. He may also see a rare opportunity to gain the 
upper hand in the battle of the bulging, with WWF owner Vincent McMahon Jr. on 
the ropes, proclaiming his innocence against charges that he illegally 
distributed bodybuilding steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the sports business and I consider wrestling sports," Turner said. 
"It's sports-o-tainment. Why put any limitation on it? We want to be the 
champs." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional wrestling, with its staged fights and pumped-up rivalries, made a 
major comeback in the 1980s, thanks to cable and pay-per-view TV. It still 
generates annual gross revenue of $500 million to more than $1 billion, though 
some feel it is in decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner acquired WCW in the 1970s and used it as a programming cornerstone of 
his TBS Network. Only recently has he started making serious noises about 
challenging his bigger rival. Eric Bischoff, WCW's executive producer, said the 
network's wrestling events routinely draw higher ratings than Turner's sports 
teams or reruns of popular sitcoms. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason apparently is the money spent on the wrestling presentations. "It 
compares with the production values of everything else for sale," Bischoff 
said. "We've dressed the arena more. We've added cameras. We use digitally 
enhanced audio . . . sophisticated graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 While TBS doesn't separate out wrestling revenue or costs, the relatively 
cheap programming can be endlessly repackaged for syndication. Live, 
pay-per-view events are also big moneymakers. Bischoff says the company will 
produce 400 hours of matches this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Hogan back into the ring would go a long way toward raising WCW's 
profile. The 6-foot, 6-inch star, who inspired a $1.7-billion merchandising 
empire at the height of his popularity, lately has shown more interest in 
acting than wrestling, but his Los Angeles attorney called the WCW talks 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in very, very serious discussions with Turner. It will be an 
unprecedented deal if it happens," said the attorney, Henry Holmes. He 
indicated that the agreement would cover entertainment and merchandising as 
well as Hogan's wrestling performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner has already invested heavily in other celebrity wrestlers. One WCW star 
is Sting -- not the singer, but a bleached-blond native of Venice, Calif., with 
a painted face whose fans are called "Little Stingers." His WCW colleagues 
include Ric (Nature Boy) Flair, Dusty (The Natural) Rhodes, the Nasty Boys, 
Ravishing Rick Rude and Jesse (The Body) Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, who, by his own account, wrestled without much success as a teen-ager, 
says that all these moves to build the WCW have the WWF on the run. "We're 
getting our act together," he said. "It's like the Hawks and the Braves. That 
took 15 years. But we're getting to them." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the WWF is handling the pressure pretty well. Steve Planamenta, the 
group's director of communications, says Turner is trying to create an illusion 
of fierce rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If their goal is to improve their product for the benefit of the fans, 
they're to be commended for those efforts," he said, "but we don't really see 
them as competition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the "drastic differences" between the two, said Planamenta, is the WWF's 
"strong story lines and themes." He said the WWF also puts on many more live 
shows each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not one leg of a media conglomerate, like the WCW," he said. "This is 
all we do. We're doing two live shows a night almost every night of the week. 
We will do 100 shows in Europe this year. . . . We're on more than 200 
syndicated stations. Plus, we do five pay-per-view events a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the WWF feels threatened or not, the battle of words between the two 
groups already is becoming as ugly as any match. Planamenta says Turner's 
pay-per-view events are "too bloody." Turner, referring to alleged steroid use 
in professional wrestling, makes a point of saying his athletes are "clean." 
</P>
<P>
 "We would love to match drug tests with that organization any time," 
Planamenta said. "We have the most comprehensive drug-testing policy in sports 
or entertainment today."

 From Chaos to Blizzard: Chaos Studios, a developer of video and computer games 
in Costa Mesa, has changed its name to Blizzard Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is to reflect its new ownership.Davidson & Associates in 
Torrance, an education software company, bought Chaos Studios earlier this year 
in a $6.75-million stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa game company, which formerly developed games for other 
publishers, will publish its own games as a result of an infusion of money from 
Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason is that the rights to the Chaos name were owned by a small 
holding company in New York, Chaos Technologies, which also owns a video game 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Adham, president of Blizzard, said Chaos Studios couldn't afford to pay 
for those rights, so the name was changed to Blizzard, which had a nice ring to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still the same lovable company," he said.

IBM VETERAN HIRED TO TURN AROUND PLATINUM; COMPUTERS: DAVID R. PROCTOR BECOMES 
PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER OF TROUBLED SOFTWARE FIRM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David R. Proctor, a 23-year IBM veteran, has been hired as president and chief 
operating officer of troubled accounting software firm Platinum Software Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor, 54, faces the challenge of turning around Irvine-based Platinum in 
the wake of an accounting scandal that forced its four top executives to resign 
on April 18. He will report to Carmelo J. Santoro, a board member who became 
chief executive after founder Gerald Blackie quit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor has experience both as the head of a large software enterprise and as 
a turnaround specialist. He served as vice president of IBM's personal software 
products division, which creates IBM's personal computer software line, 
including its flagship OS/2 operating system. 
</P>
<P>
 He left IBM in 1990 to become chief operating officer of Torrance-based 
Ashton-Tate Corp., a money-losing database software publisher. Partly through 
his efforts, the company returned to profitability and was bought in October, 
1991, by rival Borland International Corp. of Scotts Valley, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Proctor has served as a consultant to Candle Corp., a Santa 
Monica-based maker of software that evaluates computer performance; and filled 
a couple of short-term positions at Xerox Corp.'s computer and software-related 
divisions. He rejoined IBM last year to develop IBM's key operating system, 
which controls the basic functions of a personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor said he was looking for another challenge when Santoro asked for his 
help. The two men struck a deal within four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say I'm pleased is the understatement of the millennium," Proctor said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor, designated by Santoro to handle Platinum's day-to-day operations, 
will have his hands full. Among his challenges will be to restore investor and 
customer confidence in a company that acknowledged it misreported its revenue 
by $18 million; to maintain employee morale in the wake of a $15 million 
restructuring that could lead to layoffs of a third of the company's 820 
employees; and to return the company to profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also faces an investigation by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most software companies stub their toes at some point," he said. "I believe 
that they can recover if they act fast, keep their focus and reassure customers 
by giving them an honest appraisal of how things are at the company. This job 
is a hot seat, and that's what makes it fun." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, Santoro has completely remade Platinum. Two weeks ago the 
company hired Michael Simmons, another former Santoro associate, as chief 
financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Santoro announced a restructuring in which the company will focus 
on its core accounting software products. It will sell off most of its 
international sales divisions and operate three "profit centers," or units with 
their own profit and loss responsibility, where before there was none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we're done with the planning and setup phase," Santoro said. "Now 
the difficult job begins." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve DeLuca, an analyst at investment bank Cruttenden & Co. in Irvine, said 
Monday, "It's nice to see them fill the management holes quickly. . . . Now 
they have to execute." 
</P>
<P>
 Platinum's stock, at $10 a share when it disclosed the inflation of its sales 
figures, rose $0.50 to $5.875 Monday on Nasdaq. Profile:

BUYERS LURED BY LOW PRICES BOOST HOME SALES BY NEARLY 28%

<P>
 Orange County housing sales jumped by nearly 28% in April as buyers continued 
to take advantage of low home prices, according to figures released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 3,260 new and existing homes were sold during April, compared to 
2,549 transactions for April, 1993 -- an increase of 27.9%, according to TRW 
Redi Property Data, a real estate data company in Riverside.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a continuation of what we've seen since the beginning of the year," 
said Nima Nattagh, market analyst for TRW. "This bodes well for everyone in the 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first four months of 1994, Orange County home sales increased 34.8% 
from the same period a year earlier, TRW reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Nattagh noted that a recent rise in interest rates is nudging some prospective 
buyers off the fence, especially those who want to take advantage of the 
current low prices. The average price of an Orange County home sold in April 
was $237,496, compared to $240,390 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County market -- which showed the largest percentage increase in 
April homes sales among the six Southern California counties -- continues to be 
driven by entry-level or first-time home buyers. More than 35% of homes sold 
here in April were priced below $175,000. April Home Sales Top 1993 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales of new and existing homes in Orange County jumped nearly 28% in 
April compared to the same month last year. The average selling price dipped 
slightly:

</P>
<P>
 Strong home sales this year are being driven by high demand for entry-level 
houses. In April, more than a third of homes resold in Orange County went for 
less than $175,000--a slight increase from last year. April sales by price

 Carmelo J. Santoro, the new head of Platinum Software Corp. in Irvine, joked 
about his new role during the first innovation awards ceremony of the Orange 
County Council of the American Electronics Assn.

<P>
 Santoro, emcee for the event last week, said his latest high-tech job is 
learning how to defend a company against class-action lawsuits. Santoro, a 
Platinum board member, had to take over the company after shareholder suits led 
to the discovery of accounting irregularities.

BULLET GOLF SUES USGA FOR $20 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A golf equipment maker filed a lawsuit Friday in Orange County Superior Court 
against the United States Golf Assn., claiming that the organization hindered 
the company's sales by refusing to designate its new golf club as conforming to 
USGA standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet Golf Inc., which had revenue last year of about $50 million, asks for 
$20 million in damages in the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Santa Ana company began marketing a club that features a 
notched head. But the USGA said the product does not fit its requirement that 
clubs be "plain in shape," rendering its use illegal in tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very subjective opinion," said Bullet Golf President Steve Dunn. "For 
whatever reason, they don't like the way the club looks -- and because of that, 
I'm not able to market a product in our free-enterprise system."

 A Different Reality: Gemini Technology Corp. in Irvine has stopped doing work 
for Visions of Reality. But Gemini, a defense simulation software company, is 
still in the virtual reality business. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Morrow, vice president at Gemini, said his company began launching other 
virtual reality game projects after San Francisco-based Visions of Reality 
project stalled earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 In virtual reality, players can immerse themselves in a three-dimensional 
computer-animated world. Wearing headsets, they can look around in any 
direction and see a computer illusion. Gemini's technology is based on military 
projects, such as F-15 fighter simulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Visions of Reality, which planned to open a virtual reality amusement center 
in Newport Beach's Fashion Island, received wide press coverage, including 
articles in Time magazine, Wired magazine, The Los Angeles Times, the Orange 
County Register and a segment on the Oprah Winfrey TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company said last week that its project is stalled because of a legal 
dispute with Irvine-based Black Diamond Group, which was hired to launch the 
initial entertainment center. The two companies blame each other for the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemini made game software for one of Visions of Reality's subcontractors, 
defense contractor Kaiser Electro Optics in Carlsbad, which has also decided to 
forge ahead without Visions of Reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Gemini's creations is a car racing game hooked up to a motion simulator, 
which shakes the player around like a real race car. Morrow said he hopes his 
games will hit the market soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "This delay is bad for the whole industry," Morrow said. "We want to see 
virtual reality get off the ground."

YOU CAN'T CALL HIM AL; THAT'S BECAUSE HE'S JOHNNY SPAMPINATO, WHO'S TAKING THE 
BIG GUY'S PLACE IN NRBQ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joey Spampinato knows what it's like to play alongside rock superstars. Now he 
is finding out what it's like to play alongside his kid brother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spampinato, 45, has spent his entire adult life as the bassist for NRBQ, a 
band legendary for its omnivorous and adventurous take on rock 'n' roll and for 
its sheer endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1967, when Spampinato hooked up with keyboards player Terry Adams, 
the band has survived more or less intact without ever having scored a hit or 
graduated from its grueling circuit of club gigs. 
</P>
<P>
 On a good night, as it careens from rockabilly to effervescent pop to 
space-jazz, the idiosyncratic Q is purely wonderful in its display of highly 
honed skill and its willingness to be downright dizzy in the quest of fun. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, rock's royalty has taken notice of Spampinato's work. Keith 
Richards drafted him into the band that backed Chuck Berry in the film "Hail! 
Hail! Rock 'n' Roll," and that led to an invitation from Eric Clapton to back 
him on a series of blues gigs in London. During his run with Clapton, 
Spampinato rang up Paul McCartney and wound up paying his hero a house call 
that became a jam session. 
</P>
<P>
 One musician he says he never got to play with was Johnny Spampinato, his 
younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 But now they are making up for lost time. When Al Anderson resigned earlier 
this year from NRBQ after a 22-year run as the band's guitarist, Adams, 
Spampinato and drummer Tom Ardolino quickly called on Johnny Spampinato to take 
over. The new lineup plays the Coach House tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the ever-scowling "Big Al" was a brilliant, utterly unorthodox 
player, a strong, sweet-toned singer and a writer of many a Q staple, he left a 
lot of space to fill when he quit the band after a New Year's Eve gig in New 
York.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spampinato said that, while nothing was spoken, the other band members could 
tell that Anderson had become discontented and was looking for a change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying it's his fault, but it was starting to get to everybody, the 
way things were," Spampinato said, adding that he wanted it understood that 
there is no feud and that the parting was amicable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still friends with Al and want him to be successful, whatever he's 
going to do. Leaving made him happier, and indirectly it made us happier." With 
the younger Spampinato in the band, "I think everybody is perked up." 
</P>
<P>
 Spampinato said there was no debate as to who should take over as the third 
player to occupy the NRBQ guitar chair (Anderson was preceded by Steve 
Ferguson). 
</P>
<P>
 "(Johnny Spampinato) was like our biggest fan from when he was a kid. He knows 
the ins and outs of this band, the pulse of it, the spirit of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, the left-handed guitar player brings solid credentials, having played 
for seven years with the Incredible Casuals, a well-regarded Massachusetts band 
known for its pure-pop flair and strong harmonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Spampinato wrote some catchy songs on the Casuals' two independent albums and 
displayed a strong voice that should fit nicely in a close-harmony blend with 
Joey's similar chesty-but-sweet tenor. 
</P>
<P>
 As Joey puts it, "we have the sibling vocal chords. Me and Al always sang well 
together, we could blend pretty well. With me and Johnny, it will just fall in 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 NRBQ's recently released album, "Message for the Mess Age," was recorded with 
Anderson, who contributed two strong numbers, "A Little Bit of Bad" and the 
fetching ballad "Another Word for Love." Now NRBQ is in the middle of a 
four-month tour that is introducing a new guitarist, as well as the new album. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started, we thought (the lineup change) might have been a 
concern -- fans might have thought, 'Without Big Al, what's going to happen?' 
But we haven't heard anything (negative) about it. They liked what they saw and 
heard, and it's going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "Message for the Mess Age" is on Forward, a new imprint started by Rhino 
Records to showcase current material as opposed to the reissues and 
compilations for which Rhino is best known. 
</P>
<P>
 For NRBQ, it marks a return to the independent ranks after a major-label fling 
in 1989 with Virgin Records. The Virgin album, "Wild Weekend," was a vibrant 
collection, but it failed to substantially lift NRBQ's fortunes, despite the 
band's opening slots on major tours by R.E.M. and Bonnie Raitt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never based our staying together on the hit-record syndrome," Spampinato 
said. "We had a different mission than that. We've been the route of a major 
label, and we didn't see a real major difference. They were supposed to have 
more ins to the radio stations, but we didn't notice any difference." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NRBQ takes a poke at the mass-marketing of rock music in one of its new songs, 
the Spampinato-Adams collaboration "Big Dumb Jukebox." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're makin' me sick with the same old selection," sings the band whose 
career has been based on mixing things up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody can sit back and point fingers, but generally speaking, I think music 
has (tended to stay) in one place a little too long," Spampinato said. "I loved 
Jimi Hendrix, but everybody copied him, and it went on too long. Or the Led 
Zeppelin thing had gone on too many years. People like it, I guess, but I 
thought music was supposed to change more than that." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Spampinato said, is what makes NRBQ's first personnel switch since 
Ardolino's arrival in 1974 a healthy development. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt like anything was forever. I don't think I go for that 
'permanent' idea. Musicians are supposed to be spontaneous. If you keep relying 
on something for so long, you're bound to be stuck in the mud. Now we're in a 
new situation, and we go on." 
</P>
<P>

SURPRISE PICK: 'PULP FICTION'; CANNES REPORT: QUENTIN TARANTINO'S FILM IS THE 
THIRD MOVIE ABOUT THE UNDERBELLY OF AMERICAN LIFE TO WIN THE PALME D'OR IN THE 
LAST SIX YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in the last six years, the Cannes Film Festival awarded its 
Palme d'Or to an American lowlife serenade, Quentin Tarantino's showy salute to 
the cool and the crazy, "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the most talked about film at the festival, though not necessarily 
the most admired, "Pulp Fiction" follows in the footsteps of the 1990 Palme to 
David Lynch's "Wild at Heart" and the 1991 Palme to the Coen brothers' "Barton 
Fink." Still, its selection surprised many in the Palais du Festival audience, 
including one woman who was so upset she began screaming at the writer-director 
as he tried to begin his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino, whose first film, "Reservoir Dogs," was a similarly audacious look 
at gangsters both violent and loquacious, said he too was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never expect to win anything when a jury has to decide," he said, "because 
I don't make the kinds of movies that bring people together. I make the kinds 
of movies that split people apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarantino then thanked his extensive cast, which includes John Travolta in a 
charming performance that can't help but put some oomph into his career, 
saying, "when they got finished, they turned a pretty good script into an 
obsolete document." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two films by celebrated directors shared the Grand Prix du Jury, Cannes' 
runner-up award. They were Zhang Yimou's "To Live" from China and Nikita 
Mikhalkov's "Burnt by the Sun" from Russia, an extraordinarily evocative and 
humanistic film about the Soviet Union on the eve of Stalin's purges that stars 
both the director and his charming 6-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since "To Live," an intimate epic about 20th-Century Chinese history, has not 
found favor with that country's authorities, Zhang Yimou was not allowed to 
attend the festival. His award was accepted by his star, Gong Li, who minutes 
before had shed a rare public tear when her co-star, Ge You, thanked her after 
winning the prize for best actor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ge You's award was yet another festival surprise; the actor himself did a 
double take when his name was announced. He beat out several more prominent 
actors, including Albert Finney in "The Browning Version" and Jean-Louis 
Trintignant in Krysztof Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red." In fact, the 
Kieslowski film, probably the best liked across the board at the entire 
festival, ended up with no prizes at all.  
</P>
<P>
 Also unexpectedly getting two prizes was the operatic French historical epic 
"Queen Margot," which even French critics have not been high on. It won a jury 
prize, "for originality," as well as the best actress award, not for star 
Isabelle Adjani, but rather for veteran Italian actress Virna Lisi, who played 
her monstrous mother, Catherine de Medici. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisi, in tears from beginning to end, thanked the historical Catherine, "an 
incredible woman to have given me this character to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other French entrants, Michel Blanc's engaging "Gross Fatigue," a 
Gallic "The Player" about a double who makes a movie star's life miserable, 
also took two awards, one for screenplay (given for the first time in 10 years) 
and one for technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
 And the coveted Camera d'Or for the best film in the entire festival also went 
to a French production, "Petit Arrangements Avec Les Morts," directed by 
Pascale Ferran. Since this film showed in the subtitle-less Cinemas En France 
section, it got away from most American writers. Aside from "Pulp Fiction," the 
American film that did best at Cannes was Kevin Smith's engaging "Clerks," the 
hit of the Sundance Film Festival. It won both the Prix de la Jeunesse, 
awarded, as the name indicates, by a jury of young people, and the same Critics 
Week prize that in previous years went to "Cronos" and "Man Bites Dog." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost lost in all this Franco-American excitement was the best director 
prize, which went to the Italian Nanni Moretti for his "Caro Diario," a wry and 
idiosyncratic satire on life in Italy very much, it was universally agreed, in 
the manner of Woody Allen. A bit dumbfounded by his award, like almost everyone 
else in this most unexpected of Cannes ceremonies, Moretti simply shrugged and 
said, "Thank you very much. I can't think of anything else to say."

TAKING A BIG LEAP FROM 'JUMP STREET'; AFTER FINDING SUCCESS IN THE '80S ON THE 
POLICE SHOW, DUSTIN NGUYEN IS MOVING INTO FILMS AND 'SEAQUEST' WHILE SHARPENING 
HIS MARTIAL ARTS SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even with a growing number of movie roles, including one in Oliver Stone's 
"Heaven and Earth," actor Dustin Nguyen finds he is still best known for his 
four-season stint in the late '80s on the teen-throb hit "21 Jump Street" as 
Det. Harry Ioki, an undercover police officer who infiltrated high schools with 
co-star Johnny Depp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now, people still recognize me from 'Jump Street,' " Nguyen says 
good-naturedly during an early-morning interview at a Beverly Boulevard 
coffeehouse. "People still write in because they're watching it now (in 
different countries)." 
</P>
<P>
 But the 31-year-old Vietnamese actor is finally jumping off from his "Jump 
Street" fame, into both feature roles -- including the buffoonish villain Glam 
in the current "3 Ninjas Kick Back"-and TV, in his new role as Chief Helmsman 
William Shan on NBC's "seaQuest DSV." 
</P>
<P>
 Just now, Nguyen is taking a deserved break, relaxing in his mid-Wilshire area 
apartment and thinking about looking for an apartment near Orlando, Fla., where 
"seaQuest" will start production this fall. Dressed casually in jeans, a blue 
shirt and a black coat, he talks about how he's spending his time off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to a lot of bookstores," says Nguyen, adding that he's also studying 
martial arts and catching up with his friends. "I like to read a lot of Eastern 
poetry. . . . To go to a Hollywood party is kind of weird. I don't know what 
that's all about. I go to the movies a lot, or I stay home and watch my laser 
discs." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen's calm manner and low-key lifestyle might seem odd for a young actor 
who first won attention playing a hot-shot cop on a hot-shot series and who has 
become so in demand, but his background is also far from typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Vietnam, Nguyen fled with his family when Saigon fell in 1975. After 
stopping in Guam and being transferred to a refugee camp in Arkansas, the 
family moved to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The language barrier he faced made him painfully shy in school, but Nguyen 
gained some self-confidence studying tae kwon do, earning a second-degree black 
belt at 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at Southern California's Orange Coast College, Nguyen says he remained 
"very shy, to the point of it being a handicap." At the suggestion of a friend, 
he took his first acting class, hoping it would improve his public speaking 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't immediate, 'Wow -- this is my calling,' but it was good for me on a 
personal level," says Nguyen, who was already interested in film at that time. 
"I saw a lot of similarities (to martial arts) in terms of self-discovery and 
self-knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen quickly found an agent, and he won his first part in 1984 as a young 
Cambodian freedom fighter on a two-hour special episode of "Magnum, P.I." He 
played Suki on "General Hospital" for almost a year and did some television 
guest-star work before starting "Jump Street" in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been in several films, including "Heaven and Earth," in 
which he played the main character's brother, and he started work on "3 Ninjas" 
last May. 
</P>
<P>
 In the film, the agile martial arts expert plays an inept, clumsy villain and 
spends most of the movie being beaten up by three school-age ninjas-in-training 
as he attempts to steal a ceremonial dagger from their grandfather.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was on the receiving end, which is why I wanted to do it," Nguyen says. "I 
was more than happy to take the fall -- I love slapstick comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes science fiction, which he says adds to the attraction of his new 
role on "seaQuest." The part was written for him by executive producers David 
Burke and Patrick Hasburgh and is one of several changes planned to make the 
low-rated show, which is also executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, more 
action-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has great physical grace," Burke said. "He's very strong with the martial 
arts. He can present a physically dangerous quality and he's a quiet person." 
</P>
<P>
 As Helmsman Shan, Nguyen will take orders from the ship's captain and convey 
them to the helmsmen who actually steer. "I basically walk around and make sure 
they're not crashing the ship," Nguyen says.  
</P>
<P>
 As for his priorities, he says, "I made it a very strong priority to develop 
myself as an actor first. Now I have to prove myself as a martial artist, which 
is kind of ironic -- but I'd rather have it that way than to have to prove 
myself as an actor."

O.C. TREKKERS SEE LAST 'NEXT' FIRST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leave it to those Trekkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday night, leaders of five local chapters of the International Federation 
of Trekkers -- using information transmitted through space at the speed of 
light -- were able to view the final episode of "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation" the day before it happened! 
</P>
<P>
 They knew, you see, that studios customarily feed programs early to affiliate 
stations around the country, so the stations will have time to insert local 
commercials before the programs are shown. The Trekkers also knew, having read 
a satellite guide that lists such things, that the East Coast feed of "The Next 
Generation" would be Sunday night -- a full day before the actual broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
 At which point, it simply became a matter of tapping into the feed. The 
satellite dish of Hof's Bar and Grill on East Imperial Highway was all they 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After seven seasons exploring new worlds of syndicated success -- four more 
than the original "Star Trek" series -- "The Next Generation" finally is being 
transported to rerun land. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of the original crew -- Capt. Kirk, "Bones" and Spock -- elicited 
from devotees an emotional call to "live long and prosper" -- which the crew 
went on to do in half a dozen movies. At Hof's, though, the general feeling was 
-- in the words of Anaheim's John Rigoni -- "You gotta go on." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a transition, I guess," said David Lee of Diamond Bar, 
commander of the International Federation's USS Arleigh Burke chapter. " 'Star 
Trek' is like a part of life, kind of like a neighbor, and now they're moving. 
You have to get used to the emptiness. . . We just have to live with the 
reruns." 
</P>
<P>
 He popped open a bottle of champagne while those around him -- appropriately 
suited, of course -- enjoyed a blue libation (Romulan ale, perhaps?). To lead 
up to the main event, the Trekkers screened the first "Next Generation" 
episode; an episode of "Deep Space Nine," a "Next Generation" spinoff that will 
continue; an episode of "seaQuest DSV" ("that's 'Star Trek' underwater,' Lee 
said), and Lee's own footage of the filming of "Star Trek: Generations," a 
movie due in November. ("Next week they're going to be shooting in Pasadena," 
Lee confided. "Talk to the security guards; they're nice people.") 
</P>
<P>
 They also watched "Journey's End: The Saga of 'Star Trek: The Next 
Generation,' " about the making of the final episode, in its actual time-slot, 
Sunday at 9. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Leeanne Laughlin of Huntington Beach, commander of the IFT's 
Volana chapter -- and a biologist with the California Department of Fish and 
Game who credits "Star Trek" with launching her interest in science -- showed 
amazing self-restraint: She left just before the final episode began, 
explaining that she wanted to be surprised when she watched it with her fellow 
chapter members on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest said they'd watch it again. 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Smith of Redlands, captain of the Federation's Starship Morningstar, 
planned to attend a party sponsored by a Klingon Assault Group in San 
Bernardino. Klingons? "Trekkies tend to be accepting of other people," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee planned to go to Q Billiard Parlor in Pasadena for a large party sponsored 
by the IFT and a science fiction collectible store from Universal Studios. The 
irony wasn't lost on "Star Trek" fans: Q is the name of Capt. Jean-Luc Picard's 
nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even as "The Next Generation" ends, yet another "Star Trek" spinoff is on its 
way. "Deep Space Voyager" is scheduled to begin in January. But Rigoni said 
he's already got reservations about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very old theme. You remember 'Lost in Space'? Remember 'Land of the 
Giants'? Or even 'Time Tunnel'! Well, ('Deep Space Voyager' is about) a 
star-fleet vessel lost in space. " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was more optimistic. Truly of the next generation, he was born the same 
year (1966) as the original "Star Trek" series (he was 3 when it was canceled). 
 
</P>
<P>
 " 'The Next Generation' seemed a little subtle," he said. "I like 'Deep Space 
Nine' because it's a little more gritty; it's a little more blatant about the 
points it's trying to make. 'DS9' started out on a level of character 
development and inter-character relationships that 'Next Generation' got to in 
its third season. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'Next Generation,' there are new aliens but still Romulans and Klingons. 
In 'Voyager' it's going to be all new. They're unlimited." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the final episode of "Next Generation" started rolling, the Trekkers were 
all eyes and ears. While Capt. Picard hopped between past, present and a 
possible old age hampered by an Alzheimer's-like disease, they noted every 
design change of the Enterprise. They guffawed at the implications of a 
Worf-Troi-Riker love triangle. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the bar was a Trekker. One who wasn't, Chris Albaugh of 
Placentia, seemed to express the feelings of many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was intending to go home to bed by now, but I'm still here," he said. "It's 
very involving. And what the heck -- it's kind of fun watching before everybody 
else gets to." 
</P>
<P>
 At show's end, Q (described by Rigoni as "the intergalactic Mr. Annoying") 
said: 
</P>
<P>
 "When you realize the paradox, that is the exploration that awaits you." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trekkers broke into spontaneous applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's good writing," said Dennis Toguchi, captain of the starship USS 
Roddenberry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Q was the good guy, and he was the bad guy," Lee noted in wonderment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Humanity had its effect on Q," opined Rigoni. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that "Q's continuum is very strong. . . . He's capable not only of 
going through time but of changing it. If time and matter are interchangeable, 
you can learn to manipulate both. Don't look at things as a barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like watching a "Star Trek" episode a day before it airs, only 
harder.

WHO KNOWS WHAT SLEEPER LURKS . . .?; MOVIES: THE FUN IN THESE SHADOWY HITS IS 
IN THE SURPRISE. THEY ARE USUALLY MODERATELY BUDGETED FILMS THAT OPEN SMALL AND 
THEN BENEFIT BY GOOD WORD OF MOUTH.

 A few months ago, the special-effects-laden action-comedy "The Mask" might 
have been considered a bona fide summer sleeper. But now the New Line Cinema 
film starring a green-faced Jim Carrey has developed such buzz in Hollywood 
that it is projected to be one of the summer's hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speed," starring Keanu Reeves as a SWAT cop trying to save a careening 
busload of passengers, also might have been considered a summer sleeper earlier 
this year. Now advance screenings have created positive word of mouth for the 
20th Century Fox film, leaving some to question whether the term "sleeper" 
applies anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The real fun in Hollywood these days is predicting what movies without big 
expectations will become box-office hits, along the lines of last summer's 
surprise hits, "Free Willy" and "Sleepless in Seattle." 
</P>
<P>
 If you listen to the studio publicity departments, you might believe anything 
other than their biggest summer films are potential sleepers.  
</P>
<P>
 Two baseball movies are now being hyped as summer sleepers: "Angels in the 
Outfield" with Danny Glover from Walt Disney/Caravan and "Little Big League" 
with Jason Robards from Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Another touted sleeper is "The Shadow," a Universal film about the caped 
crime-fighter of radio lore, starring Alec Baldwin ("Who knows what evil lurks 
in the hearts of men? The Shadow knows").  
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who argue that all this talk about summer sleepers is 
often designed by studios to start an undercurrent of hype for certain films. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want you to believe that we made it for $80 million, but it's a 
sleeper," said entertainment attorney David Colden, adding sarcastically: "Yeah 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 John Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Inc., a motion picture research 
company, is another who believes that when you look across the landscape of 
films this summer, most really don't qualify as sleeper candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 How can "Angels in the Outfield" be considered a sleeper, Krier asked, when 
"exhibitors are expecting big things from it?" 
</P>
<P>
 And he doesn't see how anyone can still say that "Speed" is a summer sleeper, 
no matter what Fox executives might say. 
</P>
<P>
 "A sleeper is something that is unheralded and then pops up all of a sudden," 
Krier said. It has a low to moderate budget, no big stars, usually opens small, 
but benefits from good word of mouth and has "legs," is either critically 
praised or trashed, has no heavy advance promotion by the studio, does more at 
the box office than is initially expected, and is usually not given the most 
advantageous playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Some current examples, Krier said, would be "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective," 
which came out of nowhere with comedian Carrey earlier this year to gross $70 
million, and "Four Weddings and a Funeral," which has grossed $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mask" was a sleeper, he said, until exhibitors viewed the trailer at the 
ShoWest exhibitors' convention in Las Vegas earlier this year and loved it. 
Now, it would be a shock if it didn't succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 A film does not necessarily have to be devoid of stars to be considered a 
sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Take "Sleepless in Seattle," which last year grossed $126 million for TriStar 
Pictures. "It was a movie which had a fairly well-known cast with Tom Hanks and 
Meg Ryan and, given its cost and the subject matter, would normally be expected 
to do about $20-$40 million at the box office," said one source.  
</P>
<P>
 Some recent examples of sleepers, Krier said, include: "Cool Runnings" ($68 
million), "Sister Act," ($139 million), "The Crying Game" ($62 million), and 
"My Girl" ($58 million). 
</P>
<P>
 So, what are the real potential sleepers this summer? 
</P>
<P>
 If "Andre" -- a film about a 9-year-old girl and a lovable seal -- makes a big 
splash at the box office for Paramount Pictures, it would be a bona fide 
sleeper, just as the killer-whale movie "Free Willy" was for Warners when it 
grossed $77 million. 
</P>
<P>
 They might also include "Pulp Fiction," the Quentin Tarantino paean to 
criminals starring John Travolta and Uma Thurman, which on Monday won the 
Golden Palm award at Cannes; the super-hero adventure comedy "Blankman" 
starring Damon Wayans; and, "Airheads," a tale of an unknown band that takes a 
radio station hostage to get some airplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps "Fear of a Black Hat," a comedy rap version of "This Is Spinal Tap" 
from the Samuel Goldwyn Co. will be the real summer sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe it will be an Andrew Bergman movie from Castle Rock called "It Could 
Happen to You" (Nicolas Cage, Bridget Fonda).

LENO GETS IN TOUCH WITH (HIS) SHOW IN NEW YORK; TELEVISION: AFTER TWO YEARS OF 
DOING 'JOHNNY'S SHOW,' COMEDIAN SAYS WEEK IN EAST OFFERED VALUABLE LESSONS.

 Jay Leno told NBC station owners Monday that his trip to New York last week 
had been a valuable learning experience that will bring about significant 
changes in "The Tonight Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last two years, I've been doing another show. I've been doing 
Johnny's show," Leno told the assembled executives at their annual meeting at 
the Century Plaza in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leno took over "The Tonight Show" from Johnny Carson, he used the same 
basic set in Burbank, with new paint. But for his one-week stint in New York, a 
temporary set was constructed in the "Saturday Night Live" studios that crowded 
a much smaller audience into a tighter space than the show uses in Burbank. 
That meant Leno was right on top of the crowd -- similar to the club atmosphere 
he was accustomed to, doing stand-up comedy -- and right next to his 
bandleader, Branford Marsalis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audience was half the size, but there was more energy," Leno said. He 
also identified a "sparkle" between he and Marsalis, who is normally much 
farther away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something missing from the show, but I never knew what it was," 
Leno said. "We're going to take these lessons we learned in New York and bring 
them here." 
</P>
<P>
 NBC Productions is expected to begin overhauling the Burbank stage shortly to 
move the audience and Marsalis closer to Leno. And Dennis Roof, who designed 
the temporary New York set, will probably do a make-over in Burbank, an NBC 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno vowed to continue taking "The Tonight Show" on the road to put it back on 
top in the ratings. The next stop is expected to be Chicago for the November 
ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to go to every affiliate (market), I will do it," he proclaimed. 
"Last week was an indication (that) if we do a good show, we can get ratings." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tonight Show" has been beaten consistently by CBS' "Late Show With David 
Letterman," but it made considerable gains with the New York telecasts -- 
including winning on Friday in the overnight averages for 31 big cities.

LIFE AFTER Q STARTS WITH AN R, AS IN RELAXATION ; SONGWRITER: WITH YEARS OF 
HARD ROAD LIFE BEHIND HIM, AL ANDERSON KICKS BACK AND ENJOYS SUCCESS IN THE 
COUNTRY MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Al Anderson seems to have more contenders in the running these days than the 
Kentucky Derby has racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking over the phone recently from his home in Windsor, Conn., Anderson 
started rattling off the names of songs he has written that are being grabbed 
up by the country market. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the new Carlene Carter single, "Something Already Gone," which is 
featured on the "Maverick" film soundtrack. There's Hal Ketchum's "(Tonight We 
Just Might) Fall in Love Again," which is also moving up the country singles 
chart. Anderson also ticked off recent recordings by Sammy Kershaw, Alabama and 
the Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 For 22 years, slogging it out on the hard road he plied with NRBQ was pretty 
much Anderson's only way to get his music heard. Now he can sit home and lead 
the comparatively leisurely life of a songsmith who makes monthly trips to 
Nashville to work with an assortment of writing partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Success in the country market paved his way out of his long-held 
guitar-playing slot in NRBQ, a gig that Anderson said had grown "really stale." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting old to me," he said of NRBQ's never-ending round of club 
dates. "I'd been dissatisfied with it for maybe four years, playing the same 
places. Month after month it would be the same thing, with the same songs, and 
it was starting to feel like a parody of a parody. I could take it better when 
I was drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson says he quit drinking three years ago, a change he says that has 
helped spur a fertile streak as a songwriter. His first taste of success came 
last year, when he wrote "Every Little Thing" with Carlene Carter and the song 
reached No. 2 on the country singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Anderson was having his creative differences with the other members 
of NRBQ. Two of his songs made it onto the band's new album, "Message for the 
Mess Age," but another that he had submitted, "You Better Look Out," got turned 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just pushed me over the top" in deciding to quit, he said. "I don't look 
at it as a bad thing, but as a fortunate thing. I'm vastly more successful, 
both financially and spiritually. I'm a happy guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he gave his notice moments after playing a New York City club 
show with NRBQ on New Year's Eve. He said he told NRBQ's bassist, Joey 
Spampinato, that he was leaving the band, but would continue to play shows 
through June if the other members wanted him to stay on while they toured to 
promote the "Mess Age" album. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he never heard back from NRBQ, which soon replaced him with 
Spampinato's brother, Johnny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no hard feelings," Anderson said, noting that NRBQ's manager has 
talked about setting up a farewell concert for him, something he would like to 
do. "It was a great band before I got there, and it'll be great after. It was a 
great school, but it was time for me to get my degree and get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has been playing in Carter's touring band (a show a few months ago at 
the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana revealed that the hulking guitarist, 
known as "Big Al," had slimmed his customary girth considerably). He also is 
working on songs for the second solo album of his career -- the first was his 
1988 release, "Party Favors." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he will play scattered concerts in which he presents his songs 
in a stripped-down solo or duo format, including a show June 10 at McCabe's 
Guitar Shop in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Is he planning to start a new touring band of his own? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not even slightly interested," said Anderson, who can now afford to sit 
back and let some of country music's top horses do the running around for him.

LEVY GIVES UP ORCHESTRA POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Micah Levy, founder of the Orange County Chamber Orchestra and music director 
throughout its 11-year history, will leave his post to pursue a musical arts 
doctorate, the orchestra announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy will be replaced as music director and conductor by Diana Halprin, the 
orchestra's concertmaster since 1987.Halprin becomes the only woman to hold the 
music director post for a professional orchestra in Orange County. She also has 
served as conductor of the New York Kammermusiker and as resident conductor of 
the Brockport Music Festival in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Chamber Orchestra performs at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
Its existence was threatened in 1991 by falling ticket sales and related 
financial difficulties, and the group had to cancel three of its planned six 
concerts that season. The group played four concerts in its recently concluded 
11th season, and will expand to five for its 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Levy will study at the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore as a doctor of 
musical arts candidate, in a two-year program. Monday's announcement was made 
in a faxed statement from Barbara Palermo, the orchestra's president. 
</P>
<P>
 In the release, Palermo said that Levy has been asked to return to conduct 
future concerts and will have a new title: founder/music director emeritus. 
Neither Levy nor Palermo could be reached for further comment.

 The arrival of "Maverick," with its big $17.2-million gross, eclipsed the 
performance of most everything else and accounted for 40% of all tickets sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing attractions, as a result, didn't fare well.Despite adding 548 
screens, "The Crow" had a 33% drop in business from the previous weekend; "When 
a Man Loves a Woman" was down 31%, despite the addition of 188 screens. 
"Crooklyn," from director Spike Lee, did not add screens in its second weekend, 
and took a 42% tumble from its gross a weekend earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Cowgirls Get the Blues" from Fine Line Pictures was in the doldrums in 
its debut. The film was playing on 533 screens and took in a meager $672,577.

ALLEGED RAPE BY ACCUSED KILLER NOT PROSECUTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A man suspected of killing a 23-year-old Huntington Beach woman last week 
handcuffed another woman to a park tree last year and allegedly raped her but 
was never prosecuted for the crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Orange County district attorney's office arrested Edward Patrick 
Morgan Jr., 28, on a parole violation for the March 22, 1993, offense and sent 
him back to prison without filing criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the district attorney obtained a rape conviction against Morgan -- who had 
one previous conviction on a charge of forcible rape and two others on charges 
of statutory rape -- he would probably have spent as many as 12 years in prison 
rather than the 12 months he served for breaking parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't feel that we could prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt, 
despite the fact that he had a prior rape conviction," said Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Charles Middleton, who made the decision not to prosecute the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Some police have privately criticized the decision not to file charges against 
Morgan. They said the beating death of Leanora Annette Wong last Friday outside 
an Orange nightclub might have been avoided had the district attorney's office 
pursued the Huntington Beach case more vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's first conviction came in December, 1984, when he entered guilty pleas 
in two unrelated sexual attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first case, Morgan was convicted of forcibly raping and intentionally 
inflicting injury on a 16-year-old La Palma girl. After his arrest for this 
Oct. 21, 1984, rape, one of his former girlfriends, a 16-year-old from Buena 
Park, reported to police that Morgan, wearing a ski mask, had broken into her 
home and sexually assaulted her on Oct. 15, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the forcible rape, authorities also charged Morgan with 
unlawful entry, rape, sexual assault and sex with a minor in the attack on his 
ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a deal with prosecutors, Morgan pleaded guilty to both rapes, but 
the charge associated with the attack on his ex-girlfriend was reduced to 
unlawful sex with a minor. He was sentenced to three years for the forcible 
rape and an additional eight months for the statutory rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan met the victim of the forcible rape at a party and dragged her into an 
alley, threatening her with a knife, according to court records. When she 
struggled, he began "banging her head and face on the ground to make her 
submit." Morgan initially denied raping her and said his only mistake was being 
physically abusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's third conviction came in February, 1991, when he admitting having 
sexual intercourse with a female under the age of 18. In that case, Morgan 
admitted having sex with a minor on October 24, 1990, behind a Buena Park post 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 He claimed the girl said she was an adult and wanted sex. But the girl told 
police he raped her after she accepted a ride and drank beer with him. As part 
of a plea agreement, the rape charge was reduced. Although Morgan faced a 
possible four years in prison, he was sentenced to one year and four months in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huntington Beach case that was never prosecuted may be the most 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Morgan was arrested on March 22, 1993, shortly after a 
24-year-old woman called police and reported that she had been raped by a man 
driving a red Pontiac Fiero. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Sgt. Chuck Thomas said the woman was walking along 
Pacific Coast Highway near Warner Avenue when she accepted a ride from the 
driver of the Fiero. They bought some beer and drank it in Huntington Beach 
Central Park, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point that evening, the woman was handcuffed to a tree in the park and 
raped. Thomas said. Police apprehended Morgan, who was driving a red Fiero, 
that same night. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the woman lied to police about the incident and told them that she 
was attacked by two men who pulled her into the car against her will. She said 
she eluded them by slipping out of the handcuffs and running to a friend's 
house, Middleton said. The woman said she did not initially tell police what 
actually happened because she feared they would think she was at fault for 
having accepted a ride and drinking beer with Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said there were other problems with the woman's story. He said the 
woman also admitted that her attacker took off the handcuffs and drove her 
home. She admitted she then gave the man her home phone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan agreed with the woman's second version of the incident except for the 
claim that he forced her to have sex. He contended the sex was consensual, 
Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said he weighed the evidence in the case as well as Morgan's past as 
a sexual offender, but remained convinced that there was "insufficient 
evidence" to prove a rape occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to keep some semblance of order," Middleton said. "We can't lose 
sight of the fact that we have to prove this case. If the courts get filled 
with cases that would go nowhere it's total waste of manpower and money." 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton said the district attorney will take another look at the Huntington 
Beach case as a result of Wong's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleton, however, said the decision in 1993 not to prosecute was appropriate 
considering the facts and evidence at the time. He said he is puzzled by the 
reaction of some police who are critical of the decision. "It's like they did 
their job, and we didn't do ours, but that's not the case," Middleton said.

SUSPECT IN O.C. SLAYING CAPTURED; MANHUNT: PAROLED RAPIST EDWARD MORGAN, WANTED 
IN THE WEEKEND SLAYING OF A WOMAN HE REPORTEDLY MET IN A NIGHTCLUB, IS CAUGHT 
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A paroled rapist suspected of savagely beating to death a 23-year-old 
Huntington Beach woman he met in an Orange County nightclub last week was 
tracked down Monday in this small Northern California town and taken into 
custody after begging deputies to shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., 28, an unemployed ex-convict who has served prison 
time for three rapes, became the object of a statewide manhunt after abandoning 
his apartment in Orange and sending word to local authorities that he would not 
return to prison without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shoot me! Shoot me!" Morgan screamed as he turned on Plumas County sheriff's 
deputies who had caught up with him after a lengthy foot chase. "I didn't do 
it," he said before he was subdued with a spray of Mace and handcuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's arrest brought a sense of relief to the dead woman's family but 
raised concerns over the handling of his case by the Orange County district 
attorney's office. Although Morgan had already been convicted of three rapes, 
the district attorney's office declined to prosecute him when he was arrested 
in connection with a fourth rape in Huntington Beach last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Morgan's parole on an earlier rape conviction was revoked, and he was 
returned to prison for a maximum one-year term before being paroled again. If 
he had been convicted again, he probably would have faced a 12-year prison 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who has authored "one-strike" 
legislation that would put first-time violent sex offenders away for 25 years 
to life, said: "This is precisely the reason why a bill such as (this) is 
needed. These are the predators that have no business being released after 
committing that kind of brutality." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan had been named the prime suspect in the beating death of Leanora 
Annette Wong, 23, whose battered body was found near a nightclub in Orange 
where the two had met Thursday night. A wall near where her body was found was 
almost completely covered with her blood. 
</P>
<P>
 While police searched throughout Southern California over the weekend, Morgan 
apparently fled to the tiny town of Quincy, about 180 miles north of 
Sacramento, where a former girlfriend, as well as an ex-cellmate from Folsom 
State Prison, have been living. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Orange police had found postcards in Morgan's apartment from the 
former girlfriend, Sonya Marvin, 22, asking Morgan to visit her, authorities in 
Plumas County were alerted Saturday that Morgan might be in their area. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies kept watch over Marvin's home, as well as that of Travis 
Burhop, the 21-year-old former cellmate recently released from Folsom. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday morning, deputies stopped a car they had seen leaving Martin's 
house, thinking that Morgan might be inside. They found only his former 
cellmate and his ex-girlfriend's father. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-hour later, at noon, authorities who had been surreptitiously watching 
Martin's home saw Morgan leave through the front door. When they approached, he 
ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Three patrol cars chased the running ex-convict for a quarter-mile, until he 
raced through an apartment complex, scaled an eight-foot, chain-link fence 
topped with barbed wire and slid under a grader on property owned by the state 
Department of Forestry. 
</P>
<P>
 When deputies ordered him out at gunpoint, Morgan put his hands halfway up in 
the air and screamed for them to shoot. As he advanced toward the deputies, 
they sprayed him with Mace and handcuffed him. Because he has not yet been 
charged with Wong's death, he was technically taken into custody for violating 
his parole on a 1991 statutory rape conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonya Marvin and Burhop were arrested on suspicion of harboring a criminal and 
being accessories to a crime. Marvin was being held in lieu of $100,000 bail, 
and Burhop was being held without bail, according to Plumas County Assistant 
Sheriff Rodney DeCrona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're elated that we could take this predator off the street," said Lt. Timm 
Browne of the Orange Police Department. "The public should be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange police officers were to travel to Quincy today and are expected to 
bring Morgan back to Orange County as quickly as possible, Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide manhunt for Morgan began Saturday, hours after Wong was found 
dead of head, neck and pelvis injuries. Witnesses said Wong left the Australian 
Beach Restaurant and Nightclub with a "bodybuilder type," who was identified as 
Morgan by someone who called Orange police on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-8, 200-pound Morgan, who bears a tattoo saying "Eddie, one life, 
one love" across his chest and used to hang out at Huntington Beach Pier, 
worked out with weights in prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong and a girlfriend who accompanied her to the nightclub Thursday night had 
an agreement that neither would leave the bar without the other. Just before 3 
a.m. Friday, the friend found that Wong's white Toyota Tercel was still in the 
parking lot, but Wong was nowhere to be found. The following morning, security 
guards found Wong's body behind a concrete enclosure in a parking lot across 
the street from the nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong, a 1993 graduate of UC Riverside, worked as an assistant manager at a 
Foot Locker store in Westminster and was two months shy of being promoted to 
store manager, her father said. A shy young woman who loved to play tennis, 
Wong usually was the designated driver when groups went out to party because 
she didn't drink alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong's family has been inundated with calls from relatives, friends and the 
press, said an aunt who would not give her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely pleased that he's been caught," the aunt said. "But frankly, 
we're just exhausted after all this." 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service for Wong is set for Wednesday in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wong's killing was reported in the news media, police received an 
anonymous tip naming Morgan as a suspect. At 1:20 a.m. Saturday, a SWAT team 
descended on Morgan's apartment in Orange but found that he wasn't there. Armed 
with a search warrant, they entered the apartment at 8 a.m., and while they 
were there Morgan phoned his apartment and was told by police they wanted him 
to surrender for questioning within an hour. A friend called back sometime 
later and relayed a message from Morgan that he would not return to prison 
peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was convicted of two rapes, one by force and the other involving 
unlawful sex with a minor, in December, 1984. For those convictions, he was 
sentenced to 3 years and 8 months behind bars. After his release, he was 
charged with another statutory rape in 1990, and in February of 1991 was 
sentenced to the minimum prison term of 16 months on that charge, although he 
could have received four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Judge John J. Ryan sentenced Morgan to an additional year in 
prison as an enhancement for the earlier forcible rape conviction, but then 
ordered the "punishment stricken" on that count, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while he was on parole from that 1990 rape that Huntington Beach police 
arrested him for allegedly handcuffing a woman to a tree, assaulting and raping 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office declined to prosecute him for that 1993 
incident, but Huntington Beach police informed state parole officials, who 
revoked his parole and returned him to state prison in Chino. He was later 
transferred to Folsom prison and spent a year in custody before being released 
two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was born in Ohio, and came to Orange County at age 12. He graduated 
from John F. Kennedy High School in La Palma in 1983, and was on the school's 
wrestling team for three years. In his senior year, varsity wrestling Coach 
George Peterman commended Morgan in the yearbook for having placed in a major 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's 1991 probation report said he was married, and court records show 
that he and his former wife, Jacqueline, were divorced after he was sent to 
prison a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Moller, managing editor of Feather Publishing, where Sonya Marvin worked, 
said: "We're all in shock, because she's a real good kid. . . . It looks like 
to us (that she) got involved with the wrong person, innocently."

3 S. AFRICANS FREED IN BIEHL SLAYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY and DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three men accused of killing Amy Biehl, the Newport Beach woman slain by a mob 
of black youths in South Africa last year, were freed Monday after posting $70 
bail each, a development that left Biehl's relatives saddened and worried the 
crime will go unsolved. 
</P>
<P>
 As court proceedings resumed Monday following a delay of about six weeks, the 
defendants walked out of the Cape Town courthouse into a small group of 
cheering supporters and family members, who raised bail when a court order 
prohibiting their release had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I didn't expect it to be a bail situation, but I'm not surprised. 
I just never expected them to be actually prosecuted," said Kim Biehl, 28, of 
Newport Beach, the sister of the slain Fulbright scholar. "It's disappointing. 
We would all like to see some sort of justice served. Amy was a believer in 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl said she learned about the release early Monday morning from an 
Associated Press reporter who has been covering the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl, 26, who studied for a year at the predominantly black University of 
the Western Cape, was beaten and stabbed to death Aug. 25 while she was driving 
friends home to Guguletu, a township near Cape Town. The attack occurred two 
days before her scheduled return to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported Monday that Mongezi Manqina, Mzikhona Nofemela 
and Vusumzi Ntamo were released after an attorney general's order denying bail 
for the accused had lapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Nollie Niehaus did not oppose the setting of bail at about $70 
each, a relatively small amount for a violent crime. "I can't say it will be in 
the interest of justice to keep them in custody," Niehaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men, who are from one of Cape Town's poorest townships, were ordered to 
return to court on Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants are members of the student wing of the Pan-Africanist Congress, 
a militant black group that has openly avowed attacks on "settlers" -- their 
term for whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups of youthful PAC supporters have taunted white passersby during the 
court proceedings, which began in November. They often shouted their notorious 
slogan: "One settler, one bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pan-Africanist Congress renounced armed struggle in January in order to 
take part in the historic all-race election in April. The party captured a 
modest 1.2% of the national vote, less than any other party. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of the men was recently stalled for several weeks while Judge Gerald 
Friedman conducted a "trial within a trial" to decide whether the suspects' 
statements should be admitted as evidence. Manquina has charged that he was 
beaten by police and forced to make a confession. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the case, charges were dropped against three suspects because a 
witness was afraid to testify, and a 15-year-old suspect who was not jailed 
never showed up for his court appearance in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl, who was researching the role of women in the transition to majority 
rule, is believed to be the first American killed in South Africa's political 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Department of State official declined to comment Monday on the 
defendants' release, saying the department has not received any official 
communication from South Africa concerning the Biehl case. 
</P>
<P>
 Consul Jacques Jordaan, of the South African Consulate in Los Angeles, said he 
sent a telex to South Africa immediately after hearing reports about the 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 The new South African constitution, which came into effect during the trial, 
stipulates that bail must be granted in all but extreme cases, Jordaan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl's parents spent Monday in Washington at a ceremony where their daughter, 
Molly, presented five awards to honor young social activists. The annual event 
is held by the Gleitsman Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Biehl was remembered at the event for the work she did on behalf of 
democratic ideals in South Africa, said her father, Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were feeling very inspired today. This sort of takes the steam out of it," 
he said. "We're extremely disappointed, but in the end, we were really not 
expecting convictions anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Biehl said his family thought the prosecution was doomed even before 
Monday's release because many witnesses, some of them young children, have been 
threatened by supporters of the accused. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Biehl said she learned that one of the men was smiling as he emerged from 
the courthouse, but that the other two were subdued. She said she thought it 
was unlikely that they will show up at the next court appearance, but she added 
that she harbors no hatred over her sister's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can completely see how it happened. I do have some anger, but mostly it's 
just sadness," she said. "There is an entire lost generation over there, just 
like we have in our country. . . . It was a mob scene and a mob situation, and 
I'm just not sure that they have 100% certainty that they have the right 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Several funds have been set up in Amy Biehl's name to encourage the pursuit of 
democratic ideals in South Africa and elsewhere, her father said. The latest is 
the Amy Biehl Foundation, which the family has established.

3 DEMOCRATS CLASH SHARPLY IN 1ST GUBERNATORIAL DEBATE; POLITICS: GARAMENDI 
ATTACKS BROWN, WHO TAKES AN ABOVE-THE-FRAY STANCE. HAYDEN STRESSES CAMPAIGN 
REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their first debate, the three Democratic candidates for governor clashed 
sharply Monday night on a range of issues, with the most pointed exchanges 
between Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi and Treasurer Kathleen Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Garamendi vigorously attacked Brown, the front-runner in the 
polls in the June 7 primary. During his opening comments, he turned to face her 
and questioned her sharply on several points, including her acceptance of 
campaign contributions from municipal finance houses that do business with the 
state treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 On that matter, and on other issues throughout the hourlong session broadcast 
only in the Sacramento area, Garamendi likened Brown's responses to a current 
television ad run by the Hertz auto rental firm. When a character with a 
problem car is asked if he rented from Hertz, he despondently replies: "Not 
exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the debate, when Brown said she had the toughest ethics rules in the 
history of the treasurer's office, Garamendi retorted: "There you go again. 
It's, 'Not exactly.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of the hour, Brown adopted an above-the-fray front-runner's 
stance: ignoring Garamendi and aiming her campaign ammunition at Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But finally, after Garamendi raised the campaign ethics issues again, Brown 
shot back: "John, all three of your charges are false. You do not know what you 
are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 State records supported Garamendi's contention, however, that Brown did 
receive large amounts of contributions from New York bond houses until last 
June, when she declared that she would no longer accept such funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third candidate, state Sen. Tom Hayden of Santa Monica, who offered 
the sharpest rebuttal to Garamendi by accusing him of accepting, as insurance 
commissioner, campaign contributions from outside law firms that had been hired 
to do business for Garamendi's office. Garamendi has refused to accept 
contributions from insurance companies, but has taken money from the law firms, 
state reports indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign reform is the cornerstone of Hayden's campaign and he pushed that 
issue during the debate, but he also made a number of points that set him apart 
from Brown and Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, on the "three strikes, you're out" law recently approved by the 
Legislature and contained in an initiative on the June ballot, Hayden said, "I 
think 'three strikes' is fiscal madness." He said the 25-years-to-life terms 
should be meted out only to violent felons, not someone who, for example, is 
caught forging a check as a third offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi generally agreed, adding that the state could save money and open 
prison space by putting nonviolent felons in boot camps. Brown also supports 
boot camps, but did not take advantage of the opportunity to push her case 
Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said she supports the current law and the proposed initiative as needed 
"to send a message that there are consequences that flow from individual 
actions in society." 
</P>
<P>
 Repeatedly brushing aside criticisms, Brown never directly answered the 
questions that Garamendi put to her at the opening of the debate. But she came 
prepared with some of her own charges, citing state auditor reports of 
mismanagement in the insurance commissioner's office during Garamendi's 3 1/2 
years on the job. Garamendi replied that all the disparities had been 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented debate-a-day lineup, the three will meet again in San 
Francisco this evening under the sponsorship of the Commonwealth Club. The 
90-minute session beginning at 6 p.m. will be carried live on public television 
station KCET Channel 28 in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, and probably final, session will be on radio in Los Angeles on 
Wednesday, on the Michael Jackson talk show on station KABC. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's aggressiveness Monday night was no surprise. Trailing Brown by as 
much as 20 points in recent public opinion polls, he needs to bring some drama 
to the race to focus attention on him and to raise doubts in Democratic voters' 
minds about Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden is regarded as the outsider, with relatively little support in the 
polls and little chance of winning. He noted at the outset that his candidacy 
has been described in many ways this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the candidates came across much as they have campaigned throughout 
the spring: Brown cool, often talking in broad terms, sometimes technically 
phrased, focusing on Wilson as if her victory June 7 is taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi presented himself as a populist and talked about how he had worked 
other people's jobs in each of the 58 counties since early January. He said 
that reform of health, welfare and prison programs in California is fundamental 
to bringing the state budget under control. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, presumably the one with the least to lose, seemed to enjoy the 
attention he got by being treated as an equal at the debate table. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, the questions covered all the major topics that the 
candidates have been talking about: the death penalty, water development, 
health care, taxes, illegal immigration, prisons and education funding. 
</P>
<P>
 In a clash over the death penalty, Brown reiterated her position that it is 
the law of California and as governor, she would enforce the law. What she did 
not say is that she is personally opposed to capital punishment, as were her 
father and brother, both former California governors. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the death penalty issue had been used "as a political smoke screen to 
avoid failed records on public safety," presumably a shot at Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he is ambivalent on the issue, saying he might support executions 
if a crime were committed against his wife or daughter. But he said the better 
course is to put violent criminals in prison for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, however, said, "I strongly support the death penalty and I will 
enforce it and it will be used. . . . I have no ambivalence on this." Again, he 
used the Hertz ad analogy on Brown: "So what is your position exactly on this? 
Mine is clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Each candidate met with reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, saying she was pleased with the debate, called Garamendi's suggestion 
early in the debate that her office was the subject of a possible Securities 
Exchange Commission investigation of her office's conduct "a lie, a fabrication 
from a desperate candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said he merely was asking about a possible probe and not arguing 
that one is being conducted. Garamendi added that in general he was trying to 
pin Brown down to specifics on issues and "there's not a straight answer. She 
wants to be on both sides of these very important issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he welcomed Brown's professed support for his campaign reform 
proposals, including limits on the size of campaign contributions and creation 
of a public financing system. Excerpts From Debate 
</P>
<P>
 Following are excerpts from Monday night's debate in Sacramento among the 
three Democratic candidates for governor.  
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown: "I'm running because I am angry. I'm angry at 
the decline of California and everything that made the California dream 
possible. . . . I am angry that under Pete Wilson, California's dream has been 
in decline." 
</P>
<P>
 State Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi: "I strongly support the death 
penalty and I will enforce it. It will be used when I'm governor of the state 
of California. Unlike my opponents here, I have no ambivalence about this. 
Kathleen, you've said many times that you do not believe in the death penalty 
although you would enforce it. It very, very much reminds me of that new Hertz 
ad . . . the one with the guy standing out there in the rain and the guy's boss 
says, 'You got Hertz didn't you?' and the guy says, 'Not exactly.' Well, what 
is your position exactly on this?" 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica): "We're in Sacramento, which somebody 
awhile ago must have thought was a holy place because they made it the city of 
sacrament. Yet in the past four or five years, 12 people have gone to jail from 
the Legislature for political corruption. That is because the institution 
itself breeds too much temptation because the dependence on special interests 
and their contributions is the key to success around here." 
</P>
<P>
 After a Hayden statement about how he would call together legislative leaders 
to move forward with campaign finance reform:  
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "Well, Tom I agree with you about (the need to change the contribution 
system). You can't run for office in this state and not be wanting to change 
the system. So, when I'm elected governor, I want to invite you over and we'll 
have that cup of coffee and I'll support those efforts to reform campaign 
finance." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi: "Kathleen, I'm really surprised. After taking $1 million from the 
people you've done business with, flaunting the very issue that you just talked 
about, now you're going to have reform? Come on, Kathleen, give me a break." 
</P>
<P>
 On the state's budget crisis and whether a tax on wealthy Californians should 
be extended:  
</P>
<P>
 Hayden: "There's a time bomb in the budget where these tax brackets for the 
very wealthy are due to expire and if they expire . . . it means that a person 
making over $200,000 a year will pay the same tax as somebody making $33,000 a 
year. I think that's unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "First of all, Pete Wilson has been a failed governor as it relates to 
bringing this budget into balance each and every year. He's given us cooked 
books. He's given us IOUs. He's given us mountains of red ink." 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi: "If you're going to build a budget that's going to count . . . what 
you have to do is to get into the heart of the budget and understand what's 
driving the cost. Health care . . . welfare . . . and prisons are driving the 
cost. If you don't reform and change those issues, you're not going to be able 
to deal with the budget problems." Two More Debates Planned 
</P>
<P>
 There are two more scheduled debates among the candidates seeking the 
Democratic nomination for governor. Unlike Monday's debate, which was broadcast 
only in Sacramento, the others can be heard in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's debate will take place from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at the Hilton Hotel in 
downtown San Francisco. It will be carried live in Los Angeles on KCET-TV 
Channel 28 and Century Cable Channel 42, and in San Diego on KNSD-TV Channel 
39. KCET-TV will repeat its broadcast at 11 p.m. tonight. The debate also can 
be heard live on radio on KCRW-FM (89.9) in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's debate, which will be moderated by talk radio host Michael 
Jackson, will be broadcast live in Los Angeles on KABC-AM (790) from 1 to 3 
p.m. C-SPAN, the cable channel devoted to public affairs, will tape the debate 
for later broadcast.

COLUMN ONE; PAST HAUNTS EX-PANTHER IN NEW LIFE; JULIUS BUTLER'S TESTIMONY 
HELPED CONVICT GERONIMO PRATT OF MURDER. NOW, THE FIRST A.M.E. CHURCH 
OFFICIAL'S PROMINENCE UPSETS SOME WHO SAY BUTLER WAS AN FBI INFORMANT -- A 
CLAIM HE DENIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As hundreds of worshipers filed into the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church, Los Angeles' oldest and most prominent black congregation, several 
dozen protesters stood across the street, waving picket signs. 
</P>
<P>
 One read: "The snitch got to go. Free Geronimo." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators were an unsettling challenge to a venerable institution, and 
their target on that Sunday in January was no less than the 61-year-old 
chairman of First A.M.E.'s Board of Trustees: Julius C. (Julio) Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's route to that prominent position has included a series of sharply 
contrasting stops. He has been a Marine sergeant, a Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputy, a hairstylist known as "Mr. Julio," a Black Panther, a City 
Council aide, an early campaign volunteer for former Mayor Tom Bradley and a 
legal aid attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But the demonstrators were focusing on another role Butler played, one that is 
rooted in the political turbulence of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the linchpin in the murder case against Elmer G. (Geronimo) Pratt, a 
former Los Angeles Black Panther Party leader. Pratt, who was convicted in 1972 
and sentenced to life in prison, maintains that the FBI knows he is innocent 
because agents had him under surveillance in Oakland when the murder was 
committed in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler testified that Pratt had confessed to him that he shot a teacher and 
her husband during a 1968 robbery. Butler said Pratt discussed "the mission" 
with him before the crime, admitted later that evening that he had shot the 
couple, and confirmed his role the next day. The woman died days later. Her 
husband, who was critically wounded, recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, however, did not know what documents released more than seven years 
after the trial would disclose: Butler was not merely a disgruntled former 
Panther associate of Pratt's. He was giving information to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, who denies he was an informant, gave testimony so critical that three 
jurors who convicted Pratt say they would have regarded Butler's account as 
less credible and would have held out for acquittal if they had known of 
Butler's relationship with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a retired FBI agent has maintained for years that Pratt is 
innocent, and that he was framed by the bureau as part of the FBI's infamous 
and now-defunct Counter Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO) -- covert efforts to 
"neutralize" organizations the bureau called "black hate groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a stack of FBI memos that spell out the information he provided to 
agents beginning in 1969, three years before Pratt's trial, Butler insists he 
was not an informant and has steadfastly refused to comment on his apparent 
relationship with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pratt's trial, he testified that "the connotation (of) informant means a 
snitch, and I have never been in the world a snitch." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still say I stand by the testimony," Butler said in a recent telephone 
interview from his office at Bet Tzedek legal services in the Fairfax district. 
He declined to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI consistently has maintained there was no conspiracy to frame Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's conviction has long been a cause celebre for political and social 
groups that say it symbolizes a legal system that was twisted to prosecute a 
political enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 To have Butler near the helm of First A.M.E., which has gained citywide 
prominence since the 1992 riots, troubles some in the 9,000-member church. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can a church that is a beacon in the black community have this person 
with this history as chairman?" asks one member. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, that question does not disturb many others. Shortly after the January 
demonstration, the church's 3,500-member men's group rallied behind Butler, 
expressing its support in a formal vote of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 First A.M.E.'s charismatic pastor, Rev. Cecil L. (Chip) Murray, did not 
respond to requests for an interview. He was made aware of Butler's role in the 
conviction, according to a knowledgeable church source. He approved the 
elevation of Butler, a member since 1987, to the church's board, then to the 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Pratt's early defense lawyers, said Butler is 
"passing himself off as this pillar of the community. An innocent man is in 
jail. If you're a real Christian, I don't know how you can live with that. And 
I don't think you can just stonewall it forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Recent efforts to free Pratt have drawn new attention to Butler's role in the 
trial. Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti is reviewing the case, prompted by 
crusading lay minister Jim McCloskey, who submitted a detailed report arguing 
Pratt's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey, who heads New Jersey-based Centurion Ministries, drew national 
attention in 1992 after he helped gain the release of Clarence Chance and Benny 
Powell, Los Angeles men who spent 17 years in prison after they were wrongfully 
convicted of murdering a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pratt controversy has created ironies for First A.M.E. Murray was one of 
several Los Angeles clergymen who filed a friend-of-the-court brief in 1980 
supporting a new trial for Pratt. Early this year, after FBI agents foiled a 
skinhead plot to foment a race war by launching an armed attack on First A.M.E, 
Murray and other church officials held a Sunday service to thank the agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those expressing gratitude was Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI's work, Butler told a reporter afterward, "has given us the beginnings 
of a new relationship with the current administration of the FBI." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Geronimo Pratt and Julio Butler goes back a quarter-century, to 
an era when the Black Panthers frightened and outraged much of Middle America. 
Clad in their signature black berets and black leather jackets, the Panthers 
openly armed themselves and marched through the streets shouting: "Off the 
pigs." They reveled in their image as urban guerrillas defending the black 
community from police abuses. Then-FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled them 
"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Senate committee on intelligence activities found that the FBI's 
COINTELPRO effort originally targeted organizations like the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference and leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. But by 1967, 
the bureau had made the Panthers its primary target, the committee reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the report said, the FBI's covert action exacerbated 
an existing "gang war" between the Panthers and US (United Slaves), led by 
militant black nationalist Ron Karenga. That war resulted in the killing of 
four Panthers by US members and in "numerous beatings and shootings," the 
committee reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler joined the Panthers in the summer of 1968 -- a relatively late entry 
into radical politics for a man who had started his working life in the 
military and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler would not discuss his personal life in an interview. But according to 
court documents, he was born in Los Angeles, graduated from Jefferson High 
School in 1950, joined the Marines a year later and saw duty in the Korean War, 
where he was wounded. He was married that same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was discharged in 1954, and he was divorced the next year. He studied 
criminology at Los Angeles City College and became a sheriff's deputy in 1956. 
But he resigned in 1960, citing problems from a second marriage that also ended 
in divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, state records show, he was issued a cosmetology license. Using the 
name Mr. Julio, he opened a shop on Adams Boulevard in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, he joined the Panthers, quickly becoming the party's Southern 
California security chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, a decorated Vietnam veteran from Louisiana, became a Panther the same 
year. He enrolled at UCLA, where he was recruited by local Panther leaders 
Alprentice (Bunchy) Carter and John Huggins. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months after his arrival, an event occurred that would shape the rest of 
Pratt's life: On Dec. 18, 1968, Caroline Olsen, 27, was fatally shot and her 
husband, Kenneth, 33, was critically wounded in a robbery that netted about $30 
on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the Panthers were thrown into turmoil. In January, 1969, gunmen 
belonging to Karenga's US killed Carter and Huggins on the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt, then 21, succeeded the iron-fisted, charismatic Carter as local party 
head. That set in motion a rivalry with Butler, who later testified that he 
grew to "dislike" Pratt. Butler saw his authority for security reduced to a 
small area near the Crenshaw district. 
</P>
<P>
 By the spring of 1969, according to FBI documents, Butler had grown more 
dissatisfied with the direction the Panthers were taking. About that time, he 
began providing information to FBI agents, documents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between Pratt and Butler rose, and by Aug. 5 Pratt had "probably" 
expelled Butler from the party, an FBI memo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later, Butler wrote an "insurance" letter that implicated Pratt in 
Olsen's murder. In it, Butler said he had written the letter to protect himself 
against death threats by Pratt and other Panthers. He delivered the letter, to 
be opened "only in the event of my death," to a man he described in testimony 
as a friend, Los Angeles Police Sgt. DuWayne Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1970, the Los Angeles FBI office had sought permission from 
headquarters for a counterintelligence effort "designed to challenge the 
legitimacy of the authority exercised" by Pratt in the local Panthers, 
according to documents released later. 
</P>
<P>
 Another FBI memo dated five months later noted that the bureau was constantly 
considering counterintelligence measures designed to neutralize Pratt "as an 
effective (Panther) functionary." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1970, Butler's letter resurfaced under circumstances that 
seemed to show he had been in contact with the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Unknown to Rice, Butler had told agents about the letter three days after 
giving it to Rice, according to FBI documents and a sworn statement Rice made 
to Pratt's attorneys. The letter contained information that could put Panthers 
in the gas chamber, Butler told agents, according to an FBI memo. 
</P>
<P>
 When agents asked Rice for the letter, he refused to turn it over without 
Butler's permission. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking that permission, Rice said in his statement, he asked Butler how 
the agents knew about the letter. Butler said he told agents about it because 
they were pressuring him, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter implicating Pratt in Olsen's murder became the cornerstone of the 
prosecution case against Pratt. Within two months, he was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his defense and ongoing appeals, Pratt has contended that he was in Oakland 
at a weeklong series of party meetings when Olsen was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that should have been simple enough by having others who attended the 
meetings testify that Pratt was there. But by the time Pratt was tried, three 
years after the murder, he had been expelled from the party for siding with 
former Panther Minister of Information Eldridge Cleaver, who had broken with 
Panther leader Huey P. Newton. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton forbade any Panthers from testifying on Pratt's behalf, although 
several people in Oakland supported Pratt's alibi. Cleaver's wife, Kathleen, 
testified that Pratt was in Oakland. But three years after the fact she could 
not specifically place his whereabouts on the day Olsen was slain. 
</P>
<P>
 In sworn statements two years ago, Panther co-founder Bobby Seale and former 
Panther official David Hilliard did place Pratt in Oakland on the day of the 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt has argued that on that day the FBI had a wiretap on phones at the 
Panthers' Los Angeles headquarters. Wiretap logs would show that Pratt had 
several conversations from Oakland with the headquarters on Central Avenue, his 
attorneys say. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that, despite the FBI's history of documenting its wiretaps, no 
logs from that wiretap have been located. In 1985, the agent who had been 
assigned to Pratt testified at an appellate court hearing that he had no 
knowledge of a wiretap on Panther headquarters in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 However former agent M. Wesley Swearingen, who was once assigned to the squad 
that investigated the Panthers in Los Angeles, thinks Pratt "was deliberately 
set up . . . what we termed in the FBI to neutralize him." Swearingen said he 
thinks the FBI destroyed the logs. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen, who retired in good standing in 1977, said he saw documents 
showing an FBI wiretap was in place at Panther headquarters on the day Olsen 
was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two staffers in the office of the late Charles Garry, an attorney who often 
represented Panthers, said they saw logs of an FBI wiretap showing Pratt was in 
Oakland the day Olsen was shot. But a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
dismissed Pratt's petition to have those alleged logs produced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To a large degree, the case against Pratt may be a question of who is more 
believable -- Pratt or Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pratt's trial in 1972, the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard P. 
Kalustian, now a Superior Court judge, summed up just how important a witness 
Butler was: "Julio Butler has testified in this court under oath and to the 
jury to a confession that Mr. Pratt made to him that admits all of the elements 
of the offense. If the jury believes Julio Butler . . . Mr. Pratt is guilty. 
The case is over if they believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler had testified that Pratt confessed only hours after the shootings. 
Kalustian likened Butler's "insurance" letter to a deathbed declaration, saying 
"at no time did (Butler) desire to go to the police with the information and at 
all times intended to keep it secret." 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the report he delivered to Garcetti's office last June, 
minister-turned-investigator McCloskey argued that Butler had every intention 
of having the letter's contents become known. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only three days after he wrote and delivered it to Sgt. Rice, he told the FBI 
what was in it," McCloskey said in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rice's 1979 sworn statement, he said that as soon as Butler handed him the 
letter on a street corner, two FBI agents walked up and demanded the letter. 
Rice said that when he refused, the agents shouted after Butler, calling him 
"Julio," but Butler kept walking. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey called it "preposterous" to believe that the FBI "just happened to 
pass by when their informant on Pratt and the (Panthers) was passing a letter 
to someone on the street corner in broad daylight that (could have) put Pratt 
in the gas chamber." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, knowing none of this, convicted Pratt after 10 days of deliberation. 
One juror, Jeanne Hamilton, said in a recent interview that she feels as if she 
had been "used by the government, by the FBI, by Kalustian, by everybody who 
had a hand in it. I feel betrayed by the justice system right now because 
nobody will listen." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also did not know that shooting victim Kenneth Olsen, who identified 
Pratt, had earlier identified someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the jury known about Olsen's earlier identification, Hamilton said, "I 
think that alone would have changed our mind." She said she regrets she did not 
counter the jury foreman, a second-year law student, when he sternly looked her 
in the eye and asked: "If somebody shot your husband, wouldn't you remember 
their face?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Pratt was convicted, Butler volunteered for former City Councilman David 
Cunningham's 1973 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A year or two later, Cunningham said in an interview, he hired Butler as a 
field deputy, adding that Butler was very effective in getting police to crack 
down on drug dealers in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Butler was arrested for allegedly threatening a man with a pistol and 
kicking him. He resigned from Cunningham's staff and pleaded no contest to 
charges of carrying a loaded weapon and driving under the influence of alcohol. 
He was sentenced to probation and fined. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Butler was hired as a paralegal at Bet Tzedek, a legal 
services program for the poor. He attended West Los Angeles College and then 
law school. He was admitted to the State Bar in 1989 and became a staff 
attorney at Bet Tzedek.

 So far, Pratt's lawyers have lost every appeal of his conviction. In 1980, the 
state's 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled, in part, that Pratt failed to prove 
his contention that he was framed by FBI agents and Los Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodic demonstrations demanding Pratt's freedom continue. Butler's name is 
prominently raised as a symbol of the alleged betrayal of Pratt, but he remains 
secure near the top of one of Los Angeles' symbols of social justice -- First 
A.M.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, some of the January demonstrators met with church 
officials, but both sides agreed not to publicly discuss the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a source close to the negotiations, who requested anonymity, said the 
church had offered to ask Butler to write a letter to the state parole board, 
urging that Pratt be released. Some of Pratt's supporters say they would be 
satisfied with nothing less than a letter from Butler that recants his 
testimony and exonerates Pratt. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's supporters say the church has repeatedly described their efforts to 
hold Butler accountable as an attack on First A.M.E. 
</P>
<P>
 "The church keeps putting (Butler) up front and trying to make the community 
accept him as some kind of new black leader or something," said former Panther 
Roland Freeman, one of the January protest's organizers. "That is not going to 
work. The issue is that Geronimo has been in jail for 23 years, and one of the 
persons who was instrumental in it is Julio Butler." 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt's only opportunity for freedom appears to rest with McCloskey's report 
and Garcetti's review of the case. The district attorney's office says it has 
set no deadline for completion of he review. "The only decision now is to 
determine if there is anything in the material (McCloskey) has given us that 
would be worthy of an investigation," said Assistant Dist. Atty. Dan Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Pratt attorney Cochran: "I hope Garcetti will do the right thing 
-- at least a hearing or a new trial.

KENNEDY'S WIDOW RECALLED AS A 'BLESSING' TO FAMILY, NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 In the great marble church of her childhood where she was both baptized and 
confirmed, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was remembered Monday as a "blessing" who 
"made a rare and noble contribution to the American spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a blessing to us and to the nation . . . ," Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, 
her brother-in-law, told 1,000 mourners during a moving eulogy, while outside 
on Park Avenue, solemn crowds stood six deep. "No one ever gave more meaning to 
the title of First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jackie was too young to be a widow in 1963 and too young to die now . . . ," 
the senior senator from Massachusetts said, his voice ringing through the 
Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, a landmark Italian Renaissance house of worship. 
</P>
<P>
 "During those four endless days in 1963, she held us together as a family and 
a country. In large part because of her, we could grieve and then go on. She 
lifted us up and in the doubt and darkness she gave her fellow citizens back 
their pride as Americans. She was then 34 years old." 
</P>
<P>
 With prayer and song and tears and laughter -- and more than a modicum of 
privacy -- final goodbys were said to the woman many viewed as an American 
icon. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, a man held up a small sign, hand lettered with a black pen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camelot will be reunited in heaven," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners included lined faces from the New Frontier such as former Kennedy 
speech writer Theodore Sorenson, White House aide and historian Arthur 
Schlesinger Jr., one time Ambassador to India John Kenneth Galbraith, former 
White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger, former National Security Adviser 
McGeorge Bundy and former Treasury Secretary C. Douglas Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended. So did Lady Bird Johnson, widow of 
President Lyndon B. Johnson. She used a cane and held the arm of a Kennedy aide 
as she moved slowly up the church steps. 
</P>
<P>
 There were Kennedy relatives and cousins and nephews and a Hollywood 
contingent that included actress Daryl Hannah, a friend of John F. Kennedy Jr., 
and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and his wife, Maria Shriver. From the Senate 
came Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island and 
John Kerry of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 From the world of New York politics came Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his 
predecessor David N. Dinkins -- and there were people Mrs. Onassis' life had 
touched -- her decorator, her colleagues from publishing, her boarding school 
roommate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the body of Mrs. Onassis lay in a closed mahogany casket, decorated with 
ferns topped by a cross of white and purple lilies-of-the-valley, the people 
closest to the former First Lady -- her two children, John F. Kennedy Jr. and 
Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, and her longtime companion Maurice Tempelsman -- 
celebrated her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Caroline Schlossberg told mourners that her mother, who died of cancer at the 
age of 64 on Thursday, kept a book on a special bookshelf in her room. The 
volume, containing a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay, was presented as a first 
prize in literature to Mrs. Onassis while she was a student. 
</P>
<P>
 As she read the Millay poem, "Memories of Cape Cod," Caroline Schlossberg's 
voice cracked with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Choosing the readings for these services, we struggled to find ones that 
captured my mother's essence. Three things came to mind over and over again and 
ultimately dictated our selections," John Kennedy Jr. told the mourners. "They 
were her love of words, the bonds of home and family and her spirit of 
adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 Tempelsman read one of Mrs. Onassis' favorite poems, "Ithaca" by the Greek 
poet Constantine Cavafy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now the journey is over. Too short, alas too short," he concluded. "It 
was filled with adventure and wisdom, laughter and love, gallantry and grace. 
So farewell, farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 In a highly emotional moment, Metropolitan Opera star Jessye Norman sang "Ave 
Maria." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the tributes, it was the senior senator from Massachusetts, no 
stranger to sad eulogies, who perhaps captured Mrs. Onassis best -- her 
political savvy, sense of humor, love for her children and grandchildren, her 
desire for privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Kennedy took such delight in her brilliance and her spirit," he 
said. "At a White House dinner, he once leaned over and told the wife of the 
French ambassador: 'Jackie speaks fluent French. But I only understand one of 
every five words she says -- and that word is De Gaulle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Kennedy indicated that the years had not dulled Mrs. Onassis' political 
savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 He related how last summer while they were on the upper deck of a boat at 
Martha's Vineyard, Mass., waiting for the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
to arrive, "Jackie turned to me and said: 'Teddy, you go down and greet the 
President.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "But I said: 'Maurice is already there.' And Jackie answered: 'Teddy, you do 
it. Maurice isn't running for reelection.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with Mrs. Onassis' wish for privacy, no television cameras were 
allowed in the church. Outside on Park Avenue, a crowd of about 4,000 stood 
behind police barricades. Police completely closed several blocks of the 
normally busy four-lane thoroughfare for the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 In the crowd that strained against metal police barricades along a five-block 
stretch of Park Avenue, many spoke quietly about why they had come to pay their 
respects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't be anywhere else today," said Dr. Joanne Tobias, a dentist who had 
closed her Elmwood Park, N.J., office so she could stand outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias said that she once had snapped a photo of Mrs. Onassis and her daughter 
at a book party and had dropped off a copy at Mrs. Onassis' apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a beautiful handwritten note from Jackie thanking me on her distinctive 
blue stationery," she said. "It is framed on the wall of my waiting room." 
</P>
<P>
 While the funeral service was under way, photographers converged on an elderly 
woman and her companion. The woman sat on a chair in the middle of the sidewalk 
in front of an apartment building across the street from the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Her head was lowered in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been praying for her every day," said Elizabeth Montgomery, who gave 
her age as 94, and who said she had worked as a maid for the Kennedys many 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could be nicer than Jackie," she said. "She was marvelous to 
everybody. She was beautiful in every way. She was a lady to her fingertips." 
Farewell From the Family 
</P>
<P>
 The following are from some of the readings at Monday's funeral Mass: 
</P>
<P>
 "Choosing the readings for these services, we struggled to find ones that 
captured my mother's essence. Three things came to mind over and over again and 
ultimately dictated our selections. They were her love of words, the bonds of 
home and family and her spirit of adventure." 
</P>
<P>
 John F. Kennedy Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a blessing to us and to the nation -- and a lesson to the world on 
how to do things right, how to be a mother, how to appreciate history, how to 
be courageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The wind in the ash tree sounds like surf on the shore at Truro. . . . The 
winds died down. They said leave your pebbles on the sand and your shells too 
and come along. We'll find you another beach at Truro. Let me listen to the 
wind in the ash, it sounds life surf on the shore."

12 TV STATIONS TO ABANDON BIG THREE NETWORKS FOR FOX; ENTERTAINMENT: CBS LOSES 
EIGHT AFFILIATES IN THE HISTORY-MAKING DEAL. MOVES FOLLOW FOX'S FOOTBALL PACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a history-making deal that may demonstrate the appeal of sports over more 
traditional programming, the Fox Network on Monday announced plans to abscond 
with a dozen stations currently affiliated with its rivals at the Big Three 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS bore the brunt of the loss, surrendering eight affiliates in what was 
called the largest defection ever from one network to another. Other affiliates 
from CBS, and to a lesser degree NBC and ABC, have also flocked to Fox since it 
gained broadcast rights to the National Football Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox's surprise raid on the CBS affiliates leaves the No. 1 network without 
representation in key markets such as Detroit, Cleveland, Atlanta, Tampa and 
Milwaukee. CBS, which just finished in first place for its third consecutive 
prime time season but which lost the NFC broadcast rights to Fox earlier this 
year, said Monday that it is "confident in the continued strength of our 
network. . . . we will maintain strong affiliations in all of the markets 
affected." 
</P>
<P>
 With the network not saying how it plans to replace the affiliates, however, 
Wall Street hammered its stock. CBS fell $15.50 a share, to $288, on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts see a trend in smaller stations abandoning their network 
programming providers in favor of the more lucrative opportunities offered by 
upstarts such as Fox. The station switch gives the Fox Network a much larger 
potential audience, and is expected to boost its ratings. It is part of a 
broad-based working alliance between Fox Inc., the network's parent company, 
and New World Communications Group, which owns the affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Bevins, chief executive of New World, said the affiliates are 
moving to Fox because its schedule leaves more time to air money-making 
syndicated programs. Fox broadcasts 15 hours per week of prime-time programs, 
compared to 22 hours for each of the other three networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bevins conceded that the ratings of New World's TV stations will probably 
decline, but he said it was more important that New World use the newly 
available time slots to develop its own shows for syndication -- which could 
far outweigh the gains of higher ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The news hit like a bombshell at the National Cable TV Assn. convention in New 
Orleans, where more than 20,000 executives from the cable TV industry have 
gathered to hear predictions about the 500-channel future of interactive 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 By entering into a broad alliance with New World, observers said that Rupert 
Murdoch, chief executive of Fox parent News Corp., is putting his faith in 
over-the-air broadcasting at a time when many people are banking on the 
expanded TV universe. News Corp.'s American Depository Receipts closed at 
$52.875, up 75 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "Upgrading his network by switching over UHF for VHF (stations) and acquiring 
franchise programming like the NFL is a brilliant long-term move," said Gordon 
Crawford, senior vice president of Capital Research Co., which is a big 
institutional shareholder in News Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Wall Street analyst, who did not want to be identified, said 
"Murdoch is on the loose again," a reference to News Corp.'s past propensity 
for challenging the fates financially. Murdoch approached the brink of 
bankruptcy four years ago as a worldwide recession set in after he had gone 
through a decade of aggressive acquisitions and accumulated debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, NBC President Bob Wright told 650 of his affiliate representatives 
that the news changes the "landscape" of television, but will not harm NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts look for Fox to benefit greatly from the added stations. Ever 
since its inception, the upstart network of Bart Simpson and Al Bundy has been 
hampered in reaching an audience on parity with the major broadcast networks 
because most of its affiliates are UHF stations. Once the affiliation switches 
are in place, 40% of Fox's affiliates will be more preferable VHF stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This strengthens the distribution of our network significantly and will 
dramatically increase our weekly circulation," said Lucie Salhaney, president 
of Fox Broadcasting Co. She projected that the new football contract, coupled 
with the upgraded affiliates, will boost Fox's ratings by more than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 The affiliation switches will be achieved over the next 12 to 18 months, 
Salhaney added. Under the deal announced Monday, Fox and New World have also 
agreed to mutually develop programming that the companies will syndicate to 
other TV stations throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 New World's stock closed at $10.625, up $1.687, in Nasdaq trading Monday. The 
company, controlled by Revlon cosmetics mogul Ronald O. Perelman, has 
aggressively expanded its TV holdings at a time when many investors and 
analysts have been eschewing the broadcasting industry in favor of cable TV and 
the "information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 In connection with the deal with Fox, New World will expand its station 
ownership from the current seven stations to as many as 12, the maximum 
allowable under Federal Communications Commission regulations. New World 
recently agreed to buy four TV stations from Great American Communications 
Corp., which will all become Fox affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, New World has acquired an option to buy the debt and securities 
owned by DLJ Merchant Banking Partners of Argyle Television Holding, which owns 
four TV stations. The deal will cost New World $716 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox will help New World complete that deal by investing $500 million in New 
World. When the transaction is completed, Fox will own 20% of New World's 
equity and have 2.9% of the voting stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The stations moving to Fox from CBS are: WAGA of Atlanta; KTBC of Austin, 
Tex.; KDFW of Dallas; WJBK of Detroit; WJW of Cleveland; WITI of Milwaukee, 
KSAZ of Phoenix and WTVT of Tampa, Fla. From ABC, Fox gains WBRC of Birmingham, 
Ala.; WGHP of High Point, N.C., and KTVI of St. Louis. From NBC, Fox gets WDAF 
of Kansas City.

COLOSIO SLAYING SUSPECT'S KIN FLEE TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Saying they fear for their lives in Mexico, six relatives of the man accused 
of assassinating Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio have 
sought political asylum here after crossing the border illegally and 
surrendering to U.S. authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of Mario Aburto Martinez, the factory worker who is charged with 
killing Colosio two months ago, and five other relatives took a taxi to the 
border Sunday afternoon from their working-class Tijuana neighborhood. They 
climbed the fence near the Tijuana River levee, a crossing often used by 
illegal immigrants, and turned themselves over to Border Patrol agents a few 
hundred yards from the international line. The six then requested asylum in the 
United States, a Border Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 All six were released on their own recognizance late Monday and were en route 
to San Pedro to unite with family members, said Peter Schey, a Los Angeles 
human rights activist and their attorney. They are attempting to remain in the 
United States on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto's relatives said they fled Tijuana after having been followed, 
threatened and otherwise menaced since the assassination two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stated they had been threatened and harassed," said Border Patrol 
spokeswoman Ann Summers in San Diego, adding that the Aburtos said a black van 
was tailing them Sunday. "They fear remaining in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident presents a delicate issue for the U.S. and Mexican governments. 
Despite longtime human rights problems south of the border, Mexicans rarely 
seek or receive political asylum in the United States -- in contrast to 
refugees from Guatemala, China and other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aburtos' dramatic flight from Mexico puts U.S. immigration officials in 
the awkward position of being forced to judge whether Mexico can protect the 
accused assassin's family, injecting the United States into the explosive case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colosio case remains mired in mystery and conspiracy theories implicating 
politicians and drug cartels. A human rights lawyer in Los Angeles, where the 
accused assassin's father and brothers live, said Monday that the family has 
been alarmed by several attempted break-ins at their home during the past two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The April slaying of Tijuana's police chief -- which officials say could be 
connected to the chief's role in the assassination investigation -- also 
frightened the family, said Schey, who is associated with the Center for Human 
Rights and Constitutional Law. 
</P>
<P>
 The imprisoned Aburto has also expressed concern about his family's safety, 
Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mario has indicated that, for reasons that he has not made clear, he does not 
think the family is safe in Mexico," said Schey, who has been advising Aburto's 
relatives in Los Angeles. "The facts surrounding the case are extremely murky. 
. . . I think their fear is of violence by armed individuals and groups 
seemingly outside of the control of the government. They have no confidence 
that the Mexican government is in a position to protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican government officials at the consulates in San Diego and Los Angeles 
did not return phone calls seeking comment. A representative of the San Diego 
consulate requested an interview with the Aburtos on Monday afternoon, but 
Schey said he asked Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to deny 
the request until he can meet with his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested Sunday were Aburto's mother, Maria Luisa Martinez, 45; Aburto's 
brother, Jose Luis, 20, his 19-year-old wife, Adelia, and their 1-year-old son, 
Luis; and the accused assassin's two sisters, 16-year-old Elisabeth and 
10-year-old Carina. They were to be released into their lawyers' custody while 
the asylum application makes its way through a backlogged system. Cases can 
linger for more than a year without disposition, immigration officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the INS as very cooperative, Schey said he may also try to seek 
temporary residence on humanitarian grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Aburto is being held in a high-security prison near Mexico City along with 
three alleged accomplices -- guards in a crowd-control team provided by 
Colosio's political party for the fateful rally. Aburto denies any connection 
to those suspects, however, and Mexican authorities have not answered many 
questions about the assassination, including those involving the motive and who 
masterminded the plot. Aburto first implied that he had confederates but then 
insisted that he had acted alone, raising speculation that he knows more than 
he has disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 After the March 23 assassination, Aburto's mother took refuge for several days 
with Catholic nuns in Tijuana before returning to her small brick house in the 
impoverished Colonia Buenos Aires neighborhood. Neighbors in the area told 
reporters last month that she did not seem particularly worried or upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Martinez has grown increasingly fearful because of attempted 
break-ins that occurred at night while the family was sleeping, Schey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been unidentified cars circling the house," Schey said. "My 
understanding is that there have been threats." 
</P>
<P>
 And the accused assassin's father and two brothers in San Pedro, who contend 
that the Mexican government has made Aburto a scapegoat, claim to have been 
harassed north of the border. Aburto's brother, Rafael, told The Times last 
week that he was nearly run off the Harbor Freeway and that his 
brother-in-law's car was shot at while parked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know something's going to happen to me," Rafael Aburto told The Times. "I'm 
not scared for myself. I'm scared for my family. . . . The real assassins are 
behind this. They don't want us speaking out."

ONASSIS LAID TO REST AT ARLINGTON; SERVICES: CLINTON HAILS FORMER FIRST LADY AT 
RITES ALONGSIDE GRAVE OF J.F.K. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As a sultry spring breeze rippled the eternal flame she had lit 31 years ago 
at another moment of national grief, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis was laid to 
rest Monday alongside President John F. Kennedy at Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The former First Lady, who died of cancer last Thursday at 64, was hailed by 
President Clinton in a brief graveside service as a woman who handled great 
gifts and bore great burdens "with dignity and grace and uncommon common 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "We say goodby to Jackie," Clinton said. "May the flame she lit so long ago 
burn ever brighter here and always brighter in our hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 The burial was preceded by a funeral Mass at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola 
in New York, where Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) paid tribute to his 
sister-in-law as both a friend and an icon of American history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "She graced our history," Kennedy said. "And for those of us who knew and 
loved her, she graced our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' body was flown from New York to Washington National Airport 
aboard a private aircraft. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended the 
funeral Mass and flew to Washington with Kennedy family members, where she was 
met by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' children, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr., 
bade her farewell at Arlington with readings from Scripture. They also laid 
flowers at the foot of her flower-bedecked mahogany coffin. The Most Rev. 
Philip Hannan, the retired archbishop of New Orleans who presided over 
President Kennedy's funeral, sprinkled holy water on the coffin and a Navy 
chorus sang "Eternal Father Strong to Save." 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief 15 minutes, the burial service was over and the Kennedy family 
members drifted away, some stopping at the nearby grave of Robert F. Kennedy to 
pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation watched on live television as America buried yet another Kennedy. 
In the hazy distance, the bell of Washington's National Cathedral slowly tolled 
64 times. 
</P>
<P>
 And thus ended an era of glamour and hope and tragedy that began with the 
young President's inauguration in 1961 and came to a close on Monday on a 
verdant hillside in the nation's best-known graveyard of heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The widow of the President who was slain on Nov. 22, 1963, became an image 
etched in the national memory for all these years, forever young and elegant, 
mysterious and private and yet a public treasure for two generations of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Grasso, 45, a jeweler from Pinellas Park, Fla., brought his video camera 
to the avenue leading to Arlington cemetery to watch Mrs. Onassis' funeral 
procession. He said that he remembered the deaths of President Kennedy and his 
brother, Robert, as marking America's "loss of innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis' death, he said, "marks the end of the Kennedy era. As long as 
she was still alive, the Kennedy era was still alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The burial ceremony was attended by about 100 members of the Kennedy, 
Auchincloss and Radziwill families, including Lee Radziwill Ross, Mrs. Onassis' 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Those attending the service were all family except for a few, including 
Providencia Paredes, the former First Lady's personal maid in the White House; 
Paredes' son, Gustavo, who grew up with John Kennedy Jr. and is still a close 
friend, and Maurice Tempelsman, Mrs. Kennedy's close companion for the last 12 
years or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Buried alongside Kennedy and Mrs. Onassis are the couple's first child, an 
unnamed daughter stillborn in 1956, and an infant son, Patrick, who died three 
days after his birth in August, 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 The honorary pallbearers were Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Timothy Shriver, 
Christopher Lawford, William K. Smith, Edward M. Kennedy Jr., Anthony 
Radziwill, Lewis Rutherford Jr. and Jack Walsh. All but Walsh are cousins. 
Walsh was a Secret Service agent who watched over the Kennedy children when 
they were in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Kennedy, the 103-year-old ailing matriarch of the clan, remained in 
Florida but planned to watch the burial on television, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kennedy grave site was closed all day Monday but hundreds of onlookers 
lined the route into the cemetery and gathered outside its gates. A cemetery 
spokesman said that 23 other funerals scheduled during the day at the 612-acre 
cemetery were going on as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether she was soothing a nation grieving for a former President or raising 
the children with the care and the privacy they deserved or simply being a good 
friend, she seemed always to do the right thing in the right way," Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "May the flame she lit so long ago burn ever brighter here and always brighter 
in our hearts," the President said. "God bless you, friend, and farewell." 
</P>
<P>
 There were more middle-aged women than any other group along the route to the 
cemetery, but the crowd was mixed. Some tears were shed, but most people were 
thoughtful, not outwardly emotional. The crowd was hushed as the relatively 
modest motorcade of black limousines and mini-buses passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Small crowds gathered around mourners who carried radios so they could listen 
to the burial service taking place inside the cemetery gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who came to pay their respects praised Mrs. Onassis' fashion 
sense and elan, but more than anything else they remembered her for the support 
she provided the whole country during those tragic November days three decades 
ago, when she proved to the nation, through her composure and calm, that life 
would go on. 
</P>
<P>
 Person after person remarked on how the image in 1963 of the young widow's 
face, dry-eyed and draped with a black veil, had remained with them through 
their lives, a symbol of strength and courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Grieb, 50, of Rochester, N.Y., made a point of coming to Washington with 
her husband, John, during their vacation to pay their respects. "I always 
looked up to Jacqueline; I think all women my age did," she said. "She had a 
lot of sorrows but always kept her head high." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Frost, 34, of Livermore, Calif., said that Mrs. Onassis preserved her 
dignity by not appearing on talk shows or writing books. "She was such a 
graceful, wonderful woman. The world will not be the same without her. An era 
has passed."

ISRAEL SEEKS ARAFAT VOW TO BACK PACT; MIDEAST: GOVERNMENT THREATENS TO WITHHOLD 
FURTHER IMPLEMENTATION OF AUTONOMY ACCORD. PLO LEADER HAD SUGGESTED DEAL WAS 
NOT PERMANENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin demanded Monday that Yasser Arafat pledge 
in writing to uphold the Israeli-Palestinian peace accord after the chairman of 
the Palestine Liberation Organization appeared to suggest that the pact is only 
temporary, little more than a tactical maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 If Arafat fails to overcome the growing "crisis of confidence" among Israelis 
in the historic deal and the PLO's ability to fulfill its commitments, Israel 
warned that it will not implement subsequent stages of Palestinian autonomy and 
might break off further talks with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Minister Moshe Shahal, speaking for the government, said Israel will 
suspend implementation of the agreement on self-government, which is just going 
into effect in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, if Palestinian 
attacks upon Israelis do not end and if Arafat does not retract his belligerent 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the terrorist attacks continue along with these wretched statements by 
Arafat and others, statements that contradict the peace agreement," Shahal told 
Parliament, "we will continue to talk with the Palestinians, but we will not 
continue to implement the coming stages before the PLO's ability to control 
Gaza and Jericho is proven by fulfilling their commitments to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also wants Arafat to complete the appointment of the interim, 24-member 
government for the Gaza Strip and Jericho and to require his Palestinian police 
to impose order on what it sees as total chaos in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not discussing any timetable for the next phase until we can see 
whether the other side can stand behind its present commitment," said Obed 
Ben-Ami, a Rabin spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 While Israelis are angry over the pre-dawn killing last Friday of two soldiers 
guarding the northern entrance to the Gaza Strip, Rabin is incensed by an 
Arafat speech, made May 10 at a mosque in Johannesburg, South Africa. The PLO 
leader called for a jihad , meaning a holy war or struggle, over Jerusalem and 
then appeared to suggest that the agreement with Israel is simply tactical and 
politically expedient and might be put aside. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Johannesburg speech, Arafat compared the PLO's agreement with Israel to 
the 10-year peace pact that the Prophet Mohammed made with the Quraysh clan in 
Mecca. Muslims took Mecca two years later, in AD 630, claiming that the 
Qurayshis had violated the agreement. Israelis interpreted Arafat's remarks to 
mean that he too will back out whenever he believes he can achieve total 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In another portion of the speech, Arafat called for a jihad -- which is often 
translated as "holy war" but can mean many forms of struggle -- to reclaim the 
Islamic and Christian holy places in Jerusalem and to make the city the capital 
of Palestine. Although Israel regards Jerusalem as its "eternal capital," it 
has agreed to negotiate the city's future status with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arafat speech was cited repeatedly Monday by Rabin's critics in bitter, 
"we told you so" attacks on the government's approach to peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The head of the PLO, with whom the government of Israel wants to reach an 
agreement, has proved to us in recent days that he has no intention of making 
peace with us -- he says so clearly," Moshe Katsav, a leading member of the 
opposition Likud Party, told the Knesset, Israel's Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 David Levy, a former Likud foreign minister, said: "What is becoming clear is 
that we have a naive government. Whoever heard the prime minister and 
understood his demand (for a written reaffirmation from Arafat) understands 
that he was misled and did not see and did not read the map correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Environment Minister Yossi Sarid, a leading Cabinet dove, warned that, in 
the wake of Arafat's speech, "Israel won't be satisfied by an announcement only 
(of Arafat's adherence), but will insist that Arafat declare that the serious 
things he said in the Johannesburg mosque are null and void and that he is 
standing by the agreement with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The burden of proof is now on Yasser Arafat," Sarid said. "He must make every 
effort to restore the trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was no immediate response from Arafat's headquarters in Tunis, 
Tunisia, his adviser Ahmad Tibi said in Jerusalem that the PLO leader had 
already explained his statement once and that Israelis are overreacting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a crisis of confidence," Tibi acknowledged, "but it is the Israeli 
reaction that creates it."

INSIDE VALLEY BUSINESS; FORECLOSURE BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Usually when home sales rise, and the number of properties for sale shrinks, 
prices rise. Not so now in the San Fernando Valley.Prices have sunk to 1988 
levels and are still dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 * A record 3,650 single-family houses and condominiums were foreclosed in the 
Valley last year-20 times higher than in 1990-as a result of the long 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank repossessions were up another 38% in the first quarter, and are likely 
to keep climbing as owners of earthquake-damaged properties walk away from 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tough times for others have meant a boom for Ron Prechtl, left, a real estate 
agent at Century 21 Lamb Realtors in Northridge who specializes in selling 
foreclosed properties. Prechtl had his best year ever in 1993, selling about 
140 houses, more than half foreclosures. He expects the new wave of 
foreclosures from the earthquake to keep him busy until at least the end of the 
next year.

BRAWLEY GROUP WANTS TO ADD LAST CALL TO CATTLE CALL; CELEBRATION: RESIDENTS 
HOTLY CONTEST A BALLOT MEASURE THAT WOULD ALLOW BEER SALES AT THE CITY'S ANNUAL 
CIVIC HOEDOWN AND RODEO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of cowboys and beer we sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our tale begins with the organizers of Cattle Call, Brawley's annual rodeo and 
civic hoedown, deciding that the city's no-booze rule for public property is 
chafing them like a saddle with a rough spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Now into the political chute for the June 7 election comes hotly contested 
Measure R, which would add libations to the celebration for the first time in 
Cattle Call's 38-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle Call officials argue that without beer sales, there will not be enough 
money to adequately maintain the Cattle Call arena at the west end of Cattle 
Call Drive, just down the block from the exclusive Stockmen's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 What's worse, events that would be quite popular in Brawley -- tractor-pull 
contests, country-Western concerts, cutting horse competitions, Mexican rodeos, 
Cinco de Mayo celebrations -- are eschewing Brawley in favor of rival venues, 
such as El Centro, where beer is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the events themselves are underwritten by the beer industry, 
which will not book them where the industry's product is forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
 To boost Cattle Call, and generally uplift the ambient entertainment and 
cultural level in this Imperial Valley town of 19,000, Cattle Call officials 
asked the City Council to scotch the alcohol ban. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Brawley, where churches are strong and change comes slowly, one does 
not mess lightly with alcohol or Cattle Call. Confronted with a packed and 
angry house, the council refused to lift the ban, just as it had several times 
in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, Cattle Call officials persisted, and the council fashioned 
Measure R, which would allow alcohol both at the Cattle Call arena and a city 
auditorium known as Lions' Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not as if Brawley would be sanctioning a libertine lifestyle. Permission 
to sell alcohol at an event would be tightly controlled by the city manager and 
police chief, who could yank permission, even from Cattle Call, at the first 
hint of rowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure R has split Brawley just as surely as the railroad tracks that divide 
east from west. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the hottest thing going in Brawley," said Louise K. Willey, 74, owner 
of the San Pasqual Land & Cattle Co. and an original Cattle Call organizer. "It 
just screams controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 Willey and other Cattle Call officials think it's time for Brawley to go 
modern. They say the city has little to fear from drunken rodeo patrons or 
tipsy cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, rodeo is a fast-paced sport. Few patrons who plunk down $9 for 
a box seat are going to waste much time with repeated trips to the beer stand, 
organizers argue. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the cowboys are concerned, they're all business when they're in the 
arena," said feedlot manager and Cattle Call official Carson Kalin, 43. 
"They're not going to get tanked up before they go roping calves, or riding 
bulls or team-penning." 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition to Measure R is led by the Greater Brawley Ministerial Assn., 
school officials and ex-mayor Abe Seabolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents fear that allowing beer at Cattle Call (and Lions' Center) would 
send another mixed message to the youth of Brawley. How can adults tell kids 
that alcohol is bad, they ask, and then turn around and permit it to be sold at 
the city's premier social/vocational/recreational event? 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of our young people who run their cars into the (irrigation) 
canals in alcohol-related accidents," said the Rev. Bob Rathbun, 56, pastor of 
the First Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is cow-and-farm country and there is a lot of beer drinking already," 
Rathbun said. "We shouldn't contribute to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Located 10 miles north of Interstate 8, Brawley is a quiet lower-middle-class 
town with wide residential streets, large shade trees and several public parks. 
Trucks laden with sugar beets and carrots rumble down Main Street, and the lawn 
outside City Hall is adorned with a life-sized, fiberglass statue of a cowboy 
riding a bucking bronco, a gift to Brawley from rodeo legend Casey Tibbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's most prominent landmark is the defunct Planters' Hotel on Main 
Street. The only movie theater closed a generation ago and nothing has taken 
its place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Entertainment is nonexistent in Brawley," said Cattle Call official Steve 
Stodelle, 43, general manager of Brawley's country-Western radio station, KROP. 
"The high school had to go to Holtville for the senior prom." 
</P>
<P>
 Stodelle and other Measure R sponsors assert that drinking is a fact of life 
in Brawley and that it makes no sense to let good entertainment slip away by 
continuing to ban beer. Don't tell that to the anti-R people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs are out there too, but we're not going to start furnishing more spots 
for them," said ex-mayor Seabolt, 58, a farmer and owner of an oil distribution 
company. "We have the higher moral ground," said the Rev. Miriam Stump, 65, 
pastor of the First United Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of superior-sounding attitude galls the Cattle Call organizers. 
"We're not going to be pouring alcohol down the throats of children," Willey 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley is the only stop on the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Assn. tour where 
the arena does not sell beer. The tour is underwritten by Coors and Seagrams. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle Call officials worry that the failure of Measure R could ultimately 
imperil the rodeo. They are concerned about the event's sponsors moving to a 
beer-friendly location and about the ability of Brawley to continue to pay 
adequate purses if new sources of revenue are not found. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle Call began in 1957 as a steer- and calf-roping contest, a celebration 
of the beef industry to complement the celebrations in other Imperial Valley 
cities that extol cotton, carrots, sweet onions and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 With financial support from the valley's beef barons, Cattle Call has grown 
into a weeklong celebration each November with a dance, barbecues, a bluegrass 
festival, chili- and menudo-eating contests, mariachis, a 10-K run, a cowboy 
poetry recital, a whisker-growing contest and a Saturday morning parade. About 
30,000 people from the Imperial Valley and elsewhere flock to Brawley for 
Cattle Call. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's parade grand marshal was Joan Embery of the San Diego Zoo. Past 
marshals have included Alan Hale Jr., the skipper on "Gilligan's Island." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty is as pretty does in Brawley, and the Cattle Call queen is required to 
be proficient on horseback. Last year's queen was 17-year-old Jill Moiola, 
whose family owns Moiola Brothers Feedlot. 
</P>
<P>
 As furious as the campaigning has been, both sides agree that Cattle Call is 
Brawley's civic pride and joy and that what is good for Cattle Call is good for 
Brawley. The difference of opinion is over what is good for Cattle Call. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll not find any stronger supporters of Cattle Call than the members of 
this (anti-Measure R) committee," said Chairman Howard Sullivan, 49, who is 
superintendent of the Brawley elementary school district and a dedicated Cattle 
Call volunteer. "That's why we don't want to see it degraded." 
</P>
<P>
 Political campaigning in Brawley is done without consultants and opinion 
polling so it is impossible to gauge Measure R's chances. If nothing else, 
though, the give-and-take has enlivened Brawley's non-Cattle Call months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This campaign is the most entertaining thing Brawley has had in years," said 
Kalin, the feedlot manager. "Except for Cattle Call."

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; OAKHURST SPLIT BY CASINO PLAN; PROPOSAL TO PUT GAMBLING 
ESTABLISHMENT ON CHUKCHANSI TRIBE'S LAND HAS INDIANS BICKERING AMONG THEMSELVES 
AND TRADING ACCUSATIONS WITH THEIR WHITE NEIGHBORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scattered by a century of dispossession, the Chukchansi Indians barely cling 
to this mountain below Yosemite that was once homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 They have no reservation or rancheria. Not quite squatters and not quite 
homesteaders, a few dozen families live on federal land allotted to them. In 
the language of bureaucrats, they are known as "allottees." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chukchansi do hold one asset -- their designation as one of the 
nation's 545 federally recognized tribes -- and it is a trump card tribal 
leaders plan to cash in on. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, a Minnesota gaming group called DreamCatcher was flipping through 
the Federal Register and came upon the Chukchansi on Page 54,367. Soon, the 
developer and tribal leaders were drafting plans for a 60,000-square-foot 
casino amid the giant oak and gentle streams of this Madera County mountain 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal leaders hope to deal their first hands of pai gow and Texas hold 'em in 
the summer of next year, but don't count on it. Since word leaked out, the 
Chukchansi have been bickering among themselves over the wisdom of such a 
project, not to mention whose allotted land will be selected for the casino -- 
a $2-million jackpot to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And the debate has touched the larger community, with whites and Native 
Americans trading accusations over who is ransacking whose land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been accused by our own of going behind their back," sighed Gilbert 
Cordero, chairman of the tribal council. "We've been accused by whites of 
insensitivity to the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the three casino sites belongs to Cordero and his family. Some 
Chukchansi, citing a conflict of interest, want to recall the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's my land or not, the issue is the same," he said. "This tribe 
needs jobs and housing. This tribe needs a health clinic and a day-care center. 
The casino can get us all that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oakhurst is dotted with well-to-do Angelenos who picked up and ran in their 
middle years, hoping to retire on this mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Their roots run five and 10 and 15 years deep now, certainly not as deep as 
the Chukchansi but deep enough to have witnessed California history fold back 
on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of nowhere, they say, their Shangri-La has been overrun by a building boom 
tied to the Yosemite tourist trade. And with the planned casino and other big 
projects on the drawing board or under construction, the future only beckons 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The carpetbaggers have become the carpetbagged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a community activist in Pasadena," said Bill Rihn, a retired engineer 
who designed seismological equipment. "I fought the traffic and smog and 
growth. Then my wife and I moved here a few years ago to get away from it all. 
Now we're faced with the very same issues and I'm fighting again." 
</P>
<P>
 Not too long ago, Oakhurst had no traffic lights, no fast-food restaurants and 
one motel. Rural and rustic, it was refuge for an odd mix of artists and 
society dropouts, flatlanders looking to beat the hot summers and drug 
smugglers looking to hide their assets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past decade, as the population doubled and redoubled and then 
doubled again, to 13,500 residents, main street has become one giant signboard. 
Burger King, McDonald's, KFC, Taco Bell. Best Western, Shilo, Ramada and 
Holiday Inn. There are more real estate offices than churches. Three stop 
lights now govern the traffic to Bass Lake, a few miles north, and to Yosemite, 
an hour away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ought to be ashamed of ourselves," said Brad Ditton, a longtime developer 
and real estate broker known for good-quality projects. "We've ravaged this 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 Ditton says he feels a stitch of guilt each time he spots another backhoe -- 
42 at last count -- clawing away at the mountain. "I've subdivided probably 
1,000 lots by myself but I never thought it would come to this." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, with the blessing of the Madera County Board of Supervisors, 
who convene 40 miles downhill, developers have broken ground on a shopping 
center, a Ramada Inn and a 1,000-seat theater where former members of the New 
Christie Minstrels will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in February, word leaked out about the planned Chukchansi casino, and 
while the scope of the enterprise has been kept under wraps, it clearly would 
alter life here. All three prospective sites are in wooded areas with 
inadequate road service. One site is next to a church in the middle of a 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Chukchansi are a federally recognized tribe, local government has 
no say on the casino. This has left residents without the usual legal 
challenges. Instead, they must count on the U.S. Department of Interior, which 
handles Native American affairs, to ensure environmental safeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to make it clear that our opposition to the casino has nothing 
to do with the Indians," said longtime resident Harold Young, whose lawyer son 
once counseled the Sioux at Wounded Knee, S.D. "This is a bedroom community, 
for God's sake. We can't take any more of this unplanned growth without 
destroying the quality of life that brought us here." 
</P>
<P>
 Young and other angry residents launched a petition drive against the casino 
-- securing 600 signatures -- and are pushing for incorporation, which would 
take away land-use decisions from the pro-developer Madera County supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Chukchansi themselves have questions: Why has the casino deal been kept 
hush-hush? Whose allotment will be chosen and how much will that allottee be 
compensated? What revenues will flow to the tribe as a whole? 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern is . . . non-Indians will start to siphon the profits," said 
Reggie Lewis, a Chukchansi who lives on one of the prospective sites. "That's 
what is happening at an Indian casino just down the mountain from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby Roan-Cordero, 71, knows every nook and cranny of her 55-acre allotment. 
</P>

 She still pounds acorn into meal on a rock beneath some bushes and picks the

JOE PASS, VERSATILE VIRTUOSO OF JAZZ GUITAR, DIES AT 65 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Pass, legendary jazz guitarist considered gifted as a soloist and as 
accompanist to such stellar singers as Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan and Ella 
Fitzgerald, died Monday. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass, who had suffered from liver cancer for the past two years, died at 
USC-Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a gift from God that I play the guitar. I don't know how I got 
started," Pass told The Times in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pass disliked recording and insisted he was "not trying to make 
history, not trying to be the best guitar player in the world," he recorded 
about 20 albums individually and can be heard with others on about 50 more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass is regarded by many musicians who have heard him as an incomparable 
modern jazz artist, a total virtuoso of the instrument," Times jazz critic 
Leonard Feather said in his reference work, "Encyclopedia of Jazz in the 
Seventies." "(He is) capable of swinging fiercely at fast tempos and of 
exceptional harmonic imagination on ballads." 
</P>
<P>
 The guitarist earned international standing with his 1973 solo album, 
"Virtuoso," which he considered one of his best. He later used the same title, 
adding successive numbers, for other solo albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pass introduced new material over the years, he was particularly 
known for his ability to break down and rebuild old standards. He did just that 
with "Stella by Starlight" and "Cherokee" in the original "Virtuoso" album. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Pass shared a Grammy for best jazz performance by a group with Oscar 
Peterson and Niels Pedersen for their album, "The Trio." 
</P>
<P>
 Pass worked with other jazz greats, including Count Basie, Duke Ellington and 
Dizzy Gillespie. Among his recordings were "Portraits of Duke Ellington" in 
1974, "Blues for Two" with Zoot Sims, "We'll Be Together Again" in 1985 and 
"Summer Nights" in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 60s, Pass moved away from the guitar pick, noting: "Playing with your 
fingers is much better for solo guitar. You can get counterpoint, add bass 
lines. I decided to sacrifice playing fast with a pick to play music with my 
fingers." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Jan. 13, 1929, in New Brunswick, N.J., and reared in Johnstown, Pa., the 
boy named Joseph Anthony Passalaqua began taking lessons on a $17 guitar when 
he was 9. As a teen-ager in the 1940s, Pass worked in jazz clubs in New York 
with such noted bands as those headed by Tony Pastor and Charlie Barnet. 
</P>
<P>
 Pass spent the next decade or so working in Chicago, New Orleans, Las Vegas 
and Casper, Wyo., primarily to support a drug habit. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed in Los Angeles in 1960 seeking studio work. In 1961, he dealt with 
his drug problem at the Synanon Foundation in Santa Monica, and by 1962, made 
his first record, "Sounds of Synanon." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibiting versatility and remarkable technique, Pass was welcome in almost 
any musical setting. He performed and recorded with another player or with 
small groups, backed singers and played in studio orchestras for television 
shows hosted by Pearl Bailey, Leslie Uggams and Donald O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pass practiced several hours a day in his youth, he joked that he 
gave it up as a professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that I don't have to (practice)," he said in 1992, "just that I'm 
lazy, basically, and I do a lot of playing when I'm playing solo. . . . I 
always intend to practice, and I start for a day or two, then I stop and read 
the newspaper or Time magazine, lay on the couch. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Pass, who had lived in the San Fernando Valley for many years, is survived by 
his wife, Ellen, a daughter, Nina, and a son, Joe Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services will be held later this week at St. Mel's Catholic Church in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the USC-Norris 
Comprehensive Cancer Center or to a charity of the donor's choice.

STANFORD FACES TIGHTENING OF GRADING POLICY; EDUCATION: THE FACULTY SENATE WILL 
VOTE ON A PROPOSAL TO RESTORE USE OF FAILING GRADES. CURRENT STANDARDS ARE 
AMONG THE MOST LIBERAL IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stanford University senior Cory Sammons knew he was in over his head as soon 
as he opened the final exam in his introductory physics class two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Juggling three other classes, holding down a part-time job and playing on the 
ice hockey team, the 22-year-old engineering major had not spent much time 
reading his textbook or memorizing formulas. So Sammons nonchalantly did what 
many Stanford students do in such a situation -- he deliberately flunked the 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 If the faculty gets its way later this week, the cavalier attitude here toward 
bad marks will end with the return to Stanford of the failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 At Stanford, unlike most colleges and universities, Fs never appear on a 
student's transcript. Students here also enjoy a host of other relaxed grading 
policies, including the ability to retake classes an unlimited number of times 
to get higher grades. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, more than 90% of all letter grades are A or B, and the median 
grade in undergraduate courses last year was an A-minus. Cs and Ds are 
virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statistics have prompted the faculty to propose a thorough overhaul of 
Stanford's grading system that will reinstitute a failing grade and limit the 
number of times a student can retake a class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fond hope is that this will make the C a respectable grade again," and 
reduce the number of A and B grades given, said Gail Mahood, chairwoman of the 
committee proposing the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, there would still be no F grade. A failing grade would be 
known as NP, for not passed. Also, university transcripts would become 
all-inclusive dossiers of a student's academic successes and shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Stanford transcript is unique in that everyone knows that there's a lot 
of information not reflected in it," said Stanford Registrar Roger Printup at a 
recent meeting with students. Employers and graduate schools "often have a 
lingering suspicion that maybe something else is there that they should know 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, graduate schools put little stock in Stanford transcripts, 
giving more weight to standardized test scores and personal recommendations, 
Mahood said. 
</P>
<P>
 No major college or university, other than Brown University, has such liberal 
grading policies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economics may also be motivating the proposed changes. The university's 
chemistry department estimates that it spent $85,000 last year to pay for extra 
teaching assistants for students who repeated introductory chemistry courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing number of retakes is wasting faculty time and driving senior 
professors away from teaching introductory-level classes, Mahood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students, however, have a different view of the issue. With the competition 
stiff for spots in medical and law schools, many Stanford undergraduates scorn 
any grade lower than an A. Pre-medical students frequently retake their core 
classes in chemistry and biology to replace B and B+ grades with A's. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes have been the talk of campus in the past few weeks, from 
town hall meetings with faculty to spirited dining hall discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sherman, 20, a sophomore economics major, said the new policy does not 
sit well with him. Last fall, thinking that he might be interested in majoring 
in international relations, Sherman took a German language class. But toward 
the end of the quarter Sherman realized that his true calling was in economics. 
Facing a likely C in the class, Sherman dropped it just before the final exam 
-- a move that would be prohibited under the revised policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still learned a lot, but I was grateful for the freedom to not be burdened 
by a poor grade in a class I was just trying out," he said. If he had gotten 
the C, Sherman feels it would have hurt his chances of getting into graduate 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 While students like Sherman have been vocal in their opposition to the 
changes, many on campus, according to a recent poll by the Stanford Daily, said 
they favor reinstating the failing grade that was dropped in 1970. However, 
students overwhelmingly oppose other components of the proposal, including 
measures to limit course retakes and stiffen course-dropping policies, the poll 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although student response has been mixed, the faculty staunchly supports the 
proposed changes. A university survey of professors last year found that about 
three-quarters of all faculty support bringing back the failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeremy Cohen, a professor of communication and a member of the grading 
committee, said he believes the failing grade will harm students, not fix grade 
inflation. With a failing grade and more stringent course-dropping policies, 
students will be discouraged from taking challenging classes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If faculty want to give Cs, nothing is stopping them from doing so now," he 
said. "This proposal is simply going to limit students' ability to experiment 
in a broad liberal arts tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Grade inflation is not unique to Stanford, of course. It has been a topic of 
discussion in higher education for many years. Northwestern University's school 
of arts and sciences gives 88% of all grades in the A and B range. A's account 
for 40% of the grades given at Princeton University. And at Harvard University, 
Harvard magazine reported last year, 43% of all grades there were A's. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's Faculty Senate is scheduled to vote on the proposal Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is approved, Sammons said he and other students will no longer be able 
to take "the easy way out." But, he said, that may not be such a bad idea after 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out later the class average was so low that if I had finished the 
physics exam, I probably would have done pretty well," he said.

HEALTH; 'MUNCHIES' CRITIC IS HARD TO SWALLOW; FOOD INDUSTRY RESENTS MICHAEL 
JACOBSON'S ATTACKS ON NUTRITION RISKS. BUT THE HEAD OF THE FDA THINKS HE'S ON 
TARGET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Jacobson has a mission in life: to take the joy out of America's 
favorite munchies, from burgers to pasta to popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 To the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, there is much to admire about this 
soft-spoken academic whose idea of letting his diet go is eating rye bread 
instead of whole wheat. But in the food industry, Jacobson's name can be heard 
at the start of sentences that end with "Ayatollah Khomeini." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson is director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, which 
over the last two decades has delighted in decrying the health risks of some of 
the nation's most popular eats. From Big Macs to Italian food, Jacobson and 
company have analyzed and itemized ingredients and then with great fanfare 
shared the often surprising findings with consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 25, the group stunned movie-goers with a study of theater popcorn. A 
medium "buttered" popcorn at a typical theater contains "more fat than a 
bacon-and-egg breakfast, a Big Mac-with-fries and a steak dinner with all the 
trimmings . . . combined," the nonprofit consumer group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Faster than you can say "pass the salt," another of life's simple pleasures 
was in full cardiac arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great Ayatollah of the food industry," said Jeff Nedelman, spokesman for 
the Grocery Manufacturers of America, a food industry trade group. "He's 
single-handedly responsible for taking all of the fun out of eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but in the view of Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Dr. 
David A. Kessler, Jacobson has been years ahead of the curve with a public that 
now cares more about what it eats. Kessler recalled that Jacobson and the 
center were issuing their warnings long before there was much consumer 
awareness about food content. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobson, 50, who holds a Ph.D. in microbiology from Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, founded the center with a partner in 1971 after briefly working 
with consumer activist Ralph Nader. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, he has been a major, if not the only, player behind the 
introduction by supermarkets of extensive selections of health food, and the 
move by McDonald's and other fast-food chains to offer low-fat alternatives, 
such as the McLean Burger and fat-free bran muffins. 
</P>
<P>
 His battles are shrewdly orchestrated: scathing but pointed studies, followed 
by aggressive media campaigns, and finally his personal favorite -- a 
behind-the-scenes, work-the-phones lobbying of officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He is convinced that his group's efforts have led to vast improvements in the 
food supply in the United States. But about 400,000 deaths are still occurring 
each year as a result of poor diets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can make changes in the food supply that result in food that tastes 
just as good, it will be just as much fun to eat seasoned air-popped popcorn as 
heart-stopping popcorn," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week after releasing the popcorn study, Jacobson's nutrition blitzkrieg 
could claim victory. Three major holdout chains -- Loew's, United Artists and 
AMC -- announced the introduction of low-fat alternatives to popcorn popped in 
the fat-laden coconut oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the battle's pretty much over," Jacobson said recently, delighting in 
an announcement by Cineplex Odeon, the last holdout, that it too had 
surrendered. Immediately after release of the study, the chain had launched a 
vitriolic counterattack, saying the center has a history of creating "needless 
fear" -- citing an earlier description of fettuccini alfredo as "a heart attack 
on a plate." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hardly surprising that an organization with a history of passing 
judgments on some of life's most innocent pleasures would eventually find its 
way to popcorn . . . (it) is a study long on scary snippets, and short on truly 
convincing study techniques," said leaflets distributed by the chain to 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the second week, popcorn sales had plummeted 10% to 30% at various 
theater chains, according to reports. Cineplex Odeon ate its words, announcing 
that its patrons "will soon see the 'Lite': air popped popcorn coming soon to a 
theater near you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Those concessions, however, hardly quelled the criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need nutrition nannies out there scolding us over every bit of joy 
we have in life," said Dr. Elizabeth Whelan, an epidemiologist and president of 
the American Council on Science and Health in New York. The council receives 
about 40% of its funding from corporations such as the American meat industry, 
the National Soft Drink Assn. and the Malaysian palm oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The popcorn issue was completely overblown by Jacobson, Whelan argued. Each 
individual food is so irrelevant in terms of the fat it adds to the total diet 
that the benefits gained through negative publicity are not worth "scaring the 
daylights" out of unsuspecting consumers, such as movie-goers who eat delicious 
but fatty popcorn about five times a year on average. Most nutritionists agree, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he realizes he went too far this time," she said. "There's a big 
backlash." 
</P>
<P>
 The assault on popcorn, however, actually pales in comparison to Jacobson's 
past chutzpah. He once sent 170 extracted, rotten teeth to the Federal Trade 
Commission to protest sugary food ads directed at children. Last year, he took 
a hammer and chisel into a 50-pound block of hydrogenated vegetable oil on the 
nightly news -- to show Americans how the oil used by fast-food restaurants 
resembles soap more than oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler defended the center's aggressive tactics, arguing that "to get things 
done in Washington, you have to take a position that will serve as a 
counter-balance to other groups." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Jacobson defended his techniques by pointing out that 
McDonald's spends $750 million a year on advertising. "We don't have that kind 
of money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides some small private foundation grants, the center operates mostly with 
dues paid by about 750,000 subscribers to its Nutrition Action Health Letter, 
Jacobson said. The center now employs 35 workers and recently moved out of old 
row houses into a plush corporate-like office building. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the record, Jacobson does not see himself as a food Nazi. "Sometimes 
I'll have butter on bread," he explained. He shuns movie-theater popcorn, but 
not for health reasons. "It's outrageously priced," he complained. Jacobson's 
Junkyard 
</P>
<P>
 Michael F. Jacobson, executive director for the Center for Science in the 
Public Interest, has put fettuccini Alfredo at the top of his hit list. Item: 
Fat (g) Fettuccini Alfredo (dinner size): 97 Kung Pao chicken (typical dinner 
size with rice): 76 Jack in the Box Colossus sandwich: 75 Burger King Double 
Whopper with Cheese: 63 Lasagna: 53 Popcorn, 7-ounce bag popped in coconut oil 
and topped with butter: 42 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fat Guideline 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a 2,000-calorie diet, the consumption of fat should be limited to 
less than 65 grams per day.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FOR MEXICO, AN OMINOUS YEAR OF MURDER AND REVOLT; LATIN AMERICA: 
SPATE OF VIOLENCE UNNERVES NATION. IT BEGAN WITH CARDINAL'S SLAYING IN 
GUADALAJARA LAST MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hail of bullets that ripped through the Guadalajara airport a year ago 
today, killing a Roman Catholic cardinal, was the first obvious sign that 
Mexico's vaunted stability was teetering. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 12 months since then, Indian peasants have staged an armed rebellion in 
the south; the leading presidential candidate and a police chief have been 
assassinated in the north, and prominent businessmen have been kidnaped in 
broad daylight in the capital. Mexico has run through three attorneys general, 
and public safety has become a major issue in the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And in that year, police still have not captured the drug lords believed to be 
responsible for the killings of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo and six 
other people -- and the gunmen's escape to Tijuana on a commercial flight that 
was held 20 minutes for them. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was still attorney general last month, Diego Valades denied that the 
outbursts of violence were related. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are separate acts, isolated from each other," he asserted during a news 
conference following his report to an annual meeting of Mexican bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 But the incidents are strongly linked in the public mind. When Mexicans talk 
about the spate of violence that has shaken their nation, they date it to May 
24, 1993, the day drug dealers killed the cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying has become a lightning rod for the growing criticism of the 
government's seeming inability to maintain order, in part because the drug 
dealers believed to have been behind it are still free. Now, with each fresh 
display of weapons -- whether in urban gun battles, jungle rebel camps or an 
assassination -- the first question that police and citizens alike ask is, Did 
narcotics money pay for the arms? 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels who invaded and quickly left several towns near the Guatemalan 
border Jan. 1 took great pains to clarify that they were not linked to drug 
gangs. But in other cases, rumors of links to narcotics persist. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure to solve the cardinal's murder has also strained church-state 
relations, which had been recovering from decades of official anti-clericalism. 
Until last week, the Roman Catholic Church had publicly accepted the 
government's version of the killing: A rival gang aiming to kill drug lord 
Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman shot the cardinal 14 times by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first news conference since replacing Posadas Ocampo as archbishop 
of Guadalajara -- although not as a cardinal -- Juan Sandoval Iniguez said 
Thursday, "That is not believable." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for a stepped-up investigation to provide credible answers for why 
the cardinal was slain and how the suspected killers were able to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 According to authorities, the case has advanced little since December, when 
police arrested Francisco Rafael Arrellano, the older brother of the three men 
suspected of plotting the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Valades' report to the bishops last month, he said 10 arrest warrants were 
outstanding in the case and that 37 people were in jail and awaiting trial -- 
about the number who were arrested last June. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has not been forgotten," Valades assured the bishops. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in this election year, politicians are not letting it be forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we want six more years of assassinations of cardinals that are never 
cleared up?" Cristobal Arias, a Senate candidate for the opposition Democratic 
Revolutionary Party (PRD), asked a crowd at a campaign rally in his home state 
of Michoacan. "No!' they thundered back. 
</P>
<P>
 Arias went on to link the cardinal's death to the more than 200 murders of PRD 
activists and the March 23 assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the 
presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). 
</P>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, Colosio's replacement, has made public safety one of his top 
campaign issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the campaign rhetoric are signs that police are finding it harder 
to keep order. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the attorney general's top advisers, Eduardo Valle Espinoza, quit last 
month, asking, in his letter of resignation, "When are we going to have the 
courage and political maturity to tell the Mexican people that we suffer from a 
sort of narco-democracy?" 
</P>
<P>
 His boss, Valades, resigned a few days later, clearing the way for this 
administration's fifth attorney general and the third since the Posadas Ocampo 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of honest officials such as Diego Valades . . . as attorney 
general is worrisome," the independent newspaper La Jornada editorialized. 
"Little by little, they are worn down by an overburdened justice system and a 
climate of corruption that pervades all levels of the attorney general's 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 But for many Mexicans, the causes of these seemingly unrelated acts of 
violence go far deeper than the traditional police corruption or the influence 
of drug traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican society has undergone a profound economic change in recent years," 
said Hector Aguilar Camin, a writer known for his political novels. "That is 
going to have social and political effects." 
</P>
<P>
 The old order has been destroyed, and the violence is a sign of the need for a 
new order, Aguilar Camin said.

 Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-led government hunkered down for a long standoff 
Monday when the rebels violated a second promise to withdraw all their armed 
forces from Gorazde and the government reaffirmed that it will reject wider 
peace proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebel army's chief of staff, Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, had signed an 
agreement over the weekend with the U.N. Protection Force here pledging that 
all gun-toting Serbs, in army uniforms or otherwise, would be out of Gorazde by 
6 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the 150 armed Serbs masquerading as policemen remained in the 
U.N.-protected "safe area," U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb news agency, SRNA, accused the Bosnian government of 
preventing the pullout by refusing to sign the U.N.-mediated agreement 
outlining the terms of the Serbian withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said the deal made no demands of the Bosnian government side and said 
Milovanovic had not insisted on any additional signatures when he approved the 
terms Saturday with the U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. Gen. Michael 
Rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was in any case a restatement of the Serbs' promise of a month 
ago to leave a 1.9-mile exclusion zone proclaimed around Gorazde and backed by 
the threat of North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes if the Serbs 
failed to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic said he is refusing to sign any 
renegotiated terms of the NATO ultimatum on principle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an ultimatum, and a U.N. resolution," an exasperated Silajdzic 
said. "If you start renegotiating the terms of an ultimatum and signing new 
agreements about what has been ordered, where does it end?" 
</P>
<P>
 The exclusion zone was proclaimed around Gorazde's city center after Serbian 
forces overran nearly half of the U.N.-declared haven last month, driving 
thousands of Muslim civilians from their homes in the conquered areas and 
killing hundreds in a fierce bombardment that drew two token NATO air strikes 
and raised the threat of others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serbian forces were supposed to have withdrawn all infantry from the zone 
and all heavy weapons from within a 12-mile radius of the city. U.N. sources 
also confirm that some artillery pieces remain within the wider exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic said the Bosnian government will continue to insist on the 
resolution of the Gorazde standoff before resuming negotiations aimed at an 
overall cease-fire for Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said the Serbs have informed the U.N. mission here that its movements 
will be restricted until 570 Serbian residents of Gorazde are delivered to 
Serb-held territory and government forces vacate a hill in the exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Annink said U.N. military officials are bewildered by the demand that no 
government troops be allowed on Mala Biserna hill because it isn't considered 
strategic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another U.N. spokesman, Maj. Dacre Holloway, said the demand for moving 
Serbian civilians is being viewed as a "political ploy" because the United 
Nations has received no requests from Serbs still in Gorazde for relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials also reported Serbian rebel interference with efforts to 
deliver aid to another pocket held by supporters of the Bosnian government, 
according to the British news agency Reuters. Peter Kessler, a spokesman for 
the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, said in Zagreb, the 
capital of neighboring Croatia, that Bosnian Serbs halted 39 trucks with 500 
tons of aid destined for the enclave of Bihac in western Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the Gorazde impasse, both the rebel Serbs and the Bosnian government 
set off for meetings in southern France being organized by Western mediators 
seeking a negotiated solution to the Balkans crisis. Hopes for any breakthrough 
at those talks seemed dim, however, with the government refusing to contemplate 
a nationwide cease-fire, which would be a logical first step to an overall 
peace treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Russia and the European Union are insisting that the 
Bosnian factions accept an ethnic partitioning of the country, with the Serbs 
getting 49% of Bosnian territory and a new Croatian-Muslim federation being 
accorded 51%. Because Serbian forces now hold more than 70%, they have been 
reluctant to begin negotiations certain to lead to a reduction of their spoils. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which objects in principle to an ethnic division, is also not 
eager to capitulate after resisting the nationalist quest for ethnically pure 
territories for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 But its mostly Muslim forces are exhausted and poorly armed because of a U.N. 
embargo on weapons deliveries to all former Yugoslav republics.

JACQUELINE KENNEDY ONASSIS: 1929-1994; ONASSIS' LONGTIME COMPANION WAS 
CONSIDERED FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends said they were like an old married couple, comfortable and serene as 
they strolled through snowy Central Park or lolled by the shores of Martha's 
Vineyard on long summer weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, when Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis died Thursday of cancer, the official 
statement named three "family members" who were by her bedside: her two 
children -- Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr. -- and Maurice 
Tempelsman, the man who had been like a husband to her for the last decade and 
a half in all but name. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempelsman, a 65-year-old financier and diamond importer, was one of the 
people closest to the former First Lady in the last years of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tempelsman, a reserved, urbane, mild-mannered millionaire, was 
generally described, in the scant newspaper references to him through the 
years, as Mrs. Onassis' "longtime friend" or "frequent escort," he was, in 
fact, much more. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who covets his privacy perhaps as much as Mrs. Onassis did hers, he was 
a companion and protector. He fended off the paparazzi who relentlessly hounded 
the two-time widow, helped manage her finances, accompanied her to dinners and 
concerts, and eventually shared her 15-room 5th Avenue apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Onassis knew Tempelsman, a family friend since the late '50s, longer than 
she knew either President Kennedy or her second husband, Greek shipping tycoon 
Aristotle Onassis, whose death in 1975 ended their seven-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Mrs. Onassis, a woman often defined by the men in her life, 
and Tempelsman made a profoundly unlikely couple. She was the glamorous and 
stately living legend, a Roman Catholic who grew up amid debutante balls and 
the exclusive social swirl of the Hamptons on Long Island; he is a portly, 
balding, self-made man born in Antwerp, Belgium, into an Orthodox Jewish family 
that fled from the Nazis in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempelsman never obtained a divorce from his wife of more than 40 years, Lily, 
a deeply religious Orthodox Jew, whose father was also in the diamond business. 
They have three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences in background, Mrs. Onassis and Tempelsman had much 
in common. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempelsman advised U.S. presidents as well as leaders in Africa, where he does 
much business. He is a figure in Jewish philanthropic and national Democratic 
circles and shared an interest in the arts, antiques, foreign languages and 
history with the former First Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, lawyer Samuel Pisar, a friend of Mrs. Onassis, told a 
reporter, "This thoughtful, unlikely Jewish gentleman has put an aura of 
tranquillity around (Mrs. Onassis). Maurice doesn't show her off like 
(Aristotle) Onassis, who considered Jackie another jewel in his crown. Maurice, 
the diamond merchant, knows better; he protects her, understands her position 
and respects her privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 She first met Maurice Tempelsman in the late '50s when he arranged for John F. 
Kennedy, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, to meet a South African 
diamond magnate. Tempelsman was already making himself a player in liberal 
Democratic circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Few took note of the deep friendship that started developing between the 
Kennedy widow and the diamond importer in the late '70s. But by the early '80s, 
after Mrs. Onassis had been linked in gossip columns with such men as architect 
I.M. Pei, CBS founder William Paley and Prince Rainier of Monaco, friends and 
society watchers noted that the former First Lady was turning up more and more 
on the arm of Tempelsman. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he moved out of his apartment and into a hotel suite and, later, into 
Mrs. Onassis' apartment overlooking Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were not social hoppers, they were not secretive about the 
relationship, either, giving dinner parties together, holding hands at the 
ballet, and appearing together at the wedding of Caroline and Edwin 
Schlossberg. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summers, they would fly by chartered plane to Mrs. Onassis' sprawling 
vacation estate on Martha's Vineyard.

U.S. MULLS LIMITED CHINA TRADE CURBS; COMMERCE: NEW RESTRICTIONS MIGHT BE 
IMPOSED ON ARMY-MADE PRODUCTS. GUNS WOULD BE AMONG THOSE EASY TO TARGET, 
OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With President Clinton approaching the final days of decision about the 
renewal of China's trade benefits, the Administration is looking closely at the 
idea of imposing some limited sanctions on goods produced by the Chinese 
People's Liberation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the weekend, sources said, Administration officials asked for memos about 
how such sanctions would be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question now is whether there will be some sanctions against the PLA or 
not," one Washington-based diplomat said Monday. "I've heard that these 
sanctions would be very limited, in the tens of millions of dollars -- so low I 
can hardly believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last few years, Chinese military units have branched out into a wide 
range of economic activities, manufacturing not just arms but machine tools, 
toys and many other products. 
</P>
<P>
 Any new U.S. restrictions on PLA-made goods would be especially welcomed by 
the AFL-CIO, which has been arguing that these Chinese products, produced by 
inexpensive labor and often disguised as to their origins, have been flooding 
American markets. However, sanctions against PLA products probably would be 
opposed by the Pentagon, which has been trying to revive American contacts and 
dialogue with the Chinese military. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one specific category of PLA-made products that U.S. officials say 
will be politically easy to restrict: Chinese-made semiautomatic guns and other 
assault weapons, whose importation into this country is in the process of being 
curbed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who favor curbs on China's trade benefits are calling for much more 
extensive trade sanctions against PLA-made goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can't just be guns," said an aide to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco), 
who is among the congressional leaders of the effort to link trade with China 
and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must decide by June 3 whether to renew China's most-favored-nation 
trade benefits, which permit Chinese goods to be brought into the United States 
under the same low tariffs enjoyed by most other countries. A year ago, the 
President adopted an executive order calling on Beijing to make progress on 
human rights if it wants its trade benefits renewed beyond July. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, the American business community and economic 
officials within the Clinton Administration have complained that the 
Administration's China policy could force Clinton to impose sanctions -- and 
that the Beijing regime would retaliate against U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton met at the White House early Monday with Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and other top officials. 
Afterward, Administration officials said that the participants had discussed 
ideas but not reached any decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 China exported more than $31 billion in goods to this country last year, while 
American companies sold more than $8 billion in products to China. There are no 
reliable estimates as to the dollar value of goods made by the PLA. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clinton nears his decision, one of the unsettled questions is whether he 
will win the support of Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
Since 1990, Mitchell has been one of the leading proponents of using the annual 
renewal of China's trade benefits as a tool to help bring about improvements in 
its human rights policies. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the decision will be made in the same way it was last 
year, when Clinton Administration officials negotiated directly with Mitchell 
and Pelosi before announcing their policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess is there are going to be round-the-clock negotiations between now 
and around Wednesday," one congressional source said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has suggested that he may introduce his own legislation, imposing 
some form of restrictions on China's future trade benefits, if he thinks 
Clinton's actions toward China are too weak. Administration officials would 
like to have Mitchell's support for their China policy.

FATAL STAMPEDE REPORTED IN MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fatal stampede broke out before dawn Monday in Mecca during the "stoning the 
devil" ritual of the annual hajj pilgrimage, Saudi Arabian authorities 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of deaths was not given. A similar stampede in 1990 left 1,426 
people dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Saudi Press Agency, monitored in Bahrain, said 829 people have 
died in this year's hajj for a variety of reasons, including "deaths that 
resulted because of the heavy throngs throwing pebbles on Monday," but it gave 
no breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The ritual in the Muslim holy city involves pilgrims throwing pebbles at three 
boulders in a cavern. 
</P>
<P>
 Saudi officials previously said this year's hajj, which brought a record 2.5 
million pilgrims to Mecca, had been trouble-free.

SANDINISTAS REELECT ORTEGA IN NICARAGUA; CENTRAL AMERICA: CHOICE OF HARD-LINE 
EX-PRESIDENT AS LEADER DEALS A BLOW TO THE LEFTIST PARTY'S REFORM-MINDED 
MODERATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bitterly divided Sandinista Front reelected hard-line leader Daniel Ortega 
to head the party Monday in a major defeat for moderates who had sought to 
reform an organization that won a revolution 15 years ago but today is 
struggling to return to power. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending a four-day convention, Sandinista delegates chose a 15-member National 
Directorate, or executive council, dominated by orthodox leftists and former 
guerrilla commanders. Tomas Borge, the lone surviving founder of the Sandinista 
National Liberation Front, was elected to the No. 2 position behind Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
 The failure of the moderates, who advocated modernizing the party and 
broadening its appeal beyond the revolutionary left, raises questions about its 
future as it charts its course for 1996 presidential elections. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ortega as president, the Soviet-backed Sandinista Front ruled Nicaragua 
throughout the 1980s and fought a war with U.S.-backed Contras that claimed 
about 30,000 lives. In 1990 presidential elections, Ortega and the Sandinistas 
were upset by Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and a loose coalition of conservative 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Sandinistas plot their return to power, deep divisions have been 
exposed in a party whose disciplined unity was once legendary. Ortega and the 
hard-liners maintain that the moderates are selling out to the right and 
betraying the goals and achievements of the revolution. The moderates say they 
want to make the party more democratic and less dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the approximately 500 convention delegates, most of whom are 
the product of party machinery, sided with Ortega. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Ramirez, the Sandinista intellectual and legislator who spearheaded the 
reform movement, became the most prominent casualty when he lost his position 
on the National Directorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The radical wing of Sandinismo has control of the party, absolute control of 
the party," an angry Ramirez said as he left the convention hall after the 
vote. "There is no balance on the directorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez was a member of the original ruling junta that took power after the 
Sandinistas ousted dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979, and he was Ortega's vice 
president in the 1980s. Ramirez, a respected writer, has long represented a 
moderate current in the Sandinista Front. His defeat also jeopardizes his role 
as head of the Sandinista bloc in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega turned aside the critics, saying the debates had been healthy but that 
now the party must unify. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been a democratic process," he said after his election as secretary 
general, which came Monday morning at the end of a marathon 24-hour session. 
"It would do no good to the Sandinista Front if companeros leave here saying 
this wasn't democratic just because things didn't turn out the way they thought 
they should." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention was only the second the Sandinista Front has ever held, and it 
was the first time that Ortega was challenged as party leader. Henry Ruiz, 
another former guerrilla commander, opposed Ortega for the secretary general 
position, with Ramirez's backing. 
</P>
<P>
 With his victory, Ortega will now position himself to be the Sandinista 
presidential candidate. Yet public opinion surveys have ranked Ramirez as the 
most electable Sandinista leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this convention, the Sandinista Front has made the decision to lose in 
'96," said Carlos Tunnerman, former Sandinista ambassador to Washington and now 
a vocal party critic. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the directorate, delegates chose a 114-member Sandinista 
Assembly, a policy-making body. According to the Sandinista newspaper 
Barricada, about 65% of the assembly members who were elected also represent 
the hard-line faction, suggesting a broad sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Sandinista leadership also allowed women to be members 
of the directorate. Until now an all-male, nine-member body, the directorate 
was expanded to 15 seats, and five women were among the members elected, 
including a former guerrilla commander and health minister, Dora Maria Tellez.

HUMAN RIGHTS OBSERVERS DESCRIBE TERROR CAMPAIGN BY HAITIAN JUNTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Organization of American States human rights team accused the Haitian 
military regime Monday of murder, rape, kidnaping, detention and torture in a 
systematic campaign to terrorize Haitians who want the return of democracy and 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the team, Claudio Grossman of Chile, described the human rights 
situation as horrible and far worse than his team saw in a visit last August. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a serious deterioration of the most elemental human rights," 
he told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman and the other team members -- Patrick Robinson of Jamaica and Adm. 
John Donaldson of Trinidad -- were sent to Haiti last week by the 
organization's Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The OAS is the 
official regional organization of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing his figures as conservative, Grossman said the team received 
"conclusive proof" of 21 rapes of wives and other family members of political 
opponents of the regime so far this year. He said the crimes were committed by 
members of the army, the police and the paramilitary group known as FRAPH (from 
the French acronym of its full name, the Revolutionary Front for Advancement 
and Progress in Haiti). 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said the team also has documentation with "detailed and reliable 
information" of 133 executions between February and May. It also has reports -- 
without documentation so far -- of 210 other executions. 
</P>
<P>
 The team leader said that there is "convincing evidence" of 55 political 
kidnapings or disappearances in February and March. Of these, he said, 20 
Haitians were released, 11 were found dead and 24 are still missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman told reporters that the team also found evidence that the army 
massacred defenseless Haitians in the town of Roboteau on March 22, executing 
15 to 20 residents "with no justification." 
</P>
<P>
 "These attacks bear similar traits," he said. "Army units, assisted by FRAPH 
and other paramilitary groups, surround and burst into certain areas under the 
pretext of combatting subversive groups, indiscriminately beating residents and 
committing acts of arson, destruction and theft, followed by arbitrary 
detentions." 
</P>
<P>
 The team concluded that such acts are not just examples of brutality but part 
of a systematic campaign of repression against Aristide supporters, Grossman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the news conference, the Associated Press reported from 
Port-au-Prince that gunmen backed by the army had terrorized the Cite Soleil 
slum neighborhood before dawn Monday and killed four Aristide supporters. Two 
of the bodies were left on a street to intimidate residents.

HIGH COURT LIMITS '3 STRIKES' CHALLENGES; CRIME: DEFENDANTS CANNOT CONTEST 
VALIDITY OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS. U.S. JUSTICES ALSO REJECT A SUIT SEEKING TO STAY 
MILITARY SHIPYARD CLOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Congress poised to pass the tough "three strikes and you're out law," the 
Supreme Court ruled Monday that defendants generally do not have a right to 
raise new challenges to old convictions that now could mean life prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-3 ruling cited "ease of administration" as a reason for not allowing 
defendants to contest the validity of past convictions during federal 
sentencing hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics said the decision could send criminals to prison for life in part 
because of past convictions that were unfair or unconstitutional. Supporters 
said that the ruling will prevent the "three strikes" law from becoming 
entangled in endless litigation over old convictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Monday, in an unrelated ruling, the high court barred federal judges from 
second-guessing the Pentagon's plans to close unneeded military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 9-0 vote, the justices rejected a lawsuit by Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) 
that sought court intervention in the government's decision to close the 
Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. If successful, the lawsuit almost certainly would 
have bred similar challenges from other communities whose economic fortunes are 
tied closely to military bases being shuttered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pennsylvania senator claimed that Navy officials had wrongly concealed 
data showing the value of the Philadelphia base. But the high court said that 
decisions involving bases are left entirely to a special commission and the 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judicial review is not available" to contest base closings, wrote Chief 
Justice William H. Rehnquist for the court in the case (Dalton vs. Specter, 
93-289). 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist took the same hands-off approach in the career criminals case, which 
stemmed from the 1991 arrest of a Baltimore man, Darren Custis, while he was 
holding a bag of cocaine. Police found his loaded gun nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors moved to sentence him to a mandatory prison term under the 
Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984, which increases sentences for those with 
previous convictions. They pointed out that Custis had a 1985 conviction in 
Pennsylvania for robbery and a 1989 Maryland conviction for attempted burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 At his sentencing hearing, Custis said he would not have pleaded guilty to the 
1989 charges if his lawyer had told him he could have cited his intoxication as 
a defense. He also contested his 1985 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge ruled that he had no right to belatedly contest the convictions 
and he was sentenced to nearly 20 years in prison. The U.S. Court of Appeals in 
Richmond had upheld the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold that (the 1984 law) does not permit Custis to use the federal 
sentencing forum to gain review of his state convictions," Rehnquist wrote in 
this case (Custis vs. United States, 93-5209). "Congress did not prescribe and 
the Constitution does not require such delay and protraction of the federal 
sentencing process." 
</P>
<P>
 Rehnquist noted that a defendant who is "still 'in custody' for purposes of 
his state convictions" can raise a new challenge under federal or state law. 
But in most states, a defendant cannot raise such a challenge once his sentence 
for the conviction has been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In dissent, Justices David H. Souter, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens 
faulted the majority for cutting off challenges to convictions that were 
"unconstitutionally obtained." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Branham, a professor of criminal law at the Thomas Cooley Law School in 
Lansing, Mich., said Monday's decision departs sharply from earlier rulings 
involving previous convictions that may be flawed. It also is likely to affect 
the legal interpretation of the pending crime bill, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the more liberal House version, the bill says that an earlier conviction 
that has been found to be unconstitutional should not be counted as one of the 
so-called three strikes. However, it does not directly say that defendants have 
a right to challenge a prior conviction as constitutionally flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means somebody can spend years in prison because of convictions that 
were obtained in violation of the Constitution," Branham said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation 
of Sacramento, applauded the decision and predicted that it "will strengthen 
the enforcement of the 'three strikes, you're out' laws" in California and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitual criminals will not be permitted to delay their sentences by 
"litigating the details of procedures conducted years ago in other states," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions, the court: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ruled 5-4 that nurses who direct other less-skilled employees are 
supervisors and are not protected by federal labor law (NLRB vs. Health Care & 
Retirement Corp., 92-1964). Writing for the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy 
said that such workers are really supervisors because they are acting "in the 
interest of the employer" when they direct others. Federal labor law 
protections do not extend to management employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is a defeat for three Ohio nurses who were fired after they 
complained to management about problems at a private nursing home. The nurses' 
union, the Federation of Nurses and Health Professionals, decried the decision 
in the case and said that it will leave thousands of nurses without any 
protection for whistle-blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indicated on a 7-2 vote that trial lawyers may exclude potential jurors for 
religious reasons. The court has said that jurors may not be excluded for 
reasons of race and gender, but they refused to hear an appeal of a Minnesota 
court ruling that permitted a lawyer to exclude a juror who was a Jehovah's 
Witness. Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented in the case 
(Davis vs. Minnesota, 93-6577).

FIGHTING HALTS ENVOY'S ENTRY INTO KIGALI

<P>
 Rebel and government forces battled in Rwanda's capital Monday despite a 
promised cease-fire, blocking a U.N. envoy from reaching Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The day saw only intermittent signs of a 36-hour truce that both sides called 
to let U.N. envoy Iqbal Riza enter Kigali in an effort to halt seven weeks of 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 At least five mortar bombs landed in the capital's U.N. compound, but there 
were no reports of injuries. Riza met leaders of the rebel Rwandan Patriotic 
Front north of Kigali and was to have traveled on to the capital for talks with 
the government side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides seem to have difficulty in securing our security, so we cannot go 
along the route into Kigali," Riza said before heading back by road to Uganda. 
He said he hoped to fly to Kigali today.

VIRGINIA'S WILDER ANNOUNCES SENATE CAMPAIGN STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Democratic Gov. L. Douglas Wilder announced his Senate campaign staff 
Monday, leaving little doubt that he plans to make an independent bid for the 
seat held by Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilder, who announced in January that he would not run against his longtime 
rival, said phone calls, letters and "people that stop you on the street" had 
convinced him to take another look. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wilder said a formal announcement wouldn't come before the June 14 
Democratic primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't send out mixed signals. The fact that I dropped out and then 
reconsidered is enough vacillation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news release headed "Doug Wilder for U.S. Senate," Wilder said Glenn K. 
Davidson would be his campaign manager. Davidson was press secretary and later 
chief of staff during Wilder's four-year term as governor that ended in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson said the staff would help Wilder get the signatures of 15,000 
registered voters by June 14 so he could qualify for the November ballot.

ONE KILLED AS PAIR TAKE OVER RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men burst into a Denny's restaurant just before lunchtime Monday and 
opened fire, killing one person, wounding at least four others and taking up to 
25 hostages. They surrendered after a six-hour standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen released the hostages in groups of four or five throughout the 
afternoon. One of them was a 5-year-old boy who had been shot in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy underwent three hours of surgery and was listed in critical condition, 
said a spokesman for Community Hospital North. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men were being treated for gunshot wounds at Methodist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man was identified as Alfred Smith, 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said said the siege began with a botched robbery. Doan tried to wrestle 
a gun away from one of the men and was shot. After that, the other man "went 
crazy" and started shooting wildly, said Sgt. Frank Evans, the chief hostage 
negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sealed off the restaurant and surrounded it with SWAT teams and 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the suspects as Thomas E. Mathisen, 24, and his brother Ron, 
27. The brothers from Casper, Wyo., apparently picked the city and restaurant 
at random. 
</P>
<P>
 They face a variety of charges, including murder, attempted murder and 
attempted robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 One man had a .357-caliber pistol and the other had a weapon resembling an 
Israeli-made Uzi, a police spokesman said.

MEDALS OF HONOR GO TO SLAIN SOLDIERS' WIDOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Monday presented the Medal of Honor -- the nation's 
highest military decoration -- to the widows of two U.S. soldiers killed in 
Somalia, calling Master Sgt. Gary I. Gordon and Sgt. 1st Class Randall D. 
Shughart "real American heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 At a solemn White House ceremony, Clinton presented the medals, the first such 
honors bestowed since the Vietnam War, to Carmen R. Gordon and Stephanie A. 
Shughart. The Gordons' two children, Ian, 6, and Brittany, 3, stood alongside 
their mother as she received the medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Shughart were killed Oct. 3 in the abortive U.S. raid on a 
Mogadishu hotel where top aides to Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid were 
gathered. Eighteen Army Rangers and about 300 Somalis died in the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, 33, was a native of Lincoln, Me. Shughart, 35, grew up in Newville, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 The two tried to rescue crew members from the wreckage of a U.S. Black Hawk 
helicopter shot down in Mogadishu. Warrant Officer Michael Durant -- the 
32-year-old co-pilot and the only crew member to survive -- credits Gordon and 
Shughart for saving his life. 
</P>
<P>
 They pulled Durant out of the wreckage before being gunned down themselves. 
Captured, beaten and held for 11 days, Durant returned to a hero's welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon and Shughart "died in the most courageous and selfless way any human 
being can act," Clinton said. "They risked their lives without hesitation. They 
gave their lives to save others. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their actions were clearly above and beyond the call of duty," Clinton told 
an audience that included another Medal of Honor winner, Sen. Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.), a Vietnam veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Band played "Battle Hymn of the Republic" and "Fanfare for the 
Common Man" at the brief ceremony that also was attended by congressional and 
military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Mogadishu raid, the Administration had been accused of failing to 
provide adequate support for U.S. troops. Clinton eventually withdrew all U.S. 
forces from Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are any debates still to be had about our mission in Somalia, let 
people have those debates where they belong -- with the President and the 
policy-makers," Clinton told the East Room ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said, "But let there be no debate about the professionalism and the 
valor of those who served there, and the valor of those who died there. We are 
proud of what they did. We honor them. We thank them."

FLOWERS TO MARKET TAPES OF CONVERSATIONS WITH CLINTON; ARKANSAS: PHONE CALLS 
INCLUDE DISCUSSIONS ON DEFLECTING INQUIRIES FROM MEDIA ABOUT RUMORS OF 
WOMANIZING. PRESIDENT HAS DENIED ALLEGED AFFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM C. REMPEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gennifer Flowers, the Arkansas woman who claimed to have had a long-running 
affair with then-Gov. Bill Clinton, today is releasing for sale what she calls 
"the complete and unedited" tapes of four telephone conversations with Clinton 
she recorded in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has steadfastly denied having an extramarital affair with Flowers, a 
one-time Little Rock nightclub singer and former state employee. 
</P>
<P>
 A preview of the tapes found extensive discussions between Clinton and Flowers 
about how to deflect persistent media inquiries into rumors of Clinton's 
womanizing, but little evidence that would settle the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers has scheduled a press conference in New York today to announce plans 
to market the tapes, along with a 70-page transcript and booklet titled: 
"Setting the Record Straight," for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have much money left," Flowers said in an interview here. Flowers was 
paid by the Star tabloid in 1992 for her story, and also posed for a Penthouse 
feature later that year. She has since been living in Dallas in a leased 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes were made during four separate telephone conversations from 
December, 1990, when Clinton had just won reelection as governor, to December, 
1991, the early weeks of the presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In the months since the first excerpts were released, the Flowers story has 
gained some corroboration from a group of Arkansas state troopers, some of whom 
said they took Clinton to rendezvous with Flowers. One former Clinton bodyguard 
also said he was present when the governor used his car phone to call a state 
official for help getting Flowers a state job. Clinton has denied that he did 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conversation recorded on Oct. 21, 1991, shortly after Clinton had 
announced he was seeking the presidency, Flowers warns: 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill, what I'm afraid of is that if somebody in the press finds out that I'm 
working for the state, they're gonna make a big deal of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A few moments later Clinton acknowledges: "Yeah, I never thought about that, 
but as long as you say you've just been looking for one . . . If they ever 
asked if you'd talked to me about it, you can say no." 
</P>
<P>
 In another exchange a month earlier, Clinton appears to be enlisting Flowers 
to help trap Republicans who he suspects are offering money for her story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you what -- it'd be extremely valuable . . . to have an on-file 
affidavit explaining that, you know, you were approached by a Republican and 
asked to do that." Flowers said that she wasn't sure she could do 
"cloak-and-dagger" work. 
</P>
<P>
 Periodically, throughout the tapes, Clinton advises Flowers to "hang tough" 
and deny any involvement with him. What is not explicitly clear in the context 
of the tapes, however, is whether he is advising her to deny an actual 
relationship or a rumored affair.

AMA SCOLDS INSURERS, CALLS FOR STRONGER DOCTORS' VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Escalating its struggle for control over medical decision-making, the American 
Medical Assn. on Monday harshly accused the insurance industry of keeping 
consumers "in the dark" on details of their health policies and called on 
Congress to protect patients by guaranteeing doctors a strong voice in 
treatment decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a full page ad in the Washington Post headlined: "What You Don't Know CAN 
Hurt You," the AMA said that its proposal would "require insurance companies to 
give you all the information you need before you join a health plan. They'll 
have to tell you what is and isn't covered . . . (and) what sort of approval 
process you have to go through to get the care you need." 
</P>
<P>
 Without such reforms, insurers will "take over the examining room," said Dr. 
Lonnie R. Bristow, AMA board chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 In promoting the "Patient Protection Act," the AMA sought to strike a populist 
note as a consumer champion. But AMA leaders conceded that the proposal might 
just as accurately be called the "Physician Protection Act." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you bet we want protections for doctors -- because doctors are one-half 
of the doctor-patient relationship," Bristow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, managed care networks -- rather than physicians -- are deciding 
for patients what services are allowable and which physicians they may see. 
Managed care generally refers to health plans that impose varying degrees of 
restrictions on doctors and patients as a way to control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristow, of San Pablo, Calif., said that the AMA also wants Congress to 
require insurers to reveal to doctors "exactly who is reviewing their work," 
putting an end to what he called "the KGB-like secrecy." He singled out for 
criticism the Big Five insurers that dominate the managed care industry: Aetna, 
Prudential, Cigna, Metropolitan Life and Travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara B. Hill, vice president for health policy of the Prudential Insurance 
Co. of America, rejected the AMA's charges and said that the nation's largest 
doctors organization was acting primarily out of self-interest.

TOBACCO FIRM BELITTLES 'USED' SMOKE'S EFFECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tobacco industry began what is expected to be a vigorous counterattack 
against the government assault on smoking Monday as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. 
launched a public relations campaign to "bring some balance to the debate 
surrounding second-hand smoke and other issues surrounding cigarettes." 
</P>
<P>
 In full-page advertisements in major U.S. newspapers, the company insisted 
that nonsmokers are routinely exposed to "very little" second-hand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads claimed that in a month a nonsmoker living with a smoker would be 
exposed to environmental smoke that was, on average, the equivalent of smoking 
1 1/2 cigarettes in a month. "A nonsmoking waiter working eight hours a day, 
five days a week" for a month would be exposed to the equivalent of two 
cigarettes, according to the ads. 
</P>
<P>
 "And a nonsmoker sharing a modern office with a smoker would, on average, be 
exposed to the equivalent of 1 1/4 cigarettes" in a month, the ads concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's action came at a time when smokers are under an unprecedented 
siege by the federal government, states and other forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, tobacco proponents suffered a significant defeat when the House 
Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment approved a 
measure that would impose widespread restrictions on smoking in public 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Labor Department has proposed rules to prohibit smoking in the 
workplace, and the Pentagon has announced that it will do so in its work sites 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these initiatives have been fueled by the decision of the 
Environmental Protection Agency to classify second-hand smoke as a "Class A 
carcinogen," meaning that it is an indisputable cause of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA and an array of medical and public health experts have called 
second-hand tobacco smoke a cause of lung cancer and heart disease in 
nonsmokers and of asthma in children. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has estimated that such environmental smoke causes about 3,000 lung 
cancer deaths in nonsmokers annually and that as many as 300,000 children 
younger than 18 months become sick every year from smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry has challenged the EPA's ruling, saying that the agency did not 
conduct any original research and its conclusions were based on flawed science. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol M. Browner lashed out at the Reynolds campaign Monday, 
saying that it "will not distract the public from the real issue: that 
second-hand smoke poses a serious health problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Chris Coggins, a toxicologist who is a scientist with Reynolds, said that 
the company's calculations are based on measuring nicotine levels in the air, 
since it is a compound found both in mainstream smoke and second-hand smoke and 
is "the only commonly used second-hand smoke marker that is specific to 
tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 The ads urged discussion rather than government intervention, saying that "the 
solution to most smoking issues can be found in accommodation."

VICTIM OF '84 RAPE HAUNTED BY MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the days and weeks after the rape, she could not walk her high-school 
hallways without stares from students who knew what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly a decade after she met Edward Patrick Morgan at a teen-age party 
and he sexually assaulted her, a 26-year-old south Orange County woman is 
tormented by the news that he may have struck again. Morgan, who was sentenced 
to three years in prison after pleading guilty to raping the woman in 1984, was 
arrested Monday as a suspect in the murder of 23-year-old Leanora Annette Wong. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have never gotten out of jail," said the woman, who was 16 when 
Morgan raped her. She spoke Monday on the condition that her name not be 
published. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget it. . . . I can talk about it, I'm over it, but it's never 
going to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not scared, because logically you think, OK, nothing's going to happen 
to me. But at the same time, your heart's kind of beating fast, thinking, 'My 
God, he's out there again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who grew up in La Palma and now works at a real estate firm, 
learned Morgan was a suspect in the Wong killing Sunday night when a friend 
phoned with the news. After a few moments of shock, she and her husband of four 
years dug through the weekend newspapers to read about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The details of her own experience in October, 1984, remain vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just met him at a party. He showed up late. My girlfriends were all there. 
He seemed like a very nice man. He asked me if I wanted to take a walk outside 
to talk. I said sure," the woman recalled. "We walked three houses down, he 
pushed me in between two houses and started to molest me. He turned almost into 
a different person within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a knife on him. He threatened to kill me if I didn't do what he 
wanted," she remembered. "Then after slapping me around the whole time, I 
pretended I was dead or passed out so he would leave. . . . As soon as I didn't 
hear footsteps anymore, I put my clothes on and ran back to the party." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was arrested that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard going back to school," the woman recalled, noting that she spent 
a year in psychological therapy after the rape. "People were staring at you and 
pointing a finger at you."

 A security guard at a subdivision construction site in north Stockton was 
found shot to death execution-style, and a friend was run over by a car and 
killed a few feet away, police said. Sgt. Billy Wykert said the guard at the A. 
G. Spano site was found bound, gagged and shot in the back of the head inside a 
trailer. The second victim was run over outside a fence that surrounds the 
construction site.The guard was identified as Larry Loehr and the other dead 
man as Eugene Cats. Both were from Stockton. The killer or killers used the 
second man's car to knock down part of the fence and apparently fled in that 
vehicle, Wykert added. The car was found abandoned and burned.

 UC Santa Cruz officials said a federal report on campus sexual harassment is 
filled with errors and omissions. University officials responded in a 22-page 
letter to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights report that 
charged that UC Santa Cruz did little to assist female students who complained 
of harassment, the San Francisco Chronicle reported."We simply didn't have our 
day in court," UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Karl Pister said. "The prosecution made 
its case and the defense was never called." Among other things, the 
government's report misquoted some people, gave incomplete or inaccurate 
information about disciplinary hearings and portrayed campus officials as being 
more sympathetic to the accused than to victims, the letter said. The civil 
rights office's regional director, John Palomino, declined to comment on the 
May 13 letter. The university has agreed to improve the process for handling 
sexual harassment charges, but officials have been reluctant to sign a 
"voluntary resolution plan" until the alleged errors in the report are 
corrected. UC Santa Cruz could lose federal funding if found to have violated 
Title IX, the 1972 federal law prohibiting gender discrimination in education.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: BENTON'S LOSSES INCREASE DESPITE REVENUE GROWTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benton Oil and Gas Co., an Oxnard energy concern, saw its losses widen to 
$1.14 million in its first quarter ended March 31, despite revenue more tlehan 
doubling to $3.76 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same period a year earlier, Benton lost $748,000 on $1.8 million in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said its total revenue grew in the latest quarter because of 
growth in oil sales and increased ownership in its Venezuelan project, the 
start of oil sales from its Russian project and higher returns on other 
investments. However, Benton's operating, administrative and interest costs 
rose sharply for its Venezuelan and Russian projects.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: KENFIL INC. REPORTS A $7.1-MILLION LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing the Northridge earthquake, Kenfil Inc., a Van Nuys-based software 
distributor, reported a loss of $7.1 million in its fiscal third quarter on a 
42% decline in sales compared with a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The big loss for the quarter ended March 31 contrasted with a profit of 
$815,000 in the same period a year earlier.Sales in the latest quarter declined 
sharply, to $27.7 million from $47.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenfil, which recently agreed to be acquired by AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. 
of Irvine, said its loss included $2.8 million in earthquake damage to 
inventory, office equipment and other related costs. Kenfil said that the quake 
also forced the company to halt business for two weeks and that cash-flow 
shortages caused the company to sell certain inventory below costs. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Kenfil said that as of March 31 the company fell out of 
compliance with certain covenants under its senior credit line and senior 
subordinated note. Kenfil said its senior credit line expired April 30, but has 
been extended through May 31. A Kenfil spokesman said it was unlikely the 
covenant violations would affect Kenfil's recent agreement to be acquired by 
AmeriQuest in an all-stock deal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the latest quarterly loss, Kenfil posted a loss of $6.9 million for the 
nine months ended March 31, versus a profit of $1.7 million a year earlier. 
Sales for the latest nine-month period dropped 9%, to $124.2 million from 
$137.2 million a year earlier.

COMING BACK FROM WHEN CHIPS WERE DOWN; CAMARILLO: VITESSE SEMICONDUCTOR IS 
ENGINEERING A RECOVERY BY IMPROVING ITS TECHNOLOGY AND CUTTING COSTS. AT&T IS 
ONE OF THE NEW CUSTOMERS FOR THE COMPANY'S GALLIUM ARSENIDE CIRCUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vitesse Semiconductor Corp. has achieved a turnaround considered unlikely only 
two years ago, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo company, which makes gallium-arsenide computer chips, went 
public in December, 1991, at $9 a share, and though it had few sales, it was 
touted as a company to watch. The excitement was created because 
gallium-arsenide circuits, while more expensive than conventional silicon-based 
semiconductors, enable electrons to travel two to three times faster on chips 
using less power. The technology was seen as promising for increasingly 
powerful computers. 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1992, Vitesse's stock had soared to $21 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Vitesse's hopes for profiting in the small market for high-speed 
chips were short-circuited by its reliance on one customer, Convex Computer 
Corp. of Richardson, Tex., a supercomputer maker that accounted for about half 
of Vitesse's revenue two years ago. When the supercomputer market turned south, 
Convex's orders to Vitesse dropped almost to nil. Suddenly Vitesse had excess 
inventory and too much production capacity. In its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 
the company lost $19 million and its revenue plunged 30%, to $26.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now analysts say Vitesse has engineered a recovery by improving its 
technology, cutting costs and boosting its sales to several big customers, 
including AT&T and Intel Corp., plus other telecommunications and data 
communications firms and manufacturers of semiconductor testing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect Vitesse to break even or earn a small profit -- its first in 
two years -- in its fiscal third quarter ending June 30. And they predict 
Vitesse's stock, now at about $5 a share, has finally hit bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 (In the six months ended March 31, Vitesse pared its loss to $4.44 million 
from an $11.6-million loss a year before, while its revenue shot up 48% to 
$16.8 million from $11.4 million.) 
</P>
<P>
 That's just in time for the tiny technology company, which has seen its cash 
level dwindle to $5.2 million as of March 31 from more than $25 million after 
its stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point it looked as if Vitesse might go out of business, said analyst 
Mark Edelstone at Prudential Securities in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've stayed the course, got costs under control and entered new markets," 
he said. Vitesse's liquidity is "not my concern now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse President and Chief Executive Louis Tomasetta said that Vitesse was 
like "a new start-up company two years ago." Now, he said, probably 80% of 
Vitesse's business is "from customers we weren't doing business with two years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Among its new customers are telecommunications companies such as AT&T, 
Northern Telecom and Alcatel Canada, which use Vitesse's gallium-arsenide chips 
in the fiber-optic and high-speed switching networks they are building. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications customers now account for nearly 40% of Vitesse's revenue, 
and Tomasetta sees the company's sales to that industry doubling over the next 
year as the so-called information superhighway develops. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, AT&T was named a prime contractor to build Bell Atlantic 
Corp.'s planned multibillion-dollar interactive video network. 
</P>
<P>
 Data communications -- the moving of information among computer networks -- is 
another new market for Vitesse. The company also hopes to sell into the 
high-end personal computer market. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse has begun shipping semiconductors called cache memory controllers -- 
which act like traffic cops in moving information back and forth -- to giant 
semiconductor maker Intel Corp., which is producing a new generation of PC 
microprocessors called Pentium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse has also increased sales to semiconductor testing companies including 
Teradyne Inc., Megatest Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd. Tomasetta said that only 
gallium-arsenide semiconductors can operate at speeds fast enough to test 
state-of-the-art silicon chips. That business, accounting for nearly $2 million 
in sales for Vitesse in the March 31 quarter, could grow by half over the next 
two years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To break into these new markets, Vitesse invested in technology to make its 
circuits even smaller and more powerful. It has also increased productivity, in 
part by reducing the infiltration of dust particles that can ruin production 
runs. And Vitesse has trimmed employment through attrition and layoffs, from 
300 workers at its peak two years ago to 210 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's more efficient, Tomasetta said, the company has been able to 
lower prices on some products. Whereas silicon is found in abundance in 
ordinary sand and silicon chips can be cheaply produced, gallium is relatively 
rare and combining it with arsenic is an expensive process. Prices for 
gallium-arsenide semiconductors range from $10 to $1,000 apiece and are 
generally about three times as expensive as the most common type of silicon 
chip. 
</P>
<P>
 But when measured against the highest-performance silicon chips, Tomasetta 
said, Vitesse's semiconductors are still two times faster and are now more 
comparably priced. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Vitesse recently announced it was lowering its prices by about 40% on 
one line of gallium-arsenide chips that compete with silicon circuits only a 
step up in speed from mainstream chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Vitesse still faces plenty of competition from other gallium-arsenide vendors 
such as TriQuint Semiconductor in Beaverton, Ore., and even more so from makers 
of high-performance silicon chips such as Motorola Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. 
and Fujitsu Ltd., which have made great strides in improving silicon 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditional silicon has carried the load much further and longer than we had 
estimated," said analyst Daniel L. Klesken at the Robertson, Stephens & Co. 
investment firm in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Klesken said that by the end of the decade, Vitesse could reach 
$200 million in annual sales if it successfully develops the new markets it has 
targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tomasetta: "We're not going to get a chance to rest, at least not for a 
while."

OVERSEAS BUSINESS A BOON FOR LOCKHEED AIR TERMINAL INC.; TRANSPORTATION: GROWTH 
IN THE AIRPORT DEVELOPMENT BUSINESS WILL COME FROM SOUTH AMERICA, ASIA AND 
EASTERN EUROPE, AS GOVERNMENTS PUSH FOR MODERN, WESTERN-STYLE AIRFIELDS TO SPUR 
THEIR ECONOMIES.

<P>
 Lockheed Air Terminal Inc., one of Lockheed Corp.'s smaller businesses, has 
been quietly and profitably running Burbank Airport since the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Lockheed, the future growth in the airport business is overseas. 
Although the company has slowly expanded to provide services to 20 other U.S. 
airports in recent years, Lockheed expects business in South America, Asia and 
eastern Europe to overtake its domestic airport business by the end of the 
decade, thanks to a burgeoning foreign market for private airport management 
and development services. 
</P>
<P>
 Developing nations are now clamoring for state-of-the-art, Western-style 
airports, considered a key to economic development. Many countries are 
considering privatization plans, including Australia, Argentina and 
Khanty-Mansiysk, a remote outpost of Siberia -- all markets where Lockheed Air 
Terminal has been studying possible airport projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "A significant number of international airports will be privately operated and 
we expect to have our fair share," said Lockheed Air Terminal President Viggo 
Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, Lockheed Air Terminal is still a small piece within aerospace giant 
Lockheed Corp., which is headquartered in Calabasas. Analysts estimate Lockheed 
Air Terminal's annual revenues at under $100 million per year, compared to $13 
billion for Lockheed Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the only foreign airport Lockheed manages is the Lester B. 
Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Ontario. The company was a partner in 
a group that built the $480-million terminal, which opened in 1991 and includes 
a shopping center. Lockheed is now a minority owner and still manages that 
terminal, which has been a money maker from the start, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next stage of growth in the airport market worldwide seems to be from 
developing nations that want to develop modernized airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed is already involved in some airport projects in the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 In Khanty-Mansiysk, an autonomous oil-producing region of Siberia, the 
government hired Lockheed to draft a development scheme for a new terminal. 
Currently, Khanty-Mansiysk depends on barges to transport cargo, but its 
waterways are frozen all but four months a year, so the region needs an airport 
ready to handle cargo year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 In Turkmenistan, in the former Soviet Union, Lockheed led a consortium that is 
now finishing a $150-million runway and airport terminal, installing everything 
from conveyor belts to handle baggage, to air conditioning in the sweltering 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Regions once geared only for travel behind the iron curtain must now update 
their airports to accommodate Western air traffic, said Robert Aaronson, 
executive vice president of Lockheed Air Terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airports, unlike most other infrastructure, generate most their revenues in 
hard currency -- hard, foreign currency," which is why developing nations are 
interested in privatizing airports, said Robert Poole, president of the Reason 
Foundation, a Los Angeles-based, economic think tank which specializes in 
privatization issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, more developed countries are privatizing their airports in search 
of cheaper ways to run or expand airports. The Australian government may sell 
some of its 23 airports to the private sector. Lockheed Air Terminal would like 
to bid on the Australian airports if they are put up for sale, and the company 
is looking into similar projects in Eastern Europe, South America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 In the airport development and management business, Lockheed Air Terminal "is 
really the only real U.S. player on a world scale now," according to Poole. 
</P>
<P>
 But others are hastening to get in on the boom. A unit of Hughes Aircraft Co. 
is completing negotiations with the airport authority of Trinidad and Tobago. 
Hughes will lead an international team that will build a new $80-million 
terminal in that sunny, oil-producing, former outpost of the British empire. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hughes said it has completed studies for the Ukraine on ways to upgrade 
that country's airports. One reason is that the Ukraine wants to transform the 
Crimea, site of successive military invasions, into a tourist hot spot, said 
Dan Reeder, spokesman for Hughes Aircraft Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the airport market overseas should be plenty to keep Lockheed Air 
Terminal busy. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is girding itself for further expansion. Since last fall, four new 
executives, including Aaronson, have been brought in to help steer the company 
into international markets. Aaronson is the former president and executive 
officer of the Air Transport Assn. of America, and was also director of 
aviation at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, where he was 
responsible for management of Kennedy International and La Guardia airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed Air Terminal is also awaiting word on its bid for a contract to 
supervise construction of a new airport terminal in Istanbul, Turkey. Lockheed 
has been asked by governments in Hungary, Argentina and Venezuela to make 
suggestions for possible airport improvement projects. And the company has 
completed a study on a possible new airport terminal in Beijing, China, again 
at the government's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving the market for private airport projects abroad are governments that 
aspire for economic growth, but don't have the means to provide the 
infrastructure. Poorer nations are under pressure from the International 
Monetary Fund to avoid debt, and many see privatization as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Developing nations are recognizing that airports are a part of economic 
development and they see airport expansion as a key," said Hensley Evans, 
manager of the international privatization group of Price Waterhouse in 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 But the emerging airport market overseas, though promising, is marred by 
political uncertainties, warned Wolfgang Demisch, analyst for BT Securities 
Corp. In Canada, after last year's parliamentary elections, the new government 
withdrew from an agreement to hire private companies, including Lockheed, to 
revamp two more terminals at the Toronto airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lockheed Air Terminal's Butler said that the risks of airport development 
and management are not as great as in other enterprises. After all, an airport 
amounts to a public utility, and so "You have a certain measurable traffic that 
goes through these cities and you can predict over time what that traffic will 
be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's roots in the airport business date back to 1929 when it was 
called United Airport Co., then a part of United Airlines. The company was sold 
to the Lockheed Corp. in 1940, said Butler, and it once owned and operated 
Burbank Airport. In 1978, it sold the airport to the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena 
Airport Authority, but Lockheed stayed on as airport manager and now manages 
the complex there, overseeing aviation safety, maintenance, construction and a 
host of other operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lockheed Air Terminal's attention is mostly focused overseas, the 
company still hopes to line up more domestic contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 When Richard Riordan ran for mayor, he talked of leasing all or part of Los 
Angeles International Airport to the private sector to raise additional money 
for the city. The suggestion has since been shelved, but not for lack of effort 
by Lockheed Air Terminal. The company poured $158,000 into lobbying city 
officials for privatization in 1993 -- the second largest corporate lobby to 
the Los Angeles city government that year. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Mayor Riordan ever revives his plans to privatize LAX, Lockheed 
officials promise they'll be first in line to bid on that project too.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: IWERKS COMPLETES DEAL TO PURCHASE RIVAL FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iwerks Entertainment Inc., a Burbank producer of special-format movie theater 
systems and virtual reality attractions, said it has completed its $17-million 
acquisition of rival Omni Films International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal called for Omni shareholders to receive $4.4 million in cash and 
about 1.49 million shares of newly issued Iwerks common stock, worth $13 
million based on Iwerks' stock price when the deal closed on Thursday.Or, 
instead of the stock, Omni shareholders could receive $1.42 in cash for each 
Omni share, and 0.424303 share of Iwerks common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Omni, based in Sarasota, Fla., specializes in designing and manufacturing 
large-screen, three-dimensional and motion-simulation theaters. Under the 
agreement, Omni will become an Iwerks subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Iwerks said it recently signed contracts valued at about $4 
million to develop theaters in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks simulation theaters are being developed in Thailand, which is scheduled 
to open in September, and in the Philippines, which will open in October. 
Another simulation theater in China is due to open in September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Iwerks is also constructing giant-screen theaters for a science and technology 
museum outside Beijing, China, due to open this summer, and at the Singapore 
Discovery Center, an educational and entertainment complex scheduled to open in 
July, 1996.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: GTE MAY RELOCATE 120 FROM THOUSAND OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE Corp. said that it will probably relocate about 120 employees from its 
regional headquarters in Thousand Oaks as part of a reorganization of some of 
its telephone operations support services. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the GTE California headquarters in Thousand Oaks handled billing, 
government affairs and public affairs for GTE telephone operations in 
California, Hawaii and the Northwest -- which includes Washington and Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reorganization, each of the three regions will now be responsible 
for those support functions, and the 120 employees will be relocated to various 
locations. The three regions will continue to report to GTE Telephone 
Operations in Irving, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamford, Conn.-based GTE is the nation's largest independent local phone 
company. GTE California, its local subsidiary, will have about 2,400 employees 
remaining in Ventura County.

COVER STORY; FORECLOSURE AFTERSHOCK PREDICTED; A WAVE OF MORTGAGE DEFAULTS MAY 
BE IN THE OFFING NOW THAT THE MORATORIUM ON PAYMENTS FOR QUAKE-DAMAGED HOMES 
HAS EXPIRED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in a quiet neighborhood in West Hills, real estate agent Brett Howard 
glances furtively at a house across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The lender foreclosed on this house in January. But Howard doesn't have to 
knock on the door to tell that people are still there. Trash containers on the 
side are full, and, through a slit in the drawn blinds, Howard can see that 
someone has just turned off a lamp. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're living there for free now, so they're in no hurry to get out," Howard 
says, jotting the license plate number of the car parked in front of the house. 
Last week's visit was Howard's fourth in a month to this address. Pretty soon, 
he says, "We'll be back with a marshal and a locksmith. The marshal will escort 
them out and we'll change all the locks." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard checks properties for Ron Prechtl, a real estate agent at Century 21 
Lamb Realtors in Northridge who specializes in selling foreclosed properties 
for lenders. These days Howard is on the move a lot, and his workload is about 
to get heavier. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Prechtl's office, a team of four others is fielding a flood of price 
requests from banks on houses soon to be foreclosed -- many of them properties 
damaged by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Most lenders gave homeowners with quake 
damage a three-month break on mortgage payments, but that moratorium has 
expired, and banks are starting to serve default notices, so other borrowers 
are walking away from their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pipeline of foreclosures is beginning to fill up again," Prechtl says. 
Prechtl, 33, had his best year ever in 1993, selling about 140 houses, more 
than half foreclosures. His office grossed $750,000 in commissions, from which 
Prechtl pays out big overhead expenses. Through April this year, he's sold 
another 75 properties, and he expects the new wave of foreclosures from the 
earthquake to keep him busy until at least the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely going to come," Prechtl says. "We're bracing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosure proceedings typically take four months, so many quake-damaged 
properties repossessed by banks won't hit the market until late summer. But 
when they do, they will add to an already-overabundant supply of 
recession-triggered foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley, which has helped 
drive down Valley housing prices to 1988 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year lenders repossessed a record 3,650 single-family houses and 
condominiums in the Valley -- 20 times more than in 1990, according to TRW-REDI 
Property Data in Riverside. And Valley foreclosures were up 38% in the first 
quarter of this year, compared to the same period in 1993. Banks don't want 
foreclosed properties on their books, so they often dump them at fire-sale 
prices, which keeps driving down prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Through April of this year, the resale price of an existing single-family 
house in the Valley averaged $230,080 -- down 9% for all of last year, and down 
from a peak of $296,675 in 1990, says the San Fernando Valley Assn. of 
Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the median price has been even more severe. In April, house buyers 
in the Valley paid a median price of $179,000, down 12% from $204,000 a year 
earlier. The median price is the point at which half the houses sold cost more 
than $179,000 and half cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen the bottom of prices fall out yet," says Catherine McKinley, 
a real estate consultant in Newhall and a former vice president at 
Pasadena-based Countrywide Funding, the nation's largest mortgage lender. 
McKinley, who has been helping homeowners hurt by the quake, doesn't see Valley 
housing prices rebounding until the end of next year. And then, she says, "It's 
going to be a slow and gradual ride back up the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices fell even though single-family house sales in the Valley rose 12% last 
year, and through April sales were running 22% above last year's pace. 
Meanwhile, the inventory of houses for sale last month dropped to a seven-year 
low of 6,280. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the strangest market I've ever dealt with," says Dale Fay, owner of 
Century 21 Oak Tree in Valley Village, who has been in real estate since 1961. 
Resurging demand for houses is supposed to push prices up, she says. "But this 
is defying all the curves, all the projections, just everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Fay's 20 sales agents sold 15 houses in April, a few more than a year earlier. 
But eight of them were foreclosures, Fay says, and the average price of those 
15 houses sold was down about $100,000 from April, 1990. "What's going to 
happen when we see another glut of foreclosures?" she asks worriedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreclosures aren't the only reason for the sinking resale price of houses. 
Low mortgage interest rates in the past year have lured a lot of first-time 
buyers, who generally start out with smaller and cheaper houses, lowering the 
overall resale price. And after the earthquake, brokers say, many homeowners 
decided to sell damaged properties "as is" at a big discount. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Brown, 24, fits both categories. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city employee, Brown last month bought his first home, a 
three-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Mission Hills. The house went on the 
market in November at $154,000. But after the quake caused some cosmetic damage 
to the property, the owner re-listed it at $139,000, and Brown bought it for 
just $125,000. Brown got in with just a 3% down payment, the rest financed 
through a 30-year mortgage at a fixed rate of 8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says he's already fixed most of the quake damage himself. "I know I got 
a good deal," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But across the street from Brown's house are two other properties that will 
probably soon be added to the stockpile of Valley foreclosures. One owner lost 
his business and was overcome by personal bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The second property, a five-bedroom, two-story house, was badly damaged by the 
quake. Cracks ran along many of the walls, lumps formed on water-damaged 
ceilings, and the block wall was a pile of rubble. Shortly after the quake, 
neighbors say, the brothers who lived there packed up and moved to Arizona. 
They apparently took the toilet in one of the bathrooms because it was ripped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take what they can get," said Howard, the Century 21 agent who inspects 
properties. "Now some contractor will probably buy it, fix it up and sell it. 
This house you can probably get pretty cheap. The bank doesn't want it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage lenders say borrowers can avoid a smear on their credit record by 
trying to work out a solution with the mortgage holder. More financial 
institutions today are willing to strike unusual deals with quake victims such 
as "short payoffs," in which a lender agrees to accept less than full repayment 
on a mortgage if the property is sold. This enables the borrower in effect to 
walk away and keep his credit rating intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Some lenders are also offering secondary loans, or a restructuring of the 
mortgage, so borrowers can have lower monthly payments. Lenders, however, are 
generally not extending the three-month payment moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Karin Hopkins, manager of the loan department at Glendale Federal Bank, says 
the savings and loan has been aggressive in arranging short payoffs, once 
viewed by financial institutions as anathema. Glendale Federal expects a loss 
of about $15 million from short payoffs, foreclosures and other problems from 
borrowers affected by the earthquake. Glendale Federal's current supply of 
repossessions are up 5% from a year earlier, but Hopkins says it's unclear 
whether a big wave of foreclosures is coming. "From talking to borrowers, there 
are a lot of people rebuilding," she says. "It's anybody's guess what's going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth-based Great Western Bank, the nation's second-largest savings and 
loan, says 2,000 borrowers asked for a temporary deferment on their loans. Of 
that number, about 250 reported they had major structural damage and did not 
have quake insurance. "We have no idea how many will be foreclosure cases," 
said spokeswoman Linda Mueller. But if all 250 homes with major damage have to 
be taken back by Great Western, Mueller says that at an average loan amount of 
$130,000, it will cost the S&L $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and S&Ls want to avoid foreclosures because the properties are costly to 
maintain and sell. Some lenders dispose of repossessed properties through 
auctions or through bulk sales to Wall Street firms, many of which then 
contract with people like Ken Westfall to sell the foreclosed real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm, Westfall & Co. based in Denver, Colo., had an abundance of 
foreclosures in that state in the 1980s. But now much of Westfall's work is in 
California. Currently he has about 1,000 properties on the market in 
California, of which 350 are in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Westfall often fixes up foreclosed properties that need repairs, and then he 
farms them out to local real estate brokers. Westfall says he tries not to dump 
the houses in the market, but he knows of clearinghouses like his that flood 
the market with foreclosed real estate at cut-rate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just to get rid of the volume," he says. Westfall thinks there's a lot 
of pent-up demand in Southern California, but he says buyers lack confidence. 
"I don't see the number of foreclosed properties diminishing until the middle 
of next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether sold in auctions, through clearinghouses or brokers, the large volume 
of foreclosures overall drives down other home values, because appraisals are 
generally made by comparing the last three houses sold in that area. 
Foreclosures also make it harder for would-be trade-up sellers to compete, so 
they can't unload their properties and move up in the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard L. Schapira, a Hermosa Beach lawyer, has about 100 homeowners for 
clients, including many in the Valley, who are trying to renegotiate their 
mortgages. Many of them bought their homes at the height of the market in the 
late 1980s, now they've lost their equity or they owe more than the property is 
worth because of the housing slump. Some of his clients are struggling with big 
quake repairs bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Schapira says some lenders are agreeing to accept short payoffs and 
restructuring interest rates and monthly payments. Schapira says he's arranged 
short payoffs for as much as $340,000 off the principal balance of a mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 But he says some lenders are giving homeowners little choice but to walk away. 
One lender, he says, wanted a $35,000 contribution from a client of his in 
mitigation of a short payoff. The borrower balked, Schapira says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had clients who have thrown up their arms and walked away because the 
banks were completely unreasonable," said Schapira, whose business has doubled 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even excluding these cases, Schapira says lenders have told him that for 
"every borrower who attempts to work with the bank to save his credit, two or 
three don't bother and they just walk away." Foreclosure Boom in the Valley 
Housing Market 
</P>
<P>
 Single-family house sales are up, and inventory is way down. So why are prices 
still falling? Because last year there was a record of foreclosed houses in the 
Valley, and bank repossessions continue to climb this year because of the long 
recession. But this summer more owners of earthquake-damaged properties are 
expected to also walk away from their houses. Often these foreclosed houses are 
sold at fire-sale prices, which keeps driving down prices for the overall 
market.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: NEW HOME SALES JUMP IN APRIL, BUT PRICES SOFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fueled by a dramatic increase in sales of new homes, Ventura County's 
residential real estate market continued its almost yearlong comeback in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 998 houses and condominiums changed hands in the county last month, 
15% more than in the same month last year, Dataquick Information Systems 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 While far below the 60% year-to-year sales increase in March, last month's 
improvement was the ninth in a row, according to La Jolla-based Dataquick. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders sold 128 new homes in April, triple the 39 sold in April, 1993, said 
Dataquick. But last month's 708 resales of single-family houses represented 
only a 4% gain over the same month last year. Condominium resales in April 
totaled 162, up 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices continued soft, however, with the median price paid for all homes 
falling to $192,000, 6% below $205,000 a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're settling into a normal market -- neither the feverish pace of 1988 and 
1989 nor the dead times of 1992," said Dataquick analyst John Karevoll. He 
expects a trend toward adjustable-rate mortgages to continue as interest rates 
increase on fixed-rate loans.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: MEDICAL PROPERTIES' LOSS WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical Properties Inc., an Encino-based real estate investment trust, 
reported that its first-quarter loss widened to $684,000 from $598,000 a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue in the three months ended March 31 was $274,000, down 4% from $284,000 
in revenue in the first quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Properties is in default on about $13 million in debt that was due on 
Dec. 31. That amount was reduced from $14.4 million because it sold a medical 
facility in Oregon, but the company said it has not been able to sell any of 
its remaining properties and has no other resources to pay the debt. It also 
said its remaining properties are estimated to be worth substantially less than 
the unpaid debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical Properties said it is trying to restructure and obtain new capital for 
property investments. But foreclosing on its existing properties remains a 
possibility, it said.

DESERT ONCE A PEACEFUL OASIS FOR VICTIM OF ODD EXPLOSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Lynn Standish, a single mother killed by a mysterious explosion in the desert 
near her home, was remembered Monday by friends and family as a woman who often 
hiked through this sandy terrain, looking for collectibles, recyclables and a 
few moments of peace in what was sometimes a troubled life. 
</P>
<P>
 The desert calm was shattered Friday afternoon, investigators said, when some 
type of explosive device went off while Standish, 33, was sifting through 
discarded items in a patch of open desert. She might have either picked up or 
stepped on the item that turned out to be an explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved making jewelry," said her mother, Virginia Holmes. "She would find 
old beads or old bottles that they don't make any more. She'd find old lace out 
there -- even clothes. It was peaceful and relaxing. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved anything to do with the outdoors." 
</P>
<P>
 With a smile, her father, Keith Holmes, added: "She came back the other day 
and showed me she had 10 pennies that someone had thrown away with their junk." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Standish's three sons accompanied her on the hike. Her 4-year-old son, 
Michael Hepburn, suffered a serious leg injury in the blast. His brother, 
Jeffrey Standish, 9, who was standing a short distance away from his mother, 
was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members provided some details about what happened after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that Michael was injured, Jeffrey took off his own shirt and used it to 
cover his younger brother. Jeffrey then carried Michael to their mother's car. 
A passing motorist, who apparently heard the explosion, summoned help. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was not hurt, Jeffrey stayed in his brother's Antelope Valley 
Hospital room for three days after the accident, offering comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandparents said Michael must remain in traction for four weeks while 
receiving treatment for his leg injury, but they said he is expected to 
recovered fully. 
</P>
<P>
 A third son, Jared Standish, 14, had not joined the others on the hike. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of her death, Standish was not employed. She lived with her 
parents in the small unincorporated town where she had grown up. She devoted 
most of her time to caring for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a single mother, she felt she needed to be with the three boys," Holmes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standish had relocated to Colorado late last year, hoping to find work and a 
new start for her life. The move did not work out, however, and she returned in 
January, deciding that Pearblossom was the best place to raise her sons, her 
parents said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had struggled being a single mother," Holmes said. "But we felt she was 
at a real peaceful time now in her life, with a real positive direction." 
</P>
<P>
 After Standish's death, church members and neighbors in Pearblossom, about 20 
miles east of Palmdale, quickly rallied around the surviving family members, 
offering sympathy, meals and donations for Standish's funeral and for her sons' 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes was touched by the outpouring of support but remained mystified by her 
daughter's sudden death. "It's hard to explain your feelings," she said. "You 
know what's happened, but you don't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, sheriff's homicide investigators were still trying to figure out 
what sort of explosive device Standish had stumbled upon and who left it along 
a dirt road near 106th Street East. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was some sort of an explosive device -- that they are sure of," said Sgt. 
Noel Lanier. "But they don't have any more specific information." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime residents of Pearblossom and neighboring Littlerock said they have 
complained for years about the widespread dumping of old sofas, appliances, 
junk vehicles and other trash in the undeveloped desert areas. But county 
officials have said they have neither enough funds nor staff to adequately 
enforce laws against dumping in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents have complained about the discarded goods, others, such 
as Standish, have looked for treasures that may be mixed within the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, several local leaders said that before Friday, they'd never heard of an 
explosive device turning up among the discards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here for seven years, and I've never known anyone who's gone out 
to the desert collecting things and has become injured like this," said April 
Biglay, a Littlerock horse-riding enthusiast. "We're always looking for 
rattlesnakes when we're on horseback -- not pipe bombs." 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral service for Lynn Standish will be held at 1 p.m. Thursday at 
Pearblossom Foursquare Church, 34005 123rd St. East. Officiating will be the 
Rev. Cheryl Baker, a close friend of Standish and her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said she will treasure the sand-dollar necklaces that Standish crafted 
for her and her daughter. "She was very creative," the pastor recalled. "She 
enjoyed talking to my brother, who is a woodcarver. She was a very friendly 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunday's service, several church members shed tears over Standish's death. 
"It really brought eternity close, that you never know when you're going to 
die," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is accepting donations to help with the family's expenses. Baker 
said checks can be mailed to P.O. Box 440, Pearblossom, Calif. 93553.

SAMUELS PRESSED FOR DETAILS OF FAST-LANE LIVING AFTER SLAYING; TRIAL: 
CROSS-EXAMINATION IN DOUBLE MURDER-SOLICITATION CASE BRINGS OUT STORIES OF 
COCAINE, LIMOUSINES, A CANCUN CONDO AND MORE AFTER SHE INHERITED $500,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Mary Ellen Samuels told it, she was a shy person whose spending habits 
changed not a whit after her husband was murdered in 1988 and she inherited 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid bills. I lived like I normally did," Samuels told a jury as she 
testified in her own defense at her murder trial in Van Nuys Superior Court 
last week. "I bought a new car." 
</P>
<P>
 But a different portrait of Samuels emerged Monday after she endured a 
prosecutor's surgical cross-examination in her double murder-solicitation case 
that reads like a trashy novel. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the new car was a $75,000 Porsche. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels, 45, denied that she hired a hit man to kill her estranged husband, 
then two other hit men to do in the executioner. She has testified that the 
prosecution witnesses -- many of them once her closest friends -- all lied when 
they linked her to the murders of her husband, motion picture camera operator 
Robert Samuels, 40, and the suspected killer, reputed cocaine dealer James 
Bernstein, 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi's cross-examination, Samuels stuck to her 
story that $500,000 did not change her lifestyle, even if she did spend most of 
it in about nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 But as cross-examination wore on, Samuels' description of living like she 
"normally did" seemed to fit the dictionary definition of life in the fast 
lane: cocaine, limousines, fur coats, the Porsche, night clubs, a country club 
birthday bash, a condo in Cancun, trips to Las Vegas and San Francisco, loans 
to friends.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, she testified that when her husband was alive, "there never seemed to 
be enough money." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi's questions made it clear she considered Samuels anything but a demure 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "You testified you are very shy," Maurizi stated, then moved in for the kill, 
asking Samuels about a photograph taken months after she was widowed. In the 
snapshot, she is wearing nothing but $20,000 in cold cash and a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels responded that she'd had a few drinks when the picture -- her 
boyfriend's idea -- was snapped in a motel room in Cancun. Her testimony 
contradicted that of the boyfriend, Dean Groover, who earlier told the jury 
that the pinup pose was "both our idea" and that Samuels hadn't been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor pressed Samuels about the time she showed up at a boyfriend's 
hotel room wearing only a fur coat and teddy, and "cheesecake" photographs that 
Samuels insisted were taken for a mother-daughter contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was short on specifics about the mother-daughter contest. Last week 
she testified that she wore a teddy for the photos. Monday, she objected to the 
description "cheesecake" and denied wearing the teddy. 
</P>
<P>
 The contradictions were large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Samuels said she left her husband in October, 1986, then changed the 
date to November. On Monday, she said it was in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi dug into credit card records, insurance records, divorce papers, even 
telephone records in confronting Samuels. She asked the defendant why 
Bernstein, a reputed cocaine dealer, would keep her name and social security 
and bank account numbers in a notebook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," Samuels said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the chief topic was money. Maurizi, alleging that Samuels killed for 
financial gain, is seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the prosector's questioning, Samuels conceded that she received about 
$500,000 in insurance proceeds and real estate following her husband's death. 
Had they divorced, she said they'd agreed she'd receive about $30,000 and 
support payments of $1,200 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month after he died, Samuels had traveled twice to Las Vegas. On one 
trip she charged two coats, worth about $1,600.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of those was a full-length coat, the other was a jacket. If they were 
real fur, it would have been more than that for one," Samuels explained. 
</P>
<P>
 She had outfits custom-made at a store called Trashy Lingerie, running up 
bills of $1,500, four for $1,100, one for $900 and another for $800. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you still say your lifestyle didn't change?" Maurizi persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I got to do more things, naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most glaring contradiction came on a seemingly benign topic: Whether 
she had taught a pet parrot to say disparaging things about the investigating 
officer, now-retired Los Angeles Police Detective George Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels denied it, saying she'd tried to teach the bird to say, "Mary Ellen," 
but it refused to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a courtroom moment that borrowed from both Perry Mason and Monty Python, 
Maurizi confronted Samuels with a transcript of a conversation taped by David 
Navarro, one of the friends she allegedly tried to talk into killing Robert 
Samuels. Some time during the fall of 1989, Navarro wore a recording device 
that captured Samuels on the subject of the bird: 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro: Did you teach the bird to say that phrase yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels: Which one? 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro: About Daley. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels: Saying, "Daley sucks"? . . . No, I tried to, though. . . . I'm going 
to train the bird to say it. That would be a delight to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels said she didn't remember the conversation, and that the words didn't 
sound right.

BEARS' SOJOURNS TO SUBURBIA NOT UNCOMMON, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER and MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raging hormones, the search for food and animals' basic instinct to wander 
their territory may be behind two incidents in which bears roamed out of the 
forest to the edge of suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 While the visits from the California black bears -- one had a deadly encounter 
with police officers in Azusa on Friday and another took a more tranquil jaunt 
in Agua Dulce on Sunday -- may be disturbing to residents of the foothills near 
the Angeles National Forest, wildlife experts say such sojourns by the 
lumbering animals are not uncommon, particularly at this time of year. When 
they aren't in deep sleep, bears' lives revolve around eating and procreating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have bears that have come out of hibernation. They're looking for food 
and they're breeding," said Larry Sitton, a senior biologist with the state 
Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitton said his office typically receives 10 to 20 reports of bear sightings a 
year in neighborhoods and other areas outside their usual habitat. "I've been 
here seven years and every year during this time we have bears showing up in 
areas that are unlikely. They come into the edges of cities and cause some 
brouhaha." 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case Sunday, when a bear wandered into Agua Dulce, rattling 
nerves in the sparsely populated community nestled between the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents remained a bit nervous Monday, keeping a close watch on their 
children and making sure their trash cans were securely shut to deter bears 
from rummaging for food. They said there are plenty of animals in the 
surrounding hills -- raccoons, snakes, coyotes and mountain lions -- but for 
many, the bear sighting was a first. 
</P>
<P>
 The bear, whose weight was estimated at 250 pounds, was spotted near Agua 
Dulce School and made its way into a back yard. Although the noise and dust 
created by a low-flying Sheriff's Department helicopter at one point chased the 
bear back into the foothills, it showed up in a nearby mobile home park about 
an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun-wielding manager of the Hacienda Vasquez Mobile Home Park on Agua 
Dulce Canyon Road pursued the bear for about 15 minutes on foot before it again 
disappeared into the foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Smith said her husband, Ian, had the .45-caliber handgun at the ready 
in case of trouble. "He was more concerned with it getting the kids than it 
getting him," she said. "It wasn't aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Agua Dulce School teachers were briefed about the incident and asked to tell 
their students to be cautious, said Principal Carol Urban. She said officials 
closed a gate between the school and a field, but no other precautions were 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Azusa incident, a police officer spotted a 350-pound bear in the middle 
of a road. The bear wandered into a cul-de-sac and, after two tranquilizer 
darts failed to bring it down, headed toward town. Officers with 12-gauge 
shotguns pumped 14 rounds into the bear, killing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Brown, a biologist with the Angeles National Forest, said most bears 
avoid people. Nonetheless, they can be deadly. A mother bear, he noted, will 
attack someone who gets between her and her cubs, although he could not recall 
such an incident occurring in or near the national forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep your distance because they can kill you," he said. "Try to make yourself 
as big as possible and do a lot of screaming and yelling. You don't want to try 
and outrun one because you will not be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Stewart, a zoology professor at Cal Poly Pomona who has studied 
California black bears since 1970, said yearling bears chased off by their 
mothers are the ones that most often end up outside the forests, although it 
was uncertain if the bears in Azusa or Agua Dulce were yearlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're kind of on their own," he said. "They haven't established a home 
range so they wander." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said food probably brought the bears into the communities. 
</P>
<P>
 They estimated that 60 to 200 black bears in the 650,000-acre Angeles National 
Forest typically begin their annual hibernation with enough body fat to supply 
nutrients through the winter and spring, although the bears will awaken and 
rummage for food if they get hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Sitton: "Whenever they find a source of food like garbage from a 
neighborhood that offers them a real reliable food source, they're reluctant to 
move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Bears mainly eat vegetation, but Stewart said this year's light rains may have 
made that food supply less plentiful, which may cause a higher than normal 
number of bear sightings in developed foothill areas. Bears can smell food 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not just food or wandering that have the bears out and about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's breeding season," Sitton said. "The males are a little crazy right now. 
They tend to wander a lot more looking for females. The more they wander, the 
more likely they are to bump into neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 And Agua Dulce residents are preparing for just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home park manager Smith said she spent Monday morning spraying the 
trash cans at the park with a combination of cayenne pepper, bleach and Tabasco 
sauce, hoping the odor would keep bears away. She also kept a watchful eye on 
her 3-year-old daughter, Ashley. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Melendez, a resident at the park for two years, said his family is 
taking no chances. He said his 7-year-old nephew, Luis, normally walks to Agua 
Dulce School across the street, but on Monday the boy was driven. Melendez's 
3-year-old daughter, Ruth, and niece, Marlee, 2, were being kept under close 
watch at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we're really scared, because we have kids," he said. "We don't know 
if it's a dangerous bear or a nice one." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was as concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Rex, a Lancaster resident examining sites at Smith's mobile home park, 
said the thought of bears in the area may make her more likely to move there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be cool," she said, "because I like wildlife." Where Black Bears 
Roam 
</P>
<P>
 California now has more black bears than in decades, perhaps even longer. An 
estimated 17,000 to 24,000 inhabit the state's forests, and they are expanding 
into previously unoccupied areas. 
</P>
<P>
 AREAS OCCUPIED BY BLACK BEARS 
</P>
<P>
 About half are packed in California's northwestern corner at about two per 
square mile. Roughly 6,500 bears inhabit the Sierra Nevada. The San Bernardino 
and San Gabriel mountains have an estimated 200 to 400 bears. Bears are 
sporadically seen in San Diego County and San Joaquin Valley. Bears have 
crossed Interstate 10 and reached the San Jacinto Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 BEAR HABITAT, BY COUNTY 
</P>
<P>
 California has about 46 million acres of forested land that are suitable for 
black bears. Counties with the most habitat, in millions of acres. Mendocino: 
2.19 Shasta: 1.56 Humboldt: 1.55 Trinity: 1.47 Siskiyou: 1.31 Fresno: 1.31 
Plumas: 1.18 Monterey: 1.08 Tehama: 1.01 Tuolumne: 0.88 * THE AMERICAN BLACK 
BEAR Size: 4.5 to 6 feet long and 2 to 3 feet high at the shoulders. Weight: 
200 to 400 pounds for adults. Coloring: Black to cinnamon brown usually with a 
patch of white on chest. Face is always brown. Range: In California, pine and 
hardwood forests and chaparral. Food: Fruits, berries, acorns, grasses, roots, 
small mammals such as rodents, carrion,insects, and even garbage. Habits: 
Solitary and territorial, with a shuffling walk and a stride about a foot long. 
Adult males occupy areas of about 20 square miles and often kill off young 
males that approach on their territory. Females mate in mid-July every other 
year and give birth to one or two cubs at a time. If forage conditions are poor 
the bears cannot reproduce for a year. Hibernation: Hibernates from mid-winter 
to early spring.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; COUPLE CONVICTED OF CODE VIOLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Topanga couple who accused county officials of extortion have been convicted 
of building-code violations in connection with a rental house on a feud-ridden 
cul-de-sac. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury sitting in Malibu deliberated four days before 
convicting Art Starz and Kathleen Kenny last week of violating Los Angeles 
County plumbing, electrical, health and building codes. Starz was convicted on 
14 counts and Kenny was convicted on two. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the couple made improvements on the house without building 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny said prosecutors wasted the public's time with the case, which she 
maintains was the result of pressure by neighbors and county officials who had 
personal differences with her and Starz. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this time of Rodney Kings and Reginald Dennys, 12 adults spent 32 hours 
discussing when we put in a water heater," Kenny said. "It's just 
mind-blowing." 
</P>
<P>
 The unoccupied house on one of three lots owned by the couple is built to 
code, Kenny said. But four years of attempts to get permits have proved 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Joan Manley, who prosecuted the case, said her office was 
obliged to pursue charges after Kenny and Starz failed to cooperate with other 
county agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If, after the best efforts to get someone to correct a problem, there is no 
progress, that's where we come in," Manley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The convictions are the latest development in a bizarre, four-year battle 
between Starz and Kenny, their neighbors on Cave Way, and county building and 
safety and health officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the conflict is a 700-square-foot house that, like many homes 
in rustic Topanga Canyon, had been rented to tenants without proper 
certification from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming they were denied building permits for the house because they refused 
to bribe county officials, Starz and Kenny filed a racketeering lawsuit against 
Los Angeles County, several county employees and a private architect in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge dismissed the complaint in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Each misdemeanor count carries a possible maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and 
six months in jail. Sentencing is set for June 15. KURT PITZER

 For many boys growing up in single-parent homes, a Big Brother can mean the 
difference between feeling lost and knowing that someone cares. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 200 boys, ages 7 through 14, are on a waiting list to be matched with a 
Big Brother through Catholic Big Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is looking for men throughout Los Angeles County, and 
particularly in the San Fernando Valley, to spend three to five hours a week 
with a boy who has asked for a Big Brother. Often, the Big Brother gets as much 
from the pairing as the youngster, said Karen-Alicia Robertson, director of 
public relations for Catholic Big Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Big Brothers get a sense in the beginning that they're doing 
something for the community. But as they build a relationship with their little 
brother, it becomes something they wouldn't give up," Roberston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Brothers make a commitment to spend time with their little brother for at 
least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of commitment in a child's life is really important. They don't 
need someone to flake on them because they've had that happen," said Robertson. 
"The little brothers get a sense that someone cares for them. Their 
relationship with authority figures really improves. They don't feel the need 
to be antagonistic and they do better in school. They feel a sense that the 
future can be positive for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Big Brothers, founded in 1926, also serves hearing impaired boys ages 
6 through 18. Big Brothers in the Hearing Impaired Program, the largest of its 
kind in the nation, must be capable of meeting the needs of the hearing 
impaired community. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholic Big Brothers is a United Way agency affiliated with Big Brothers/Big 
Sisters of America, with offices located in Pasadena, Van Nuys, Bellflower, 
West Los Angeles and the downtown area. Big Brothers do not have to be 
Catholic. For more information, call (213) 251-9800 (V/TDD).

scheduling appointments, distributing conservation materials, filing and 
answering telephones. Volunteers are asked to work four- or eight-hour shifts 
one day a week.  
</P>

<P>
 Up With People is looking for families to serve as hosts to members of its 
cast when the international student group tours the San Fernando Valley next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of 150 students range in age from 17 to 26 and hail from 22 
countries. About 50 more families are needed to house the students, said Ana 
Kallstrom, host family coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosts would be responsible for transporting the students to local shuttle 
points from Sunday evening until the following Sunday, and would be asked to 
provide breakfast and dinner each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very good experience for both the families and our students," said 
Kallstrom. "It's wonderful to take someone in from another state and another 
country and learn about their culture." 
</P>
<P>
 For information about being a host to a performer from Sunday through May 29, 
call Kallstrom at (213) 359-6346 or (310) 614-7562.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; $3 MILLION SOUGHT TO FUND THEATERS 
</P>

<P>
 Hoping to capitalize on the success of the newly renovated Alex Theatre, 
Glendale city staff members have asked the Redevelopment Agency for $3 million 
to fund several theaters as anchors for a cultural arts district. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding request would spend $2.5 million to build a 300-seat playhouse for 
The Colony Studio Theatre and budgets $500,000 for renovation efforts and rent 
assistance for a local theater company, A Noise Within. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, will consider these 
requests as part of the agency's 1994-95 budget. The budget must be finalized 
by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The theaters would join the 69-year-old Alex Theatre along the Brand Boulevard 
corridor as part of a citywide theater district -- designed to attract other 
businesses to the area such as coffeehouses, bookstores and art galleries, said 
Jeanne Armstrong, redevelopment agency director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to create an individual niche for Glendale -- to set aside the 
city from other communities in the area," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope theaters would lead those who work in Glendale during the day 
to stay in the city for dinner and a show in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer theaters are expected to parrot the Alex's success, where business has 
doubled at restaurants around the 1,463-seat theater on performance nights 
since the Alex reopened in January after a $6-million renovation effort.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY SEEKS TO ANNEX GATED COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the request of homeowners, the Calabasas City Council has proposed annexing 
a gated community that abuts land slated for the controversial Ahmanson Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Annexing the 825-acre Mountain View Estates would give Calabasas control over 
a larger section of Thousand Oaks Boulevard -- a proposed access to Ahmanson 
Ranch -- but would not block plans for the mini-city, said Calabasas Planning 
Director Steve Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas must get permission to annex the land from the Los Angeles County 
Local Agency Formation Commission, which oversees boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas sent its application to the commission this month, Harris said, but 
the review process often takes as long as a year.  
</P>
<P>
 The application was filed after 49 residents of the area north of the Ventura 
Freeway between the city line and Crummer Canyon Road petitioned Calabasas 
officials, saying they wanted to enjoy the benefits of living in the city. The 
area includes Gates Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Calabasas is going to be one of the most culturally oriented cities 
as it grows," said Bill Bell, vice president of Mountain View Estates 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to use the recreation facilities and the opportunities for 
getting together with our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we moved in," Bell said. "most of us thought we were part of Calabasas."

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FOURTH ARREST MADE IN CREDIT-CARD RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank police have arrested a fourth person in a credit-card fraud ring that 
allegedly includes a Los Angeles police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarence Josey, 30, of Hawthorne posted $25,000 bail Friday after being 
arrested Thursday at his place of work in Pacoima on charges of embezzlement, 
conspiracy to commit computer fraud and credit-card fraud, Burbank police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Josey's job and the name of his employer were not released, but Burbank Police 
Detective John Dilibert said that he works for a firm that has access to 
credit-card numbers. Josey's role in the ring was allegedly to supply credit 
card information to be used for fraudulent cards. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, Phillip Clemons Davis, 33, assigned to the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Central Division, pleaded innocent Friday to 
charges of possession of a forged driver's license, possession of a counterfeit 
seal, insurance fraud and the sale or receipt of fraudulent credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our investigation following Mr. Davis' arrest led us to Mr. Josey," Dilibert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was arrested May 9 with two others in the case, Tandra Ann Sadr, 19, and 
Monica Coles, 28, both of North Hollywood. Sadr and Coles pleaded innocent to 
burglary charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit-card ring allegedly used an electronic encoder to alter the 
magnetic strips on the back of credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Elizabeth Siegmund said all four defendants in the case are 
to appear in Burbank Municipal Court on June 6, when Josey will enter a plea 
and a date for a preliminary hearing will be set. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; FUND SHORTAGE MAY SHUT PET RESCUE GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They are among the most motley groups of orphans left in the aftermath of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake -- and their fate is hanging in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Dogs, cats, birds, even a rabbit and her young were putting up a healthy 
ruckus at the Pet Rescue Assn. in Sun Valley Monday as their hostess spoke of a 
cash shortage and the possibility of going under. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate the idea of us not being able to survive," said Annette Petelle, 
president of the nonprofit humane organization. "This is Shangri-La compared to 
the animal shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 A steep drop-off in donations has left the association three months behind in 
mortgage payments, not to mention behind in food and veterinarian bills. The 
facility's annual budget is about $60,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll find a way to keep going," said Petelle, who co-founded the 
organization 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility accepts pets from people who no longer want them and attempts to 
find them new homes, typically for a fee, or "donation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of the earthquake, people are too preoccupied or short of 
funds to donate, Petelle said. "And you really can't blame them, either," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, just when donations are down, referrals are up as more people 
bring in animals they no longer want. The facility's kennels, which handle 
about 125 animals, are at full capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely the reverse of what it usually is this time of the year, 
springtime, when people are thinking of adding a new pet," Petelle said. "Now 
they're thinking of getting rid of them because their fences are down, their 
houses are damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 Petelle said donations may be sent to 8906 Norris Ave., Sun Valley 91352. GREG

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HEARINGS ON RULES FOR HORSE OWNERS HALTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pressed by hundreds of angry horse owners as well as city officials, the Los 
Angeles Planning Commission has decided to halt hearings on a new city 
ordinance regulating the keeping of horses and send the controversial document 
back to the Planning Department for retooling. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called "Horse Keepers Bill of Rights" -- which many horse owners say is 
anything but -- was put on hold last week after public outcry and letters from 
Mayor Richard Riordan and City Councilmen Hal Bernson, Joel Wachs and Richard 
Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, whose 12th District contains many horse owners, initiated the 
ordinance more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually been taken off the calendar and been sent back to the staff," 
said City Planner Cora Smith, who worked on the ordinance. "We really believe 
that we came up with a pretty good ordinance to address all their concerns, but 
I guess they didn't think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Prince, a horse owner and spokesman for the West Valley community group 
PRIDE, said he was happy the ordinance was stopped for the time being but hoped 
that the issue would still be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased that it's not going to wipe out horse keeping," he said. "But on 
the other hand, I want to see something done to protect horse keeping. We're 
(back) in the same position we've been in for 10 years," without a 
comprehensive horse-keeping ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what the "bill of rights" was intended to be, a single 
ordinance that delineated horse-keeping regulations and consolidated the 
different rules of separate agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was released early this month, however, horse owners called it a nail 
in the coffin of equine use in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other problems, they pointed out, a majority of horse keepers in the 
Valley would become non-complying overnight due to the new rules. Non-complying 
lots would receive an exemption, but if a registered horse was not kept on the 
property for three years the exemption would be lost. The owners of the lot 
would then have to comply with the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission delayed a vote on the ordinance at a meeting May 12 
because it lacked a quorum, and rescheduled it for this Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the ordinance has been dropped from Thursday's agenda, Chief Zoning 
Administrator Robert Janovici said, and it may be some time before his 
employees can get to it again. ERIC SLATER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; TEMPORARY STREET CLOSURE TIES TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents are complaining about traffic congestion caused by the temporary 
closure of Universal Place between Lankershim Boulevard and Willowcrest Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners who live in the Weddington Park South neighborhood say that the 
closure, due to water pipe replacement under Universal Place, has made 
Bluffside and Valley Heart drives the only routes into and out of their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Before April 11, when the project began, neighbors could also use Universal 
Place for access to Lankershim Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, neighbors say, is motorists on Lankershim who block the 
intersection with Valley Heart Drive, making it difficult for residents to use 
the only entrance and exit route currently available to them. The 
pipe-replacement project is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Biff Elliot, a resident of Weddington Park South, said that he has had to wait 
up to 15 minutes to turn onto Lankershim.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't go out of here," said neighbor Dee Crider. "A couple of mornings ago, 
at 10:30, I had to wait for three lights because traffic (on Lankershim) looked 
like a slow-moving parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot and Crider said they would like to see the city or county assign a 
traffic officer to the corner to stop drivers from blocking the intersection. 
Elliot said the problem is worse on nights when there are special events at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 A traffic officer or supervisor will be sent to check on that intersection 
Friday and Saturday, said Betty McMaryion, a senior supervisor with the Los 
Angeles Department of Transportation's Valley Parking Enforcement Office, which 
is responsible for directing traffic in emergencies and other unusual 
circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 But McMaryion said that, due to a shortage of traffic officers, someone cannot 
be assigned to that intersection on a regular basis and will only return when 
her office receives a complaint. The traffic supervisor said she was not aware 
of the Department of Water and Power, which is replacing the pipe, requesting 
traffic assistance related to the project. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; SCHOOL BUYS PARCEL ADJACENT TO CAMPUS

 Exercising its budget autonomy in an unprecedented move, the San Fernando 
Valley's first charter school concluded negotiations Monday for the purchase of 
an $80,000 property adjacent to its campus at 13330 Vaughn Street in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaughn Next Century Learning Center closed escrow with the Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp. on a 7,900-square-foot property with an abandoned one-story 
house, making it the first school in the Los Angeles Unified School District to 
purchase property independently of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a done deal," said Vaughn principal Yvonne Chan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will foot the bill. We will house the kids. I'm ecstatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said the purchase of the property is the first step toward returning the 
elementary school to a traditional calendar by adding classrooms to accommodate 
all 1,100 students at once and increasing the number of instruction days from 
163 to 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other overcrowded schools in the Valley, Vaughn now operates three 
rotating "tracks" year-round to make space for all of its students. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds for the property came from savings generated by the school in its 
first year of operation. Chan said she hopes to have the property in use by 
January, 1995, either by bringing in portable classrooms or, if the necessary 
permits are approved in time, bulldozing the existing structure and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be all one track by July 1," Chan said. "We would be the only 
traditional school running on 200 days a year." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to using the space for five portable classrooms on the new 
property, the charter school will also bring two classrooms to its existing 
campus. SUSAN BYRNES

PIT BULLS' OWNERS CHARGED IN ATTACK; CRIME: A COUPLE ARE ACCUSED OF MISDEMEANOR

 Misdemeanor charges have been filed against the owners of two mixed-breed pit 
bulls that attacked a woman as she was taking an afternoon stroll, city 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges of violating the city's leash law, harboring a dangerous animal 
and operating a kennel without a license were filed Friday against Edward Ecock 
and his wife, Andrea Valente. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna J. Smith, 57, of Panorama City was dragged to the ground by the dogs and 
bitten over much of her body near the intersection of Parish Place and Chandler 
Boulevard on May 12. She required about 80 stitches on her face and has been 
released from St. Joseph Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs -- Cheyane, a 3-year-old female, and Dutch, a 5-year-old male -- were 
placed under a 10-day rabies quarantine. They are currently being held as 
evidence at the Burbank Animal Shelter until a judge rules on their fate.

 "Certainly, we'll be requesting the destruction of the animals," said 
Assistant City Atty. Terry Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
 Valente, who insists that she, and not her husband, owns the dogs, said she 
has been so upset since the incident that she has been unable to eat or sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like our family members," said Valente, 28. "They sleep in our beds 
with us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel terrible. I don't want my dogs to be taken away, but I'd never want 
someone to get bitten. . . . My dogs are like everything to me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the attack on Smith, the dogs were being watched by Valente's 
8-year-old son. Valente claims that Smith provoked the animals. Smith could not 
be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment for Ecock and Valente has been scheduled for June 23.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; METROLINK CHIEF EXPECTS THE SERVICE TO KEEP GAINING GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Sabbatini

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metrolink commuter rail system began operating in October, 1992, providing 
service between Downtown Los Angeles and suburban communities. Concerns about 
high fares, stagnant ridership and several deaths caused when trains hit 
motorists or pedestrians -- some apparently committing suicide -- had some 
questioning the line's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Stanger, 47, executive director of Metrolink, called the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake the biggest boost the rail line has experienced as 
commuters, especially those in the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys, had few 
other options available for getting to work. Ridership has taken a dip as more 
roads open, but the Santa Clarita line continues to carry five times as many 
riders as before the earthquake, and ridership on other lines is up by about 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanger was interviewed by special correspondent Mark Sabbatini. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Question: How will last week's opening of the Golden State Freeway affect 
Metrolink ridership?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I don't expect that there will be much of a change in our ridership 
with the opening of I-5. People that are using Metrolink tend to be more 
towards the east, more towards the Lancaster area and Canyon Country. I-5 is a 
bit towards the west of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about when the Antelope Valley Freeway reopens?  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's the one we've got to watch, and that is due to open by the end of 
July and will probably come in earlier, because they have a big incentive. We 
are doing a lot of work to improve speeds. We have a target of completing 
everything by June, before the Highway 14 ramps are put in, so that we can get 
people on our higher-speed lines for at least a month before they try the 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's your prediction for ridership on the Santa Clarita line in the 
coming months, as the after-effects of the earthquake subside?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Right now we're about 5,500 trips on that line, which is over five times 
what it was before the earthquake. We expect that will drop into, say, the 
4,000 area, maybe a little more, with an average next year of 4,700 trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You went up to 11,000 riders on that line the week after the earthquake. Is 
there anything you can do to lure those riders back?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We actually got up for three days to 21,000 riders just on that line, but 
we were back to 11,000 the second week. Through February and March we were at 
about 8,100, and we're now at 5,500. 
</P>
<P>
 There are things we can do to lure them back, and we have a very intensive 
effort of speed improvements, especially in the Santa Clarita to Lancaster 
area. We're going to cut time basically by half. It took us right after the 
earthquake an hour and a half to go from Lancaster to Santa Clarita. It'll take 
us about 45 minutes to do that, which is almost competitive with an automobile. 
We're also putting in some speed improvements south of Santa Clarita, so you'll 
be able to go from Santa Clarita to Downtown (Los Angeles) not in 52 minutes, 
but actually in 42 minutes, and that's for a 35-mile trip. So that's almost 
within the 50-m.p.h. range which, compared to what it takes to drive to work, 
is very competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A post-quake poll of residents in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita 
valleys indicated 86% don't plan to switch to any form of mass transit or car - 
pooling. Is there anything you can do to reach those people?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Surveys of non-riders have indicated that the two most important factors 
are whether they've ridden before and whether they have free parking. So if 
you've never ridden Metrolink and your parking is free, it's a real uphill 
struggle for us. One of the things the earthquake did was to at least get a lot 
of people on our trains, just to experience them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the largest number of riders you think you can get on the Santa 
Clarita and other Metrolink lines?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the total that we could get is probably in the 75,000-a-day range. 
I mean, we're looking 10, 15 years out. But we have been operating for 16 
months, and we've gone from 2,400 a day to 18,000 a day in a little over a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How big a role did the earthquake play in that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We gained about 4,000 riders from the Santa Clarita line and 1,000 riders 
elsewhere, so we've gained about 5,000 riders at this point from the 
earthquake. So we would have gone from 2,400 to 13,000 and that's not bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you look at the Metrolink operation five years from now, will the 
earthquake have played any part?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, there's no doubt about it. Before the earthquake I would say maybe 10% 
of the people in Los Angeles knew what Metrolink was. After the earthquake I 
would venture to say that 90% of people in Los Angeles know what Metrolink is. 
Now that may not be something they can use, but it has been invaluable to us to 
get our name out and recognized as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Last fall several officials called Metrolink something between a limited 
and a modest success, saying ridership had tapered off, and there was a lot of 
publicity about the number of deaths that had occurred on that line due to 
traffic collisions and suicides. Do you agree with that perception?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think so far it's been a moderate success. We're growing steadily. The 
importance of Metrolink to the region, I think, was underlined by the 
earthquake. Rail systems historically are the least damaged and the first 
transportation brought up. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you survey your customers regularly to find out what their likes and 
dislikes are?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We try to survey them once a year and we have a survey going out next week. 
We have last year's survey, which basically indicated to us that riders are 
very happy with Metrolink. We got a very high satisfaction rate. Many of them 
are subsidized by their employers. Forty-seven percent were subsidized an 
average of $60 a month on their tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there any particular dislikes or complaints about Metrolink?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There have been a couple. The high fare tends to be mentioned quite a bit. 
The biggest problem that I think we have to work on is how we get people from 
the end station to their place of employment. People want to take the train, 
but they work away from the station, and how do we make that final link? In 
order to make it work, it's got to be Metrolink plus the connection, and we 
don't control the connection. Others have to provide that for us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you deal with the complaints about the high fare?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The high fare is sort of interesting, because on the other hand we get the 
complaint that we're subsidizing too much. Well, you can't have high fares and 
complain about the subsidies, because if the fare is lower then the subsidy 
goes up. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that the fare people are paying for Metrolink is a reasonable one. 
Just the price of gas and regular maintenance alone cost 9 or 10 cents a mile, 
according to AAA (the Automobile Club of Southern California). Our Metrolink 
fares on a per-mile basis are about 10 to 14 cents a mile, so for a little bit 
more than the price of gas and maintenance -- not insurance, depreciation and 
parking -- you can ride Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There are complaints that Metrolink is too subsidized. Some say the money 
would be better spent on city buses in areas that people more in need could 
use. How do you respond to those complaints?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The first eight months of operation, when we had just started, we expected 
a fare-box recovery of about 12%. We ended the first year at about 17 1/2%. 
Presently we are at about 28% fare-box recovery, and we'll be in the mid-30s 
for next year. That compares with a Blue Line subsidy of 14% after three or 
four years of operation. That compares with the fare-box recovery on the MTA 
bus system of 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, our trips are 10 times longer. Instead of the three-mile trip that an 
average bus person takes, our trips are 30 miles, so the subsidy per trip is 
much higher. But as far as the subsidy per mile, we are more efficient in 
moving people than the local bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: One concern is Metrolink carries primarily suburban, more wealthy people to 
work while bus services -- some of which are being threatened by budget cuts -- 
carry people who don't have as much money and are more in need of the services. 
How do you justify the money spent per trip on Metrolink?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The MTA subsidizes Metrolink about $22 million for next year. The total 
subsidy the MTA provides the bus system is in the order of $600 million, so 
you're talking 3%. But I imagine that of the income that comes into the MTA, a 
lot more than 3% comes in from the outlying areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In places like the Antelope Valley and counties to the east, it's not as 
upper-income as you would think. There are pockets of upper-income, but the 
Antelope Valley and a lot of the outlying portions of the Metrolink system are 
where the younger, first-homeowner families live.

KIDNAPING SUSPECT BELIEVES HE IS JESUS, ATTORNEY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former oil-field worker who is charged with kidnaping a Ventura auto 
salesman during a test drive and later leading police on a chase to Universal 
City believes he is Jesus and cannot help in his own criminal defense, a public 
defender said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Stephen P. Lipson entered pleas of not guilty in 
Ventura County Municipal Court during an arraignment for defendant Daryl Lynn 
Simpson, 32, who is charged with kidnaping and auto theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Steven Hintz ordered a hearing today to determine if a 
psychologist should be appointed in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants are considered incompetent if schizophrenia or other mental 
problems leave them incapable of assisting in their own defense, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Simpson was test-driving a black $27,000 Camaro Z-28 from Paradise 
Chevrolet on Victoria Avenue when he told salesman Russell Phelps that he was 
God and wanted to go to radio station KLOS in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He drove south on the Ventura Freeway to the San Fernando Valley, they said. 
Phelps escaped in Encino when Simpson exited the freeway to make a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police spotted the car in Van Nuys, triggering a chase in which 
speeds reached 90 m.p.h. Simpson was finally arrested when the car's tire 
flattened after he exited the freeway and struck a curb on a dead-end street in 
Universal City. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipson said family members first began noticing Simpson's mental problems 
about eight months ago. Before that, Simpson appeared to be living a normal 
life, Lipson said. He had a girlfriend and held various jobs doing oil-field 
work, the lawyer said.

CITY'S TALLY OF VACATED BUILDINGS DROPS BY 30% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of homes and businesses vacated in the city of Los Angeles because 
of earthquake damage is actually 30% lower than was previously cited, city 
officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to a clerical error, city Building and Safety officials until last week 
had said that 30,680 homes and businesses were vacant due to quake damage. In 
fact, only 21,536 were vacated, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Takaki, a Building and Safety supervisor, said the error occurred when 
a notation in a report for $9,000 worth of damage to one dwelling unit was 
erroneously counted as 9,000 dwelling units vacated. Some other buildings were 
taken off the list because they are no longer empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The error will not affect quake funding from the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency because most of that money is doled out as a reimbursement for costs 
paid out by the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report submitted to the City Council's Public Safety Committee, the 
Building and Safety Department said the quake forced the evacuation of 20,844 
residential units, 336 commercial buildings, 314 mixed-use structures and 42 
other buildings. Total damage to buildings in the city has been estimated at 
$1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, the Public Safety Committee recommended that beginning 
next year all new and remodeled buildings be required to have a gas valve that 
automatically shuts off during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Councilman Marvin Braude, chairman of the committee, 
modifies a proposal originally offered last week by Councilman Hal Bernson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernson proposal failed to get council approval because council members 
feared that the gas valves currently on the market may be triggered too easily, 
cutting off gas flow due to vandalism, accidents or small aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to send the proposal to Braude's committee for further 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude recommended that the ordinance requiring gas shut-off valves be adopted 
but not take effect until July, 1995, to give manufacturers time to make 
adjustments to the device so that they only shuts off gas during severe quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives for two gas valve manufacturers told Braude at a hearing 
that they could make such adjustments fairly easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Picott, a bureau chief for the Building and Safety Department who was 
critical of Bernson's original proposal last week, said he supported the 
modifications suggested by Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be a fair proposal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson could not be reached for comment. The City Council will reconsider the 
proposal June 16.

<P>
 A 41-year-old man was fatally shot early Monday by a gunman who walked up to 
his car and demanded money, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eron Alonzo Mallagon of Palmdale was pronounced dead by paramedics at the 
scene of the 2:05 a.m. shooting, Deputy Irma Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred shortly after Mallagon and a friend began driving home 
from El Charro bar. Mallagon stopped in the 38300 block of North 11th Street 
East when it appeared a motorist was following him. 
</P>
<P>
 A man with a gun got out of the other vehicle, opened Mallagon's door and 
demanded money, Becerra said. When Mallagon resisted, the gunman shot him, ran 
back to his car and fled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The passenger in Mallagon's car, whom authorities declined to identify for his 
safety, was uninjured, Becerra said. TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEWHALL MAN STABBED WHILE ATTEMPTING TO 
PREVENT FIGHT

<P>
 A Newhall man was stabbed three times while trying to prevent a fight between 
two men Sunday night, authorities reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Guerra, 34, was stabbed about 9:20 p.m. in a parking lot in the 24800 
block of Newhall Avenue, according to a report by Deputy Joe Skophammer of the 
Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's station.The assailant, believed to be in his 
early to mid-20s, remains at large. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year-old girl who witnessed the incident told deputies she saw Guerra 
step between two men who appeared as if they were going to fight. One of them 
stabbed Guerra and both fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerra was "very uncooperative" with investigating deputies, stating he did 
not want to report the incident and did not want to press charges against his 
assailant, Skophammer said. Guerra told deputies that he did not know the two 
men and could not identify them if he saw them again. 
</P>
<P>
 He was taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where he was 
treated for three stab wounds just below the left side of his chest and other 
minor injuries, according to the report. Hospital officials said he remained at 
the hospital Monday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SUSPECTED RACIST IN PLEA BARGAIN FOR ROAD

 A suspected white supremacist ended a controversial legal battle over his 
arrest for a minor driving offense by agreeing to a plea bargain Monday under 
which he was sentenced to 35 days in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jace Edwards, 18, of Canyon Country, pleaded guilty in Newhall Municipal Court 
to driving with a suspended license in May, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Dan Damon. 
Edwards, who committed the same offense in March, pleaded guilty to violating 
his probation, Damon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the jail term, Edwards was ordered to perform 17 days of 
community service and serve two years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender James Racusin said Edwards consented to the plea 
bargain because he might have served more time in jail waiting for the case to 
go to trial than he will under the jail term agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was arrested May 17 when Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies spotted 
him driving near Canyon High School and found three knives in his car. 
Informants told deputies Edwards was part of a "white power" group that helped 
incite two racially motivated brawls involving 20 to 30 youths near the school 
May 10, although he did not take part in the fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Racusin said Edwards joined the group for companionship, but dropped out about 
three weeks before the disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office and Edwards' lawyer had disputed his bail, 
which was originally set at $500,000. Edwards' parents and lawyer complained 
the bail was excessively high and maintained prosecutors were trying to hold 
Edwards to build a case implicating him in the brawl. Deputies argued the bail 
was sufficient because he was a flight risk and was on probation. In addition, 
he had claimed to have $600,000 from a court settlement that would enable him 
to make a high bail. 
</P>
<P>
 No charges were filed against Edwards for possessing the knives. His bail had 
been reduced Thursday to $100,000, which his parents and attorney also 
maintained was too high.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PLAN OFFERS REFUGE TO SCHOOLCHILDREN ON FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Officials from the city and Santa Clarita Valley sheriff's office on Monday 
unveiled a program designed to provide safe havens for children on their way to 
and from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Safe House Program, the idea is to place green triangle symbols in 
certain houses throughout the city -- signals to children that they can seek 
refuge there if they sense trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want it to be like a home alarm system," said Deputy Tom Drake, who 
coordinated the program with Santa Clarita elementary schools. "You have it 
there ready, and hopefully you'll never have to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating homes and businesses will be marked with fluorescent green 
triangles, signifying there is a volunteer present to help in an emergency. A 
second triangle is painted on the curb, and each site is kept on file with the 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Santa Clarita elementary schools have signed up so far, and 30 
residents, mostly from the Canyon Country community where planning efforts 
began, have asked to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers undergo a background check and are provided with basic instructions 
about when to call either 911 or the sheriff's station. Deputies also contact 
their references and visit the neighborhood to make sure each safe house is 
reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about it is that it has built-in safeguards," said Mayor George 
Pederson. "It's not just volunteers who say, 'My house is OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson, a law enforcement officer himself before retiring, said the program 
sends out a good message about Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the Safe House Program began with the efforts of Karin Nelson, a 
Canyon Country resident who has a 6-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally my program was for people, if they happened to be home at the 
time, to just go out on their porch," Nelson said. "I think we need to have 
kids supervised all the way as they walk to school. That's the ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said such a program is important, even in Santa Clarita, which has a 
reputation as a safe city. She became involved after reading about the 
kidnaping-related deaths of 8-year-old Nicole Parker in the San Fernando Valley 
and 12-year-old Polly Klaas in Petaluma, both late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have to decide they're not going to let this happen," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will learn about the Safe House Program and its green triangles at 
assemblies throughout the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the sheriff's station received two reports of suspicious 
activity by an adult near an elementary school, although no arrests were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are now focusing on getting safe-house sites along walking routes 
to and from elementary schools, but eventually want green triangles throughout 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, one per block would be a good goal," said Sgt. Bob Warford. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about volunteering for the Safe House Program is available by 
calling (805) 255-1121.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; STUDENTS CONSTRUCT 2 HOMES WHILE BUILDING 
THEIR FUTURES; EDUCATION: THE SEVEN-MONTH PROJECT IS A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE 
CITY, THE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A DEVELOPER.

 FOR SALE: Two new homes in east Palmdale. Three bedrooms, two baths, lots of 
extras. Built by high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, students. The homes were constructed through an innovative 
partnership among the city of Palmdale, the Antelope Valley Union High School 
District and developer Centex Homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program, proposed about a year ago by Councilman Jim Root, 
also a high school work experience coordinator, was to give vocational 
education students from Palmdale and Highland high schools a chance to sharpen 
their home-building skills while providing them with a sense of pride for 
having constructed a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley vocational education students for years have built sheds, 
gazebos and the like, but never before have they taken on something of this 
magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 At a dedication ceremony Monday, several students said the seven-month project 
helped them decide what they want to do with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Sha Harmon, a Palmdale High School senior, said she has abandoned her plans to 
work with animals now that she helped build a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to get my real estate broker's license, build houses and sell them for 
myself," Harmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in school, Harmon said she learned to build sheds. This year, it was 
houses. "I learned some skills I never thought I'd learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale High junior Ben Balagtas, who before the project did not have any 
post-graduation plans, now plans to start his own carpentry business. "They get 
paid a lot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About two dozen students worked on the houses, which are in Sunchase, a Centex 
Homes tract off of 60th Street East and Avenue R. During the ceremony, a "key" 
to the homes was turned over to Palmdale, which funded the project through its 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The city put about $190,000 into the project for the purchase of land and 
supplies as well as for professional builders to oversee and assist in the 
construction, said Danny Roberts, Palmdale's redevelopment manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the homes will be sold for no more than $80,000 to qualifying low- or 
moderate-income families, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are under way to continue the program next year. Roberts said that as 
early as next month he will submit a report seeking City Council approval to 
make the program part of the curriculum for Palmdale and Highland high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The money made from the sale of the homes, he said, would be used the 
following year to buy land and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mayor Jim Ledford: "I see unlimited potential with this program."

 Oscar Saul -- Because of erroneous information provided to The Times, a story 
in Monday's editions incorrectly stated that screenwriter and author Oscar 
Saul, 81, had died Sunday in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center of prostate cancer. 
His son, Richard Saul, said Monday that the elder Saul is still living but is a 
patient at the hospital. The Times regrets the error.
