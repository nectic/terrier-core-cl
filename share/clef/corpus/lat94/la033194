AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: NATURE'S PUBLICIST AT WORK 
</P>

<P>
 Commuters dipping onto Laurel Canyon Boulevard just south of Mulholland this 
morning were no doubt amused, bemused or just plain puzzled by this 
hand-lettered roadside sign: MOLEHILL MADE OUT OF A MOUNTAIN. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it's not some crazed Burma Shave survivor on the loose. It's Jon Earl -- 
and he doesn't trek to that spot at daybreak to plant his signs solely to 
titillate motorists crossing from the Valley to Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to make them aware that the Santa Monicas are not merely "a speed 
bump on the way to the Westside and vice versa," but the endangered natural 
habitat of priceless flora and fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 In his world view, these commuters are "like strange animals migrating over 
the mountain range" -- a range that rightfully belongs to the plants and 
animals that were there first. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hollywood Hills, where he lives, he's been known to stop traffic to 
rescue a baby gopher snake about to be run over. Five years ago, distressed but 
not yet discouraged by the state of the environment in the L.A. Basin, he and 
Ellen Petty founded Rhapsody in Green. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of their new nonprofit group was to enlist and train volunteers in 
hands-on work such as cleaning up estuaries, restoring natural habitats and 
planting native trees. Earl, 43, who grew up in the house next door to the 
citified mountain cabin where he and Petty live, waxes absolutely, well, 
rhapsodic about the El Segundo blue butterfly and the red ant. 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants to spread the word: "It's not too late. Nature is ready to 
respond to our efforts." How, he wondered one day, could Rhapsody in Green make 
motorists think in terms of bio-regional awareness? 
</P>
<P>
 Brainstorming, he and Petty came up with the idea of roadside signs. They hit 
upon a formula: "Quick, educational and fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The first sign, which went up March 15, proclaimed: EARTHWORM CROSSING. DRIVE 
CAREFULLY. When Earl returned at dusk to retrieve it, it had been stolen. Now 
he chains his signs to a post. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampler of signs coming soon to a canyon road near you: 
</P>
<P>
 * THIS MOUNTAIN IS NOT A REHEARSAL. (Says Earl, "I thought that might appeal 
to the theatrical people.") 
</P>
<P>
 * UP AHEAD. GAS. FOOD. 15 MILLION PEOPLE.  
</P>
<P>
 * TODAY'S AIR: CARBON OBNOXIDE. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the idea. Earl's kicking himself that he didn't do an Oscar week 
special. It would have read BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY, with an arrow pointing to an 
unspoiled natural canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 He toyed briefly with the idea of HONK IF YOU HATE NOISE POLLUTION. Only 
briefly. And he reasons that his signs don't count as visual pollution because 
he removes them each night. Plus, the cause is noble. 
</P>
<P>
 For a change of pace, he may throw in a few that are downright lofty. Like 
this Persian proverb: "In the ant's house, the dew is a flood." And this, from 
Buddha: "The tree offers shade even to the ax man that destroys it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl -- who earns his only income teaching environmental studies at a private 
elementary school -- recalls when he was a kid, and how different things were. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing out the window of his home, he says, "My play yard was the hill up 
here." When he grew up, he studied math for two years at UCLA, but only because 
he was good at it. Inevitably, "environmental fever" consumed him. 
</P>
<P>
 He's "very angry" at how earlier generations have mucked things up: "Southern 
California used to be a paradise, an absolute paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't people understand that coyotes help control rats? That snails, an 
important part of the food chain, don't exist merely to annoy us? Until now, 
Rhapsody in Green, with a budget of only $3,000 a year, wasn't exactly a 
high-visibility group. But wait . . . Earl dreams of recruiting a small army of 
the like-minded to write jingles and make more signs, and more signs. He talks 
about signs throughout L.A., throughout the country, in other countries . . .  
</P>
<P>
 For now, he's going to zero in on those big arteries through the Santa Monicas 
-- Laurel Canyon and, next week, Beverly Glen and Coldwater Canyon. He figures 
he can reach maybe a million people there each Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to grab them with signs such as: 
</P>
<P>
 * GRAY WHALES ARE SWIMMING THROUGH THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS. (Technically, 
he says, the Channel Islands are part of the same chain). 
</P>
<P>
 Or maybe: 
</P>
<P>
 * YOU ARE WATCHING THE NATURE CHANNEL. From Madge to Mommies 
</P>
<P>
 Madge has packed up her nailbrushes. Make way for "The Mommies." 
</P>
<P>
 Colgate-Palmolive, the dishwashing-liquid people, staged an L.A. media event 
to introduce the successors to America's favorite manicurist/confidante, who 
was retired after 26 years as TV's longest-running pitch person. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing Madge (in real life, actress Jan Miner) are Caryl Kristensen and 
Marilyn Kentz, stars of NBC's Saturday night comedy show "The Mommies." Their 
first soap spot aired Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In a year-long $20-million ad campaign, the Palmolive folks are wagering that 
Kristensen, 33, and Kentz, 46, will be able to sell soap to the dishpan-hands 
set by poking a little fun at what it's like to be a contemporary mom. 
(Kristensen and Kentz know: Between them, they have six children). 
</P>
<P>
 A corporate type explained that, like "icon" Madge, Caryl and Marilyn are 
"funny and presumptuous, but accessible and likable." They don't do nails; 
they're just hip homemakers. Consider this spot, filmed in their TV kitchen: 
</P>
<P>
 MARILYN: "On the few occasions we actually cook, we clean with this. . . . 
It's the new way to get rid of dried-on food and tough stains." 
</P>
<P>
 CARYL: "What's the old way?" 
</P>
<P>
 (Marilyn tosses a dirty plate into the kitchen trash can.) 
</P>
<P>
 CARYL: "Nice shot." 
</P>
<P>
 One gets the idea they might have actually done this in the not-long-ago days 
when they were suburban neighbors in Petaluma. That was before they parlayed 
their stand-up comedy act -- in which they made light of car pooling, wrinkles 
and morning sickness -- into a network TV show. 
</P>
<P>
 This is their first TV commercial, they said. The diet-food companies courted 
them, quipped Caryl, "but we knew that was something we could never achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 And do they really wash their dishes with Palmolive? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, said Caryl, both now have full-time househusbands who do a lot of that 
stuff, including the cooking. "They swap recipes," deadpanned Marilyn. 
</P>
<P>
 And, someone asked, do "The Mommies" see themselves selling soap 26 years down 
the line? 
</P>
<P>
 It's possible, said Caryl. By then, "We could afford more surgery."

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: OTIS COLLEGE OF ART REAPS RECORD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't believe for a minute that Los Angeles fund-raisers don't care deeply 
about the next generation and aren't struggling through tough economic times to 
excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts for the Otis College of Art and Design's 75th anniversary 
commemorative journal -- to be presented to guests at the college's annual 
Critics' Awards Gala Fashion Show April 30 at the Century Plaza -- have 
elicited a record-breaking $350,000 in scholarship support for students at the 
mid-Wilshire arts campus. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cocktail party hosted by Otis trustee Bronya Galef and husband Andy in 
their Bel-Air home, there was ecstasy over the success co-chaired by Joan and 
John Hotchkis, Carole Sumner Krechman and Sue Keanne, and it now puts tickets 
to the gala student fashion show chaired by Nancy and Tim Vreeland at a 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding at the cocktail kickoff were Otis president Neil Hoffman and fashion 
department chair Rosemary Brantley. Present, too, were this year's recipients 
of the Otis Fashion Achievement Awards: Mossimo Giannulli of Mossimo and Larry 
Hansel, founder and CEO of the fast-growing Rampage. Committee members 
exulting: Susie and Norm Barker, Constance Towers Gavin, Jennifer Kaufman, 
Annette O'Malley, Susan and Peter Strauss. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Big 100th: Connie Gavin chairs the 20th Anniversary Leader Luncheon for this 
centennial year of the YWCA of Greater Los Angeles April 28 at the Westin 
Bonaventure. Listening to the goal of $150,000 at the California Club kickoff 
were Nancy Daly, Judy Miller (newly appointed commissioner of the Department of 
Water and Power) and Adrienne Hall. For Gavin, actress and wife of former U.S. 
Ambassador to Mexico John Gavin, the effort will be pure joy. 
</P>
<P>
 She's from tough stock. Her grandmother was head of the Temperance Union for 
Idaho, Montana and Washington. "She always told me: Stay at the YWCA when you 
travel -- you'll always be safe there." And Connie, herself, remembers the 
indignity of being refused a bank loan to buy a home because she was a woman 
with two young children, divorced and an actress. (Her dad helped her out.) 
</P>
<P>
 The YWCA has really kept up, she says. "Today, we have rape centers," and the 
organization offers services for boys, too. 
</P>
<P>
 An illustrious banner of six women will be honored. More later. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Best: Chatter after the Music Center Spotlight Awards Tuesday evening in 
the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion was all raves about the marvelous young talent 
onstage and the incredible successes of students honored in previous years at 
the event launched by Peggy and Walter Grauman. 
</P>
<P>
 Said emcee Gregory Harrison, "This grew up from what might be called amazing 
grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Burns: "The best talent ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Grauman: "They all have wonderful careers ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Roberts of the sponsoring Fraternity of Friends: "We have succeeded in 
creating positive images in high schools with this." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Martin, regional vice president of Northern Telecom, which sponsored the 
gala: "It's wonderful to get away from the bits and bites." 
</P>
<P>
 This year 650 applicants took private auditions; then 90 were selected as 
finalists and given mentoring and special lessons, and 12 competed on stage 
with six $5,000 winners: Derek Kwan, jazz instrumental; Hiromi Ushino, ballet; 
Kristine Remigio, pop-musical theater vocal; Alpin Seung-Hi Hong, piano; 
Danielle Hobbs, jazz-modern dance, and Laura Griffith, opera. They were judged 
by an incredible array of judges -- the likes of Alan Bergman, Hal David, Paula 
Kelly, Harry (Sweets) Edison, Gerald Arpino. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Peggy and Anne Johnson received bouquets of white tulips for the lovely 
dinner -- a piano theme of white and black. Dining past 11 o'clock were (550 
for a $110,000 net) Bridget and John Martens (home from "paradise" -- Annapuri 
on the Isle of Phuket); Stuart and Carrie Ketchum; Brigitte and Sheldon 
Stanfill; Helen Bing; Bill Siart and his fiancee, Nevada lawyer Laura Moore 
(they wed in May at the desert), and Ginny Mancini, without composer/pianist 
Henry, who has cancer (he has been a judge through most of the Spotlights). 
Might all the young people mature to be as kind, generous and gallant as he. 
</P>

<P>
 Two Nice People: Orange County residents Clement and Lynn Hirsch were lauded 
as Humanitarians of the Year for their generosity to charities at the House Ear 
Institute gala at the Beverly Hilton. Lynn has long been a trustee of the 
institute, and Clement certainly hasn't let a hearing aid ever let him miss a 
beat as a founder of Kal Kan Foods, founder and now chair of Stagg Foods and a 
life that beats to the tempo of horse races and turf clubs (he helped found the 
Oak Tree Racing Assn. and later the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was a starlit night with Nanette Fabray, Dudley Moore, Phyllis Diller and 
Carol Channing with a banner committee: Edward M. Carson, chair and CEO of 
First Interstate Bancorp; Peggy Edwards and Mrs. James De Rose of the 
Associates; Joyce Hameetman, and Bonnie Baker Sonance. Media Awards by 
"hearing-challenged" actors went to Lydia Heston and Richard Dysart. 
</P>
<P>
 The affair netted $350,000, according to founder Dr. Howard House. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Stars: Si and Virginia Ramo glitter like diamonds in a close, long marriage 
with heaps of humor. Cleverly, Elaine Leventhal asked him to give Virginia the 
"Vision Award" last week at the Luminaires luncheon and I. Magnin fashion show 
featuring the svelte Lanvin Collection. Eighth generation California 
philanthropist Alice Avery, Ginny Gaspar and Elizabeth Westerby chaired the 
affair for the Doheny Eye Institute.  
</P>
<P>
 Si, of course, has the National Medal of Science, the Presidential Medal of 
Freedom and he co-founded TRW. He plays the violin, graduated from Caltech and 
attends thousands of social events with Virginia, a USC graduate. He noted the 
voluminous mail and the incessant phone calls early in their marriage, and he 
says he asked her what she was doing. "She'd always say, 'I am seeing other 
men,' and indeed she was." 
</P>
<P>
 She's on the boards of USC, Music Center Opera, KUSC and Heart Assn. and has 
performed Herculean financial efforts for all. She told the audience his 
lauding was "highly embarrassing," but she did mention he had forgotten her 
third-grade penmanship award. See, it all starts young.

PRACTICAL VIEW: TIME TO TAKE STOCK OF RETIREMENT NEEDS; FINANCES: INFLATION AND 
OTHER UNCERTAINTIES THREATEN TO CLOUD THOSE GOLDEN YEARS. PRUDENT PLANNING NOW 
MAY BE YOUR SAVING GRACE.

 "Every time I go on vacation and sit under a palm tree, I think, 'Wouldn't it 
be great to do this forever?' " said Lee Rosenberg, co-founder of ARS Financial 
Services in Valley Stream, N.Y. "Then I get depressed because in a week, I'm 
back in the rat race." 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, if you're not setting aside enough money now, you may never be 
able to afford to retire to a tropical island. Nearly half of the Americans 
recently surveyed by Money magazine said they will have either just enough 
money to meet their living expenses in their retirement years or they will fall 
short of what they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, the author of "Retirement Ready or Not," concurred: "You almost 
cannot find a person who is on target." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people don't even have a clue of how much they will need when they 
retire, experts say. And the fact that people are living longer than ever means 
that your retirement savings may have to support you for 20 to 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never calculated how much you'll need to live on after you retire, 
be prepared for a shock. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book, Rosenberg estimates that a 45-year-old person earning $60,000 a 
year would need an annual income of $144,321 to maintain the same standard of 
living at retirement 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people have a powerful weapon on their side: compounding. If you start 
saving even small amounts for retirement when you are young, you will be ahead 
of the people who put it off because they have so many other pressing financial 
obligations. Rosenberg noted that for every 10 years you delay saving for 
retirement, you have to save three times as much to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest mistakes people make when it comes to saving for retirement 
is "thinking they don't have to do it on their own," said Howard Schneider, 
vice president of the American Assn. of Retired Persons' Investment Program 
from Scudder. Many companies are phasing out pension plans in favor of 401(k) 
plans, in which the employees make most, if not all, of the contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for Social Security, "I think people should not expect to rely on it as 
anything more than a supplement to private pension and private savings," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 So you're basically on your own. That's especially true for the baby-boom 
generation, which is at a disadvantage compared to the generation that's 
retiring now, Rosenberg said. Baby boomers are less likely to have a 
company-funded pension plan. Unlike their parents, they aren't in the habit of 
saving money. And they are not likely to see their homes grow in value the way 
their parents' homes have appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin by estimating your retirement living expenses. Some experts say that, as 
a rule of thumb, you will need 75% to 80% of current income. That's not true 
for everyone. In fact, Rosenberg believes that "the greatest myth is that 
you'll spend less during retirement." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no doubt that some expenses will be less. You won't have the same 
transportation costs because you won't be commuting to work. Your clothing 
expenses will probably be less. Even if you remain in the same tax bracket, 
your tax bite will be somewhat less because you won't be paying into Social 
Security. After you retire, perhaps you will have paid off your mortgage and be 
out of debt. 
</P>
<P>
 But these savings may be depleted by new expenses: You may spend more on 
travel, eating out and medical bills. You need to consider whether you want to 
have money left over to leave to your heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you should be sure to factor in the cost of living of the area where 
you plan to retire. You may need more money if you retire in the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Now you should have an estimate of what you'll need to live on. But the total 
is in today's dollars. Depending on how many years until you retire, that 
figure will balloon -- and it will continue to balloon during the years of your 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this example, from "Planning for Retirement," a guide produced by the 
AARP Investment Program from Scudder: Ben and Thelma estimate they will need 
$30,000 a year in today's dollars to maintain their standard of living. 
Assuming 4% inflation per year, they will actually need $39,478 during the 
first year of retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they live for another 27 years, by the 27th year of their retirement 
they will need $113,829 to maintain an income equivalent to $30,000 today. If 
you are in good health, you should plan on supporting yourself until you are 85 
to 90 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you've estimated how much money you'll need, see what resources you have. 
There are three main areas to consider: Social Security, private pension plans 
and your own retirement savings, including 401(k) plans and IRAs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your employer and the Social Security Administration for help figuring out 
your annual income from them. The difference between that total and the amount 
you need to live on is what you must generate from your savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Add up what you have already saved toward retirement, and estimate what it 
will be worth when you tap into it. You want this amount to fill in the gap 
between your expenses and Social Security and your company pension plan, if 
any. And you want it to last for all the years of your retirement.  
</P>
<P>
 If all this has you confused, Rosenberg has some simple advice: People in 
their 20s and 30s should save 5% of their income toward retirement. When they 
reach their 40s, increase that amount to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally: Don't count on an inheritance for retirement income. Unexpected 
medical bills, or even a change of heart, may cause it to fall through.

 As the story goes, a woman finds a Tiffany's receipt in her husband's jacket 
and asks him what it's for. The husband, who had bought a jewel for his 
mistress at the posh Fifth Avenue store, claims the receipt was for a 
business-related meal. He says to his gullible wife, "Haven't you ever heard of 
having breakfast at Tiffany's?" 
</P>
<P>
 Truman Capote added the phrase to American lingo with his short novel of the 
same name, the story of Holly Golightly, the daffy and sexy waif from the 
sticks who takes on New York. Following the 1958 publication of the book, film 
(with Audrey Hepburn) and stage (with Mary Tyler Moore) versions followed. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate the life of Capote -- the puckish literary and party fixture of 
New York, the Hamptons and Los Angeles until his death in 1984 -- his longtime 
publisher, Random House, has reissued "Breakfast at Tiffany's" in a handsomely 
designed addition to its Modern Library series. In addition, the publisher 
joined last week in announcing the formation of the Truman Capote Literary 
Trust during a special celebrity-attended breakfast -- in the Jewel Salon at 
Tiffany's, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust will fund six annual scholarships in creative writing at Stanford 
and the University of Iowa, an annual award for excellence in literary 
criticism and a lifetime award for literary criticism that will be granted 
every four years. The first recipients are expected to be announced later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan U. Schwartz, a Los Angeles attorney who is the sole executor and trustee 
of Capote's estate, says the writer's assets were valued at about $2.25 million 
when he died and the sum initially provided an annuity to his longtime 
companion, Jack Dunphy. Today, two years after Dunphy's death, the Capote 
estate is worth $5 million, Schwartz added -- as a result of investments, new 
agreements covering the continued publication of his books, all of which remain 
in print, and the sale of movie and TV options. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Schwartz explained, Random House recently entered into a new deal 
to keep Capote's "In Cold Blood" on the publishing house's backlist and 
Paramount Communications agreed to terms designed to generate greater income 
from exploitation of the 1961 "Breakfast at Tiffany's" movie. Also, director 
Charles Matthauplans to start shooting a movie version of the author's "The 
Grass Harp" in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rewarding to do this," said Schwartz, who has been arranging to 
give away all the annual income from Capote's estate. "The schools pointed out 
that there's very little money around for scholars and writers. . . . I know 
that Truman would be very happy."

 Woodward on Clinton: Having Bob Woodward, of Woodward and Bernstein fame, on 
Bill Clinton's trail would seem to be the President's worst nightmare in these 
Whitewater-logged days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woodward's closely guarded book for Simon & Schuster, "Inside Clinton's 
White House" (a working title), will examine the shaping of economic policy 
within the Administration, the publisher says. "In the process, the book 
explains how the White House works," said S & S publicity director Victoria 
Meyer. 
</P>
<P>
 A 400,000-copy first printing is planned for June. With a print run of that 
magnitude, surely S & S plans to rely on more than domestic-policy revelations 
to spur sales. The question, then, is what else Woodward has unearthed. 
</P>

 B Matter: The Talk of Los Angeles reports that the first audit of its 
circulation, done last summer by the Audit Bureau of Circulations, showed an 
average sale of 72,692 copies per issue, which was nearly three times the 
number for the same period in 1992. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, for numbers of a more chilling sort, check out the April issue of 
Los Angeles magazine, which looks at the rise in gun ownership among the city's 
law-abiding residents, including screenwriter Robert Dillon. He writes: "I 
voted for Bill Clinton. I really consider myself a liberal. . . . I'm not a 
member of the NRA, but I do believe that an honest, well-trained, armed citizen 
isn't a bad thing to be.". . . 
</P>
<P>
 After three test issues, Time Inc. has given the official go-ahead to In 
Style, a sleekly glossy mag that profiles celebs in their homes. The publisher 
is guaranteeing advertisers a circulation of 500,000 copies when monthly 
frequency begins in June. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Taylor Rosenberg, whose publishing star shines brightly after two 
criminal-justice thrillers ("Mitigating Circumstances" and "Interest of 
Justice"), has agreed to a new, multi-book deal with Dutton / Signet for what's 
described as "a substantial, seven-figure advance." Meanwhile, her next one, 
"First Offense," is scheduled for release in August, and NBC has announced 
plans to shoot "Interest of Justice," to star Sissy Spacek.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; WHEN 'DYNASTY' MEETS THE OLD TESTAMENT; THE HARAFISH BY 
NAGUIB MAHFOUZ , TRANSLATED BY CATHERINE COBHAM; DOUBLEDAY, $22.95, 496 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 When, in 1988, the Egyptian writer Naguib Mahfouz was awarded the Nobel Prize 
for Literature, relatively few Americans were familiar with his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers scrambled to issue or reissue several of his 30 novels and 14 
collections of short stories. Thanks in particular to the efforts of editor 
Jacqueline Onassis, a respectable selection, including the much praised Cairo 
Trilogy, is currently available in English language editions. 
</P>
<P>
 For those not yet initiated into Mahfouz's literary vision, "The Harafish" 
will be a good and relatively easy introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Beautifully and simply translated by Catherine Cobham, this multi-generational 
saga of the al-Nagi family moves at a brisk and compelling clip. Characters 
sometimes change their lives abruptly, divorcing, marrying and reproducing all 
in the space of a single paragraph. Though the pace occasionally leaves the 
reader breathless -- plagues, children, lifetimes zip by as if assisted by a 
fast-forward button -- there are enough particular facts and snippets of 
dialogue to ground the action and involve the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harafish," a term that means, roughly, the common folk, is as much plot 
summary as plot, and, in its 10 sequential tales, feels like the synopsis of an 
epic rather than the kind of tightly argued novel usually produced in the West. 
What is sacrificed in complex character development, however, is often balanced 
by an aura of archetypal significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The al-Nagis' destinies rise and fall and rise again with an inexorable 
narrative force that evokes comparison to fate or parable. Lacking the subtle 
shading that normally adheres to a character through the gradual accumulation 
of detail, men and women bloom larger than life: noble, bad, weak, strong, 
greedy, venal -- all in neon capital letters. If nothing else, the novel bursts 
with historical sweep, as if a long, lush carpet were suddenly unrolled down a 
steep flight of stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The story broadly entails the emergence out of obscurity of a patriarch named 
Ashur, a giant lion of a man whose simplicity is his strength, as well as his 
weakness. Devoted to the precepts of his Moslem faith, he nevertheless leaves 
his stalwart wife and older sons to marry a comely bar girl with whom he 
launches a complicated, prolific dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 Each succeeding set of offspring strays further from the purity of their 
origins, evolving into protagonists so weak and scheming, cruel and 
self-aggrandizing as to be unrecognizable as the descendants of the generous 
and mostly righteous Ashur. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, as such strings of begats often play out, the good reasserts 
itself, producing at the end of the line a larger-than-life figure who's the 
moral equal of the founder. Along the way, Mahfouz takes every opportunity to 
expose the full range of human foibles and failings, graces and passions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Harafish," at its most page-turning, is sort of like "Dynasty" or 
"Dallas" crossed with the Old Testament (as if they weren't already!). Stripped 
of its exotic settings and unfamiliar surnames, this is, at its pulsing core, a 
melodrama about lust, money, scandal and the corruption of power -- with a 
heavy dose of the indomitable human spirit thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 While by no means the most literary of Mahfouz's novels, "The Harafish" is a 
whirling dervish of a good yarn, the kind of tale Frank Capra could have made 
into, well, 19 or 20 good, instructive, ultimately uplifting movies. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, it is unabashedly an example of populist literature -- and a running 
start into the more intellectually challenging and provocative garden of "The 
Palace Walk" or "Sugar Street."

ART REVIEW; 'MEXICO' SHOW NOT A PRETTY PICTURE ; EXCEPTIONAL WORK LOST IN 
MUDDLED PHOTO EXHIBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mexico Through Foreign Eyes: 1850-1990" is among the sillier shows of the 
season to date. A sentimental travelogue masquerading as a photography 
exhibition, it seems less interested in examining works of art than in selling 
a mythologized picture of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Curators Carole Naggar and Fred Ritchin, hired to organize the show and 
assemble its bilingual catalogue for the independent Santa Monica exhibitions 
firm Pilar Perez and Associates, selected more than 180 photographs by more 
than four dozen American and European visitors to Mexico since the middle of 
the 19th Century. Among them are such major figures as William Henry Jackson 
and Henri Cartier-Bresson, as well as such compelling, if lesser-known, artists 
and photojournalists as Ellen Auerbach and Alex Webb. After stops in Mexico 
City, Monterrey and New York, it is currently on view at the Armand Hammer 
Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers claim that throughout the medium's 150-year history, Mexico has 
been the site of more artistic breakthroughs for visiting American and European 
photographers than any other country. Neither the show nor the book offers much 
to substantiate the claim, but who knows? Maybe they're right. 
</P>
<P>
 What's perplexing is the nature of the assertion as an organizing principle 
for an exhibition. It suggests something magical, mysterious and enduring about 
Mexico, something so unusually compelling that over the course of 150 years it 
galvanized the art of visiting photographers as radically different from one 
another as France's Cartier-Bresson and Italy's Tina Modotti, or as sharply 
distinctive as the incisive chronicler of urban children's lives, Helen Levitt, 
and the stark abstractionist of city walls, Aaron Siskind. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief catalogue essays each curator pursues an aura characterizing Mexico 
-- or characterizing many outsiders' views of it -- that is potent enough to 
have transformed the artistic outlook of widely disparate photographers. Naggar 
finds it in the Mexican embodiment of "otherness" for some Europeans and North 
Americans; Ritchin finds it in Mexico's particular sense of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet any search for such a magic bullet capable of transforming the work of 
perceptive artists makes little sense. It also does a disservice to their art. 
You're encouraged to stop considering the acute specificity of a photographer's 
work, but that is what makes any art finally worth looking at. Instead, you're 
coaxed to search for a missing common denominator that makes Cartier-Bresson 
and Modotti, Levitt and Siskind somehow alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's something in the water? 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico Through Foreign Eyes" might be most succinctly described as a NAFTA 
show. Underwritten by the Banco Nacional de Mexico (BANAMEX), Eastman Kodak, 
Anheuser-Busch and Mexicana Airlines, and touring since 1993, it's finally all 
about packaging and marketing the image of a country currently in the forefront 
of popular consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad, because there are some exceptional pictures to be found 
scattered throughout the otherwise muddled show. Few are likely to be a 
surprise; in addition to the well-known Mexican pictures of Cartier-Bresson, 
Modotti and Levitt, there are fine pictures by the likes of Edward Weston, Paul 
Outterbridge, Harry Callahan, Arthur Tress, Richard Misrach, Paul Strand, Linda 
Connor and other accomplished photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most arresting is an 1867 albumen print by the little-known 
Frenchman Francois Aubert, who was a kind of court photographer to the Emperor 
Maximilian. A rather more grisly task was recording the aftermath of 
Maximilian's execution, which Aubert had witnessed. His picture shows the slain 
emperor's bullet-ridden, blood-stained white shirt, which has been tacked to 
the back of a door for display. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirt, and by extension the photographic record of it, are bluntly offered 
to the viewer as factual evidence of the deed. Mundane reportage reverberates 
against a poetic intimation of St. Veronica's veil, which displays the image of 
the executed Christ as evidence of a miracle and was a popular subject in 
Mexican devotional painting of the period.

CLUB REVIEW; '60S-'70S ROCK FLIES AT BIRDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Franklin Strip, a popular stretch of Franklin Avenue between Beachwood and 
Bronson canyons in Hollywood, didn't even know what it was missing until Birds 
-- named after the kitchen's all-chicken menu -- came along six weeks ago and 
filled the void. With its addition, the trendy area -- which already includes a 
theater, cafes, restaurants and a resident psychic -- now has a neighborhood 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dockers ads haven't spoiled your appetite for all things boomer, you'll 
find the proprietors' music taste a good match with Birds' comfortable 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 In between serving patrons and making introductions, owners Henry Olek and 
Mary Preston scurry to the stereo system behind the bar to keep the '60s and 
early-'70s rock rolling, favoring such tunes as Bob Dylan's "Lay Lady Lay" and 
the Rolling Stones' "Brown Sugar." Not a night goes by without the 17-minute 
version of Iron Butterfly's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida." 
</P>
<P>
 Come last call, customers grooving to the familiar songs aren't eager to 
leave. Preston, however, has come up with an innovative tactic to oust the 
stragglers. 
</P>
<P>
 While flipping the light switch vigorously, she blasts either Marie Osmond's 
"Paper Roses" or the theme from "Love Boat" and they leave. It seems to work 
every time. HEIDI SIEGMUND

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SONGS OF ROMANTIC LONGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might expect an American art-cabaret singer who based her career in 
Belgium for a decade to come equipped with a heavy Euro-attitude, but in her 
Los Angeles debut at LunaPark on Tuesday, Anna Domino didn't do any 
persona-pushing. The gaunt singer-songwriter projected a nervous, bemused 
manner, interspersing deadpan wisecracks between the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by her own accordion and meticulously supported by guitarist-banjoist 
Michel Delory and amazing percussionist Hearn Gadbois, she sang in a 
deceptively plain voice. With a suggestion of huskiness, it insinuates rather 
than asserts -- ideal for her twilight moods of romantic longing. 
</P>
<P>
 She expresses a touching vulnerability, but while her music is evocative and 
seductive, it isn't equipped to summon something like real despair. Her 
chilling version of the creepy song sung by the little girl in "Night of the 
Hunter" indicated she'd do well to move from pastels into the dark. RICHARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; 'EL CIMARRON' A COMPELLING HISTORY LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Based on the biography of Esteban Montejo, a runaway Cuban slave, Hans Werner 
Henze's compelling "El Cimarron" was finished in 1979 and had its Los Angeles 
premiere in 1982 at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 It returned for a Monday Evening Concert this week, and its inventive musical 
language and narrative powers seem to have only increased in the intervening 
dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 One question: Where does it fit in the lexicon of existing musical forms? It 
is described as "a recital for four musicians" -- they being baritone Milton 
Williams, guitarist David Tanenbaum, flutist Jane Lenoir and percussionist 
Daniel Kennedy on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 This "recital" behaves much more like a type of musical theater, made more 
powerful because of its stripped-down presentation and avoidance of 
theatricality. Henze's opus of musical storytelling amounts to a rich, moving 
portrait of a hard life lived under persistent oppression and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 The assured, resonant Williams gave heft and flesh to his title role, broken 
up into 15 sections that detail the path of el cimmaron's (the runaway slave) 
life. The saga takes us from capture in Africa, to toil in the sugar cane, to 
escape and life in the woods, to fighting in a revolution that fails to 
liberate the black Cuban population, and to a final sigh of resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 The prolific, eclectic German composer's challenge was to keep the resources 
of the four musicians in constant motion, without losing aim or unity. To this 
end, Henze deploys improvisational moments and extended techniques -- 
Tanenbaum, for instance, sometimes struck his guitar or bowed its strings -- 
the players also ran around the stage, adding to the welter of percussion 
sounds. Henze also shifts the musical approach from atonal contemporary writing 
to hints of folk-like, indigenous Cuban material. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the entirety, there are intriguing pieces that linger in memory. An 
eerie, vaporous rumble accompanies "The Forest." "The Evil Victory" -- about 
life after the revolution and shattered idealism -- goes from delirious 
patchwork of Ivesian song fragments to a sad, hope-depleted solo voice. 
"Friendliness," a lament, is backed by the sharp, cerebral guitar writing Henze 
specializes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, "El Cimarron" is one of those rare contemporary works that 
addresses a specific historical subject and gives it the weight of a metaphor 
suitable for our life and times. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEWS; A COOL RECITAL FROM KYUNG-WHA CHUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1968, when as one of the more promising 20-year-old violinists on the 
national musical scene she first appeared in a Los Angeles-area recital, the 
Korean-born Kyung-Wha Chung has been pleasing Southland audiences with her high 
technical and musical accomplishment. The latest in her visits here came Monday 
night in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung is a mature artist now -- though she certainly still looks youthful -- 
and her recital with pianist Peter Frankl achieved an admirable standard in 
terms of solid mechanics and musical perspective. Yet, this agenda of works by 
Bartok, Beethoven, Debussy and Ravel emerged measurably uncommunicative. A 
deadly objectivity marked the entire event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What the duo played most convincingly came first, in Bartok's engagingly 
episodic and emotional Rhapsody No. 1. Here, both Chung and Frankl seemed to 
inhabit the pungent folk style, and rise to these many virtuosic challenges, 
breezily. 
</P>
<P>
 They connected less well to the sonatas that followed. Chung's harsh, smallish 
tone gave little character, and precious little nuance, to the Olympian 
statements in Beethoven's "Kreutzer," to the more delicate swagger in Debussy's 
G-minor opus and to the usually irresistible, jazzy subtleties of Ravel's 
Sonata.  
</P>
<P>
 Frankl, for his part, proved again that one can play the piano while thinking 
of nothing else at all; his tangible lack of imagination, while conquering all 
technical hurdles conscientiously, is remarkable. He remains that rare duck in 
the pianistic world: a key-depresser. Depressing. DANIEL CARIAGA

MOVIE REVIEW; 'WUORNOS': FUZZY LOOK AT A SERIAL KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aileen "Lee" Wuornos, the subject of Nick Broomfield's documentary "Aileen 
Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer," has the hard-bitten look of someone 
whose life has been hell and who has made a hell of the lives of others. 
Commentators have often noted how shockingly normal serial killers like Jeffrey 
Dahmer or Ted Bundy look; Wuornos doesn't inspire the same befuddlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the points of Broomfield's movie is that perhaps Wuornos is not, in 
the strictest definition, a serial killer at all. Between 1989 and 1990, while 
working as a prostitute on a Florida interstate highway, Wuornos shot and 
killed seven men. While admitting the killings, she repeatedly characterized 
them during her trial as acts of self-defense, a charge she reiterates during 
the interview she gives Broomfield at the end of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 When we hear Wuornos in the courtroom go into painstaking detail about how her 
first murder victim sexually tortured her and planned to kill her, she appears 
to be reliving the horror. It's almost unbearable to listen to and watch. 
</P>
<P>
 If her murders had been confined to that one alone, she probably would have 
escaped death row. (She's still there, pending appeal.) But her claims of 
self-defense in the other six don't jog the same vehement feminist fury. 
Wuornos is a jangle of mixed motives: She claims to accept her guilt and wants 
to be put to death but when she is sentenced she screams at the judge, "May 
your wife and kids get raped." 
</P>
<P>
 Wuornos' plea of no contest to one of the murders, which led to her 
sentencing, was engineered by her attorney Steven Glazer and Arlene Pralle, a 
born-again Christian and horse farmer who adopted Wuornos just before the 
murder trial because she claims "Lee" had a "heart of gold."  
</P>
<P>
 Broomfield seems manifestly concerned with how the Wuornos murders have turned 
into a commercial enterprise. He draws out a Florida policeman, Brian Jarvis, 
who claims that police officers conspired to sell the rights to the Wuornos 
case before she had been arrested, and that Wuornos' estranged female lover 
Tyria Moore, who some believe was a co-conspirator, was in on the deal in 
exchange for her freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 Broomfield's tack is to highlight the commercialization of the case and, in 
the process, to encourage the view that Wuornos has been sacrificed. When she 
finally relents to be interviewed by him at the end of the film, and 
underscores her position as a victim of abuse who murdered in self-defense, his 
interrogation is not very probing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unremarked, or glossed over in this film, is the fact that Wuornos had already 
been arrested and jailed for armed robbery in 1982, that she had married a 
70-year-old man in 1976 and that the marriage broke up on battery charges (each 
accused the other), that she had a baby at 13 that was taken from her, that she 
had tried to kill herself. Also glossed over or unexamined is the weight of 
evidence against her charges of self-defense: the fact that all the men she 
murdered were white men between the ages of 40 and 60 and drove fairly 
expensive vehicles; that space had been rented by her to store the spoils; that 
in all the murders she was careful enough to leave behind only one fingerprint; 
that she was not above trying to cut her own deals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Selling of a Serial Killer" is properly cynical of the commercial motives 
behind the case but it isn't skeptical enough about Wuornos, who, despite her 
entreaties to Broomfield at the end to investigate police corruption, remains 
remorseless about the murders. The film finally becomes an extension of the 
current vogue in courtroom special pleading: Wuornos is martyred because of her 
abusive childhood and her degradation as a prostitute. The film presents her as 
the first documented female serial killer but what you come away with is 
something else: Wuornos is the first politically correct serial killer.

 O Beautiful for Species of Crabs 
</P>
<P>
 North American waters are home to the largest variety of edible crab species 
in the world: snow, blue, king, Dungeness, stone, green, calico, Jonah, lady 
and oyster crabs. If you haven't heard of most of those names, it may be 
because about half the total catch is snow crabs. Billions and Billions and

 For years, people have been saying garlic is good for your blood. In the 
current issue of the medical journal Lipids, Dr. Yu-Yan Yeh of Penn State and 
research assistant Shaw-Mei Yeh describe the apparent mechanism: Garlic 
inhibits the liver's manufacture of triglycerides and cholesterol. (Dietary 
cholesterol is broken down in digestion; the cholesterol found in the blood is 
all synthesized in the liver.) In lab tests, garlic reduced triglycerides 30% 
and (particularly good news) while total cholesterol went down 15%, HDL (the 
"good" cholesterol) remained the same. Of course, that was in rats. The Yehs 
will have results of a human study this summer. Hey, No Dribbling at the Table!

 For the basketball finals season, General Mills is making a cereal called 
Dunk-A-Balls. They're sort of like a cross between Kix and Trix, but each wheat 
and corn puff has brown or red seam lines, making it look like a tiny 
basketball. If you think this is a brazen invitation for children to play with 
their food, you're right. The back of the package actually features a cut-out 
basketball hoop for sliding a cereal bowl under. In supermarkets for the next

 Wednesday, April 6, there'll be a party at the Omaha, Neb., plant of C.A. 
Swanson & Sons, celebrating the 40th birthday of the TV dinner. The ancient 
among us may remember those first frozen dinner packages (originally, the only 
flavor was turkey) that were designed to look like a TV screen surrounded by 
wood-tone paneling; the price would be stamped on an imitation channel selector 
and the USDA inspection certificate was made to look a little like a volume 
dial. The original aluminum TV dinner tray was doomed by the microwave, but 
otherwise those corny cartons were the future. CHARLES PERRY

CULINARY SOS: POTATOES ANNA, ENGLISH CRUMPETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 DEAR SOS: I would really love to have the recipe for the potato circles baked 
crisp and served with meals at Chasen's in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MILLIE 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR MILLIE: Some of the best things are the simplest. There are only two 
major ingredients in potatoes Anna, a classic French recipe often used in 
restaurants. But there is a trick to assembling and baking that will keep you 
on your toes. CHASEN'S POTATOES ANNA 
</P>
<P>
 6 baking potatoes 
</P>
<P>
 Salt, pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups clarified butter 
</P>
<P>
 Chopped parsley, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Peel potatoes and cut into paper-thin 1/8-inch slices. Rinse and pat dry with 
paper towels. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Using 1 potato per cup, 
layer slices into 6-ounce heat-proof custard cups, adding about 2 tablespoons 
clarified butter to each cup. Top potato layer should be slightly higher than 
rim. 
</P>
<P>
 Place cups on baking sheet over range. Turn on heat under baking sheet until 
butter in cups comes to boil. Turn off heat. Wearing oven mitts, place baking 
sheet and cups in oven to bake at 350 degrees 45 to 60 minutes. When top layer 
of potatoes turns brown, cover with foil.  
</P>
<P>
 After 45 minutes, test for doneness. Bottom layer of potatoes should be crisp 
and brown. When done, remove baking sheet and cool potatoes in cups 20 minutes. 
Slide fork under potatoes to loosen. Invert potatoes on dish. Sprinkle with 
chopped parsley. Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about:

 DEAR SOS: I've lost a recipe for crumpets that I clipped from The Times 
approximately 25 years ago. I hope you can find it. They were gorgeous. 
</P>
<P>
 -- HELEN 
</P>
<P>
 DEAR HELEN: This recipe, perhaps? ENGLISH CRUMPETS 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 package cake or dry yeast 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons warm water 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup melted shortening 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup milk, scalded and cooled 
</P>
<P>
 1 2/3 cups flour, about 
</P>
<P>
 Butter, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Dissolve yeast in bowl with warm water. In another bowl add dissolved yeast, 
shortening, salt and scalded milk. Stir in flour. Beat well. Let rise in warm 
place 1 1/2 hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Grease crumpet rings about 1 inch deep and 3 3/4 inches across. Place rings on 
hot griddle. Pour enough batter into each ring to fill halfway and cook until 
top bubbles. (Griddle must not be too hot or bottom of crumpets will cook 
before top bubbles.) Do not turn. Remove rings from griddle with pancake turner 
and slip out crumpets. Cool completely. Then toast and butter generously. Makes 
about 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Each unbuttered crumpet contains about:

 128 calories; 131 mg sodium; 2 mg cholesterol; 6 grams fat; 16 grams 
carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 0.06 gram fiber.

GARDEN FRESH; HONOR THY FAVA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 F eves. Fave. Habas. Bakla. Paghlah. Koukia. Ful. The French, Italian, 
Spanish, Turkish, Armenian, Greek and Arabic names for an ancient bean that is 
as treasured in those kitchens as it is neglected in ours. Even the British are 
mad about these broad beans.  
</P>
<P>
 How, in this inquisitive, vigorous ferment called America -- where radicchio, 
tomatillos and bok choy keep company with lettuce and tomatoes in our crispers 
-- have we let favas get away?  
</P>
<P>
 It would make sense if favas weren't delectable from start to finish. From the 
time the pods are a couple of inches long to when the nubbins inside are 
pea-size, you can prepare the pods just as you would snap peas or beans. When 
seeds reach the soft shelly stage (the fresh-shelling stage between snap and 
dry), they'll remind you of limas -- with more flavor. And the mature dried 
beans, which can be the size of a small daisy, creamy or coppery in color, are 
meaty-rich. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason favas are so popular abroad is their versatility. Although any bean 
can be eaten at every stage, I can't think of another whose fine quality, 
flavor and texture at every stage match these. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, the French simmer fava beans at the shelly stage with sprigs of 
summer savory and thyme. They make a veil of sauce by whisking an egg yolk, 
olive oil and lemon juice into the reduced cooking broth, then top the dish 
with more summer savory. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rite of spring -- the way we dive at the first asparagus -- Italians pack 
a heap of raw young fave pods into a picnic basket with a bottle of golden wine 
and a wedge of salty sheep's milk cheese, then head off to the country, a 
pretty ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 North of Madrid in Segovian soil, favas are grown to perfection. In winter, 
the dried beans might be stewed with ham, sausage and a pig's foot and ear, 
then finished with tomatoes, pimiento, onion and garlic. Glasses of a deep-red 
vino de la tierra wash down this lusty dish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turks enjoy cooked favas cooled and heaped with yogurt flavored with garlic 
and dill. Dill also figures in an Armenian spring stew -- snap favas and 
chopped dill are added to almost-tender chunks of lamb and onions in tomato 
sauce, then simmered until all is tender and ladled over pilaf. 
</P>
<P>
 In Greece, baby artichokes are ready to be harvested while favas are still in 
the snap stage. The artichoke hearts are quartered and simmered with the beans, 
some of the juices thickened with flour and sharpened with lemon, served hot 
with chopped wild fennel. And retsina! 
</P>
<P>
 Ful medames , the national dish of Egypt, is cooked in huge, nearly spherical 
pots and sold by street vendors the way hot dogs are here. The small dried fava 
beans are simmered with garlic and served in soup bowls with a variety of 
garnishes, such as hard-boiled egg, chopped parsley, olive oil and lemon juice. 
The Egyptians have a saying, "Even the pharaohs have feasted on ful medames ," 
and certainly the name comes from the old Egyptian language, Coptic ( phel 
mithems ). 
</P>
<P>
 The English fancy their broad bean pods young and pale and boiled with mint or 
parsley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So does it make sense we are largely deprived of such feasts? Perhaps it's 
that fava beans aren't always sweet. Depending on the soil in which they grow 
and the cultivar, favas can have a spirited flavor, sometimes even a hint of 
herbal bitterness (larger dried beans, however, are most often sweet). But this 
can't be the reason. Americans are fond of tastes with an edge: Cheddar cheese, 
garlic, dark chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even fava leaves are good to eat! Pick young top leaves and tear them into 
salads, or chop them for soups, or use them as garnish with their fragrant 
pale-sweet-pea-like flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Underappreciated favas. It would make sense if raising them weren't foolproof. 
Favas will produce on lean soil as long as it's well drained, but of course the 
more fertile it is, the finer the plants. The plants will leave the earth in 
which they grew richer than they found it; favas contribute lots of nitrogen to 
the soil. They need sun and a modicum of water but usually no irrigation if 
there is rain. Aphids are likely to be attracted to the top leaves. When the 
plants are tall enough and setting blossoms, pick off those leaves and bring 
them into the kitchen. Until then, douse the critters with the hose or soapy 
water.  
</P>
<P>
 Favas are vigorous, some plants growing five feet tall. For them, set pea 
sticks -- slender prunings from trees and shrubs that the plants can lean 
against as they grow -- in the ground at sowing time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bushes of favas are appealing. They can grow close together and make a 
deep-green hedge. (Spring flowers such as columbine, daffodils and larkspur are 
delightful against the hedge.) Fava leaves bear no resemblance to those of 
summer beans, because they don't belong to the same family. Both are legumes, 
but favas are in the vetch clan and native to North Africa and Southeast Asia. 
Most of our sunny summer beans are in the pea clan, native to this continent.  
</P>
<P>
 Favas are a cool-weather crop that loves cold soil. In warm climates, they're 
annuals grown as a winter/spring crop, and in cool climates as an early summer 
crop. In most of Southern California, sow favas from September through 
February. In the high desert, sow in February and March. Mark your calendar. 
Where winters are frozen, sow from mid-February through April. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvest snap pods at two to three inches with a sharp downward twist. Harvest 
beans for fresh shelling when the seeds appear as small bumps in the pod. The 
slight scar on the side should be white or green. By the time the scar darkens, 
each bean is in a jacket that most people want removed. You can pop it off 
after cooking. Harvest dried beans when pods are brittle. 
</P>
<P>
 For seeds, a white knight is coming to the rescue in our relatively fava 
bean-less nation. Ianto Evans has established a Fava Bean Project in Oregon, 
where a brilliant collection of favas from all over the world is being grown 
and improved in expectation of popularizing these nourishing beans.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Fava Bean Project's achievements is Aprovecho Large, a large and 
decidedly sweet bean. Another, Bonnie Lad, grows only 15 inches tall, gives 
small, light-green seeds and is lovely in the border with sweet peas. Castillo 
Franco, heirloom Spanish beans, are dark-brown -- for Arabic dishes. Broad 
Windsor is a classic large English bean known for fine flavor. When sowing, 
sprinkle the seeds with an inoculant -- bacteria that increases productivity. 
</P>

Institute, 80574 Hazelton Road, Cottage Grove, Ore. 97424. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : One caution about fava beans applies to people of African, Asian and 
Mediterranean descent: Every part of the plant may cause a reaction to those 
with an inherited allergic condition known as favism. Obviously, the vast 
majority of people with such ancestry don't have the favism gene, but if you 
come of this stock and have never eaten favas, start with one or two.

<P>
 This is a gem of a bean dish. Speckled with red and green, the sauce is rosy 
pink -- delightful around the celadon-colored beans. Four servings meant one 
for my husband and three for me. I never seem to plant enough.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu for the rest of the meal should be Italian, I think. A good roast 
chicken, a tossed salad with lots of colors and crispness, and the same wine 
used in the bean dish for sipping. And luscious red grapes and creamy cheese 
for dessert.  
</P>

WINE COUNTRY COOKING; IS THIS A GREAT JOB, OR WHAT?; SWEET DEALS: THREE 
RESTAURANT CHEFS TRADED THE RAT RACE FOR SLOWER-PACED JOBS AS STAFF CHEFS AT 
CALIFORNIA WINERIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fame that goes with being a world-class chef has appeal only while the 
klieg lights are on. Once back in the depths of the kitchen, many chefs burn 
out on the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Three California chefs have left the glitzy restaurant lifestyle for the 
calmer, more creative world of the winery kitchen, where the fame may be far 
less but where the personal rewards appear to be much more tangible. 
</P>
<P>
 Winery owners hire chefs because they know that table wines show best with 
fine food. But the high cost of maintaining an on-staff chef has, in the last 
six years, eliminated all but a tiny handful of such positions. Six years ago, 
California boasted more than two dozen on-staff winery chefs. Of the few who 
remain, three are former restaurant chefs who gave up what they saw as a rat 
race. John Ash, Jerry Comfort and Mark Malicki all still feel cooking is 
exciting and rewarding, but prefer to do it in small, private kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial appeal of the restaurant is the excitement, the adrenaline rush 
that keeps you going," says Ash, whose successful restaurant John Ash and Co. 
was founded in Santa Rosa nearly 15 years ago, but who now makes his sauces for 
Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino County. Eventually Ash felt the adrenaline 
collapse as the day-to-day routine of cooking took its toll. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Malicki, who ran his own restaurant, Truffles, in Sebastopol in western Sonoma 
County, says he disliked the non-cooking aspects of running a restaurant. He 
found cost analysis of the commercial operation to be tiresome. He also 
disliked the headache of dealing with such mundane pursuits as the whims of 
purveyors, staff and insurance companies. He is now five miles up the road at 
Iron Horse Vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy this a lot more," says Malicki. "I can be home at night, and I don't 
have to make money (for someone else)." 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort spoke of the hectic pace of the restaurant kitchen. At Checkers, he 
says, "Cooking was two hectic hours at lunch and three hours at dinner." That 
sort of schedule dictates shortcuts in cooking, he says, that don't always make 
for the best food. 
</P>
<P>
 Now at Beringer Vineyards in the Napa Valley, he can take the time and care 
necessary to create great cuisine in a generally unhurried manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are those who seem to thrive on the excitement of the 
restaurant kitchen. Gary Danko, a Madeleine Kamman-trained chef of 
extraordinary talent, preceded Comfort as staff chef at Beringer before moving 
on. For the last two years he has been head chef at the Ritz-Carlton San 
Francisco and has won high praise from critics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ash, Comfort and Malicki would rather be cooking in less-public 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Before he started cooking professionally, Ash was a photographer and medical 
illustrator in San Francisco with an interest in food styling and cooking. "I'd 
always loved to cook," he says, "it was my little passion." Eventually, he 
landed a position at Del Monte Foods as head of new product development, where 
he came up with the idea of the pudding-in-a-cup, something far removed from 
haute cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 He tired of the corporate life, however. So he toured Europe, taking courses 
at cooking schools such as La Varenne in Paris and Cordon Bleu in London. When 
he returned to San Francisco, he operated a small catering company. In 1979 he 
mentioned his desire to cook to neighbor George Smith and his wife, Nancy 
Doyle, two physicians who loved great wine and food. The Smiths encouraged Ash 
to start a restaurant, and they helped arrange financing. 
</P>
<P>
 John Ash and Co. opened in a Santa Rosa shopping center to rave reviews in 
1980. In 1988 it moved five miles north to a new building at the Vintner's Inn. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But Ash, 51, says that after cooking professionally for more than a decade he 
began to find menu development more interesting. When he was offered a position 
as staff chef with Fetzer Vineyards in Mendocino, he didn't think twice. He 
remains a consultant at the restaurant bearing his name, but now prepares 
smaller meals out of a large two-section kitchen at Fetzer's Valley Oaks 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At verdant Valley Oaks, two hours north of San Francisco and a mile east of 
Highway 101, Fetzer's kitchen is set up back behind the organic garden that was 
one of the major reasons Ash took this job. The rear kitchen, closed off from 
the rest of the circular, pergola-designed building, is large enough for the 
army of chefs necessary to cook for 150, which happens occasionally. The front 
kitchen is a teaching line, above which are angled mirrors so guests can see 
what's cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash says when his restaurant clearly was becoming a grind, he thought about 
what he'd do instead. "I wondered whether I had another restaurant in me," he 
says. "I was wondering what the hell I'd do later in life. Well, I found that 
as I got older, I liked to yak about food." He started doing a Saturday radio 
show in Sonoma County and three years ago, when he joined Fetzer, he began 
writing cookbooks and teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Today he creates menus for the Fetzer Valley Oaks Food and Wine Center in 
Hopland and travels extensively, cooking dinners at which Fetzer wines are 
served. He also is working on a new cookbook, tentatively called "John Ash's 
Wine Country Cuisine," to be published by E.P. Dutton.

 Always a kitchen tinkerer, Beringer's Comfort, 36, got his first restaurant 
job at 13, a busboy in his hometown of Stockton. He worked part-time in 
kitchens for eight years before taking a two-year culinary course at San 
Francisco City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, however, he jumped onto the fastest career track available to a chef. In 
a space of 12 years he worked with four great chefs. After working at San 
Francisco's Stanford Court Hotel (beginning as vegetable cook and leaving as 
sous chef), he served at Stars with Jeremiah Tower and then at Masa with the 
late Masataka Kobayashi. He also cooked for four years with founding chef 
Philippe Jeanty at Domaine Chandon before taking over as head chef at Checkers 
in Los Angeles, the hectic but acclaimed downtown hotel restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after joining Checkers, he moved to the calm and professional -- and 
decidedly less glamorous -- kitchen at Beringer Vineyards, mainly for the 
chance to push the envelope of creative cookery. 
</P>
<P>
 His kitchen is larger than any he's ever toiled in. Beringer designed a twin, 
side-by-side cooking line and installed some of the most sophisticated 
equipment -- warming ovens, convection ovens, standard ovens and more -- in 
Hudson House, a restored and expanded turn-of-the-century farmhouse in St. 
Helena, across Highway 29 from the main winery. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort uses mainly the enclosed front kitchen; instructor and cookbook author 
Madeleine Kamman uses the teaching half of the kitchen. Comfort has a staff of 
three who regularly assist turning out five- and six-course dinners for VIP 
winery guests. 
</P>

 Malicki too began cooking at age 13, after his mother died. His siblings were 
all grown, he says, "so I was cooking dinner for my dad every night." At age 14 
he took a part-time and weekend job at Delmonico's, a local restaurant in New 
Haven, Conn., where, he says, he peeled a lot of garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school he worked at a variety of kitchen jobs before getting his 
first position as sous chef at Pear Trees in New York, and at the affiliated 
River Cafe in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 He was operating a catering business in New York's fashion district in 1984 
when he and his wife took a trip to visit her sister in Sebastopol. "I fell in 
love with this area," he recalls. "When we went back to New York, we asked 
ourselves why we came back." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later the Malickis moved west and opened Truffles in 1987. But 
working nights and weekends was no fun, and running a restaurant added to the 
stress level -- "having to make a living at it," he says with a trace of 
disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Truffles was popular with wine industry people because Malicki liked to 
experiment with Asian dishes, which go with non-traditional wines, a favorite 
of winemakers. But Sebastopol isn't located in a major metropolitan center, so 
traffic midweek nights was slow. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the Sterling family sought to replace Martha Buser (now at Zuni Cafe in 
San Francisco) as staff chef at their Iron Horse Vineyards, Malicki, 35, never 
hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Now instead of cost accounting and pricing of dishes, Malicki can simply walk 
through Audrey Sterling's amazing, multitiered garden of vegetables, fruits, 
and herbs and create taste sensations that work with Iron Horse's line of 
wines, which includes spectacular sparkling wine and lean, delicate 
Chardonnays. 
</P>
<P>
 His kitchen is little more than the original 9x9-foot kitchen that originally 
existed in the handsome Victorian home Barry and Audrey Sterling bought 20 
years ago two miles west of Highway 116 on a rise in the middle of vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
 The kitchen is small but has ample countertop space, and a rear door leading 
to the garden permits Malicki to grab fresh herbs to garnish plates just before 
serving. 
</P>

 Whom do these chefs cook for? Wine buyers, mostly -- wholesale or retail 
salespeople who trek to the wine country to reacquaint themselves with the 
wineries they represent. At Fetzer, Beringer and Iron Horse, food is such an 
integral part of the winery's message that the chefs work almost daily on meals 
for one client or another, or for visiting importers from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent event was for a group of wholesale people from Miami who were 
touring the wine country for five days, seeing a dozen wineries. Most of the 
time, wineries brought in caterers to cook luncheons. At Iron Horse, however, 
they arrived at 10 a.m. for a tasting of new releases and barrel samples with 
Forest Tancer, the head winemaker. Then the guests walked down the unpaved 
pathway, between the row of flowering bushes, to the porch-graced Victorian 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 On a rear patio, Iron Horse sparkling wine accompanied smoked salmon canapes 
and quail eggs and caviar. At 12:30, lunch was served in the smaller of two 
indoor dining areas, with Iron Horse Fume Blanc accompanying a light appetizer, 
Chardonnay served with a seafood dish, then the Pinot Noir and Cabernet 
Sauvignon with local cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the luncheon was well made when the wholesalers realized that the 
delicate 1991 Chardonnay, which may be passed over in a traditional tasting 
with many other wines, was a perfect foil for the delicate seafood, and that 
the 1989 Cabernet went well with the two cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 All three chefs also cook for other special occasions. For instance, Ash 
recently prepared dinner in honor of a Chilean winemaker affiliated with 
Fetzer's parent company, Brown Forman of Louisville. Comfort prepared a dinner 
for the owner of a large retail operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort also occasionally does major dinners of 50 or 100 for groups that 
contract with the winery. Recently the Marin Wine and Food Society held a 
birthday dinner in honor of Dr. Bernard Rhodes, owner of the Bella Oaks 
Vineyard and a partner in Heitz Cellars. Comfort prepared a six-course meal, 
served on china by a tuxedoed staff. Beringer wines and wines from other 
producers were poured into cut crystal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Malicki may have the most varied job of the three. Though he rarely cooks for 
as large a crowd as Comfort or Ash, he cooks more often. Not only does he 
frequently cook for the Sterling and Tancer families (winemaker Forest is 
married to Barry and Audrey's daughter, Joy), but he also does harvest 
luncheons throughout the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All three chefs declined to discuss their salaries, but say it's comparable to 
what they made at their last restaurant positions. Industry analysts say 
salaries here range between $70,000 and $100,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that's more than the owner of a small gourmet cafe might take home, 
it's less than the owner of a great restaurant might make. What they do this 
for, they all say, is the greater freedom they get at the smaller winery 
kitchen than they had at the restaurant. In this peaceful setting, they can 
concentrate on such subtle elements as matching a specific wine with a specific 
dish. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the restaurant, you never knew whether someone was ordering white or red 
with a dish, so you had to think about how a dish would go with more than one 
wine," says Ash. This meant occasionally making a dish that wasn't as exciting 
as it could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, says Comfort, he's not locked into making recipes the same way each 
time; he has more flexibility in how he prepares things. "I'm constantly 
tasting the wine we're serving that day," he says, "and then tasting the dish, 
to see if the dish needs fixing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when they are cooking for a small group, these chefs can concentrate on 
artistic elements that might be impossible in the heated atmosphere of the 
restaurant kitchen. These touches might be a more architectural display of the 
food, or a more time-consuming preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort admits that it's nice to gain accolades for a dish, get your name in 
the newspaper, or walk out after a dinner amid applause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people like that setting," says Comfort. "I like this one."

 This is good with freshly sauteed Swiss chard and roasted wild mushroom s. Ash 
suggests it be accompanied by a lighter Cabernet Sauvignon such as Fetzer 
Barrel Select or, interestingly, an off-dry Gewurztraminer. Ash says the 
Cabernet pairs nicely with the pork and the compote becomes the foil; 
Gewurztraminer pairs nicely with the compote and the pork then is the foil.

WINE COUNTRY COOKING ; BALANCING ACT: MATCHING FOOD WITH WINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Ash says he has developed a three-part philosophy for matching foods and 
wine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Acidity, pungency and sweetness," says Ash. "That's almost all there is. If 
those elements are in balance with the wine, the dish and the wine will 
probably match." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Malicki points out that because of the higher acidity in the wines at 
Iron Horse than at some wineries, he uses less salt than he might otherwise. 
Higher-acid wines tend to make it easier to taste subtleties in foods, thus 
they don't have to be as highly seasoned or sauced. On the other hand, because 
of the richness and new-oak aging of so many Beringer wines, Jerry Comfort uses 
more salt than he might. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a rich, young Cabernet Sauvignon would go best with steak, but 
the more mellow the Cabernet, the more it works with lamb or venison. 
Cabernet's broad, soft, generous flavors should be matched with something 
equally flavorful, such as beef. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As for Chardonnay, most are not very tart and have oak for richness, so these 
go well with rich seafood dishes, in cream or butter sauces, and chicken dishes 
where the spices are delicate and the sauces not based around tart elements 
such as tomatoes or artichokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Where tartness is a main ingredient in the dish, not sweetness, Sauvignon 
Blanc seems to work better. Thus Sauvignon Blanc works with seafood and light 
pastas that have delicate, non-tomato-based sauces or olive oil; grilled 
seafood with lemon sauce; seafood mousses, and grilled chicken in herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavier dishes with some tartness -- such as pastas based around tomatoes, 
artichoke-based dishes, and veal with lemon and capers -- call for a wine like 
Chianti. Chianti is a fairly high-acid wine and needs a dish equally tart. 
</P>
<P>
 Pungency, Ash says, is a difficult thing to describe. This is an intensity of 
aroma that is sharp, such as the aroma one might get from raw onions, 
high-strength vinegar, or limburger cheese.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Take asparagus for example," he says. "If you steam or boil it, the sulfurous 
compounds come out, and then it's hard to match wine with it. What I do is 
simply grill it. Or take beets. Rather than steam them, I roast them." 
</P>
<P>
 He also likes to use roasted garlic as a "magical ingredient" in many dishes 
because roasting it tames its pungency and adds a sweetness and a smoky quality 
to many dishes that is subtle and complex, bringing out the character of many 
red wines, particularly Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a pungency in grilled and smoked meats, which go better with 
Zinfandel than with other red wines. Zinfandel also works with rich and spicy 
pastas, game and sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweetness is also a critical issue. Says Comfort: "If the dish is too sweet 
for the wine, such as a rack of lamb in Port wine sauce, then I'll reduce the 
sweetness of the sauce." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some lightly sweet foods, such as sate, call for lightly sweet wines, such 
as Gewurztraminer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the "sweet" red wine, Pinot Noir, a wine that usually lacks much 
overt tannin and offers more fruit than Cabernet. Here, tradition calls for 
prime rib, but the chefs all said it works just as well with the richer 
seafoods such as salmon and chicken dishes prepared with garlic or other strong 
seasonings. 
</P>
<P>
 Comfort says he is most bothered by what he calls "two romantic wine-food 
pairings that just don't work. That is chocolate with Cabernet and Champagne 
with dessert." He says the sweetness of the food in both cases wipes out the 
flavor of the wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Malicki says wine works better the fresher the ingredients, and he is 
especially insistent about the use of fresh herbs whenever possible. "Fresh 
herbs make wines taste more alive," he says. If fresh herbs aren't available, 
Malicki suggests using only the freshest of dried herbs. "Dried herbs lose 
their flavor after a time," he says. "I'd replace them once a year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Malicki suggests, cook with the wine you're going to serve with the 
meal, or at least something close to it in weight and flavor. This is 
especially true of sauces that are not cooked for a long period of time, or 
sauces that don't call for much or any cream or butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash said cooking for a winery has taught him to cook differently, to be more 
sensitive to what the food will taste like with different wines and with 
specific wines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cooking in the 1990s presents a challenge to all traditional cooks," he says. 
"We all need to learn how to cook in a new way. We don't have demi-glaces any 
more. There are no hot and cold emulsions, brown sauces, white sauces, tomato 
sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a whole new set of mother sauces including salsas, chutneys, 
vinaigrettes, juices and simple stock reductions." This sort of cooking was 
spurred by more interest in healthier foods, "and it just happens to work well 
with wine, if you watch the balance of the dish and the wine." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ash says there are many versions of such preparations as chutney and 
vinaigrette. "A lot of vinaigrettes don't have any vinegar in them at all," he 
says, "and chutneys don't even have to be sweet. They should have a sweet-tart 
note, but we're not talking Major Grey's here." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a vinaigrette made with lemon juice instead of vinegar might work 
well with a crisp white wine, and a chutney made only a tiny bit sweet would be 
a perfect foil for an off-dry Gewurztraminer, Riesling or Chenin Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a Chardonnay might not work with these dishes," he said. "You just need 
to watch the balance of the sweetness and the acidity." And his "secret" is to 
taste the wine he's going to serve while preparing the dish. DAN BERGER

IN THE KITCHEN; GREEN LASAGNA: YOU HAD TO BE THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right up front, I'll be honest about this dish: When we ran it through The 
Times Test Kitchen, no one liked it. It's not that they hated it, it's just 
that they weren't crazy about it. 
</P>
<P>
 So why should you waste your time trying it? Because I'm digging in my heels 
on this one. I'm right and they're wrong. It's good. That settles it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that I don't understand what everyone else was talking about. I can 
see how tasting this dish, eating in a rush, standing by the sink, waiting for 
the next thing to come out, you might not appreciate its full worth. In this 
setting, the food that wins is the kind that jumps up and down and waves its 
arms at you, not the one that quietly charms you. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm firmly convinced that some dishes, like some buildings, are site-specific. 
Within their proper context they are absolutely wonderful. Take them out of 
that situation, though, and you think what-the-heck? Or worse. There is 
something monumental about pueblo-style architecture, the sinuous way the 
building's curves fit the stark, sere surrounding mountains. But one of the 
silliest buildings I ever saw was an adobe in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So let's talk about where this dish comes from. I served it one night after a 
good strong spring rain. It was the turn of the season, those days when 
Southern California changes from roasted golden brown to a rich and shimmering 
shade of green. Sometimes there seems to be so much chlorophyll in the air you 
can taste it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, you can't. So I figure, if you can't eat green, you can eat 
greens. I am a big fan of greens. Mustard, chard, kale or collard -- I like 
them sauteed with olive oil; I like them boiled with fatback. I like greens 
stirred in risotto and cooked in vegetable soup. Serve them with cornbread or 
crostini and I'm happy. 
</P>
<P>
 When I finally came in out of the rain after spending the morning working in 
the yard, I was thinking green thoughts. Which led, inevitably, to dinner. What 
I settled on was this lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasagna has a reputation for being a bruiser of a dish with heavy layers of 
noodles, thick tomato sauce, browned meat and lots of melted cheese. But this 
version is a kind of springtime compromise. It has some of my favorite things 
about heavy lasagna -- the warm goosh of ricotta and the molten pull of 
mozzarella -- but it's different. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, the mozzarella and ricotta are shot through with garlicky greens 
and earthy mushrooms instead of beef. And to keep it even lighter (or maybe 
just because I'd just been out trimming the tree and had plenty of fruit 
available), I flavored the ricotta fairly strongly with lemon. The lemon, 
garlic and greens worked very well together, in a quiet kind of way. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is not a big brass band of a lasagna, the fresh pasta is 
essential here. Normally, I'm a dried-noodle kind of guy -- after a couple of 
years of making all my pasta fresh, I long ago came to embrace the convenience 
(and taste) of good-quality dried. Granted, dried pasta has a flavor and 
texture different from fresh, but I find it works especially well with the kind 
of quick-cooked sauces I normally make. It's difficult for me to figure aglio e 
olio on fresh pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, in the case of an understated filling like this one, 
nothing but fresh will do. In the end, this lasagna is about textures and 
shadings of flavors. The soft architecture of fresh pasta seems the only thing 
that is appropriate to support this filling. 
</P>
<P>
 So go ahead and try it -- all the better if you can make it on some cool 
spring night when it has just rained and green is the only color you taste. 
LASAGNA OF GREENS AND LEMON 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch Swiss chard, rinsed, trimmed and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch mustard greens, rinsed, thick stems trimmed and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1 bunch kale, rinsed, trimmed and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound brown mushrooms, rinsed, trimmed and quartered 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound ricotta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup fresh goat cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Zest 1 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh Pasta 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups tomato puree 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound mozzarella, shredded 
</P>
<P>
 In large saute pan or wok, stir-fry chard, mustard greens and kale just with 
water clinging to leaves after rinsing. After greens have cooked 3 to 5 
minutes, add garlic and cook until all greens are tender, about 10 minutes, 
stirring frequently to keep from scorching. Add 1/2 of lemon juice and stir 
until all moisture is re-absorbed. Season to taste with salt and pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat non-stick saute pan over high heat. When very hot, add mushrooms and 
cook, tossing and stirring constantly, until browned. Add to greens and allow 
to cool completely. Mixture should be completely dry. 
</P>
<P>
 In large mixing bowl, combine ricotta, goat cheese and lemon zest. Add 
remaining 1/2 of lemon juice and stir to combine. When greens are completely 
cool, add to cheese mixture and stir well. Season to taste with salt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fresh Pasta has been made, assemble lasagna. Spread bottom and sides of 
glass baking pan with 3/4 cup of tomato puree. Cook pasta in pot of boiling 
water. Drain. Then lay 1 sheet of pasta in bottom of pan. It should cover 
bottom completely. Spread 1/2 of cheese mixture over pasta sheet. Sprinkle 1/3 
of mozzarella over top. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat layering once more, finishing with third sheet of pasta. Spread 
remaining tomato puree over top and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella. Bake at 
300 degrees 30 to 45 minutes, until heated through. Makes 6 servings.

</P>
<P>
 Fresh Pasta 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Place flour in work bowl of food processor fitted with steel blade. Add eggs 
and process until dough comes together and forms ball that rides around on top 
of blade. If mixture is too dry and fails to form ball, slowly add just enough 
water to bring ball together, no more than 1 tablespoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dough ball should be slightly sticky. If too sticky and soft, add flour 1 
teaspoon at time until texture is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 Knead dough by running processor. Ball will ride around on top of blade, 
becoming more and more smooth. When smooth enough, remove from processor. Wrap 
in plastic wrap. Let stand at least 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll dough out in pasta machine. Divide in quarters and work with 1 portion at 
time, keeping remainder wrapped in plastic wrap. Flatten dough, then run 
through machine on widest setting. Fold double and run through again, folded 
edge first. Repeat 2 or 3 times. Fold double again, and run through sideways. 
Repeat 2 or 3 more times. Dough will change from fairly sticky and possibly 
slightly dimpled on 1 side to satiny and smooth. Sheet should be as wide as 
baking dish (if not, layer dish with 2 sheets rather than 1). 
</P>
<P>
 Change pasta machine to next narrower setting. Run dough through machine once. 
Repeat until next-to-last setting. Before rolling out at next-to-last setting, 
cut pasta sheet in half. After rolling out at next-to-last setting, lay pasta 
sheet on lightly floured dish towel and cover with another dish towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeat until all dough has been rolled out.

EASTER ; SPRING LAMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE LEVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lamb has long been the springtime meat of choice in much of Europe and the 
Mediterranean area. It's only natural that it has become a time-honored entree 
for Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Families in Rome enjoy Easter lamb baked with artichokes, potatoes, carrots 
and sage or stewed lamb with black olives. In Athens, spring lamb is prepared 
in many guises -- braised with peas, with green beans, with artichokes, with 
zucchini, or with green onions and dill. 
</P>
<P>
 The best cut for many home-cooked lamb specialties is the shoulder. In our 
markets, lamb shoulder chops are often featured as reasonably priced specials. 
This succulent cut can be cooked in several ways. Baking or braising the lamb 
with liquid are ideal techniques to use. The lamb produces a delicious sauce 
and cooks much faster than comparable beef dishes because lamb is more tender. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since lamb has a good, meaty flavor, there is no need to add stock when 
braising, although you can add the bones from shoulder chops to reinforce the 
sauce's taste. Wine and tomatoes are the preferred braising liquids, while 
garlic, onions and assertive herbs such as rosemary, sage and bay leaves are 
the most popular seasonings in northern Mediterranean countries. 
</P>
<P>
 If baking the shoulder chops, brown the lamb in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 When braising, brown the meat in a pan before adding liquid. Browning produces 
a sauce of deeper color and richer flavor, but to save time, you can skip this 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice and pasta are delicious with lamb and benefit from the meat's braising 
juices. Serving lamb with pasta or grains has another advantage -- you can eat 
smaller amounts of meat. You still enjoy the wonderful flavor but by eating a 
modest quantity of lamb, the menu will still be nutritionally balanced. To 
reduce the amount of fat, trim as much of the visible fat as possible when 
cutting the meat into pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Match flavorful lamb with asparagus, peas or other seasonal vegetables. This 
is a time-tested formula for putting you and your family in a festive 
springtime mood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For this traditional meal-in-one-dish, rice-shaped pasta, called orzo or riso, 
is baked in a sauce from the lamb juices, then becomes a bed for the meat. 
White wine and a subtle hint of cinnamon give the sauce a lovely flavor. 
Steamed asparagus is a great accompaniment.  
</P>
<P>
 GREEK-BAKED LAMB WITH ORZO 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2 1/2 pounds lamb shoulder chops, 1 to 1 1/4 inches thick, fat trimmed 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 1 small cinnamon stick 
</P>
<P>
 1 large onion, halved and thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 2 large garlic cloves, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup tomato sauce 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dried leaf oregano 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound orzo or riso pasta 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Place chops in 10-cup gratin dish or large baking dish. Sprinkle lamb with oil 
and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Turn chops to coat 
evenly. Bake at 400 degrees 10 minutes, turning once. Reduce heat to 350 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Add wine, cinnamon stick, onion and garlic. Bake until meat is still pink 
inside but not red when cut, about 15 minutes longer.  
</P>
<P>
 Remove chops. Cut meat from bones, keeping meat in large pieces and reserving 
bones. Reserve meat on plate and cover. Return bones to pan and stir. Continue 
baking until onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Discard cinnamon stick and 
bones. 
</P>
<P>
 Add tomato sauce, oregano and boiling water to pan. Season well to taste with 
salt and pepper. Stir in orzo. Bake 20 minutes without stirring. Set meat 
pieces on top in 1 layer and press gently into mixture. Bake until orzo is 
tender but firm to bite and meat is done to taste, 10 minutes. Sprinkle with 
parsley. Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

EASTER ; BEYOND CHOCOLATE BUNNIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though Easter is usually celebrated in the United States with an endless 
stream of chocolate bunnies and jelly beans, there are many other traditions 
associated with the holiday.  
</P>
<P>
 Greek and Roman festivals -- ancient antecedents of the feast that celebrates 
Christ's return to life after His Crucifixion and death -- celebrated the 
passage of winter into the rebirth of spring and have common points with Easter 
as well as Passover. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth of spring and its fertile promise of the long and prosperous 
season ahead is well illustrated by the Sicilian Easter wreath. Its round shape 
signifies the continuous passage of the seasons through the year -- in fact, 
the four eggs that decorate it probably stand for the seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The eggs, of course, symbolize fertility and the replenishing of the earth 
with animals as well as plants after the dreary winter months. The promise of 
the harvest to come is seen in the Swiss rice tart; throughout Europe, Easter 
pastries are filled with grains. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Naples, wheat berries are used for a similar tart, the grain in all of 
these pastries symbolizing the potential of birth and growth inherent in the 
seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Though of more recent origin, chocolate is associated with Easter almost as 
much as it is with Valentine's Day. The association probably came about when 
chocolate became more available at the end of the 19th Century and 
confectioners vied with each other to produce elaborate molded chocolates in 
the shape of eggs and rabbits -- more symbols of fertility. 
</P>
<P>
 Chocolate souffle roll is based on a famous recipe originally introduced to 
the United States by Dione Lucas. Famous as one of the original television 
cooks in the early '50s, Lucas introduced many homey French recipes, such as 
this roll, to her audience. The recipe is equally associated with James Beard, 
who popularized it.

 Wreath can be assembled completely and refrigerated up to one day before 
baking. Bake the wreath on the day you plan to serve it.  
</P>
<P>
 SICILIAN EASTER WREATH 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 4 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup cool unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 unpeeled hard-boiled eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Colored sugar sprinkles or chopped almonds 
</P>
<P>
 Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour, granulated sugar, salt and baking powder in bowl and stir well 
to mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Whisk together 3 eggs, vanilla and orange and lemon zests in separate bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut butter into 1/2-inch pieces and add to dry ingredients. Using fingertips 
or pastry blender, rub in butter until mixture is fine and sandy (cool and 
powdery, not sticky). Stir in egg-zest mixture with fork and continue stirring 
until mixture holds together. Remove dough to lightly floured work surface. 
Knead lightly until smooth, about 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 To form wreath, roll 3/4 of dough into 24-inch cylinder. Arrange on parchment 
paper- or foil-lined baking sheet, making circle about 8 inches in diameter. 
Press ends together to adhere. Beat remaining egg and dash salt to make egg 
wash, and brush surface with egg wash. Position hard-boiled eggs on top, 
equidistant from each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll remaining dough into thin cylinder. Cut into 8 pieces. Roll each piece 3 
1/2 inches long. Criss-cross 2 pieces over each egg, forming X. Adhere ends of 
dough to wreath on either side of eggs. Carefully brush criss-cross strips with 
egg wash. Sprinkle entire wreath with colored sugar sprinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake on middle oven rack at 350 degrees until golden and firm, about 30 
minutes. Cool wreath on pan. Before serving, lightly dust top with powdered 
sugar. Slide wreath onto serving platter to use as Easter centerpiece. To 
serve, cut into thin vertical slices. (Eggs will be somewhat overcooked -- they 
are really decoration and not meant to be eaten.) Makes about 8 servings.

 Spanakopita , or spinach pie, is one of the most delightful Greek uses of filo 
dough. Unfortunately, the traditional recipe calls for brushing each sheet of 
filo with butter. For this low-fat version, we spray them with butter-flavored 
non-stick cooking spray instead. A little real butter is brushed on the top 
layer of the pie for flavor, but even that can be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The base for the spinach filling is a nonfat "cream" sauce -- a light paste of 
flour and nonfat milk stirred into hot nonfat milk and enriched with egg 
substitute. Nonfat cottage cheese and crumbled feta, which is lower in fat than 
most cheeses, give the sauce a nice tang. 
</P>
<P>
 It's assumed you'll be using store-bought filo rather than making your own, 
but you'll get better results if you use fresh filo from a Middle Eastern or 
Greek market rather than the frozen filo available at supermarkets. SPANAKOPITA 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sliced green onions 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup snipped dill weed 
</P>
<P>
 2 (10-ounce) packages frozen chopped spinach, thawed 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 cups nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup nonfat egg substitute (equivalent to 4 eggs) 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups nonfat cottage cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup crumbled feta cheese 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon white pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 9 sheets filo dough 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in skillet. Add onions and dill and saute until tender.  
</P>
<P>
 Squeeze excess water from spinach. Add spinach to skillet and saute until hot. 
Keep warm while preparing cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine flour and salt in mixing bowl. Add just enough milk to make thin 
paste, about 3/4 cup. Put remaining milk in saucepan and bring to boil. Stir in 
flour-and-milk paste. Return to boil and cook, stirring constantly, until just 
thickened.  
</P>
<P>
 Mix small amount of boiling sauce into egg substitute to temper. Add tempered 
egg substitute to saucepan. Heat and stir until slightly thickened. Stir in 
cottage and feta cheeses, white pepper and baking powder. Stir in spinach 
mixture. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange 3 sheets filo dough, each sprayed with butter-flavored non-stick 
cooking spray, in 13x9-inch baking pan sprayed with butter-flavored non-stick 
cooking spray. Spoon 1/2 of creamed spinach mixture into pan. Repeat with 3 
more sheets sprayed filo and remaining creamed spinach. Trim off excess filo 
around edges. Arrange 2 sheets filo dough on top spinach layer and spray each 
with butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray. Top with last sheet filo dough. 
Tuck all sides into dish. Brush top with butter. Bake at 325 degrees until 
lightly browned on top, 45 to 60 minutes. Makes 12 servings.

A BONE TO PICK OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Easter ham and the Thanksgiving turkey have little in common 
nutritionally, but from my gastronomic point of view they have one great 
similarity: Both are much more interesting as leftovers than they are in their 
original forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Ham, especially, is hard to take as a mighty slab but wonderful as a 
seasoning. From chunks that go with pasta and peas to the ham bone in the bean 
soup, just a little bit is enough to alert the taste buds: meat in here, full 
meal.  
</P>
<P>
 No other protein except maybe cheese has a wider range of comfortable 
companions. Just saute some diced ham with onions or garlic and add (with or 
without a splash of cream) to any of the cole crops (cabbage, kohlrabi, 
broccoli, cauliflower or broccoli raab), to potatoes or sweet potatoes, peas, 
beans, peppers, mushrooms, rice or noodles or scrambled eggs, green salad, 
grilled apples . . . . Assuming you don't try chocolate sauce, you can't miss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To get the most mileage from a roast ham, start with a serious piece of meat. 
It needn't be a long-cured, super-salty country type; what matters is that it 
be a leg of pork that contains no more brine than necessary for curing, and 
that it has been really and truly smoked -- smoked in a smokehouse, not just 
painted with smoke flavor. Inconvenient though it may be, ham with bone in has 
more flavor than boneless ham, but since you want the bone anyway. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Spicy, aromatic and filling without being heavy, these fritters need only a 
green salad to make a meal. They're called fritters mostly because I can't bear 
to call them patties; don't expect anything but the very edges to be crisp.  
</P>
<P>
 HOT STUFF HAM FRITTERS WITH PARSNIPS AND CARROTS 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound carrots 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound parsnips 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-inch) chunk ginger root, peeled 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 1/2 cups cooked ham, chopped into small pieces 
</P>
<P>
 1 long green chile, not seeded, thinly sliced crosswise 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Rendered ham fat or vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 Red pepper flakes, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon wedges 
</P>
<P>
 Peel carrots and parsnips. Then shred on large holes of grater or in food 
processor. Shred ginger on small holes of grater or in food processor. In bowl 
combine carrots, parsnips and ginger with onion, ham and chile. Mix thoroughly. 
Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Place flour, baking powder and nutmeg in small bowl and mix thoroughly. Stir 
flour mixture into vegetable-ham mixture. Mix in 2 eggs. Mixture should hold 
together when lifted by spoonful. If shreds come apart, add third egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Put bit of rendered ham fat in small skillet over medium-high heat. Make 1 
(1-tablespoon-sized) test fritter and brown on both sides in skillet. Taste 
fritter, it should have spicy zing. Add red pepper flakes to batter, if more 
heat is desired.  
</P>
<P>
 At serving time, heat generous film of ham fat in wide, heavy skillet over 
medium-high heat. When fat just starts smoking, drop ham mixture into pan, 
allowing about 1/3 cup per fritter, and keeping fritters well separated. 
Flatten fritters with spatula to about 1/3-inch thick. Fry, turning once, until 
both sides are well browned, about 3 minutes per side. 
</P>
<P>
 Transfer finished fritters to paper towel-lined baking sheet. Keep warm in 
200-degree oven while frying second batch. Serve immediately, with lemon wedges 
on side. Makes 12 fritters, 4 to 6 servings.  
</P>

 These are moister than regular biscuits, less crisp but better keepers. Serve 
with chowder for supper, with eggs for breakfast -- or all by themselves, split

<P>
 SWEET POTATO BISCUITS WITH HAM AND SESAME 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup mashed cooked sweet potato 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup butter, melted 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup cake flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon baking powder 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cups cooked ham, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup sesame seeds 
</P>
<P>
 Butter 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl beat together sweet potato, melted butter and milk. Set aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine cake flour, all-purpose flour, baking powder and salt in wide, shallow 
mixing bowl. Stir with wire whip until thoroughly mixed. Stir in ham. 
</P>
<P>
 Using as few strokes as possible, stir sweet potato mixture into dry 
ingredients. Dough should be soft and slightly sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle work surface with sesame seeds, covering area about 1 foot square. 
Turn dough onto prepared surface, sprinkle top with sesame seeds and pat out 
into rough square about 9 inches on each side and 1/2-inch thick. Add seeds as 
necessary to keep fingertips from sticking. 
</P>
<P>
 Using sharp knife dipped in flour, cut dough into squares. Transfer squares to 
generously buttered baking sheet, placing squares at least 2 inches apart. Bake 
at 450 degrees 20 minutes or until well browned. Cool squares on wire racks, if 
biscuits won't be eaten right away. Makes 16 biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Each biscuit contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 103 calories; 210 mg sodium; 11 mg cholesterol; 5 grams fat; 11 grams 
carbohydrates; 3 grams protein; 0.22 grams fiber.

GOOD COOKING; HAM: GOOD TO THE LAST DROP

 If you've got the time, you can easily make a rich soup stock from a ham bone 
(or a ham hock, for that matter) plus beef bones, vegetables, flavorings and 
water. Once the stock has simmered about eight hours (no attention is needed -- 
it can even cook overnight, since it barely simmers), the bones and flavorings 
are discarded and the vegetables are pureed right into the liquid. To say the 
least, this full-bodied brew makes soups that warm the heart, especially in 
damp weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the following soup recipes use a rich ham-based soup stock as a base. The 
lentil soup is straightforward, since the lentils do not require pre-soaking or 
precooking. The simple herb-and-vegetable flavoring makes for a most satisfying 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The black bean soup is even quicker, since it calls for the shortcut of canned 
black beans. With a garnish of a lime slice and cilantro, the soup looks as 
appealing as it tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since ham bones can be frozen, you can either make the stock and freeze it, or 
freeze the bones and make the stock at your leisure. Whichever you do, be sure 
to have the butcher cut the ham bone into chunks so it fits easily into the 
soup pot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, no salt is added to stock while it is being made. You can add salt 
to taste to the dish made from the stock. Remember, this stock is made with a 
ham bone, which contains salt, so restraint should be in order. RICH SOUP STOCK 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 large Spanish onions, sliced 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 large leek, rinsed, coarsely cut 
</P>
<P>
 2 large celery ribs 
</P>
<P>
 2 large carrots 
</P>
<P>
 2 bay leaves 
</P>
<P>
 2 whole cloves 
</P>
<P>
 1 ham bone or ham hock, cut into chunks 
</P>
<P>
 2 pounds beef bones 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1 gallon water 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 5- to 6-quart stockpot over medium-high heat. Add onions, garlic, 
leek, celery, carrots, bay leaves and cloves. Cook, stirring often, until 
onions are tender, about 4 minutes. Add ham bone and beef bones. Cook 4 minutes 
more, stirring often. Add pepper and water. Bring to boil. 
</P>
<P>
 Once boiling, reduce heat, skim surface and simmer, partially covered, about 8 
hours. Remove from heat.  
</P>
<P>
 Let stand until cool enough to handle. Discard bones, bay leaves and cloves. 
Strain solids from liquid, reserving both. Puree solids until smooth in blender 
or processor fitted with metal blade. Stir puree back into liquid.  
</P>
<P>
 Stock can be refrigerated 2 days or frozen as long as 3 months. Freeze in 
practical-size portions for cooking. Makes about 4 quarts.

 As simple as lentil soups are, they always elicit an enthusiastic reaction. 
What separates this lentil soup from others is the rich soup stock.  
</P>
<P>
 LENTIL SOUP 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium carrots, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 large stalk celery, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup lentils, sorted and rinsed 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons dried thyme leaves 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 cups Rich Soup Stock 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon tomato paste 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons minced parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 2-quart saucepan over medium-high heat. Add onion, garlic, carrots 
and celery. Cook, stirring often, until onion is tender, about 4 minutes. Add 
lentils, thyme, cumin, 4 cups stock and tomato paste. Bring to boil. Stir well. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduce heat and simmer, covered, until lentils are tender but not completely

KING SAYS HE'S NOT GUILTY OF ROBBERY COUNT ON HIS RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA DEUTSCH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King wrapped up 2 1/2 days on the witness stand in his lawsuit 
against the city of Los Angeles on Wednesday, telling jurors he was wrongly 
sent to prison for robbery before his beating at the hands of police thrust him 
into the national spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 He said all he did to merit the conviction was throw pies at a store owner. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you pleaded guilty, served two years in prison and three years of parole 
for throwing pies?" asked defense attorney Michael Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I was convicted of," said King, who insisted that he pleaded 
guilty to robbery because he could not afford a lawyer to counter the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 King is seeking $9.5 million in damages stemming from the videotaped beating 
by police on March 3, 1991. He is expected to return to the stand in the 
trial's second phase when the jury will be asked to assess punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 On the stand, King came under attack from defense attorneys, who suggested he 
doctored his account of the beating to increase his chances of a big award. He 
was also questioned about his criminal record. 
</P>
<P>
 King was on probation for armed robbery when he was stopped for speeding and 
beaten by four Los Angeles police officers. He has had four run-ins with the 
law since. No charges were filed in three of the cases. 
</P>
<P>
 King was placed on three years probation in January for a misdemeanor drunk 
driving conviction. The judge also ordered him to attend education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by his lawyer, Milton Grimes, King said he pleaded guilty to 
robbery and went to prison in 1989 because he could not afford a lawyer to 
contest the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was accused of robbing and assaulting a grocer with a tire iron, 
he said he was blameless. He said the grocer refused to take his $5 in food 
stamps and attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy came toward me with a tire iron," King said. "I picked up some pies 
from the pie rack and threw them at him to slow him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone represented former Officer Laurence M. Powell, one of the four officers 
originally charged in the beating and one of two convicted in federal court of 
violating King's civil rights. Former police Sgt. Stacey C. Koon also was 
convicted in federal court. They are serving 30-month sentences in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone suggested that King had grabbed checks and cash out of the grocer's 
till. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I did not," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And didn't you take a tire iron out of your pants and hit him?" Stone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I did not," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You threw pies?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I did," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, Koon and former Officers Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind were 
acquitted of nearly all assault charges in a state criminal trial, touching off 
three days of riots in Los Angeles. Briseno and Wind were acquitted in the 
federal trial.

 The star of bus stops: Steve Mozena thinks he has something in common with 
such giants as Abe Lincoln, Tom Edison, Christopher Columbus, and Ike and Tina 
Turner -- mainly, his life has inspired a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, Only in L.A. (Column to the Un-Stars) mentioned that 
Mozena, an aspiring actor, had been trying to get his big break in Hollywood by 
taking out self-advertisements on bus benches. 
</P>
<P>
 You can imagine Mozena's excitement when he later heard that director Barry 
Levinson was making a movie about an aspiring actor who takes out 
self-advertisements on bus benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a couple of problems. First, the main character (as well as the movie) is 
named "Jimmy Hollywood." And it stars Joe Pesci. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second disappointment Mozena has had in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also somehow overlooked for a role in the Richard Gere movie, 
"Intersection." 
</P>

 Surprise guest -- Mother Nature!The pledge pitches of KCET (Channel 28) 
generally don't make for the most exciting moments on television. But during a 
recent campaign, spokesman Julio Martinez noted, "it was almost as if we called 
the heavens to reinforce our message."  
</P>
<P>
 KCET was broadcasting "Quick Fixes, Quake-Safe" when a 5.3 aftershock struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, retired firefighter Henry Robinson, the host of "Surviving the 
Big One," another quake program, just happened to be in the studio. He calmed 
down everyone, including the unheralded volunteers working the phones. Then 
listeners were reminded that if they made a $100 pledge, they could obtain the 
two quake programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phones," Martinez said, "were really ringing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Nature had the good manners not to knock out telephone service.

<P>
 He wanted to be outta there: With baseball season here, it's an appropriate 
time to honor the ingenuity of the late Bob Kelley, one of L.A.'s pioneer radio 
sportscasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley used to re-create the road games of the minor league Los Angeles Angels 
from the studio at KMPC. He would obtain the play-by-play from Western Union 
and call the game as though he were there, using various sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Sundays, he had a double-header and had to work alone," recalled KMPC 
sportscaster Jim Healy. "Between games they'd throw in a deejay play some music 
and he'd go out to the local bar, the Hucksters, to have a few." 
</P>
<P>
 One Sunday in the early-1950s, the Angels were playing in Portland's ancient 
Multnomah Stadium. "Kelley came back to the KMPC studio for the second game and 
he felt the call of nature -- really bad," Healy said. "But he couldn't leave 
because there was no one to take his place."  
</P>
<P>
 It was, after all, the era of live radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there, but I was a writer and didn't have any broadcasting experience," 
Healy continued. "Finally, he picked up a metal waste basket and in a few 
moments he said, 'Uh-oh, folks. It's starting to rain. I think you can hear it 
coming down on this old tin roof.' " miscelLAny:

HELMUT KOHL

<TEXT>
<P>
 So, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's aide apparently feels that France and its World 
War II allies should stop celebrating their victory over Germany because it 
occurred 50 years ago (March 18). He says, "How long will they be celebrating 
this? A hundred years? Two hundred? Or is this the end?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, my friend, the United States has been celebrating its victory over 
England for over 200 years (did you ever hear of the 4th of July holiday?) and 
there don't seem to be any big problems between these two countries. Could it 
be that you have a guilty conscience? Granted, the American Revolution and 
World War II are not comparable, but if we want to keep reminding the world 
(and especially the young children) that there should never be another maniac 
like Hitler, who are you to keep us from this task?

 Perhaps The Times overlooked one of the great events of World War II ("WWII 
Remembrances"). I refer to the June 4, 1944, capture of Rome by Gen. Mark W. 
Clark's Fifth Army. Two months earlier, on April 11, an offensive was begun 
from the battle line about 30 miles north of Naples where the Allied forces had 
been bogged down all winter. The heaviest artillery barrage in all military 
history up to that time was laid down, starting at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern England, hundreds of thousands of British, Canadian and American 
forces awaited the signal from Gen. Dwight Eisenhower to launch the invasion of 
northern France. A few hours before the "go" decision was made, news spread 
throughout southern England, giving great encouragement to the waiting invasion 
forces, "Rome is ours!"

JOHN WAYNE GACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article on John Wayne Gacy (March 22) points out clearly what is wrong 
with our justice and prison systems. Although Gacy has been convicted of the 
worst series of murders in U.S. history and sentenced to death, he has been 
housed at taxpayer expense for 14 years.And what punishment has occurred? He 
arises at 10 a.m., gets 100 fan letters a week, paints and plays games. He is 
now considering which tabloid to be interviewed by. Where is the justice in 
that? If he wants to paint clowns, let him make toys for disabled children!  
</P>
<P>
 Prisoners should have to work for their keep, whether it be in the fields, on 
roads, making license plates or crafting items for the disadvantaged. Why are 
prisoners able to give interviews from jail? If they do, the profits should go 
directly to their upkeep and to the victims' families. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of sounding old-fashioned, I believe that prison should be a 
punishment for a crime. In the case of psychopaths like Gacy, many, many 
crimes.

 Re the Gacy art horrorfest: I wonder if any local, state or federal tax monies 
were expended in any way directly or indirectly to underwrite Gacy's so-called 
art and writings? Someone should conduct an audit to determine where the money 
for his supplies and art space came from. Once more I am disgusted that any one 
would display this homicidal pedophile terrorist's "art."

ARE GUNS SAFER THAN CARS?; OF COURSE NOT, AND THAT'S WHY THE NEW TEST AND 
INSTRUCTIONS ARE JUSTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guns kill people. So when it comes to gun ownership, experience teaches that 
what you don't know about handling and storing firearms can have lethal 
consequences -- especially with children around. That certainly was 
heartbreakingly so when a 7-year-old Long Beach boy was accidentally shot to 
death last year by a playmate who found his father's handgun lying unattended 
on a sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, with 210 million firearms in circulation nationally -- and by 
some estimates more than 10 million guns here in California -- the toll from 
accidental deaths undoubtedly will continue to mount. But beginning Friday, 
individuals who purchase a handgun in California will be required first to take 
a brief course in the safe handling and storage of their firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, the first of its kind in the nation, was passed in 1991 in large part 
because of the heroic effort, in the face of hostile political fire, by 
Assemblyman Rusty Areias (D-San Jose), himself a gun owner and hunter. The law 
is aimed at averting killings that occur because of lack of knowledge about 
basic gun safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun buyers now must earn safety certification from the California 
Department of Justice by passing a written multiple-choice test or watching a 
two-hour instructional video at the gun store. One can also be certified by 
taking safety classes with a police department. The test costs $10. Current and 
former law enforcement officials, active-duty and former military personnel, 
licensed hunters and holders of concealed-weapons permits are exempt from the 
requirement.  
</P>
<P>
 California once was far in front on the gun issue, having passed the safety 
certification law and requiring a 15-day wait for handgun purchasers. Those 
regulations stand as models of sensibility in a nation riddled by gunfire and 
reluctant to combat it. But courage has been in short supply recently, as 
legislators have failed so far to enact a ban on high-volume ammunition clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Individually, gun laws, like safety certification, have a limited effect. Yet 
collectively these laws save many lives. What the State of California is 
asking, after all, is less than it asks of those who want a driver's license.

WHEN SCIENCE LIES TO THE PUBLIC; NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE OUSTS TOP RESEARCHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing disclosures of scientific misconduct in an international study of 
breast cancer shake confidence in the medical research Establishment. And they 
are profoundly upsetting to millions of women and their doctors who have relied 
on the two-decade-long study's key, and very welcome, conclusion: that early 
cancer can be just as effectively treated by a lumpectomy and radiation as by a 
full mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cancer Institute, which funds the study, has assured the public 
that the falsifications do not alter the central findings and that such therapy 
remains valid. But the NCI took extraordinary action Tuesday by forcing the 
ouster of Dr. Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh as coordinator of 
14 major cancer studies involving tens of thousands of patients in the United 
States and Canada. It also ordered a temporary halt to enrolling new subjects 
in the studies, which include trials of tamoxifen, a new drug considered to 
have high promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month it was disclosed that a researcher at St. Luc Hospital in 
Montreal, Dr. Roger Poisson, had altered background data on 100 women in the 
original breast cancer study. Then Monday came another jolt: that a 
"discrepancy" had been found in files of another Montreal hospital in the 
study, St. Mary's, and that the dossiers of all 200 subjects there were being 
audited. In both cases, the NCI said that Fisher, 75, a pioneer in cancer 
research, and his staff had been sluggish in following up on the reported 
falsifications and in publishing corrected data. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheating in research is not new and, by its nature, is hard to detect. But 
modern pressures for results and publication to justify more grants have 
encouraged it. Poisson, for example, altered dates on which women's cancers 
were detected to meet the required number of women called for in the study. 
Scientists say dishonesty is rare, but there is evidence that too-trusting 
hospitals, universities and government agencies have been lax in detecting 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficulties compound when it comes to broad cooperative studies like the NCI 
one, which involved more than 5,000 researchers at nearly 500 hospitals in two 
countries. How many other similar studies have been compromised over the years? 
How many drugs and other therapies in use today are based on at least partly 
flawed data? How can researchers be better audited? 
</P>
<P>
 Those are difficult questions that leaders of the National Institutes of 
Health must ponder when they analyze the tainted breast cancer research. So 
must Rep. John D. Dingell of Michigan when he holds hearings April 13. Let not 
politics interfere with science, but let not science interfere with truth.

ENVIRONMENT WATCH; BEACH PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some may have laughed when the Surfrider Foundation took to the waves almost 
10 years ago: Was it possible, really, that happy-go-lucky surfers could do 
much to clean up California's coastal waters? Happily, the answer is yes; 
surfers aren't just beach bums with boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente-based foundation claims 27,000 members in seven states, many 
of them surfers whose sun-bleached hair is turning gray.Its 
environmental-issues team has testified before Congress, and it has launched a 
program to recruit high school students to test ocean waters for bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the group's major successes came when it joined with the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency to win a settlement against two pulp mills in 
Humboldt County. The mills were ordered to spend $50 million to reduce toxic 
discharges into water near Eureka and were fined $5.8 million. Unfortunately, 
that victory led to internal quarrels over the division of $500,000 in legal 
fees awarded to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, $350,000 is marked for Surf- rider to make environmental 
improvements in Humboldt. The foundation, which appears to have put its 
in-house difficulties behind it, should make those improvements soon. Its 
members, who know well the dangers facing one of the state's major resources, 
have proven to be a key asset in helping to make coastal waters a bit bluer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfrider Foundation began as an attempt to spruce up the image of 
surfers. It has done that and more, and should keep up the good work while 
catching the curl.

KNOCK NOT THY NEIGHBOR; L.A. AND ORANGE COUNTIES MUST BE A TEAM, NOT GO 
SEPARATE WAYS ON TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Southern Californians schooled in the nuances of our region's varied 
landscapes and mind-sets, Orange County and Los Angeles may seem light-years 
apart at times. But to visitors from around the nation and abroad, this is not 
necessarily so. For them, all Southern California is likely to be one big "L.A. 
Story," and from afar it has a coherence, even today when sunny images of 
Hollywood and Disneyland seem all too frequently to give way to morbid 
projections of life on the brink of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County leaders and tourism industry officials have been giving some 
thought lately to how they might position the county to lure visitors, even in 
the face of all the far-reaching depictions of the region's earthquakes, fires 
and other horrors. They are planning to hold a tourism summit, and 
understandably they are interested in featuring Orange County as a safe 
destination. Some also are tempted to go a step farther and say, as a few 
indeed have, that Orange County should separate itself completely from Los 
Angeles as a tourist destination. The latest from the realm of the unthinkable, 
the murder of two Japanese students during a carjacking in San Pedro, was 
especially compelling because the Japanese tourist is so vital to tourism here. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, we are one region for better or worse, in sickness and in 
health, in times of balmy sunshine and in times of rattled nerves. Orange 
County developed as an attractive suburb -- in many ways a psychological 
alternative to Los Angeles, and a geographically handy one at that. 
Increasingly, however, the evidence has been of the two counties' interrelated 
destinies, not of their independence and isolation. Moreover, what happened 
outside a supermarket in a "safe" area of San Pedro no longer can be considered 
an impossibility in "safe" Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to see how the idea of deliberately distancing Orange County 
from Los Angeles may tempt some tourism interests. But an 
Orange-County-versus-L.A.-County strategy is not a wise course when the 
fortunes of both areas in fact are linked.

ASSASSINATION OF COLOSIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The death of Luis Donaldo Colosio (March 24) has left many people bereft. 
Many will miss him. Many questions will remain forever unanswered: Why was he 
murdered, could he have won this year's presidential elections, what direction 
would Mexico's political turmoil have taken? 
</P>
<P>
 Colosio, an active member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) since 
a teen-ager, was to head Mexico into the 21st Century, continuing the party's 
six-decade rule over Mexico (a party which has been described by intellectuals 
as the longest dictatorship of modern times -- an authoritarian reign involved 
in political scandals, fraudulent elections, student and Indian 
assassinations). However, as of Jan. 1, the chance of Colosio trailing the 
footsteps of President Salinas' rule over Mexico was seriously jeopardized by 
two powerful reasons: the loss of control over some sectors of the population 
brought about by the uprising of the Zapatistas, who demanded, among other 
things, reformation of the electoral code; and the surge of Manuel Camacho 
Solis as a possible presidential contender.  
</P>
<P>
 The PRI has now picked a new candidate behind which it can stand as a single 
force (March 30). The media, mostly controlled by the government, will surely 
back its new presidential candidate and take advantage of the people's mourning 
to vote for the PRI "in the memory of Colosio." At stake is the PRI's 
survivability and control over government. A vote against the system would 
signify an important setback for the impressive economic transformations that 
Mexico has achieved during Salinas' term in office. It would signify a blow for 
the Mexican economy and to NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not be misled by party propaganda that takes advantage of a sad 
situation to manipulate public opinion for its own interest. Let us just 
remember Luis Donaldo Colosio as a dedicated person who worked long and hard 
for what he believed in, and who will be missed by his family and friends, but 
not as a martyr or a hero.

 * I am a Filipino and extremely sad and irate over the assassination of 
Colosio. Having the grass-roots' concerns at heart, he perilously campaigned 
within Tijuana's environs his future plans for the common man. Colosio should 
have been afforded tight security in the midst of that unpredictable throng. 
One man's brain snapped, and the irreparable consequence: the untimely loss of 
a man, regardless of party affiliation, who could have made a difference in the 
political arena of Mexico.

 * In "Gunman Claims He Only Tried to Wound Colosio" (March 26), there is a 
peculiar statement about the alleged assassin, Mexican citizen Mario Aburto 
Martinez: "Strangely, he was also registered to vote in California -- even 
though non-citizens are barred from voting." 
</P>
<P>
 The peculiarity of the statement is that The Times should find it strange that 
the man was registered to vote in California. Who doesn't know that our 
politicians have long wooed votes, no matter how illegitimate, with such 
gimmicks as "motor voter" laws, which have been added to other ploys to make 
registration even easier for non-eligible people.

PERSPECTIVE ON VIOLENCE; EXPLAINING AMERICA TO THE JAPANESE; CITIZENS, VISITORS 
SHARE THE SAME PERIL; THERE ARE NO 'ISLANDS' IN A FURIOUS WORLD.

appearing in the Tokyo daily Sankei Shimbun.

<TEXT>
<P>
 I grieve for Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito, gunned down in a Los Angeles 
carjacking, as I grieved for Yoshi Hattori and for Masakazu Kuriyama, who was 
shot to death at a BART train station in Concord last August -- all victims of 
the senseless violence and ready availability of guns so prevalent in the 
United States. Like Ambassador Walter Mondale, I, too, wish to apologize to the 
Japanese people. 
</P>
<P>
 But I would not say, as the ambassador did, that these killings should be 
viewed as rare occurrences, considering the 3 million Japanese tourists and 
50,000 students who come to this country every year. Of course, he is correct 
in a purely statistical sense. But this is like saying that Americans do not 
usually assassinate their presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Random violence in America is so widespread and common that even ordinary 
people take all sorts of precautions, and not only in major urban areas. Yoshi 
Hattori was shot in a residential neighborhood in Baton Rouge, La., by a man 
who said that he was afraid of crime -- who decided to shoot first and ask 
questions later. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the many ironies surrounding American lawlessness is that Hollywood 
films glorifying such violence are enormously popular all over the world, 
including Japan. I am thinking not merely of gangster films or detective 
stories, but of surrealistic films like "Robocop" and "The Terminator," 
drenched in mindless mayhem and gore. Matsuura and Ito were film enthusiasts 
and had come to Southern California to study filmmaking.  
</P>
<P>
 The United States has seen a lot of debate about whether violent films lead to 
violent (perhaps imitative) behavior, but there is great resistance in 
Hollywood to censoring or eliminating such violence altogether because it is 
too popular and brings in too much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, despite opinion polls that show a majority of U.S. citizens 
favoring some form of gun control, there is great resistance to actually 
passing such laws. Americans fought for their national freedom using guns, and 
many of them lived at least until the turn of this century (and a few, in areas 
like Alaska, still do) in places that had no police, where citizens themselves 
dealt with crime through "rough justice," much as the Samurai did in Kurosawa's 
famous film "Magnificent Seven." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the modern state disarmed the Samurai. The Japanese wonder why the 
United States could not imitate Japan in allowing only the police to be armed. 
But guns may not be the root of the problem. In a carefully reasoned article in 
the March issue of the Atlantic Monthly, law professor Daniel Polsby argues 
that gun ownership in the United States -- whether legal or illegal -- will 
decline only when enough criminals cease to find criminal behavior profitable 
and when ordinary citizens are no longer afraid of criminals. The underlying 
cause of crime, he argues, is not the prevalence of guns but the fact that "for 
certain people, predation is a rational occupational choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Japan, of course, has its own criminal underclass, but it tends to be 
organized by yakuza (Mafia-like families). There are even occasional "gang 
wars" and "shootouts" among such groups, although American police have 
discovered that yakuza killings often occur abroad (say, in Los Angeles or Las 
Vegas), where the chance of being caught is smaller. A year or so ago, when 
Angelenos were reproaching themselves for the death of yet another "innocent" 
Japanese tourist, it turned out to be a yakuza- ordered "hit" on a member of a 
rival gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Japan is unquestionably a much safer society than the United 
States. And the United States is probably safer than most of sub-Saharan 
Africa, Somalia, Colombia, Brazil, Mexico and perhaps Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In another very important Atlantic Monthly article (in the February issue), 
Robert Kaplan argues that crime, poverty, overpopulation, tribalism and disease 
will soon turn much of the underdeveloped world -- and perhaps even parts of 
the semideveloped world -- into ungovernable places where Thomas Hobbes' "war 
of everyone against everyone" prevails and all live in "continual fear and 
danger of violent death." In such a world, rich enclaves can attempt to wall 
themselves off. Kaplan evokes the image of a stretch limousine in which people 
like the Japanese may, for a time, navigate the dirty, dangerous and potholed 
streets of the rest of the world. But sooner or later the limousine will break 
down, or an envious and angry outsider will throw a rock through the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why ultimately I have to agree with Ambassador Mondale that the 
Japanese should not pull up the drawbridge and isolate themselves in their own 
country. It is worth remembering that the great poet John Donne, a contemporary 
of Hobbes in what was a period of great civil turmoil in England, wrote: "No 
man is an island, entire of itself. . . . And therefore never send to know for 
whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee."

ERNESTO ZEDILLO, PRESIDENT-IN-TRAINING; MEXICO: THE NEW CANDIDATE WILL BENEFIT 
FROM COLOSIO'S MARTYRDOM AURA, BUT ONLY IF HE CAN DEVELOP POLITICAL SAVVY TO 
MANAGE HIS FRACTIOUS PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico (ITAM) and a visiting scholar at 
USC.

<P>
 For all that is unknown -- and may never be known -- about the assassination 
of Luis Donaldo Colosio, it has revealed the Mexican political class at war 
with itself. The battle over the course of Mexico's future -- the choice of a 
successor to Colosio's candidacy -- lasted several days behind closed doors at 
Los Pinos, the presidential residence. The power struggle pitted President 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari against Colosio supporters, reformists against the 
old guard and, ultimately, the PRI against the PRI. While one faction supported 
Fernando Ortiz Arana, the emblematic "party man" and president of the PRI (the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party), hard-liners advocated the return of the 
emblematic "law and order man" and former minister of the interior, Fernando 
Gutierrez Barrios. 
</P>
<P>
 A weakened and overwhelmed Salinas finally prevailed, imposing his choice, the 
technocrat Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon, on a disgruntled, divided party. But 
the "Salinistas" have not yet won the war. Zedillo now faces the daunting task 
of constructing a base of support among the disputing factions, many of which 
vehemently opposed his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yale-trained economist is not without significant allies: Mexico's 
technocratic bureaucracy, the Clinton Administration, domestic and 
international investors, the middle class and members of the country's 
intelligentsia who believe that in an imperfect world, the dry and dull Zedillo 
represents a better option than a hellish descent into a Pinochet-style 
authoritarian regime. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps Zedillo's most powerful weapon is Colosio himself. Upon his death, 
Colosio has been endowed by Mexican public opinion with the noble attributes he 
seemed to lack while alive. Among friends and foes alike, Colosio has been 
reinvented as a democratic hero, sacrificed while defending liberty, justice 
and the pursuit of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo will attempt to seize the torch, further the Colosio cause and build 
on the political capital that martyrdom has so generously granted the PRI. 
Riding on Colosio's post-mortem popularity and the assured onslaught of public 
support for the ruling party, Zedillo will probably win the August presidential 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 This scenario, however, will become less plausible if Zedillo is not able to 
develop and effectively employ the political skills he now lacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Admired for his technical expertise, Zedillo has been faulted for his 
political ineptitude. With an eye on grooming him for higher office, Salinas 
placed Zedillo in sensitive positions, such as the Education Ministry, in order 
to test his political skills. Time and again, Zedillo proved that he did not 
have any. 
</P>
<P>
 His tenure as minister of education was clouded by controversy stemming from 
his rocky relationship with the powerful teachers' union and his attempt to 
institute new history books that mainstream academics found unacceptable. His 
next incarnation as Colosio's campaign manager further diminished his image, as 
pundits blamed him for the campaign's mediocrity and mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to survive as a candidate and as a president, Zedillo will have to 
reinvent himself as a savvy politician. 
</P>
<P>
 The power struggle within the PRI may subside until the election is over and a 
semblance of normalcy is temporarily restored throughout the country. 
Adversaries within the PRI will unite to assure the party's survival in a 
contested and internationally supervised election. But Zedillo's perceived 
weaknesses and the vacuum created by Colosio's death have opened up windows of 
opportunity for feuding factions. Dinosaurs and democrats, traditionalists and 
technocrats, members of the "old" PRI and militants of the "new" PRI will all 
try to claim Zedillo as one of their own and exploit his need for political 
expertise to further their agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Zedillo's well-known political alliance with Jose Cordoba, 
Salinas' controversial chief of staff (he was "reassigned" Wednesday), raises 
questions about his independence and whether the outgoing president will 
attempt to govern behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now at the helm of a leaky boat navigating through troubled waters, Zedillo 
must prove to the country and to his party that he can be a pilot and not 
merely a puppet.

THEATER REVIEW; ELABORATE DESIGN STEALS THE THUNDER IN 'GREASE'; THE LIGHTS AND 
SET TAKE CENTER STAGE IN TOMMY TUNE'S TOURING PRODUCTION, OVERSHADOWING THE 
CHOREOGRAPHY AND THE STARS.

 They've gone and made "Grease" pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 Count the Day-Glo colors. Admire the silhouettes of the actors and their 
props. Watch the play of lights and shadows as they swoop in for the finale of 
each number.  
</P>
<P>
 From the ads, you might surmise that Rosie O'Donnell is the star. Think again. 
In this touring production at Orange County Performing Arts Center, the stars 
are offstage. We're talking John Arnone on sets and Howell Binkley on lights. 
</P>
<P>
 We're also talking about Tommy Tune. This is billed as "the Tommy Tune 
production," though Tune's protege Jeff Calhoun gets the director-choreographer 
credit. As in the last big Tune show seen here, "The Will Rogers Follies," the 
tall Texan appears to have become obsessed with design at the expense of what 
we thought was his specialty, choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 You'd expect a Tune-supervised "Grease" to feature a prom dance contest to end 
prom dance contests. But this one is awfully perfunctory, stuck with a "Hand 
Jive" number that by definition focuses on the hands instead of the legs, just 
as a similar number did in "Will Rogers." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be difficult to make much more out of that number, however, because 
the room for dancing has been radically shrunk by two picture-frame proscenium 
arches, one inside the other. The outer frame is lavishly decorated with 
colorful '50s imagery. The smaller, plainer frame appears to be an effort to 
re-create the ambience of a high school auditorium stage -- not an altogether 
inappropriate choice, given the setting of "Grease" at Rydell High School. 
</P>
<P>
 These frames may serve an initial purpose, but they quickly become obstacles, 
cutting off too much of the back and sides of the stage. Any expectations that 
they'll be pulled back at some climactic moment are dashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course "Grease" has no real climaxes. The Jim Jacobs/Warren Casey book has 
no depth, and it might be argued that this shallow show belongs on a shallow 
stage. This might even make sense in this production's eventual home on 
Broadway. But in the larger Orange County hall, which lacks any compensatory 
intimacy unless you're in the first few rows, the combination of flat show and 
flat staging results in a flat experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to deny that designers Arnone and Binkley have created some 
striking imagery. Spinning tires and Hula-Hoops in a couple of the big numbers 
add circular energy to the pictures. The actors are skilled at their familiar 
caricatures. But generally everything remains stubbornly two-dimensional. It's 
more of a revue devoted to '50s nostalgia than a living, breathing musical. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Wood plays sweet Sandy, and Ricky Paull Goldin her summer flame Danny 
Zuko. Wood gets to sing an actual 1959 hit, "Since I Don't Have You," imported 
for this production, and pulls it off like a queen of the charts. A parental 
warning, in case you've somehow missed previous "Greases": We're supposed to 
enjoy Sandy's total capitulation to peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell's shtick is on target, though her singing voice doesn't sustain 
extended notes well. Sam Harris and Billy Porter make the most of their big 
solos; Porter's "Beauty School Dropout" gets a purposefully soulful arrangement 
and the show's most preposterous hairdos. As the school's one teacher, Marcia 
Lewis moves her voice between blowtorch and little-old-lady effects for maximum 
laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the actual show begins, Brian Bradley's deejay warms up the audience 
with a pre-show and cajoles a few audience members into dancing with him. 
</P>

TV REVIEW; 'TRAPS' PREMIERE: STRONG CAST, WEAK PLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cast is the most interesting element of "Traps," the CBS police series 
premiering tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the exotic pairing of Academy Award winner George C. Scott and Dan 
Cortese -- renowned for hosting "MTV Sports" and starring in Burger King 
commercials -- as the two protagonists.There's Piper Laurie as the 
Alzheimer's-stricken wife of Joseph Trapchek, Scott's veteran supercop who 
returns from retirement to help with "high-profile" cases. That means working 
alongside his resistant grandson, Cortese's long-haired Det. Chris Trapchek. 
And there's Lindsay Crouse's recurring cameo as the tough police commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott, Laurie and Crouse are a lot of talent to cram into a weekly hour. Yet 
nearly everything else about this uninvolving Stephen J. Cannell 
cops-getting-in-touch-with-their-feelings series is routine.  
</P>
<P>
 An exception is a scene that finds a squinting Scott bending over and talking 
to a corpse ("What were you doing in a downtown ally, wearing old clothes?") 
while Cortese and others watch in apparent awe. It's unclear whether it's 
Cortese's character or Cortese himself who's dumbstruck, having never been 
around an actor quite like Scott before. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, this is the kind of actor-homogenizing series that narrows the 
gap between the two performers, as grandfather Trapchek and grandson Trapchek 
tonight ultimately overcome their differences long enough to collaborate on 
pursuing the deadly "headlight killer." This low-beam mystery is eclipsed by 
the relentless verbalizing that comes from the script's heavy tilt toward 
relationships and sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we got are the people who love us," Chris' regular partner, Jack Cloud 
(Bill Nunn), tells him. It's this kind of gritty cop talk that may motivate you 
to switch channels.

 The cook is nervous, the dinner guests even more so. As the entree is cleared 
and thoughts turn toward dessert -- an interlude usually filled with pleasant 
anticipation -- blood pressures begins to rise. How high will it go? 
</P>
<P>
 Not the blood pressure -- the souffle. Will it fall? Collapse? Do we care? 
Couldn't we have a plain layer cake? Furtive glances at the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the cook dashes out (on tiptoe lest the floor shake), removes the 
souffle from the oven, tiptoes back and with lightning speed serves her 
creation while admonishing the hapless victims: "Eat quickly before it utterly 
disappears. You know how delicate souffles are . . . but aren't they worth it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In a word, no. Not that kind of souffle. Too delicate, too much anxiety, a 
test of stress management skills. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two types of classic hot fruit souffles. One is made with a base of 
starch-butter-egg yolks (high in saturated fat); the other is a simple fat-free 
blend of pureed fruit and meringue. If the latter is so clearly the more 
healthful, you ask, why isn't it the darling of low-fat bakers? It is too 
unreliable and fragile. The texture can vary from watery sludge to dry cotton 
foam, depending upon the weight, sweetness and moisture content of the fruit. 
These souffles have an unnerving tendency to collapse upon even the most 
experienced baker because while they lack fat, they also lack the stabilized 
starch base to support the fruited meringue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After countless experiments, I have devised a souffle that is utterly reliable 
and does not fall. For overcoming this long-known and greatly feared kitchen 
terror -- the falling souffle -- I should win a Nobel peace (or chemistry) 
prize. 
</P>
<P>
 My souffle is not only divine to behold and sublime to taste, it is quick and 
simple to make and based on classic techniques with a new twist. The first 
trick is to cook a fruit-flavored puree thickened and stabilized with 
cornstarch and sugar. This flavor base can be made ahead and refrigerated, but 
must be at room temperature before being blended (the only last-minute task) 
with stiffly beaten egg whites just before baking. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trick is to bake the souffle in a water bath, which guarantees 
gentle, even heat, a slow and steady rise, a creamy texture and a stable 
product. A traditional baking technique, it never fails. 
</P>
<P>
 The third trick is to use an instant-read thermometer to test the internal 
temperature of the souffle. Fruit souffles are perfectly baked when the 
thermometer inserted one inch from the rim reads 160 degrees, and 150 degrees 
at the center. (The souffle is hotter near the rim, so check both.) At this 
point the texture will be light and still moist, but does hold its shape. The 
center will be set but smooth and creamy, the edges slightly firmer and drier. 
Chocolate souffles bake slightly longer, until the temperature in the center is 
160 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When first taken from the oven, the souffle is puffed to its greatest height, 
and it should be presented and served right away. However, this souffle will 
not collapse seconds after it is taken from the oven, nor will it fall when you 
spoon out the first serving. It will sink about one inch, then hold its shape 
for two to six hours -- if there are leftovers. 
</P>
<P>

 A classic vanilla souffle, made with a cooked bechamel sauce base 
(flour-butter-yolks), using four to five whole eggs, receives approximately 45% 
calories from fat. Each serving packs a relatively minor 9 grams of fat but a 
huge 157 milligrams of cholesterol. A classic meringue/fruit souffle has the 
same amount of fat as it has dependability: none. My souffles are dependable, 
and with one exception, they contain virtually no fat. The one exception is 
this chocolate souffle because it contains a little solid chocolate, high in 
cocoa butter, which is a saturated fat.  
</P>
<P>
 The intense chocolate flavor of this souffle comes from cocoa and a small 
amount of grated unsweetened chocolate. Serve this for a dramatic finale at a 
dinner party, sprinkled with a few drops of coffee liqueur. This recipe makes a 
slightly large souffle because it is typically served as a party dessert, and I 
wanted it to have an exceptionally high rise.  
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE SOUFFLE 
</P>
<P>
 2/3 cup non-alkalized unsweetened cocoa powder 3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons 
granulated sugar 4 teaspoons cornstarch 1/8 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 cup 
nonfat milk 2 teaspoons vanilla 7 large egg whites, at room temperature Dash 
salt 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar 1/2 ounce unsweetened chocolate, grated 
Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare chocolate base, combine cocoa, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, cornstarch 
and cinnamon in heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepan. Whisk to blend well. 
Whisk in milk.  
</P>
<P>
 Set over medium heat and whisk constantly 5 to 7 minutes, until it begins to 
boil. Then boil, stirring, making sure to reach into corners, 1 minute, or 
until mixture is as thick as pudding and generously coats spoon. Remove from 
heat and stir in vanilla. Let cool to room temperature. (Base can be prepared 
ahead, covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated. Bring to room temperature 
before proceeding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange rack in lower 1/3 of oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Coat 2-quart 
(8-cup) souffle mold or 6 (1 1/2-cup) individual souffle dishes with 
butter-flavor no-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle bottom and sides with 2 
tablespoons granulated sugar. Tap out excess sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Whip egg whites with salt and cream of tartar until foamy in large, 
grease-free bowl using electric mixer on medium speed. Gradually add remaining 
1/2 cup granulated sugar and whip until whites are medium-stiff but not dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure chocolate base is at room temperature. Stir well. Fold about 1 cup 
whipped whites into chocolate mixture to lighten, using whisk. Sprinkle in 
grated chocolate and then fold chocolate mixture into remaining whites. Turn 
mixture into prepared molds and smooth tops with spatula. 
</P>
<P>
 Place molds in baking pan large enough to hold. Add hot water to come about 
1/3 of way up sides of molds. Bake until well risen and firm when lightly 
jiggled, about 35 to 40 minutes for large souffle (instant-read thermometer 
inserted near center should read about 160 degrees), or about 25 minutes for 
individual souffles. Remove from oven. Sift powdered sugar to taste over tops. 
Serve at once. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

 Ethereal in texture, bright-pink in color and delectable in taste, this fat- 
and cholesterol-free souffle can be made in any season because frozen 
raspberries work as well as fresh. The raspberry flavor of this souffle is 
intensified if you use either Chambord (a sweet raspberry liqueur) or Framboise 
(raspberry eau-de-vie).  
</P>
<P>
 RASPBERRY SOUFFLE 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/3 cups fresh raspberries or frozen unsweetened whole raspberries 5 
tablespoons granulated sugar plus extra for molds 1 1/2 teaspoons grated orange 
zest 1 tablespoon water 2 tablespoons cornstarch 2 1/2 tablespoons fresh lemon 
juice 2 tablespoons Chambord or Framboise 5 large egg whites, at room 
temperature 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar Dash salt Powdered sugar 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare raspberry base, combine 1 cup raspberries, 2 tablespoons granulated 
sugar, orange zest and water in heavy-bottomed non-reactive saucepan. Set over 
medium heat and bring to boil, stirring and mashing berries with wooden spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, dissolve cornstarch in lemon juice. Stir cornstarch mixture into 
raspberries and return to boil, stirring constantly. Then boil, stirring, about 
45 seconds, or until mixture is no longer cloudy and is as thick as preserves. 
Remove from heat. Stir in Chambord and remaining 1/3 cup whole raspberries. Let 
cool to room temperature. (Raspberry base can be made ahead, covered and 
refrigerated. Bring to room temperature before proceeding.) 
</P>
<P>
 Position rack in lower 1/3 of oven and preheat to 350 degrees. Coat 1 
1/2-quart (6-cup) souffle mold or 6 (1 1/2-cup) individual souffle molds with 
butter-flavor no-stick cooking spray. Sprinkle bottom and sides with sugar. Tap 
out excess sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine egg whites, cream of tartar and salt in large grease-free bowl. Using 
electric mixer on medium speed, whip until foamy. Gradually add remaining 3 
tablespoons sugar and whip until whites are medium-stiff but not dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Be sure raspberry base is at room temperature. Stir well. Fold about 1 cup 
whipped whites into raspberry base to lighten, using whisk, then fold mixture 
into remaining whites. Turn mixture into prepared souffle molds and smooth tops 
with spatula. 
</P>
<P>
 Place molds in roasting pan. Add hot water to come about 1/3 of way up sides 
of molds. Bake until well risen, medium-brown in color and fairly firm when 
lightly jiggled, about 35 minutes for large souffle (instant-read thermometer 
inserted in center should read about 150 degrees) or about 25 minutes for 
individual souffles. Remove from oven. Sift tops with powdered sugar to taste. 
Serve immediately. Makes 6 servings.

RISING INTEREST RATES SPUR A BROAD SELLOFF; MARKETS: INVESTMENT ADVISERS 
CONTINUE TO TURN BEARISH ON STOCKS. BOND YIELDS MAINTAIN THEIR UPWARD TREND.

 Few stocks escaped the broad selloff in the market Wednesday, as investors 
were spooked by rising interest rates and more big investment advisers turned 
bearish. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining shares swamped advances by a huge margin, and all indexes took huge 
hits. "This is about as ugly as it has been for a long, long time," said Bob 
Walberg, market analyst at MMS International. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four leading Wall Street firms have turned bearish, raising their 
cash levels to cut back on stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith Barney Shearson started the shift Tuesday with a boost in its 
recommended cash allocation to 25% from 15%, cutting stocks to 50% from 55% and 
bonds to 25% from 30%. Dean Witter Reynolds and NatWest Securities took similar 
actions Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Lehman Bros.' influential market analyst Elaine Garzarelli, who won a 
wide following after predicting the 1987 stock market crash, lowered her 
composite stock indicator to 47% from 57.5%, a level she said is considered 
neutral. A reading of 30% or under is viewed as a sell signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are translating that negative talking into negative action and 
doing some selling," said Marshall Acuff, portfolio strategist at Smith Barney 
Shearson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones average tumbled 72.27 points to 3,626.75, the lowest level since 
Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Selling is across the board, no company is escaping," said David Holt, 
director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues swamped advances by about 6 to 1 on the NYSE. Volume on the 
floor of the Big Board totaled an extremely heavy 390.52 million shares, up 
from 301.63 million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, 402 New York Stock Exchange stocks hit new lows for a 
52-week period, while only four issues reached new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
lost 6.93 to 445.55, while the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller issues, 
dropped 10.38 to 744.91. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield rose to 7.10% from Tuesday's 7.06%, 
while its prices sank 1/2 point, or $5 per $1,000 face value. Yields on 
short-term Treasury bills, however, receded slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term interest rates, used to set borrowing costs, are seen as the biggest 
culprit behind the recent market slide, which began after the Federal Reserve 
tightened credit on Feb. 4 for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend accelerated last week after the Fed raised interest rates for the 
second time. The fear is that the rising cost of credit will choke off the 
economic recovery and constrain profit growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling in the bond market was less intense than Tuesday's session because 
many participants refrained from trading while awaiting Friday's potentially 
market-moving employment report for March. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with many people keeping to the sidelines, the impact of each trade was 
magnified, making the bond market unusually volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, hedge fund managers who bought mortgage-backed securities with 
money borrowed from major bond firms are selling the securities instead of 
meeting demands to put up more money, traders said. In turn, the bond firms are 
selling Treasuries to offset the risk of owning more mortgage-backed 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills edged down to 3.54% as the discount went 
down 0.02 percentage point to 3.47%. Six-month yields declined to 3.90% as the 
discount dipped 0.05 point to 3.78%. One-year yields fell to 4.37% as the 
discount fell 0.01 point to 4.19%. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, yields on actively traded municipal bonds surged as much as 12 
basis points as higher interest rates continued to fuel concerns that mutual 
funds are dumping bonds to meet redemptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Express Scripts fell sharply for a second day, off 4 5/8 to 51 3/4. The 
company attributed the fall to general market conditions rather than 
fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oils stocks and cyclical stocks continued weak. Chevron fell 3 1/2 to 83 3/4 
and Texaco lost 1 1/4 to 63 1/8. Alcoa dropped 2 7/8 to 71 3/4, General Motors 
shed 1 3/4 to 54 1/4 and Caterpillar dropped 1 1/4 to 109 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some technology stocks, which led the market's decline earlier this week, 
were among the only share prices that gained ground. Microsoft rose 1 1/8 to 83 
5/8, while Lotus Development dropped 1/4 to 70 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Woolworth fell 1 to 17 after the it announced that it was investigating 
allegations of accounting irregularities and would restate its interim 
financial results for the fiscal year ended Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's weakness also sent stock prices tumbling overseas. Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng index plunged 247.93 points, or 2.62%, to 9,232.21, while in Tokyo 
the 225-share Nikkei average fell 149.83 points to 19,559.91. In London, the 
Financial Times 100-share average dropped 31 points to 3,092.4. Frankfurt's 
30-share average closed 20.82 points lower at 2,147.53. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended down 47.21 points, or 1.92%, at 2,410.38.

 The Clinton Administration is making it easier for U.S. companies to sell 
telecommunications and computer equipment abroad, including in China, Russia 
and other nations of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration said Wednesday that on Friday it will lift licensing 
requirements for numerous "low-level" items that could not be used for military 
advantage against the United States or its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy was announced by National Economic Council Chairman Robert 
Rubin and the Commerce Department. White House officials, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity, provided some additional details. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items that will be affected by relaxed rules are cellular mobile 
phones that can be used to send and receive calls over a wide geographic area, 
one White House official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another official said the Administration does not believe the new policy will 
hinder efforts to promote human rights reform in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's in U.S. interests" to promote the trade, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration said the relaxed rules will help U.S. companies to compete 
in a $150-billion global market. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies still would be barred from exporting to nations that the United 
States regards as supporting terrorism, including North Korea, Iran, Iraq, 
Libya and Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 "This licensing change will make our businesses more competitive abroad . . . 
while maintaining controls on items and technologies we consider to be 
sensitive for security and non-proliferation reasons," Commerce Secretary Ron 
Brown said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement was welcomed by some businesses. Business groups had 
expressed disappointment earlier this year when the Administration proposed 
changes in federal export licensing law, saying the reform did not go far 
enough.

MUTUAL FUND SALES DECLINE REFLECTS INFLATION CONCERN; INVESTING: TOTALS SHOW 
RECENT BOOM IS WANING. BANKS WILL LIKELY ATTRACT MORE OF SAVERS' MONEY.

 Sales of stock and bond and income mutual funds sank 15% in February from the 
previous month, the mutual fund industry's trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund sales fell to $48.1 billion from $56.9 billion in January, the Investment 
Company Institute reported. The February figure was 35% above the $35.6 billion 
in sales made in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures seemed to be further evidence that an almost continuous explosion 
in mutual funds over the last year or so won't last through 1994. Many small 
and institutional investors are more concerned about the economy and inflation 
than they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investors holding bank certificates of deposit won't be so quick 
to rush into equity and bond mutual funds as money-market interest rates rise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of stock mutual funds totaled $26.1 billion in February. That's 12% less 
than the $29.6 billion of January, and 76% above the $14.8 billion of February, 
1993. International funds, with sales of $6.2 billion, led all fund categories. 
</P>
<P>
 February sales of bond and income mutual funds totaled $22 billion. That's 19% 
less than the $27.2 billion of January and 5.8% more than the $20.8 billion in 
February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Total sales represent the value of new shares purchased, including reinvested 
dividends. Total sales numbers do not include exchanges from one fund to 
another within the same fund group. Nor do they account for redemptions of 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The new sales, excluding reinvested dividends, totaled $46.1 billion in 
February, down 15% from $54.1 billion in January and up 27% from $33.8 billion 
in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 New stock-fund sales were $26 billion, down 11% from $29.1 billion in January 
and up 77% from $14.7 billion in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond and income funds' new sales sank 20% to $20.1 billion from $25 
billion in January. The figure rose 4.7% from $19.2 billion in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Redemptions, or liquidations of shares by fund holders, totaled $26.2 billion 
in February, up 1.6% from $25.8 billion in January and up 7.2% from $15.2 
billion in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock fund redemptions slipped 4% to $11.7 billion in February, from $12.1 
billion in January. The latest figure rose 95% from $6 billion in February, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond and income fund redemptions advanced to $14.5 billion in February, up 
5.8% from $13.7 billion in January and up 58% from $9.2 billion in February, 
1993.

WESTSIDE WATCH: GUERRILLA SCULPTOR TAKES MYSTERY TO NEW HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica may have its own version of the Watts Towers. 
</P>
<P>
 About three weeks ago, three 20-foot wooden totems were mysteriously planted 
in a vacant lot near the corner of 17th Street and Colorado Avenue. Carved with 
intricate figurines and designs, they stand within a few feet of each other and 
look like ancient artifacts, looming conspicuously in an area often used to 
dump trash. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something different," said Henry Casio, a worker at a nearby glass 
company. "I've noticed a lot of people stopping and taking pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit of all this creativity is a 24-year-old guerrilla artist from 
Kentucky. His pseudonym: John Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been fascinated by mysterious ancient art structures such as 
Stonehenge, the Easter Island faces and the pyramids," said Arthur. "All those 
structures are timeless and there's no clue who put them there." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur has certainly caught the attention of the neighborhood. Residents, who 
refer to him as the "mystery sculptor," wonder where he will strike next. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the mystery and tradition of creating unsigned art work," he said. 
"And I do have plans for more." 
</P>

 CEREAL? THEY'LL PASS: Thud. There it was, the Sunday Times, wrapped in 
plastic, together with a special treat -- two sample boxes of cereal. 
</P>
<P>
 But on this, the first day of the weeklong festival of Passover, the package 
posed a problem for tradition-minded Westside Jews who had painstakingly 
followed the Biblical requirement to rid their homes of all bread and grain 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 "People had all sorts of ideas about what to do," said Rabbi Yitzhok 
Adlerstein, a faculty member at the Yeshiva of Los Angeles, a high school and 
adult education institute in the Pico-Robertson district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some said to save up the boxes and dump them on the city editor's desk in 
protest. Some said to burn the boxes, others said to burn the newspaper 
together with the boxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Another rabbi, unhappy with coverage of events in the Middle East, said the 
paper deserves to be burned even without the cereal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Adlerstein said, the consensus was to cover the boxes from sight, 
leave them on the porch or the front lawn until the first two days of the 
festival were over, then burn them or flush the contents down the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reaction I liked best, because it was mine, was that the Times should 
make sure that next weekend everybody gets two boxes of (rabbinically approved) 
Passover cereal," he said.

COUNCIL TO OPEN SHELTER FOR HOMELESS; SANTA MONICA: THE 6-0 VOTE IS AN ATTEMPT 
TO COMPLY WITH A STATE COURT RULING REQUIRING CITIES TO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE 
BEFORE BANNING SLEEPING IN PARKS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council has decided to open a temporary homeless shelter 
for more than 100 people as a prelude to evicting transients who live in the 
city's parks. 
</P>
<P>
 In its 6-0 vote Tuesday, the council acted on the advice of new City Atty. 
Marsha Jones Moutrie, who said such a shelter was needed to comply with a 
recent state Court of Appeal ruling. The ruling, in a Santa Ana case, says a 
city cannot legally ban sleeping in all public places without providing an 
alternative place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the site has not been selected, City Manager John Jalili recommended a 
city-owned building at 502 Colorado Ave. that houses a shower and locker 
facility for the homeless. Another site mentioned was city-owned property at 
Olympic Boulevard and 5th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members agreed to draft a plan within a month to open the makeshift 
shelter as soon as possible. But council members made it clear that the shelter 
will be opened on a temporary, trial basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm perfectly willing to abandon this approach if it becomes another horror 
story," Councilman Paul Rosenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Launching a counterpunch, attorneys for the National Lawyers Guild have 
informed the city that they will pursue a dormant lawsuit challenging Santa 
Monica's encampment law, which bans living in parks. That law has never been 
enforced pending the outcome of the Santa Ana case. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director James Lafferty said in an interview that opening a shelter 
is not enough to comply with the Santa Ana decision because once the shelter is 
filled, there will still be homeless people with no place to go. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break in the council meeting, Lafferty was accosted by several 
residents who were not receptive when he told them that in cracking down on the 
homeless, the city will be violating their constitutional rights. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, who refused to provide his name, yelled: "I'm not going to let them 
sleep in our parks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Lafferty replied, "I'm not going to let you not let them sleep in the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action was prompted by a series of proposals, offered last week 
by Council members Asha Greenberg and Robert T. Holbrook, who represent yet 
another effort by city leaders to address the city's homeless problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At a council meeting last week, residents accused the council of dereliction 
of duty, asserting that in not cracking down on the homeless, the city has 
failed to protect the public's health and safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Holbrook said that since last week's meeting, they have received 
about two dozen phone calls and letters supporting their efforts -- a response, 
they say, that reflects widespread dissatisfaction with the city's handling of 
homelessness. Although initially resistant to the proposals, the council 
majority elected on a rent control slate embraced most of them Tuesday. The 
exception was Mayor Judy Abdo, who was out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they read the public," Holbrook said. "Council members who play with 
this run the risk of losing their job." 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrook said it is "absolutely unacceptable" that one-third of all calls to 
police involve homeless-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 27 people, many of them homeless, wanted to speak about the issue 
Tuesday night, the council stuck with its prior decision not to reopen public 
testimony on the matter. Some, however, waited until after midnight to speak 
during the public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're demonizing the homeless people, criminalizing . . . everything they do 
to survive," said Marguerite Waller, a Santa Monica resident and university 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides ordering a new shelter, council members directed the city attorney to 
write a law prohibiting aggressive panhandling, which is already illegal under 
a vaguely worded state statute. They also agreed that Moutrie should research 
the legality of banning panhandling after dark and 24 hours a day on the Third 
Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new strategies under discussion include requiring a business license for 
groups that serve food in public parks and adjusting homeless services to 
emphasize long-term solutions rather than emergency help. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also voted to cooperate with the California Grocers Assn., which 
has included Santa Monica in a program to retrieve stolen shopping carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in a finding that appears to contradict earlier estimates that 
thousands of homeless people roam Santa Monica on any given day, the city 
manager reported finding only 130 people sleeping in all the city's parks over 
the weekend.

AUTO-BIOGRAPHY; MUSEUMS: FACILITY WILL CELEBRATE THE HISTORY OF THE CAR IN 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OFFICIALS HOPE IT WILL ALSO HELP REJUVENATE MIRACLE MILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Whether one loves or hates automobiles, the history of Los Angeles and the 
rest of Southern California is inextricably linked to our wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Automobiles have defined where and how Angelenos have lived, said Catherine 
Krell, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
Suburbs and billboards were created because of autos. The world's first 
drive-through grocery store and drive-in church originated in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not celebrate our passion for pistons? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind the Petersen Automotive Museum, which will soon open in 
the former Orbach's building at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Natural 
History Museum officials are overseeing construction of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said this week that plans are on track to meet the projected June 10 
opening date, despite the Jan. 17 quake that prompted additional work to 
fortify the building against future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 One aim is to turn a deteriorating building that had been vacant for three 
years into a jewel that will help rejuvenate the Miracle Mile area of Wilshire 
Boulevard, officials said. The museum is expected to draw 2 million visitors in 
its first year, many of them from operators of two sightseeing tours that will 
add the Petersen to their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very supportive of the museum," said Renee Weitzer, a planning deputy 
for Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area. "It will be a 
great impact on a building that has been an eyesore and had a problem with 
vagrants. It will help revitalize the Miracle Mile." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 13 million automobiles on the streets of Greater Los Angeles, 
the museum is a natural for the area, said Matthew Roth, a staff member at the 
Natural History Museum who will be lead curator at the Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is the capital of car consumption," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum will provide a cultural and educational spin 
through automotive history with detailed displays of about 200 authentic cars, 
as well as motorcycles, photographs, billboards and dioramas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 museums in the nation are devoted to the automobile, including three 
in California. They are in Sylmar, San Diego and Danville. But Krell said the 
Petersen, in a four-story, 300,000-square-foot building, will be the largest in 
the country and will have the most comprehensive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like us. We're part of the Natural History Museum, which 
means it's big and serious. No museum deals with the impact of the auto as 
fully and as comprehensively as we will." 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is expected to cost about $50 million, Krell said. It is named 
after Robert Petersen, the founder and chairman of Petersen Publishing Co., who 
donated $15 million toward its establishment. His company publishes 30 
magazines, including Motor Trend and Hot Rod. The history museum also obtained 
$20 million in bond money from Los Angeles County. Money was also given by 
benefactors and by corporations such as Arco.  
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the museum will be education, Krell said, with information in 
English, Spanish, German and Japanese. Each of the first three floors will 
trace the history of the auto, and conference rooms will be located on the 
fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor, dubbed "Streetscape," begins a journey through the 1900s. 
There is a scene of a Breer Blacksmith Shop with a 1901 steam car, complete 
with cobwebs and reconstructed tools. There is a diorama of a 1911 American 
Underslung stuck in the mud in Las Tunas Canyon with a chauffeur and stranded 
motorists. Further along is a Laurel and Hardy scene depicting a crushed 
Model-T sitting between two trolley cars in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits include representations of Los Angeles' first L-shaped 
mini-mall and one of the first California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers 
perched behind a billboard in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor will include five rotating galleries with themes such as 
French luxury cars of the 1930s; Hollywood and the automobile; early 
motorcycles, and past and present automotive technology. The third floor will 
provide more views of Southern California car culture, with three art galleries 
of photography, toys and memorabilia. The museum began collecting automobiles 
in the 1930s as anthropological artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural History Museum officials decided to build a world-class automotive 
museum as a way to showcase its inventory of automobile memorabilia, which has 
been warehoused because of a lack of display space, Krell said.

TOPICS / LIFESTYLES; ROAR OF JETS FUELS A PASSION FOR SOME RESIDENTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At sunset, Jason Boss often heads out to the balcony of his third-floor 
apartment, leans back in a deck chair with a highball in hand and watches the 
world roar in beneath his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Boss, 22, is a resident of Park West Apartments, a 444-unit building in 
Westchester with a panorama of Los Angeles International Airport. His bedroom 
window is less than 100 yards from the northern runway of the world's 
third-busiest airplane hub, and Boss wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll often have friends over, and we'll just sit on the porch for hours 
watching the flights come and go," Boss said. "It's absolutely hypnotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite numerous complaints over the years from many of the roughly 80,000 
people who airport officials say are most affected by noise from the facility, 
a significant contingent swear by the planes, rather than at them. 
</P>
<P>
 They include airline mechanics, airport employees, retired engineers and 
aviation buffs who live on the airport's perimeter and thrive on the airport's 
international flavor and commotion, which some regard as a soothing, reassuring 
presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Cover, the Park West Apartments' leasing agent, said he was initially 
perplexed by the high demand for the building's units. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's strange, but most of these people just love watching the airplanes," he 
said, gesturing beyond an apartment's triple-pane glass, installed to dull the 
noise. "Funny enough, inside it's a real quiet building, with lots of 
professional types including pro basketball, hockey and football players, as 
well as CEOs stationed here during the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Park West's neighbors exhibit the same devotion to the clamor. 
</P>
<P>
 Reginald Shribbs spends his days as a customer service agent at British 
Airways; at night, he returns to his noisy haven in Westchester: a 
three-bedroom, $240,000 home on Glider Street near parking Lot D. An 
ex-military man with two children who has lived on air bases for most of his 
life, Shribbs likes the affordability of Westchester's housing and the short 
walk to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are inconveniences, such as having to set his TV remote control to 
high volume to cover the noise. And the airport's thousands of lights often 
blot out the stars and bathe the neighborhood in a surreal glow. But Shribbs 
retains a fondness for the peculiarities of life at the airport's edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "On walks in my neighborhood, I'm always giving people directions," he said. 
"There are always lost tourists in rental cars looking at maps with their 
lights on, and backing into driveways. . . . It's a gateway for international 
travelers, a reflection of this city." 
</P>
<P>
 LAX encompasses more than one-third of Westchester, a community of 50,000 
people living in tract homes, boxy apartment buildings and on tidy cul-de-sacs, 
brushed by cool ocean breezes. 
</P>
<P>
 During the airport's expansion in the 1970s, the Board of Airport 
Commissioners demolished more than 3,500 homes in northwest Westchester and 
relocated about 10,000 residents to make way for construction of the northern 
runway. Many residents next to the site faced increased jet noise. Some sued. A 
few fled. Many stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The noise was never a problem for Harry Stephens, who first came to the area 
after World War II as a field engineer for Milwaukee-based AC Sparkplug. During 
initial visits, he often stayed in airport motels because of his affinity for 
the roar of the jets. Now retired and living in a house on 91st Street, 
Stephens sometimes dozes off at night with an air-traffic-control radio on full 
blast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like listening to the banter of the pilots, how they strike up personal 
conversations," he said. "There's always something going on. I once heard Air 
Force One coming through on the shortwave and went down to spy on it while it 
was parked at the end of the runway." 
</P>
<P>
 Up the street from Stephens lives Randy Crespo, a maintenance engineer for 
British Airways, whose house is separated from runway 24 Right by a jumble of 
weeds and a few chain-link fences. By late afternoon, the house reverberates 
with the whine and roar of aircraft, the scent of jet fuel wafting in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at that -- the epitome of man's ingenuity," Crespo says as he 
bounds onto his driveway pointing at a parked TWA 747. "By tonight, that thing 
will be filled with 350,000 pounds of jet fuel, hundreds of passengers, food, 
luggage, movies, drinks -- everything totally in control."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; RESTAURATEUR, 37, FOUND GUILTY OF RAPE

<P>
 An owner of A Votre Sante, a trendy Westside restaurant chain, has been found 
guilty of raping a woman he had hired to decorate the firm's newest outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nour Tillo, 37, faces up to 16 years in prison when he is sentenced April 21 
in Santa Monica Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillo is one of three partners in the A Votre Sante chain of four health food 
restaurants: in Santa Monica, Brentwood, Venice and on La Brea Avenue near 
Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Mary Hanlon said the 26-year-old victim is a graduate art 
student and former waitress in the Venice restaurant whom Tillo had asked to 
decorate the chain's Santa Monica eatery. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillo was found guilty last Thursday after a jury deliberated for a day. He 
remains in the Los Angeles County jail in lieu of $350,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon said the woman was raped in Tillo's Venice apartment last February. 
Tillo and the victim went there to retrieve car keys she had left there before 
a meeting at a Hollywood restaurant, which he had arranged, to discuss 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 She was treated for bruises the next day at a hospital and reported the 
incident to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Gottesman, Tillo's attorney, said his client was innocent and that Tillo 
and the victim had consensual sex. 
</P>
<P>
 At a previous meeting, Tillo had forcibly kissed the victim, Gottesman said. 
The woman may not have exercised good judgment in going back to his apartment 
after the first encounter, Gottesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he plans to appeal the verdict. CAROL CHASTANG

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; THEATER CHAIN HELPS SCHOOLS BY GIVING MONEY AND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Santa Monica Boulevard Elementary and Grant Elementary in 
Hollywood are finding their school libraries a more interesting place. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there are hundreds of new books, furniture and more space, 
thanks to a gift from Pacific Theatres. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the company's "Hooked on Reading" school partnership program begun 
last year, the theater chain has spent $10,000 to renovate the libraries at 
each of the schools, which are part of the cash-strapped Los Angeles Unified 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 45 Pacific Theatres employees have agreed to work part of their 
shifts at the schools to serve as readers, tutors and teachers' aides. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Chenow, vice president of Pacific Theatres, said the company hopes to 
modernize two school libraries in Los Angeles County each year. He said about 
$1,355 in donations were collected from moviegoers who dropped money in boxes 
located in Hollywood's El Capitan, Cinerama Dome and Hollywood Pacific 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was especially welcome at Santa Monica Boulevard Elementary, which 
used the donation to pay for the demolition of a partition in the library, 
almost doubling its size. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old library was kind of dark, and the shelves were too high, and there 
wasn't enough room for the students to sit and read," said Catherine Johnson, a 
library coordinator at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "So often, we have to make do and rely on hand-me-downs," Johnson said. "Now 
we have more tools to enrich their lives. This is how it should be." CAROL

CITY HALL ROUNDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MALIBU: The City Council has voted unanimously not to require residents 
seeking to rebuild homes burned in the November wildfires to indemnify the city 
from future liability resulting from landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after hundreds of residents complained to council members 
that an indemnification clause contained in waivers they had to sign before 
rebuilding would be onerous. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the city had refused to issue rebuilding permits until waivers 
releasing it from liability and indemnifying it were signed, holding up 
reconstruction of about 200 homes on properties prone to landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the residents and the city reached a compromise Monday, dubbed 
Assumption of Risk and Release, which makes landholders assume risks incurred 
by building on geologically unstable land. Removal of the indemnity clause 
leaves the city open to third-party suits. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a homeowner whose house is damaged by another's during a slide 
would typically sue the neighbor and the city (for issuing a building permit). 
The indemnity clause would have exempted the city from such litigation.

VENICE: COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF HISTORIC BOARDWALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The boardwalk ("Boardwalk Blues," March 3) used to be one of the most 
interesting neighborhoods in Venice. It was a special place where the public 
had an opportunity to mingle with an iconoclastic community, where people could 
be themselves without being judged. 
</P>
<P>
 This unique setting was then destroyed by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter so that a 
handful of boardwalk property owners could maximize profits from their land 
holdings. Residential zones on the boardwalk were rezoned for intense 
commercial uses; neighborhood housing was converted to stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitions containing thousands of signatures from residents were submitted 
expressing opposition to the commercialization of the boardwalk. Community 
groups, acting through the city's local coastal planning process, opposed 
further commercialization of the boardwalk. Even Galanter signed one petition 
before she was elected. It didn't matter: She ignored the protests and threw 
all of her political weight in support of profits for boardwalk property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Galanter's negligence, abominable weekend traffic, overcrowding 
on the oceanfront, trash, noise and crime have changed the quality of life here 
and in the greater Venice community. Public safety, not renovation, is the 
issue on the boardwalk. If you think it is bad now, Galanter's plans for more 
commercialization will bring the boardwalk to its knees. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no point in renovating the boardwalk until the commercial 
exploitation of the oceanfront is brought to an end. That will happen only if 
people demonstrate their anger to Galanter or someone responsible replaces her 
at the next election.

MORMONS: SHOWING THE DIVERSITY THAT EXISTS IN THE CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I grew up in Westchester, and am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints. Your article on the church ("The New Mormons," Feb. 20) and 
how it has grown, was an article that I very much enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 I have not lived in Westchester for many years, having moved to Arcadia in the 
San Gabriel Valley when I graduated from Westchester High School. It was most 
interesting to me to see how the church has grown and diversified over the 
years. I was thrilled to see that people of many different backgrounds have 
found their spiritual home in the Mormon faith in which I grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to thank you -- and especially Mr. Chazanov, who wrote the article -- 
for the integrity with which it was researched and written. 
</P>
<P>
 Please, continue to share this kind of positive and uplifting information with 
readers who are world-weary and shellshocked by the overwhelming present and 
future challenges of each day.

COVER STORY; CULTURAL UNITY IS A MEMORY IN ONE SANTA MONICA NEIGHBORHOOD, BUT 
SOME RESIDENTS ARE TRYING TO RECAPTURE THE PAST IN . . .; THEIR TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Minnie Duncan McCauley was a toddler when her folks brought her to a sleepy 
little country town called Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1925. Santa Monica was mostly bean fields, lemon groves, and dirt 
roads, which turned into mudholes when it rained.  
</P>
<P>
 The Duncans came to California from Arkansas for the same reason as most: a 
better life. The difference was their skin color. And, as it turned out, that 
hardly mattered, they say, as they and their brood of 10 settled down as one of 
the community's early African American families. They found a town that, 
although not exactly colorblind, abided by a live-and-let-live philosophy that 
was unusual in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Juarez arrived a year or so later from Texas, by way of Montebello, to 
work at a local brickyard that lured many Latinos. He raised a family of five 
and still lives in Santa Monica with his wife, Beulah. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, Rosemary Romero Miano's family had been there for generations. 
She is a descendant of the Marquez and Reyes families that settled Santa Monica 
Canyon in the mid-1800s, living on a 6,000-acre Mexican government land grant 
called Rancho Boca de Santa Monica. Over the next few decades, more minorities 
filtered into town and prospered, becoming tradesmen, merchants, teachers, 
secretaries, lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Belying the image of the Westside as an all-white enclave, African American 
and Latino families lived side by side with whites and Asian Americans, mostly 
in the city's southeast corner: the Pico Neighborhood, an area roughly bounded 
by Pico Boulevard, Centinela Avenue, Santa Monica Boulevard and Lincoln 
Boulevard. That's where the land was most affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 There were horse-driven hayrides to Malibu by moonlight and Mexican 
Independence Day festivals on Olympic Boulevard. Minority children went to 
school, rode the streetcar and attended Saturday matinees side by side with 
everyone else, practicing multiculturalism decades before the buzzword was 
coined. Pico residents didn't call it that, though. To them it was simply the 
good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never sat in the back of nothing," McCauley, 73, said emphatically. "I 
didn't know prejudice, growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 But like many good things, the spirit of the Pico Neighborhood that McCauley 
and others recall so fondly didn't last. Though still a polyglot neighborhood 
with neatly kept bungalows, it has taken a battering since she romped through 
the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction of the Santa Monica Freeway in the late '50s to the mid-60s 
drove a stake through the heart of the neighborhood. Today, the sound of 
children's laughter has given way to gunshots as drug-dealing youth loiter in 
alleys. Many younger African Americans and Latinos now distrust each other, 
unaware of past alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 On streets where they once learned each other's language and customs, they now 
eye each other suspiciously and keep to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a growing movement is afoot to rejuvenate the only area in town where 
minorities outnumber whites 2 to 1, according to census figures. The idea, as 
exemplified in a city-sponsored cultural festival that will run over the next 
week, is to solidify the future by honoring the past. THE EARLY YEARS: "No one 
cared what color you had living next to you."  
</P>
<P>
 Though they grew up at opposite ends of town, the 1930s were wonderful, 
carefree years for Miano and McCauley, and they both remember them as filled 
with love, respect and food, but not much money. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they come to Santa Monica? 
</P>
<P>
 The Depression was in full swing, but land was cheap. California offered a new 
start and, best of all, a more relaxed racial climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Its cool ocean air appealed to those used to the humidity of the South and 
Midwest. And as early migrants settled in, they told their friends and 
relatives about it. Some of them came West too. 
</P>
<P>
 Miano, now 71, grew up on part of the family land on Entrada Drive, where she 
still lives on one of the two remaining lots from the land grant. Her mother, a 
young widow, taught her English before she started school at Canyon Elementary. 
There were family picnics on the beach and in the shade of the sycamore groves. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother made the biggest tortillas," she said. "We didn't have a lot of 
money, but we had a lot of food." 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley walked through fields to junior high and to the library at night, 
picking guava off trees along the way. She helped her Mexican playmates with 
their English; her brothers learned Spanish in the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women said they played with children of all ethnic backgrounds. They 
credit their parents for teaching them respect for others and the Santa Monica 
public schools for downplaying different economic backgrounds by requiring 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our teachers treated us all the same," Miano said. "We respected each other." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to segregated school systems elsewhere, Santa Monica had one high 
school for everyone, a key factor in promoting tolerance, people agree. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the mid-1930s, when Beulah Juarez married her husband, Tony, a 
bricklayer, and came to town, they found comfort and acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a nice little town where you could raise a family," said Beulah 
Juarez, now 83. "You could go to the beach at night and not lock your doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, one hot summer, the whole town did just that. During the heat wave of 
'39, everyone in town slept on the beach, McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one cared what color you had living next to you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vabel Reed, 78, a longtime civil rights activist, was a young married woman 
when she came to Santa Monica from Texas around 1940 in search of a job. The 
daughter of a Howard University graduate, Reed hoped to get away from the 
stifling segregation at home, where blacks couldn't even use the same drinking 
fountain as whites.  
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, Reed joined thousands of women who worked in factories. 
She worked the assembly line at Douglas Aircraft as a riveter and bought a 
bungalow that she still owns on Virginia Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We faced some prejudice," the longtime civil rights activist said, recalling 
a department store that would not hire black clerks, "but not to the depths of 
Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the relatively benign past described by longtime members of 
Santa Monica's ethnic community, people of color did face barriers, in 
accordance with the laws of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, minorities could not buy property north of Montana Avenue, 
retired Santa Monica High School teacher Forrest Freed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed, a descendant of the Marquez and Reyes families, remembers his extended 
family attending a groundbreaking ceremony for a subdivision called Marquez 
Knolls. But a year later, when a cousin wanted to buy a lot, he was dissuaded 
from doing so by those marketing the tract. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Freed cousin couldn't get a job at Douglas Aircraft before World War 
II -- despite having a letter of introduction from the governor. And yet a 
third cousin who lost his job during the Depression and needed government 
assistance was asked by a government worker, "How would you like to go to 
Mexico?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to go," the man replied. "I've never been." 
</P>
<P>
 Ballroom dances, with their aura of romance, also fell prey to segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Juarez said it was understood that Latinos were only allowed at the 
beginning of dances at local ballrooms. "By 9 p.m., they would put you 
outside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Weston, who leads a group of gospel singers, came to Santa Monica from 
Texas in the '40s to attend UCLA. He remembers a brouhaha when the Aragon 
Ballroom, on the eve of a performance by Count Basie, told blacks they couldn't 
dance at the club. The rule was lifted when Basie threatened to cancel the 
show, Weston said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pico Neighborhood, however, "there was no separatism," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Latinos) had their culture; We had ours. We could always come together in 
the happy medium." THE POSTWAR DECADES: "All of a sudden it became a black area 
and a Mexican area."  
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, things began to change. Soldiers from all over the country 
who had been stationed here during the war decided to settle in town. The land 
became more valuable. Tolerance, several longtime residents suggested, seemed 
to come easier when there was plenty of room for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "People came in and brought their prejudices," said Harriette McCauley, Minnie 
Duncan's daughter, who surmises that people who came here earlier, when it was 
a bold move, were more driven to put old ways behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the '50s would bring a mortal blow to the thriving multiethnic Pico 
Neighborhood, life was still sweet on the streets for the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Newton Ricard, who had helped build St. John's Hospital in the '40s, in the 
'50s used his carpentry skills to build the Little League field where his five 
sons played on integrated teams, his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Ricard boys, Tarik, now 50, who has returned to live in the 
neighborhood with his mother, recalls street dances. The one Spanish radio 
station turned up full blast provided the music. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how I learned to cha-cha when I was 12 years old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the state and county governments were looking for a place to put the 
Santa Monica Freeway in the mid-'50s, it was the Pico Neighborhood they deemed 
expendable. Though officials denied it, people in the neighborhood believed 
that, as minorities, they lacked the clout to block the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway, which opened in 1966, literally cut the neighborhood in half and 
displaced some 600 families, mostly black and Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 People lost their dream homes to eminent domain, and many middle-class African 
Americans moved to communities such as Baldwin Hills, while their counterparts 
in the Latino community headed for places such as San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Each group used to make up about 20% to 25% of Santa Monica's population. 
According to the most recent census, African Americans constitute 4.1% of the 
city's population; Latinos, 13%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to stop (the freeway)," said Vabel Reed. "Some of us stood in front 
of the bulldozer to stop it. We walked. We fought. We picketed. They 
overwhelmed us. After the freeway came, things started to go downhill." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheap apartment houses were slapped up on vacant lots, right next to 
single-family homes. As the units filled up, the neighborhood quickly 
Balkanized, with the majority of blacks living south of the freeway, while 
Latinos were concentrated to the north. No one seems to understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden it became a black area and a Mexican area," said Lois Ricard, 
Tarik's mother. TODAY: "Everybody is fighting for crumbs"  
</P>
<P>
 In the '90s, the Pico Neighborhood is fighting for its life. The enemies are 
gangs, drugs, the breakup of the family and something that flabbergasts the 
old-timers: a breach between blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where does it come from?" said Vabel Reed. "This never was. We was always 
kind of kin." 
</P>
<P>
 The area is still dotted with cozy, well-kept bungalows, but the sound of 
gunshots is an all-too-regular occurrence, as Latino gangs from the area fight 
black gangs from Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs, drugs, drugs," said Lois Ricard. "It's so different now. Everybody's 
afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, there are signs of gentrification as first-time 
homeowners seek affordable housing on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the residents of the area, organized by church leaders 
and the Pico Neighborhood Assn., have been putting the pressure on City Hall 
for more police protection, youth programs and other services in their area. 
Residents feel neglected, saying resources are being siphoned off by other 
parts of town that have more political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarik Ricard and Harriette McCauley, both officers of the Pico Neighborhood 
Assn., are trying to infuse others with community pride. "People here need to 
recognize they have the power to change the neighborhood," McCauley said. 
</P>
<P>
 They seek to defuse racial tensions by reminding both groups about their 
shared struggle to attain parity and their shared past in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricard said the breach between African Americans and Latinos has been fostered 
by a system in which both groups are competing for ever-dwindling resources. 
"Everybody is fighting for crumbs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the women from his mother's generation, who raised families in 
Santa Monica, lament the lack of direction and respect for others they see in 
today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor kids," said Beulah Juarez. "I'd hate to be a kid right now. They don't 
get enough attention at home. When they took out the dining room and put in the 
den, it ruined everything."

OUT AND ABOUT / FATHER'S OFFICE: WHERE A BEER LOVER'S HEART TAP-DANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Father's Office is a tavern capable of pouring a different pint of beer for 
every day of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 A 31-tap bar is the centerpiece of this Santa Monica watering hole, which has 
a nondescript exterior that belies a quaint interior reminiscent of a German 
beer garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike traditional establishments, Lou Moench doesn't sell imported or bottled 
beer from mainstream companies. 
</P>
<P>
 He insists on serving products made strictly from the four basic ingredients: 
water, hops, yeast and grain. 
</P>
<P>
 No preservatives or additives, please. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beer is a fresh product and we emphasize the quality of beer," said Moench, a 
longtime Santa Monica resident. "We offer a distinct alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Considered among the first microbreweries in the state, Moench opened the 
49-seat bar eight years ago on Montana Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 He initially sold two types of beers, Anchor Steam and Sierra Nevada, but 
expanded the beer menu over the years to include more than 70 brands from 
California, Oregon and Washington. Selections vary, depending on available 
stock and season. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no pool sharks here. Only classical and jazz music is played. 
Smoking is not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are plenty of big, wooden tables and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 This a neighborhood place where residents come to relax and sip $4 beers such 
as "Old Foghorn," which, with an alcohol content of 9.5%, is among the 
strongest beers brewed in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very relaxing atmosphere," said West Los Angeles resident and regular 
customer Julio Acevedo. "It's a great place to unwind. . . . I fell in love 
with the selection of beer." 
</P>
<P>
 Father's Office, 1018 Montana Ave., Santa Monica. (310) 451-9330. Hours are 3 
p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Monday through Thursday and noon to 1:30 a.m. Friday, 
Saturday and Sunday.

 Being different is never easy, especially for teen-agers. But gay and lesbian 
youths have a particularly hard time, and often suffer social, academic, health

REGIONA; WOODLAND HILLS; COYOTE-TRAPPING BAN TO UNDERGO FURTHER STUDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a contentious hearing on a controversial 9-month-old ban on coyote 
trapping, the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission last week called for 
further study before deciding how to stop coyotes from foraging for food in 
residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The study is expected to seek a compromise that will appease wildlife 
conservationists, who oppose coyote trapping, and hillside residents who say 
trapping is needed to protect pets and children from coyote attacks.The report 
will also recommend whether to continue the ban on trapping, which was 
implemented last June under pressure from animal-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to ask animal regulation officials to draft recommendations 
within 60 days came during a sometimes emotional meeting in Woodland Hills 
attended by about 110 people, many of whom live on urban hillsides where coyote 
sightings have increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memory of my little Kelly's moans is more piercing than any yelp a coyote 
could make," said Cathy Keen, mother of a 3-year-old girl killed by a coyote in 
Glendale in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife conservationists recommend, among other steps, keeping pets and pet 
food in at night to cut off the food supply that draws coyotes into 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent wildfires, which drove coyotes into urban areas, the trapping ban and a 
seasonal abundance of the small wildlife that coyotes feed upon are factors 
that have led to an increase in coyote sightings, animal regulation officers 
say. HUGO MARTIN

REGION; LOMITA; PETITION ADVANCES DISTRICT'S PUSH TO LEAVE L.A. UNIFIED

 The group working to see Lomita secede from the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and manage its own schools has submitted a petition to county 
officials with enough signatures to require the county to either reject or 
endorse the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Committee to Unify Lomita's Schools recently delivered a petition with 
3,099 signatures to Los Angeles County officials.At least 2,400 signatures were 
required as a first step toward gaining educational autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have 20 days to verify the signatures and another 60 days to 
have a public hearing on the issue. After the hearing, the county has 120 days 
to determine whether it will advance Lomita's effort to the State Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community is very anxious," said Cindy Grant, one of three chief 
organizers of the petition drive. "If we could have (our own) district 
tomorrow, we'd be delighted." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's main complaint is that Los Angeles Unified is too big and unwieldy 
to address the needs of Lomita, a community of 19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign marks the second time in eight years that Lomita has tried to 
secede from Los Angeles Unified. Its previous attempt reached the state level 
but died because state officials determined that by withdrawing its mostly 
white students, Lomita would undermine Los Angeles Unified's desegregation 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial makeup of Lomita, however, has changed in recent years from almost 
entirely white to 60% white and 40% minority. 
</P>
<P>
 If the effort is successful, Lomita would create a new school district of 
about 2,000 students. The district would include Eshelman Avenue Elementary and 
Lomita Elementary, a magnet school. Fleming Middle School would become a 
combined junior and senior high school. LISA RICHARDSON

MAN IS CONVICTED IN JAPAN OF L.A. MURDER; COURTS: OUTCRY OVER SLAYING OF 
JAPANESE STUDENTS IS REMINISCENT OF 1981 HOMICIDE. IN THAT CASE, A TOKYO 
BUSINESSMAN CLAIMED STREET CRIMINALS SHOT HIM AND HIS WIFE. AS IT TURNED OUT, 
HE HAD STAGED THE SLAYING.

<P>
 In 1981, Kazuyoshi Miura parlayed the Japanese stereotype of Los Angeles into 
an alibi for murder. He told police that his wife was shot dead and he was 
wounded as they snapped photos in the streets of a metropolis the Japanese 
regard as one of most violent cities on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 As was the case this week in the murders of two students in a San Pedro 
carjacking, the Japanese outcry was tremendous and the U.S. response was 
abject. Except that Miura had staged his wife's murder for his own financial 
gain, believing he could never get away with it in Japan -- but might be able 
to in Downtown Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, in a verdict that capped one of the most sensational 
international whodunits in Japanese history, the Tokyo fashion importer was 
convicted of murdering his wife. At a different moment in time, the Tokyo 
court's decision might simply have marked the final chapter in a 13-year saga 
of murder, money and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the heels of this week's international uproar over the carjacking 
murders of a Japanese-American student and his Japanese friend, the verdict 
also offered a dark and ironic echo of the long-held Japanese perception of Los 
Angeles as violent and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 One commentator on Japan Television, which covered the Miura verdict live, 
speculated that Miura chose the United States as the scene of his crime 
"precisely because America is a society of guns." The recent deaths of 
Marymount College students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, the commentator added, 
only underscored that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at a news conference called in Los Angeles to announce the Miura 
verdicts, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti could not help but note the similarities in 
the outrage sparked by the two cases, 13 years apart. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- like so many public officials in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., this 
week -- he stressed that the deaths of Ito and Matsuura on Friday night were 
the result of a random and "uncommon" act of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have my children living here," he said, if that was not the 
case." 
</P>
<P>
 The slaying of Kazumi Miura, on the other hand, was something else entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 The case that the Japanese press would eventually dub the "L.A. Shooting 
Affair" began to unfold on Nov. 18, 1981, on Fremont Avenue two blocks from the 
Downtown Music Center and nine blocks from police headquarters. Initial news 
accounts were that Kazumi Miura, 28, of Tokyo, a tourist visiting with her 
businessman husband, had been taken to County-USC Medical Center in extremely 
critical condition with a bullet in her head. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Kazuyoshi Miura, then 34, had been shot in the leg, in broad 
daylight on a busy street. Miura told police his wife was cut down before his 
eyes as he focused on her in his camera viewfinder. 
</P>
<P>
 The businessman, an importer who had been coming to Los Angeles on business 
nearly every month for nine years, told police that the couple had parked their 
car at 11:45 a.m. and were taking pictures of the Downtown skyline when two 
young men pulled up in an old, dark green American car and demanded money. When 
the Miuras hesitated, one of the men pointed a handgun out the car window, shot 
the Miuras, then hopped out and stole $1,200 from the wife's purse and the 
husband's pockets, Miura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, police noted, several pieces of currency lay fluttering on the 
sidewalk where the fallen couple lay bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
 Miura wasted no time in placing blame on the hateful plague of urban violence, 
American-style. From his hospital bed, he told reporters that he was writing to 
then-President Reagan, then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. and then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley "to protest this incident and ask proper care and protection against 
this sort of incident happening again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many young Japanese will be coming to the U.S. with their dreams on their 
hearts," Miura said then. "I strongly hope this accident will never occur 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 A month later, Miura returned to Japan, leaving his wife in an L.A. hospital. 
As she had been since the attack, Kazumi Miura, the mother of a 13-month-old 
child, was blind, paralyzed, unconscious and subsisting on life-support 
machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Miura lashed out at the state of California because he had tried 
and failed to get a crime victims program to subsidize his hospital bills. He 
did, however, persuade the U.S. government to fly his wife back to Japan in a 
special U.S. Air Force military hospital jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kazumi Miura died in a Japanese hospital almost a year to the day after the 
attack, and the furor over the still-unsolved crime died down. Then a series of 
news articles surfaced in Tokyo in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the accounts noted that Miura had collected 155 million 
yen (about $655,000) on life insurance policies he had taken out on his wife in 
the United States and Japan. There was also a bizarre confession to a Japanese 
newspaper by a onetime Japanese porn actress who told reporters that three 
months before the shooting, Miura had hired her to kill his wife in their room 
at the New Otani hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Michiko Yazawa, who said she was Miura's lover at the time, said Miura had 
told her that if she eliminated his wife, he would marry her and split $200,000 
in insurance benefits. So, she said, she posed as a dressmaker and visited 
Kazumi Miura at her hotel room, ostensibly to take her measurements. But after 
smacking the woman several times with a two-pound, hammer-like tool, Yazawa 
said, she lost her nerve and fled. Miura told authorities his wife had been 
injured in a bathroom fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there were questions about the disappearance of another Japanese 
visitor to Los Angeles -- a woman who had earlier been Miura's accountant and 
lover. Two years before the shooting, Chizuko Shiraishi, 34, had filed for 
divorce and hopped a plane to Los Angeles on a 30-day tourist visa, listing a 
Hollywood Holiday Inn as her destination. The hotel manager told reporters at 
the time that he had no record of a guest by her name, but that a Mr. and Mrs. 
Miura had checked in the day she arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The sighting by the hotel manager was the last report that the woman had been 
seen alive. But her bank records showed that, shortly after her departure, 
Miura withdrew about $21,000 from her account in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a Japanese reporter finally gave her dental charts to a Los Angeles 
detective in 1984, they were traced to a corpse that had been found in a vacant 
field in Lake View Terrace two months after Shiraishi disappeared. Jane Doe No. 
88 had languished, unidentified, in the county morgue for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosures spawned a media frenzy, as reporters from TV to tabloid 
magazines raced to dish details of Miura's life -- from his past criminal 
record to his string of lovers and even half-nude photos of him surrounded by 
naked women in S & M garb at a sex swap party. 
</P>
<P>
 The media overkill actually stirred some public sympathy for Miura, with calls 
for media responsibility and respect for his rights, and the businessman 
eventually wrote two books detailing his persecution by the media. In fact, he 
was just wrapping up a televised denial of any role in his wife's death when 
police arrested him at the posh Ginza Tokyo Hotel. Four TV networks broadcast 
Miura's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Miura was tried only on attempted murder charges, based on the New 
Otani incident. But after his 1987 conviction on those charges, the 
investigation of the fatal shooting picked up steam, and authorities from Los 
Angeles -- who had been conducting a parallel probe all along -- traveled to 
Japan to complete their work on the deaths of Miura's wife and lover. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, with Miura already serving a six-year sentence for attempted murder, 
he was finally charged with murder, under a Japanese law that allows its 
citizens to be prosecuted in Japan for crimes committed in other countries. 
Also charged was a man who had been a buyer for his company and who police said 
had acted as his accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshikuni Matsumoto, an Osaka native who had graduated from USC and had gone 
on to become Miura's agent in Los Angeles, was accused of conspiring with Miura 
to murder his wife. On Wednesday, Matsumoto was exonerated on that charge, but 
convicted of smuggling a rifle and 100 pounds of ammunition from the United 
States to Japan. He was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are expected to appeal, and Japanese legal experts noted that the 
split verdict leaves one crucial question unanswered: Who fired the fatal shot? 
</P>
<P>
 But for the Japanese media this week, that question was secondary to the point 
raised by a Japan Television network correspondent: 
</P>
<P>
 "The murder of two Japanese exchange students just occurred in Los Angeles," 
the correspondent said, "and showed how crime is increasing because of the guns 
in American society." 
</P>

ROMANCING THE STONES; SEARCHERS BELIEVE ROCKS POINT THE WAY TO ELYSIAN PARK 
TREASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Suddenly, in the shadows of a canyon above Downtown Los Angeles, there was a 
glint. 
</P>
<P>
 Not from something shiny in the ground. From Marvin Baker's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "There! There's one of the treasure signs!" he exclaimed, pointing to a 
boulder jutting from a nearby hillside. "It shows where the treasure is." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker scampered to the rock and brushed away the dust on top. There, scratched 
into the stone, were symbols -- lines and circles worn by age and almost 
invisible. 
</P>
<P>
 To Baker, it was a road map to riches. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-taught treasure hunter was standing in the middle of Elysian Park, 
the hilly corner of Downtown best known to most people as a shortcut to Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is a 585-acre bank vault in Baker's view -- one crammed with 
valuables buried 150 years ago by frightened residents of the Los Angeles 
pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not the only one who thinks that locals stashed money and jewels in 
the hills north of Olvera Street to keep invading troops from seizing them as 
Mexicans and Americans clashed over control of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of stuff buried. And it was hastily buried," said Roy Roush, 
a globe-trotting treasure hunter whose work has taken him from the jungles of 
Caribbean islands to a hidden tunnel deep beneath Elysian Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The thought of treasure hidden in the park intrigues those who say its 
recovery could add to future generations' knowledge of pioneer life in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It scares others, however. City officials and members of the Citizens 
Committee to Save Elysian Park worry that a treasure hunt would ruin the 
fragile nature of rugged-looking hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose he finds gold in the park," committee founder Grace Simons said of a 
hunter's excavation request (later denied by the city) in 1974. "There might be 
a gold rush to the park. Where would we stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say it is illegal to dig without a permit in the municipally owned 
park and there's probably nothing there anyway. But if there is, it's the 
property of the city, they quickly add. Permits have not been issued in years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a treasure up there adds to the mystique of Elysian Park," said 
Manuel Mollinedo, the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department manager in 
charge of the area. "We're probably better off keeping the mystique alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is a 65-year-old former warehouseman who lives north of the park in a 
neighborhood called Elysian Valley. He said he stumbled upon the first of a 
series of etched-rock "treasure signs" about two years ago while walking his 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Roush, 69, is a retired combat pilot and technical writer who mounts his 
treasure-hunting expeditions from a ridge-top home in Woodland Hills. He said 
he discovered the same rock scratchings about 15 years ago when two Mexican 
American women hired him to hunt for what they thought was a family treasure 
hidden in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker is convinced that markings on at least one of the rocks point the way to 
a cache hidden by Francisco Avila, the man who in 1818 built the first house in 
Los Angeles. The adobe still stands on Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 An odd drawing found on another rock could be even more significant. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Baker thought the scratchings were of a primitive stick figure. But a 
chance discovery of an old Elysian Park map in the city archives changed his 
mind, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker believes that instead of arms and legs, the lines on the rock actually 
depict the park's canyons and ravines. Sixty-two small holes bored into the 
rock along the lines probably show the approximate location of buried 
valuables, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 History seems to support the buried-treasure premise. 
</P>
<P>
 An 1850 account noted that "the inhabitants of the pueblo are of the better 
and wealthier class of Californians. At the time of the conquest they fought 
with determined resistance." 
</P>
<P>
 A history of the state written in 1915 recalled that "the better class of the 
native inhabitants closed their houses and took refuge with foreign residents 
or went to the ranchos of their friends in the country" when Gen. John C. 
Fremont's American troops showed up in early 1847. 
</P>
<P>
 Another historian's account in 1930 pointed out that Encarnacion Avila, widow 
of Francisco Avila, was one of those who locked her house and fled to the 
outskirts of the pueblo, where she hid at the home of Frenchman Luis Vignes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Fremont came through, he came through here like a tornado," said Roush. 
"He terrified the local Mexicans. Mexicans all over the pueblo of Los Angeles 
were busy digging. In the hills north of Broadway they actually dug escape 
tunnels from one side to the other." 
</P>
<P>
 As it developed, there was no need for the citizens to stash their valuables, 
Roush said. "Fremont just wanted the government, not a tribute from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Roush speculates that most of the buried treasure was retrieved by its owners 
once the coast was clear. But some pueblo residents may have died before they 
got around to digging up their property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His own experience in Elysian Park came when the two women hired him to help 
hunt for treasure in a ravine that their father had told them about, according 
to Roush -- who has taught classes and produced videotapes on locating 
treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found three treasure signs pointing to the perfect place to bury something 
-- a place not too accessible but not too inaccessible, either. The families 
did the digging; we got down about 30 feet." 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear from the soil that the hillside site had been excavated before, 
he said. At about the 30-foot depth he discovered a four-foot length of crude, 
handmade rope and a cardboard lantern battery from the 1940s. It was proof to 
Roush that someone had already removed whatever had been stashed there. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker -- who has never met Roush -- said he followed the same treasure signs 
and found the remains of that tunnel. According to Baker, he received stern 
warnings against treasure hunting when he reported his findings to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers covered the tunnel entrance with logs and dirt. Even worse, Baker 
contends, they destroyed some of the rock signs after he told them where they 
were. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the rangers laughed and said, 'Well, I guess you saw we did some 
"maintenance work" up there,' " Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials deny that. "We don't have staff to do maintenance work we need 
to do there, let alone go out and obliterate signs," said Pete Echeverria, a 
deputy city attorney who has warned Baker against digging without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker has also reported his treasure-sign discoveries to various City Council 
offices, the mayor's office and to such places as the El Pueblo de Los Angeles 
Historic Monument and the Mexican Consulate. He said he feels any excavated 
treasure should go on display -- after he gets a modest cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "A treasure would be absolutely marvelous. . . . I'd like nothing better," 
said Jean Bruce Poole, director of the monument's Historic Museum. But she said 
a treasure hunt would require a coordinated effort involving archeologists and 
other experts -- something the city cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Liliana Ferrer, special assistant to the Mexican consul general in Los 
Angeles, has asked the Museum of Natural History in Mexico City to search for 
old maps that might point the way to Elysian Park treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is reasonable evidence that allows us to believe there could be 
something of significance to both our cultures and histories, it would be in 
the best interest of both to pursue further exploration," Ferrer said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker's talkativeness is frustrating to Roush and other treasure hunters, 
who by their very nature are inclined to keep secrets.  
</P>
<P>
 "He can't keep his mouth shut," Roush said. "He's called just about every 
treasure hunter in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Milota, a Ventura resident with nearly 40 years of treasure-hunting 
experience, said: "I heard a rumor about Elysian Park. But if you don't have a 
map what are you going to do? You can take a knife and put whatever you want on 
that sandstone. I think it's a hoax." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional treasure hunter Charles Kenworthy of Tarzana said he is skeptical 
that the Elysian Park rock markings were made by pueblo residents. They do not 
resemble the Spanish-style marks used until about 1880, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Kenworthy added, true treasure hunters are "a low-profile group." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for secrecy is clear, according to Steve Ryland, owner of a 
Glendale treasure hunter's shop.  
</P>
<P>
 "One thinks about the local government problem in getting permission to hunt," 
Ryland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's another governmental agency interested, obviously, if you find 
something."

CITY TRIES TO LINK KING'S LIFESTYLE TO STRESS IN EFFORT TO REDUCE DAMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During his final moments on the witness stand Wednesday, Rodney G. King was 
grilled by defense attorneys who sought to show that his lifestyle has 
contributed to the emotional stress he has suffered since his beating by police 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorneys suggested during cross-examination that King has 
inflated his account of the beating to enhance his chances of getting a large 
award in his lawsuit against the city and 15 present and former police 
officers. King is asking for $9.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 He was questioned about his criminal record, his relationship with his wife, a 
pending paternity case for failure to pay child support, and his use of drugs 
and alcohol before and after the beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Atty. Don Vincent, the lead attorney for the defense, said that 
because King has claimed severe emotional damage, his lifestyle is fair game. 
"The city has agreed to pay damages, not inflated damages, but real damages," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys accused the defense of resorting to personal attacks because 
they cannot refute the overwhelming medical testimony that King has suffered 
permanent mental and physical damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the type of tactic used on a person who brings charges of rape," said 
Federico Castela Sayre, one of King's attorneys. "You assault the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday morning, before jury members took their seats, King's attorneys 
attempted to block a request by the defense to question King about whether he 
failed to make child-support payments for an 11-year-old daughter. King's 
attorneys said the information would prejudice the jury against their client, 
but the defense countered that King's stress results from more than just the 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, U.S. District Judge John G. Davies agreed to allow the 
questioning, saying that King's life has "become an open book." 
</P>
<P>
 In the jury's presence, the defense asked King about several well-publicized 
incidents, including the time he picked up a "transvestite" in Hollywood and 
tried to flee police. He explained that he had thought the police officers were 
trying to rob him and that "I didn't know (he) was a transvestite." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to a defense question, King said he never beat his wife, who had 
called police and complained he was throwing her clothes out of a closet. King 
admitted using cocaine once, and he said he tested positive for heroin once 
only because he had taken Percodan, a prescription pain killer. 
</P>
<P>
 King testified Wednesday that he pleaded guilty and went to prison for robbery 
in 1989 because he could not afford a lawyer to fight the charge. Although he 
was accused of robbing and assaulting a grocer with a tire iron, King said he 
was not at fault. He said the grocer attacked him after he attempted to walk 
out of the store after paying for some items with $5 in food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A scuffle followed, King said, and the grocer attacked him with the tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked up some pies off a pie rack and was throwing them at him," King 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "So you pleaded guilty, served two years in prison and three years of parole 
for throwing pies?" asked defense attorney Michael Stone, who represents former 
Officer Laurence M. Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I was convicted of," King said.

 King was on probation for the armed robbery when he was stopped for speeding 
and beaten by four Los Angeles police officers.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has admitted liability and has offered to pay King $1.25 million for 
his injuries -- a figure rejected by King's attorneys. King also is seeking 
punitive damages from several defendants, including former Officers Stacey C. 
Koon and Powell,who are serving 30-month sentences in federal prison after a 
conviction in U.S. District Court for violating King's civil rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Powell, Koon and former Officers Theodore J. Briseno and Timothy E. Wind were 
acquitted of nearly all assault charges in a state criminal trial, touching off 
three days of riots in Los Angeles. Briseno and Wind also were acquitted in the 
federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorneys are expected to call Briseno or Wind to testify today.

JACKSON CASE PANEL ASKS ABOUT SEXUAL ORIENTATION; GRAND JURY: AN EMPLOYEE OF 
THE SINGER SAYS HE WAS QUESTIONED ABOUT THE STAR AND ABOUT HIMSELF. THE 
WITNESS'S LAWYER CALLS THE INQUIRIES IMPROPER; SOME EXPERTS DISPUTE HIM.

 Prosecutors investigating allegations that Michael Jackson sexually molested a 
13-year-old boy asked a witness to tell a grand jury about Jackson's sexual 
orientation and to testify about his own sexual orientation as well, according 
to sources familiar with that witness's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness, an employee of Jackson who appeared before the Santa Barbara 
County Grand Jury recently, told his lawyer about the questions, and that 
attorney fired off an angry letter to the Santa Barbara County and Los Angeles 
County district attorney's offices in response. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, lawyer Richard M. Steingard accused prosecutors of exceeding 
the proper limits of grand jury questioning. Steingard wrote that grand jury 
questions must be limited to evidence that would be admissible in court -- a 
contention that legal experts disputed even as some expressed reservations 
about inquiring into a witness' sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One would think that prosecutors of your stature would, at a minimum, know 
this to be the law and attempt in your questioning of witnesses to comply with 
this rule," Steingard wrote. "Based on the above, you apparently believe that 
the questioning of a witness has no limits or boundaries and that anything, 
even a witness' sexual preference, is fair game." 
</P>
<P>
 Steingard's letter is the latest in a series of criticisms leveled at 
prosecutors in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara who are investigating the 
allegations against Jackson. The entertainer's lawyers have regularly attacked 
the slow pace of the inquiry, which was launched last summer, while ministers, 
civil rights activists and other Jackson supporters have added their criticisms 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Childs, a spokeswoman for the district attorney's office, said 
officials there could not comment on the allegations raised in Steingard's 
letter. Prosecutors are prohibited by law from discussing any matters that are 
before a grand jury -- even to confirm that a grand jury probe is under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts, meanwhile, disputed Steingard's reading of the law about the 
limits of grand jury inquiries.  
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury is given powers that we do not give police or prosecutors . . 
. and it may ask a broad range of questions whose relevancy might not be clear 
until other evidence is gathered," said Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor 
who has extensively researched issues related to grand juries. "For the most 
part, the grand jury can ask whatever it wants." 
</P>
<P>
 During grand jury inquiries, prosecutors generally question witnesses, but 
jurors also can ask questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several experienced lawyers said they considered it highly unusual for 
prosecutors to inquire about a witness' sexual orientation. One area of 
particular concern, they noted, is that state grand jury transcripts become 
public documents if the subject of the inquiry is indicted. As a result, the 
information about the witness' sexual orientation could become public if 
Jackson were indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Steingard's letter indicates that his client was asked about three topics he 
considered objectionable: the sexual orientation of Jackson, the sexual 
orientation of Jackson associates and the witness's own sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury can ask questions that are relevant to the inquiry," said 
Donald M. Re, an experienced criminal defense lawyer. "Given the nature of this 
case, the first two questions may be proper. . . . The third question, 'Are you 
yourself gay?' gets a lot closer to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Harland W. Braun, another defense attorney who also is a former prosecutor, 
agreed, saying he believes the district attorney could explore the topic of 
Jackson's sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the question about the witness's orientation, Braun called it "close to 
the edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Under most circumstances, asking a witness about his or her sexual orientation 
would almost certainly be irrelevant during a trial, legal experts agreed. But 
even in that context, a witness's own statements might make it relevant. For 
example, if a witness described impressions of Jackson's conduct or 
conversations about homosexuality, the witness's own perspective on that topic 
might be deemed relevant in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Steingard declined to comment Wednesday on the questions that were posed to 
his client during his grand jury appearance. But Steingard confirmed he had 
sent the letter to the district attorney's office and said he stood by the 
statements in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, to ask questions of grand jury witnesses about sexual orientation 
I think is outrageous," he said. "I cannot fathom any circumstance in which 
that would be proper." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Weitzman, one of Jackson's lawyers, said prosecutors have "spent 
considerable time, money and energy to construct a case that does not exist." 
Although the lawyer said he did not know whether a witness had been questioned 
about Jackson's sexual orientation or his own, Weitzman added: "If what 
(Steingard) claims in that letter is true and the investigation is now down to 
that level, it is a real sad commentary on the prosecution in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been under investigation since last summer, and an array of 
witnesses, including Jackson's mother, have been forced to appear before grand 
juries meeting in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Authorities in the two 
counties are conducting investigations because Jackson allegedly molested the 
boy in both jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting with the courthouse press corps March 15, Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said he expected the Jackson investigation to be 
concluded within a month or so. Sources familiar with the case now say they 
expect it to conclude by the end of April.

TIP LEADS TO ARREST NEAR SEATTLE OF SUSPECT IN 1975 PACOIMA SLAYING; CRIME: 
RICHARD LEOS HAD APPARENTLY BEEN LIVING TRANQUILLY UNDER VARIOUS ALIASES. 
MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY EXPRESS SHOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a mixture of tenacity and technology, authorities say, that finally 
brought Richard Leos to justice after 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Leos had been on the lam as the suspected gunman in a Pacoima barroom robbery 
and slaying since Gerald R. Ford was president. Along the way, authorities say, 
he used a series of aliases and false addresses. Most recently, he was living 
comfortably -- and under several different identities -- in a sleepy Seattle 
suburb with his longtime girlfriend and her two adult daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 But all along, Los Angeles police were on the lookout, running Leos' name and 
his aliases through national crime computers and making periodic checks with 
other authorities. Recently, they got a tip, and the work paid off. When police 
finally caught up with him Monday in the suburb of SeaTac, Wash., Leos, 42, was 
taking an early evening nap on his favorite couch, the TV blaring in front of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There he was, asleep in his boxer shorts," said FBI Special Agent Dave 
Burroughs. "I asked, 'Are you Richard Leos?' And he said, 'Yes, I am.' He had 
nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 For Leos, it was most assuredly a rude awakening; one minute, he was living 
what family members say was a tranquil life in the Pacific Northwest; the next, 
he was under arrest for a vicious 1975 slaying. After being handcuffed, he was 
hauled off to jail, speechless, and is now awaiting extradition to Los Angeles 
to be tried on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe all these FBI agents in my house, yelling for him," said 
Ginger Rosendale, Leos' girlfriend. "They came in here with guns pulled and 
woke him up. He stood up, held his hands out, they cuffed him, and it was all 
said and done." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosendale described Leos, whom she knew as Jess Caruso, as a hard-working man 
who eschewed violence, and who lovingly helped her raise and support her 
daughters since the two met through a mutual friend 16 years ago. He never 
mentioned his past much, she said, except to say that he was from Los Angeles. 
And he certainly never gave a hint that anyone was looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally destroyed our world as we know it, our existence, our happy home 
life," Rosendale said. "To everybody else, it's just news. But to us, it is 
devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosendale's daughter Jennifer, 20, was the one who answered the knock on the 
front door and watched as 10 federal agents barged in with their guns drawn. 
She, too, had no idea what was happening until an agent told Leos what he was 
being arrested for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at him as if he were my real dad," she said. "He was always loving and 
wonderful. We will not be a full family until he comes home." 
</P>
<P>
 Leos faces charges of murder, armed robbery and unlawful flight to avoid 
prosecution.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, authorities allege, Leos entered Moran's Bar in Pacoima with two 
other men to commit an armed robbery. He is accused of fatally shooting a bar 
patron in the back of the head with a double-barreled shotgun after the man 
failed to follow instructions and walked toward the barroom entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Leos' alleged accomplices have never been identified, but Los Angeles police 
plan to travel to the Seattle area in the next few days to begin trying to 
track them down, said Detective Ray Broker of the LAPD's Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI said Leos has used a number of names and lived in various places in 
the United States and Mexico since the slaying. According to a Los Angeles 
Police Department bulletin from 1975, Leos was a heroin user with a scar over 
his left eye and a tattoo of a cross on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD's first break came several weeks ago, when a tipster said he had some 
information about an old, unsolved slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 Broker dusted off the case file, combined the old information with the new, 
and determined that Leos was living under an alias in the Seattle area. 
Authorities there ran computer checks and found that the person using the alias 
Jess Caruso had had several brushes with the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, Leos was arrested for assault in 1989 and cited for a traffic 
violation in 1991. In both cases he gave bogus names and addresses, the FBI 
said, and no connection to Leos was made at first. 
</P>
<P>
 The addresses listed in police computers were wrong, but a phone number that 
Caruso had given to police during the traffic stop matched the one at the house 
where he was captured. Hours after making the match, Burroughs and other 
members of the Seattle Area Fugitive Apprehension Team arrested Leos. 
</P>
<P>
 For Broker, it was just another homicide case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if it's 19 years old or 19 minutes, it's the same good feeling," 
he said. "If someone takes a life, they deserve to go to jail for it. It is the 
most heinous crime that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say an eyewitness in the bar that day -- an old schoolmate of 
Leos' who had just seen him several weeks beforehand -- is expected to testify 
against Leos. 
</P>
<P>
 But his wife and her children said they will stand by a man they have come to 
love over 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna support him," Rosendale said. "He's not a violent guy, not at all."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; LONGSHOREMEN 
SET RALLY HONORING SLAIN STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles longshoremen will hold a rally at a San Pedro Ralphs supermarket 
at noon Friday in memory of the two Japanese students who died after being shot 
in the store's parking lot last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally at Western Avenue and Park Western Drive will be open to the 
public.The International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union plans to lay a 
wreath in the students' honor and to announce a program aimed at stemming 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to tell others that we will not put up with this, and that we will do 
what we can to stop this violence," said Norman Tuck, secretary/treasurer of 
ILWU Local 13, which he said has 2,700 area members, including many living in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuck said that he is contacting major shipping firms to ask their backing in 
anti-violence efforts. Those might include promoting jobs for disadvantaged 
youths and educating students from foreign countries about safety in Los 
Angeles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two 19-year-old students, Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, attended Marymount 
College in Rancho Palos Verdes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
SCIENTOLOGY LOSES BID TO VOID $2.5-MILLION AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Wednesday threw out a lawsuit filed by the Hollywood-based Church 
of Scientology in hopes of getting a reversal of a $2.5-million emotional 
distress award that a former member won eight years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The complaint, filed on Feb. 16, 1993, had been on hold pending the outcome of 
a U.S. Supreme Court challenge to Larry D. Wollersheim's verdict.That was 
resolved March 7 when the high court rejected the church's contention that 
Wollersheim's case should have failed because Scientology's practices are 
protected under the U.S. Constitution.  
</P>
<P>
 But by then the church had sued Wollersheim, claiming that the late Judge 
Ronald Swearinger was biased against Scientology and that his bias filtered 
back to the jury room during the trial of the Wollersheim case. Wollersheim's 
attorneys argued that he was the victim of a SLAPP -- Strategic Lawsuit Against 
Public Participation -- case designed to muzzle him and deter others from going 
up against the church.  
</P>
<P>
 The judge agreed, but Scientology attorney Kendrick Moxon did not.  
</P>
<P>
 "The way they argued it, there is not a single lawsuit that would not fit 
under the (state) SLAPP Act," he said. Moxon said he will claim in an appeal 
brief that Kakita's decision was too broad.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; METROLINK 
STATION WILL OPEN AT CAL STATE L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will open a Metrolink station at Cal 
State Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The station, at the southern edge of the East Los Angeles campus, could be 
completed by the fall term, said university spokeswoman Carol Selkin.It is 
adjacent to the MTA's bus station on the San Bernardino Freeway, near the Long 
Beach Freeway interchange.  
</P>
<P>
 The campus is on the San Bernardino line, which has stops in Pomona, Covina, 
Baldwin Park and El Monte. More than 2,700 students, faculty and staff members 
live in cities along that route, said Carmen Gachupin, the school's employee 
transportation coordinator.  
</P>
<P>
 To get people to ride the commuter train, the school will help pay for train 
fares, Selkin said. Metrolink also will offer a 25% discount off the regular 
adult fare for Cal State L.A. students.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; PLAN FOR 
CITIZEN OVERSIGHT OF POLICE MATTERS ADVANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After almost two years of study and debate, the Pasadena City Council has 
tentatively approved Police Chief Jerry Oliver's plan to place civilians on 
advisory boards to review complaints against the department and to recommend 
discipline for officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 5-1 decision on Tuesday is a step toward establishing three 
panels to review use of force, disciplinary actions and property damage 
involving police officers, including crashes involving police cars.A final vote 
is expected April 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The council moved ahead with the plan even though no one seemed entirely 
satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents complained that the advisory boards would have no 
enforcement authority and too few civilians. Police union spokesmen, meanwhile, 
complained that they did not have enough input into the plan and are not happy 
about having civilians on the panels. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members, noting that Oliver first proposed the panels in 1992, 
said they will take another look at the plan in six to eight months.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; HOMELESS 
SHELTER OKD AS STEP TOWARD CLEARING PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council, responding to growing complaints from residents 
about the homeless, has voted to open a temporary homeless shelter for more 
than 100 people as a prelude to evicting transients who live in the city's 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 6-0 vote Tuesday night, the council acted on the advice of new City 
Atty.Marsha Jones Moutrie, who said such a shelter was needed to comply with a 
recent state Court of Appeal ruling. The ruling, in a Santa Ana case, says a 
city cannot legally ban sleeping in all public places without providing an 
alternative place to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also agreed to cooperate with a California Grocers Assn. shopping 
cart retrieval program in which contractors pick up stray carts. Many residents 
have complained about the noise from the carts, which many homeless people use 
to stow their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to clean up the parks was proposed last week by council members 
Asha Greenberg and Robert T. Holbrook as part of an overall crackdown on the 
homeless inspired by complaints from residents about intolerable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the new shelter, which will be opened as soon as possible, the 
council next month will consider new laws to address panhandling, including 
limiting the practice to daylight hours.  
</P>
<P>
 Public interest attorneys from the National Lawyers Guild said they would 
press forward on a dormant lawsuit seeking to overturn the city's law that bans 
camping in the park. The guild considers the law unconstitutional.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 2 
EX-DEPUTIES PLEAD GUILTY TO STEALING DRUG MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have pleaded guilty to felony 
charges of stealing money seized in narcotics busts. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Karl Clark, 45, of Glendora, and Paul Rapisarda, 50, of La Palma, 
entered their guilty pleas this week before U.S. District Judge Harry L. 
Hupp.The two became the 20th and 21st former deputies convicted under an 
ongoing investigation by the Big Spender Task Force, said Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Stefan Stein.

 The task force, made up of officials from the FBI, IRS and Sheriff's 
Department, is looking into the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
captured drug profits by deputies connected with the sheriff's Major Violators 
drug-enforcement teams from 1987 to 1989, Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The teams routinely came upon large amounts of currency during their 
investigations, and what we discovered was a large drug money-skimming 
operation," Stein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing for the two will be in late September and early October, he said. 
Clark faces a maximum sentence of 20 years and $500,000 in fines. Rapisarda 
faces a maximum of 23 years in prison and $750,000 in fines.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; SVORINICH 
SAYS HOMELESS ADVOCATES REJECTED DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After weeks of angry protests, rowdy meetings and increasing political 
interest, San Pedro residents were told Tuesday that a compromise had been 
reached that would have stopped plans for a large homeless shelter in their 
community but that homeless advocates backed out of the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 However, officials of Turner's Technical Institute, which proposed opening the 
shelter in surplus Navy housing on Taper Avenue, said no deal had ever been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents San Pedro, told 
about 1,500 residents at a meeting that the institute had agreed orally to move 
its planned project from Navy property to a new site. But institute director 
Johnathon Marzet subsequently refused to sign an agreement, Svorinich told 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Marzet denied ever making a verbal agreement, saying it did not guarantee a 
new site for the shelter if the group gave up the 144 units it plans to use in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 "This memorandum, that Rudy had typed and prepared, was not to the advantage 
of TTI nor the homeless citizens," he said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; DEADLINE 
TODAY TO APPLY FOR QUAKE JOBLESS AID PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today is the last day for residents put out of work by the Northridge quake 
and aftershocks to file federal disaster unemployment relief claims.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who file after March 31 must show "good cause" why their Disaster 
Unemployment Assistance relief claims were late, said state Employment 
Development Department spokeswoman Suzanne Schroeder.Federal disaster relief is 
available for those who cannot get regular unemployment insurance, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The DUA is similar to regular unemployment insurance in terms of benefits 
(which range from $40 yp $230 a week) and duration (26 weeks), but differs in 
eligibility requirements.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal assistance is available for those who were self-employed or were 
to begin working and were unable to do so because of the temblor.  
</P>
<P>
 Self-employed residents filing DUA claims at any EDD office should bring tax 
returns, affidavits from individuals having knowledge of their business or any 
other evidence to verify the self-employment.

FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS; SAFETY: TOUGH SEISMIC STANDARDS THAT COVER PUBLIC 
SCHOOLS DO NOT APPLY TO DAY-CARE FACILITIES OR PRIVATE SCHOOLS. SOME OFFICIALS 
SEE A NEED FOR MORE CONSISTENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN MOFFAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When they finish their classes at public elementary schools, some students in 
Santa Clarita walk across campus to private day-care centers with signs warning 
that the structures do not meet earthquake safety standards and are "NOT TO BE 
USED FOR SCHOOL PURPOSES." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they would not be allowed to attend public school classes in the 
structures, they can legally attend day care there. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the loopholes in state laws designed to keep schoolchildren safe in 
earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make any sense," Gary McGavin, a state seismic safety 
commissioner, says of the patchwork of earthquake regulations. "There's this 
big, gray, Catch-22 area where nobody is taking responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Field Act requires public schools to meet higher seismic safety 
standards than most other buildings. But private schools and day-care centers 
are exempt. So are temporary public classrooms that can be used for up to six 
years during renovations or expansions of permanent buildings. And, although no 
one seems to know why, public school classrooms for the developmentally 
disabled and for pregnant teens are also exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting paradoxes like these, state officials are increasingly questioning 
exemptions involving facilities for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to explain them," Henry Heydt, assistant director of school 
facilities planning at the state Department of Education, said of the differing 
standards. But, he said, "portables are sort of a way of life nowadays. A lot 
of districts are using exemptions." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood) calls the widespread exemptions "a 
very, very scary situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one really publicizes the fact that a public school is not Field Act safe. 
If the parents really knew, (they) would be up in arms about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides design standards, inspection of construction and installation is also 
a concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Private school buildings are not inspected by the state, while public school 
buildings are. In general, private structures are inspected by local building 
authorities and must meet safety standards required of all buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 But many portable units used by private day-care centers on public school 
grounds fall into an almost completely unregulated limbo. They often are 
inspected neither by public school officials nor local building inspectors, who 
say they do not have jurisdiction over school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Portables used by public schools for non-temporary purposes are in general 
@required by the Field Act to have extra-strong construction, and to be bolted 
to a concrete foundation or wooden foundation secured to the ground. They are 
inspected during both manufacture and installation by the Division of the State 
Architect.  
</P>
<P>
 But education sources say portables used by private schools and day-care 
centers are usually built to a somewhat lower standard and rest on dozens of 
tripod-like metal jack stands that are bolted neither to the building nor to 
the ground, but rely on gravity to stay upright. 
</P>
<P>
 Most private schools and day-care centers use techniques less stringent than 
called for in the Field Act because they are cheaper. But the majority of all 
schools installing the structures today use earthquake bracing to increase 
stability, according to Dennis Kakures, who represents companies that rent the 
classrooms. It is not clear, however, how many of the previously installed 
structures have the earthquake bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 There is debate over the safety of structures which do not meet Field 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Many concerns stem from the fact that the support systems of the jack 
stand-mounted portables are similar to those used on mobile homes. In the 
Northridge quake, many mobile homes suffered severe damage, including metal 
jack stands punching up through the floors of the units when they fell off 
their supports. Sometimes stairs blocked doors after the units fell and utility 
lines were severed, creating electrical hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Seismic Safety Commissioner McGavin believes the jack stands pose a serious 
hazard in classrooms during earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If a child were in a portable unit in the duck-and-cover earthquake position 
taught in many schools, "the kid runs a risk of having his head taken off by a 
jack stand coming through the floor," McGavin said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would not want my kid in a trailer," said McGavin of jack stand-mounted 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kakures says the experience of mobile homes is not comparable, 
because many that fell were more than 20 years old, ctood much higher off the 
ground than portable classrooms and lacked seismic bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kakures said that all classroom portables did extremely well in the 
earthquake. He said that he had received reports of only two units that did not 
meet Field Act standards falling off their jack stands in the quake, and none 
of jack stands punching through floors. "The proof is in the results," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 However, Brother Hilarion O'Connor, who is in charge of school construction 
for the Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles, said its portable units will be 
switched to concrete foundations similar to those required by the Field Act, 
because of what was learned in the earthquake. At Catholic schools affected by 
the Northridge quake, portable units on concrete foundations were not damaged, 
while several on jack stands with earthquake bracing fell off their supports.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Duffy, superintendent of the Moorpark School District, testified at a 
recent Seismic Safety Commission hearing that he had all of the jack 
stand-supported units removed from his district following the Whittier Narrows 
earthquake. In that temblor, units on jack stands tumbled off their supports, 
while units on Field Act-approved foundations nearby suffered no damage.  
</P>
<P>
 McGavin, an architect who specializes in designing public structures, 
including schools, says his concerns extend to permanent private school 
buildings as well.  
</P>
<P>
 McGavin said he has seen permanent structures at private schools being rebuilt 
in the San Fernando Valley with techniques he calls "flimsy," such as using 
plywood that is too thin for adequate reinforcement. Although such building 
methods may meet city codes, they would not be permitted in public schools, 
said McGavin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd . . . say private schools should have a code similar to the Field Act," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials, however, say that present regulations are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 And regardless of regulations, some school districts do more than is required 
for earthquake safety. For example, the Los Angeles Unified School District 
puts special education students only in structures that meet Field Act 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Sulphur Springs Union School District in Santa Clarita say 
the portable day-care units they use have seismic bracing and are safe. "I 
wouldn't be worried about having my kids in one," said Nick Teeter, assistant 
superintendent for business services. Warning signs have been posted on 
portable classrooms because the Division of the State Architect instructed 
school districts to do so in order to limit the state's liability, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Martinez, director of a day-care center on the grounds of a Santa Clarita 
school, says she feels that her portable, which has earthquake bracing and the 
warning sign, is safe. "I think (the building) did great" in the earthquake, 
she said. The only major damage was a water line that broke, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for expanding regulations to cover structures like this one, Teeter says 
cost is an issue. "Day care providers probably couldn't afford (to provide 
services) if held to the same standard as public schools. You think everyone 
should be as safe as they possibly can, but you can't afford that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Kakures, renting a typical portable classroom, including 
installation, costs about $12,600 a year for a unit that complies with the 
Field Act, $9,455 a year for a non-complying unit on jack stands with seismic 
bracing and $8,675 for a unit without the bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGavin said cost should not drive safety regulations. "No kid's life is 
worth saving a few dollars," he said.

VIOLENCE AGAIN ROCKS QUIET PENINSULA AREA; CRIME: RANCHO PALOS VERDES IS 
REELING OVER A TRIPLE STABBING THAT LEFT ONE DEAD. THE BLOODSHED FOLLOWS A 
DOUBLE SLAYING AND A SHOOTING NEARBY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The last crime that 83-year-old W. E. Besse can remember happening on 
Manitowac Drive in Rancho Palos Verdes was when a car was stolen from somebody 
up the street -- and that was years ago. So he was stunned when he came home 
from playing golf late Tuesday afternoon and saw a body under a white sheet 
near his house. 
</P>
<P>
 "These days you just don't know what's going to happen," Besse, a retired Army 
colonel, said. "It was kind of a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 The body was that of a 17-year-old San Pedro youth, one of three young men who 
were stabbed in a bloody melee that horrified residents on this quiet street in 
Rancho Palos Verdes, an upscale community on the lush hillsides of the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula. That incident followed two other violent crimes in the 
peninsula area in the previous few days -- the slayings of two Marymount 
College students in San Pedro and a shooting in nearby Rolling Hills Estates 
that left a woman wounded. Some residents wonder whether they are safe anymore 
from the crime that has long plagued people "down the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all suffering a little post-traumatic stress syndrome," said Shannon 
Agnew, who lives across the street from the scene of the stabbings in the 5300 
block of Manitowac Drive. "This is not a war zone, not like L.A. . . . But I 
can't say (violent crime) is just happening over there. Obviously, it's not 
just over there anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistically, crime remains a relative rarity in Rancho Palos Verdes, a 
sprawling community of about 42,000 people whose median household income is 
about $80,000. There were no murders in the city from 1989 to 1991, one in 1992 
and none in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, in addition to Tuesday's fatal stabbing, a body was found in a car 
in an open area near the city limits, although the murder may have occurred 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a shock to my system when I came here," said Sgt. Jim Miller of the 
Lomita sheriff's station, which provides police protection to Rancho Palos 
Verdes. "I'd never seen so many zeros on crime reports." 
</P>
<P>
 But statistics do not reassure some Manitowac Drive residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope (the attack) was an isolated incident," said an 18-year-old neighbor 
who asked not to be identified. "This kind of thing is unheard of up here -- at 
least it was. It was the first time I'd ever seen a dead body." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials say the stabbing incident began when a group of 
teen-agers and young adults were visiting a teen-age girl who lives in a house 
on Manitowac Drive. A group of about eight young males, said to be members of a 
"tagging" gang, showed up at the house, reportedly looking for the girl's 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
 A fistfight between the two groups broke out, sheriff's spokeswoman Diane 
Hecht said, and one of the men ran into the house and grabbed a knife. He came 
back out and stabbed three of the men who allegedly were attacking one of his 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Michael Walsh, 17, died of stab wounds at the scene, Hecht said. 
Jeff Allan Kelly, 18, was taken to Torrance Memorial Hospital and was in 
critical condition on life-support systems. Edward Charles Morales, 17, was 
treated for a stab wound to the back and released. All three young men were 
from San Pedro, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators arrested Neil Christopher Perez, 18, of Torrance at 
his girlfriend's house in Carson and booked him for murder. He was being held 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this had happened anywhere else, it wouldn't have even been reported (by 
the news media)," said a young man who was standing in the driveway where the 
stabbings occurred. "If it had been in L.A. nobody would even care. But because 
it happened in PVE, it's a big deal."

JONES TURNS DALLAS INTO SWITZER-LAND; COWBOYS: ONE DAY AFTER JOHNSON LEAVES, 
FORMER OKLAHOMA COACH GETS THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Switzer, nearly unbeatable in college but untested in the NFL, replaced 
longtime nemesis Jimmy Johnson as coach of the Dallas Cowboys on Wednesday and 
said he wouldn't tinker with a team that won two consecutive Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 "There won't be any changes," Switzer said. "I hope the Cowboys don't change. 
Jimmy and I are a lot alike. We've always been motivated and able to 
communicate to our teams. I just hope I can be compared to what Jimmy did." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, 56, who won three national championships at Oklahoma but left amid 
scandal in 1989, got the job a day after Johnson walked out and ended his 
stormy five years under owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get ready to watch the Dallas Cowboys be the best in the NFL," said Switzer, 
who was Jones' freshman football coach at the University of Arkansas. "We have 
a job to do and we're gonna do it, baby!" 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer will retain every coach on Johnson's staff, including offensive 
coordinator Ernie Zampese and defensive coordinator Butch Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the greatest coaching staff in the NFL," Switzer said. "I competed 
against some of them. I just ask them to give me a chance. Just let me garner 
their respect." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Switzer acted a little overwhelmed at being with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would have an opportunity," he said. "I thought my time had 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Troy Aikman and every assistant coach on Johnson's staff met with 
Jones and Switzer on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Barry is an outstanding coach and the transition should be smooth," 
Aikman said. "I believe he will do a good job. He's keeping the same staff. 
We're keeping the same offense and defense. I think we'll be comfortable with 
what he's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman and Switzer have had a rocky history. Switzer recruited Aikman out of 
Henryetta, Okla., telling him that they were going to a passing offense. 
However, Oklahoma stayed in the ground-bound wishbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman played one game as a freshman in 1984, then started as a sophomore 
until he broke his ankle against Miami in the fourth game of the season. He 
transferred at the end of 1985 to UCLA, where he found immediate stardom in a 
passing offense and eventually became the Cowboys' No. 1 draft pick in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman said he was grateful to Switzer because "he was very helpful getting me 
to a university to do what I do best." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Emmitt Smith, who said on Saturday "if you fire Jimmy, you fire 
me," had calmed down after talking to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said Jerry treated him well with his contract. If Jimmy is satisfied, I'm 
satisfied," he said. "There is no need for me to moan and groan. I have to make 
the best of the situation and keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Michael Irvin, who said, "hell no" when asked if he would play 
for Switzer, was back at Valley Ranch slamming doors and declining interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Irvin would "learn to deal with it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones mentioned Switzer's name in a bar during a tirade against Johnson 
at Orlando last week, it infuriated Johnson to the point of seeking a break 
from Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Switzer had trouble getting their stories straight on when Jones 
first called Switzer. Switzer said, "I got a call last week from Jerry asking 
me if I wanted to coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had said his first contact with Switzer was on Monday, when the tiff 
with Johnson was boiling. Jones backtracked to say he called Switzer last week 
"to avoid embarrassment about mentioning his name." 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing has the chance to really be fun and really be exciting and, most 
importantly, it's going to be successful," Jones said. "I think the excitement 
of being part of the Dallas Cowboys will be sustained. I think we're going to 
be competitive dollars and sense wise." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer and Johnson were assistants at Oklahoma, where Switzer dubbed Johnson 
"Jimmy Jump-Up." They were rivals when Johnson became head coach at Oklahoma 
State, losing every year to the Sooners the five seasons he was there. 
</P>
<P>
 After Johnson moved to Miami, he handed Switzer his only loss three years in a 
row, including the 1988 Orange Bowl for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Switzer resigned after a scandal at Oklahoma that included NCAA 
probation, three players charged with rape, another charged with shooting a 
teammate and the starting quarterback indicted on cocaine-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get to work with 50 professionals now," Switzer said. "I don't miss the 
hassles with the NCAA and recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer said he wanted another job in football because he missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I give my commitment of loyalty, of excellence, of total commitment of making 
this program what it has been in the past and what it will be in the future," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was diplomatic in his response to the news that Switzer replaced him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little bit of a surprise to me, but again, that's Jerry's decision," 
Johnson said on NBC's "Today" show. "We'll just have to wait and see how it 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson visited Valley Ranch early Wednesday, then left, leaving the packing 
to his secretary. Later, he called the accounting department to see if his 
multimillion-dollar check had been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't," a source said. "Coach Johnson will probably get it tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 With Switzer beside him, Jones sought to allay fears among Cowboys' fans that 
he would meddle in the team's on-field activities. Two weeks before this year's 
Super Bowl, Jones irked Johnson by saying there were 500 people -- including 
himself -- who could do as well coaching the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we have one of the most talented teams that there is the NFL, if not 
the most talented team, and one of the best that has ever been put together," 
Jones said. "I feel very confident that the continuity can be kept in place and 
be motivated with the new head coach of the Dallas Cowboys, Barry Switzer." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer coached 16 years at Oklahoma, going 157-29-4, and won or tied for 12 
Big Eight titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas defensive lineman Tony Casillas, who played for Switzer at Oklahoma, 
said, "He's a lot like Jimmy in that he knows how to win, but he knows how to 
have fun, too."

CITY HALL NEWS; PASADENA; COUNCIL BACKS PLAN FOR CIVILIAN POLICE BOARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an action that seemed to disappoint supporters and opponents, the Pasadena 
City Council on Tuesday tentatively approved Police Chief Jerry Oliver's plan 
to place civilians on advisory boards to review complaints against the 
department and recommend discipline against officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 5-1 decision, opposed by Vice Mayor Kathryn Nack, would 
establish three panels to review use of force, disciplinary actions and 
property damage involving police officers, including police car crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 A key part of Oliver's community policing plan, the review boards would 
include up to five officers and three civilians who live or work in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The civilians would be chosen from those who have completed a 45-hour 
department training program called the Civilian Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents complained that the advisory boards had no enforcement 
authority and too few civilians. Police union spokesmen said they did not have 
enough input into the plan and were not happy about having civilians on the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members, noting Oliver first proposed the panels in 1992, said 
they will re-examine the plan in six to eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 "No legislation is engraved in stone," Councilman Bill Crowfoot said. "We 
ought to get off the dime on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Oliver's plan, the boards reviewing use of force and property damage 
would advise Oliver whether officers acted within department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief would make the final decision on disciplinary action against 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Disciplinary cases would go before the third panel, which will render 
recommendations ranging from suspension to demotion to firing. Again, Oliver 
would make the final decision on discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of all three boards would keep findings confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, complaints resulted in internal investigations of 52 cases for 
possible disciplinary action, a spokesman said. The department does not release 
the findings of those personnel actions. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of residents argued Tuesday for an independent citizens police 
review board to investigate complaints of police misconduct and advise the 
council on police issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the chief's proposal, the citizens have no power," said James Lomako, a 
member of the city's Human Relations Commission, which has recommended the 
independent review board. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the commission's proposal, the review board would have no authority 
regarding the discipline of officers, but it could make its findings public. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Diaz, president of the 173-member Pasadena Police Officers Assn., said 
his group is opposed to civilian participation in ongoing investigations that 
could result in discipline of police officers. The association has proposed a 
civilian board to review disciplinary decisions made by the chief.

PUENTE HILLS LANDFILL WINS COURT FIGHT TO KEEP OPERATING; ENVIRONMENT: CLOSING 
IT UNTIL SUITS ARE RESOLVED WOULD DISRUPT REFUSE COLLECTION, JUDGE RULES. 
OPPONENTS WILL APPEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Ending uncertainty over the fate of the Puente Hills Landfill, a Los Angeles 
Superior Court judge has reaffirmed a decision to let it continue accepting 
trash until environmental lawsuits brought by its opponents are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Judge Diane L. Wayne last week allows the Sanitation Districts 
of Los Angeles County to continue operations at the county's second-biggest 
landfill and was a setback for opponents -- a homeowners group, a local school 
district and developer R. R. & C. Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, Judge Wayne does not want to shut this landfill down . . . so we're 
filing a writ of appeal," said Jeffrey D. Dintzer, an attorney for the Hacienda 
Heights Home Improvement Assn. and Hacienda La Puente Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had hoped Wayne would close the landfill at least temporarily after 
ruling last month that the permit issued by the County Board of Supervisors in 
August, 1993, was invalid.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Wayne agreed with Sanitation Districts officials that shutting down 
Puente Hills would cause a major disruption to refuse collection countywide and 
could leave trash in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dintzer said there is plenty of excess landfill space in the county to 
accommodate the trash normally taken to Puente Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's ruling surprised some who thought her previous decisions pointed to 
the certain closure of the landfill, located at the junction of the San Gabriel 
River (605) and Pomona (60) freeways. The site takes in more than 12,000 tons 
of trash daily from 60 cities in the San Gabriel Valley and the southeastern 
portion of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the judge ruled that an environmental study on expanding the 
landfill was inadequate. Specifically, she questioned its analysis of the 
affects on ground-water quality as well as the lack of detail provided on a 
proposed recycling and waste-by-rail facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Wayne invalidated the permit for the landfill because of the 
inadequacy of the environmental report. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials want to expand the landfill to within 1,750 feet of homes 
to extend its life to 2003. But Wayne's latest ruling allows dumping only in 
the existing landfill and not in the proposed expansion area that has been 
challenged. As such, the existing landfill will reach capacity next year, 
according to sanitation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill can stay open while the facility's operators correct inadequacies 
with extra studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The districts made a move toward doing that last Wednesday, when its board 
approved new detailed reports on ground-water effects and decided to separate 
the recycling and waste-by-rail project from the landfill expansion in order to 
reduce delays. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation Districts officials said Wayne would have to approve the division 
and review the studies before they ask county supervisors for a new permit as 
early as May. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dintzer said, "We're going to fight this separation."

NO FOR CITY COUNCIL; TATTOO STUDIO PUT ON HOLD BY CLAREMONT COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CARLSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tattoo studio has gotten under the skin of the Claremont City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont Tattoo operated with no complaints for 18 months out of a store on 
Foothill Boulevard. But then the business moved to 225 Yale Ave. in the heart 
of The Village, a shopping district a block from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation put the needle to council members and other Village merchants, 
who feel a tattoo studio would attract an unsavory crowd and spoil the shopping 
area's family atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 So the council, citing a lack of health regulations governing the tattoo 
industry, approved an urgency ordinance that prohibits the studio from opening 
for four months. During that time, the city will investigate the risks of 
spreading disease via the use and disposal of the needles used in tattooing. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an action is authorized under a state Government Code section that allows 
the council to adopt, by a four-fifths majority, an urgency ordinance necessary 
for "the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety." The 
measure passed, 4-1, with Councilman Nicholas L. Presecan the sole dissenter. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 22 decision, which came a day after the studio opened, left the 
shop's owners shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for something to throw us out on and they haven't (found it), 
so they've come up with this," said co-manager Leah Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel they're too uppity to have a tattoo shop in their city," said 
Pierce, who runs the family-owned studio with her brother, Buddy Tanner. She 
emphasized that the shop, which already has a retail sales license and sells 
incense, silver jewelry and temporary tattoos as well as permanent ones, never 
had any problems from the city at its old location. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother tattooed over 25 Pomona police officers, some teachers and some 
housewives. We get a lot of students. It's not your 'Hell's Angels-type' 
clientele. We use disposable needles and have a hazardous-waste company come 
pick them up," Pierce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just blatant discrimination," she said. 'We were closer to Pomona at our 
last location, and they must have figured we were far enough away. Now that 
we're one block from City Hall, we're just too close to them," said Pierce, who 
said she is researching the possibility of filing a lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials say public safety, not location, is the major reason for 
the four-month wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of needles in this process and no (legal) regulations as to 
how they can be disposed. There seems to be a real void in health regulations 
here," City Manager Glenn D. Southard said. 
</P>
<P>
 A city report on the proposed tattoo studio quotes a study by the Centers for 
Disease Control that describes tattooing as "a process by which blood-borne 
pathogens, including . . . hepatitis B virus and HIV, may be transmitted to or 
from customers and employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Los Angeles County and many other cities, Claremont has no health or 
safety regulations that apply specifically to tattoo parlors, and California 
state law only prohibits tattooing of minors. 
</P>
<P>
 The city staff will use the moratorium to formulate city code amendments that 
would regulate tattoo parlors, Southard said. In the meantime, he said the city 
is willing to allow the studio to sell its silver jewelry and other items so 
that it can stay in business.

BOTH SIDES CLAIM WIN IN SCHOOL DISTRICT UNIFICATION RULING; EDUCATION: JUDGE'S 
DECISION SEEMS TO HAVE INVALIDATED ELECTION THAT CREATED SPECIAL SAN GABRIEL 
SCHOOL ZONE. THE NEXT STEP IS UNCLEAR.

<P>
 Only days before San Gabriel residents will vote on a $29.9-million bond 
measure to build a high school, a Superior Court judge has cast doubt over the 
fate of the school and its district. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling last week by Los Angeles Judge Diane Wayne has both Alhambra and 
San Gabriel school officials claiming victory in a lawsuit contesting the 
validity of San Gabriel's 1992 unification election. 
</P>
<P>
 The election created San Gabriel Unified School District from what was 
formerly an elementary district. Plans to open a high school next year are 
under way, and a bond issue on the April 12 ballot would fund construction of 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suit filed by Alhambra school officials charged that the state Board 
of Education incorrectly certified the 1992 election, which excluded Alhambra 
voters. As a result, Alhambra school officials said, the election is invalid 
and the San Gabriel Unified School District does not legitimately exist. 
</P>
<P>
 The order issued March 22 by Wayne leaves that open to dispute, and both sides 
believe the uncertain wording vindicates their position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge did not set aside the school district called San Gabriel Unified 
School District," San Gabriel Supt. Gary Goodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the decision essentially invalidates the election," said Mia 
Montpas, attorney for Alhambra Unified. "If the election is invalid there is no 
longer a San Gabriel Unified School District." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's clerk said, "It appears that it sets aside the election, but it does 
not say on its face." 
</P>
<P>
 In her ruling, Wayne said the reorganization would not result in racial or 
ethnic discrimination or segregation, nor would it disrupt educational 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she wrote, its racial and financial impacts, including the loss of 
both per-student funding and an adult school facility, would be of great 
concern to Alhambra voters. Since their interests were at stake, she said, 
their exclusion from the election violated a constitutional right to equal 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne's decision was modeled on a case in which a state court ruled that 
Fullerton High School District residents had the right to vote on the secession 
of Yorba Linda from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the Fullerton case, which was decided before an election, the 
Alhambra lawsuit challenged an election that occurred two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodson, the San Gabriel superintendent, said, "We're duly recognized by the 
state treasurer, L.A. County, and Sacramento. We've entered into contracts with 
teachers, spent money on modernization. There's a whole lot of business that's 
been done in the name of San Gabriel Unified School District. You can't just 
unwind all that." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Wolfertz, an attorney for the state Board of Education, said that while 
Wayne's decision appears to invalidate the 1992 election, it is not clear what 
that will mean for the San Gabriel district or the pending bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling throws into question not only the existing district but its plans 
for expansion. The district has hired a high school principal and teachers and 
has registered students for fall.  
</P>
<P>
 They will attend class at what is now Jefferson Intermediate and the bond 
issue, if approved, would fund construction of the new Gabrielino High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Wayne's ruling, Alhambra officials will draft a court order for her 
signature and Montpas said she expects to file it by Friday. Ultimately, she 
added, Alhambra officials hope to reverse the election, return San Gabriel to 
an elementary district and ban San Gabriel from operating as a unified district 
pending any appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dan Mooney, who would become principal of Gabrielino High School, said the 
San Gabriel district will proceed with its current plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until there's a final decision, we are unified and must provide, according to 
the law, a high school education program for our ninth- through 12th-graders," 
Mooney said.

 Orchard Supply Hardware Stores Corp. will open stores in Pasadena and South 
Pasadena this spring, filling voids in the west San Gabriel Valley's home 
improvement market created by the closing of the Builders Emporium chain. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose-based Orchard Supply plans to open its Pasadena store on East 
Colorado Boulevard on April 30 and its South Pasadena store on Fair Oaks Avenue 
on May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The new stores are two of six that are scheduled to open in the Los Angeles 
area by mid-May, marking Orchard Supply's entrance in the Southern California 
market. The 63-year-old publicly held company now has 43 stores in Central and 
Northern California. The Southland stores are all opening in former Builders 
Emporium stores, which have an average of about 35,000 square feet of retail 
floor space. 
</P>
<P>
 Builders Emporium decided last August to pull the plug on its 82 California 
retail outlets. The company's sales had been battered by the Southland's 
housing slump and by increasing competition from warehouse-style stores such as 
Home Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Orchard Supply officials say Home Depot is formidable competition for them, 
too, but point out that the two chains have different emphases. Orchard Supply 
specializes in tools and "fix-it" electrical and plumbing hardware, while Home 
Depot carries more building materials for new construction. Orchard Supply 
doesn't carry lumber, which represents a large portion of Home Depot's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pasadena and South Pasadena Orchard Supply stores will each create an 
estimated 125 jobs, paying from $6 to $12.50 an hour, a company spokesman said.

 Eaton Canyon Nature Center is the kind of place that gets lemons and makes 
lemonade. 
</P>
<P>
 After last October's wildfires scorched the center's 184-acre wilderness park 
and burned down its building, park supporters spent little time lamenting the 
loss. And the center's director blissfully announced: "We'll have a fantastic 
fire ecology park." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, busloads of children and carloads of hikers have been watching how 
nature responds to a fire. And the county and park volunteers are in the 
process of not only rebuilding the structure, but adding and improving, perhaps 
with new wildlife exhibits or medicinal-plant gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Two upcoming public hearings will give people a chance to offer more ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is scheduled for 7 tonight at Farnsworth Park, 568 East Mt. Curve 
Ave. in Pasadena. The other hearing is set for 7 p.m. on April 28 at the Los 
Angeles County Arboretum, 301 Baldwin Ave. in Arcadia. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearings, the county will draw up preliminary building plans to 
determine how much funding will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency 
Services have agreed to cover the bulk of the rebuilding costs, which county 
officials estimate will amount to more than $2.5 million. That only covers the 
cost of building a center identical to the original. Volunteers who have long 
supported the park hope to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the 
new center even better. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Eaton Canyon nature center structure, built in 1963, was a 
5,300-square-foot stucco building. It had a gift shop, library, 186-seat 
auditorium and geology, plant and animal exhibits.  
</P>
<P>
 After the first of the public meetings on the new center was held last month, 
several suggestions surfaced. For instance, some want the new center to be made 
of more costly materials, possibly an adobelike substance that is supposed to 
be sturdy and fireproof, and blend in well with the natural surroundings. Many 
center supporters would also like energy-efficient heating and cooling systems 
to be installed.  
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion is that the old center's auditorium be replaced by a 
multipurpose room with a kitchen. That room could be rented for meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 The new building may end up being slightly larger than the former and may be 
relocated to an area closer to the parking lot, according to Mickey Long, the 
center's director. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising efforts are off to a good start: In addition to sparking a 
colorful array of wildflowers that are beginning to bloom amid the ashes in the 
park, the October fire has triggered newfound support for the center from San 
Gabriel Valley nature lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since the October blaze, the volunteer organization Eaton Canyon Nature Center 
Associates has collected about $66,000 in donations -- 10 times what the 
center's volunteer gift shop would raise in a year, according to group 
President Cynthia Null. Also since the fire, she said, the group's membership 
list has tripled from about 260.  
</P>
<P>
 The group also has received grants totaling about $53,000 from conservation 
organizations such as the Santa Monica Mountain Conservancy and the 
Pasadena-based Flintridge Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Null said, the group hopes to raise $500,000 over the next three years 
to help pay for construction of the nature center and furnishings.

 Three local hospitals are working on a prostate cancer prevention trial with 
the National Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-year study of 18,000 volunteers nationwide will involve Huntington 
Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Methodist Hospital of Southern California in 
Arcadia and St. Luke Medical Center in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The study will test the effectiveness of the drug finasteride in the 
prevention of prostate cancer. It is a double-blind trial, which means that 
neither the men participating nor the study physicians will be told who is 
taking the drug and who is taking a placebo. 
</P>
<P>
 During the study, test hospitals will provide pills, and an annual exam and 
blood test. Between visits, hospital staff will check on participants by 
telephone. In seven years, participants will undergo a prostate gland biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible volunteers should be at least 55 years old, in good health, 
cancer-free in the past five years and free of chemotherapy or radiation 
treatment. Also, participants must have a normal rectal exam and test negative 
for prostate cancer. Special efforts are being made to recruit African American 
men because they have a higher rate of prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 One out of seven men older than 55 will be found to have prostate cancer. It 
is the second most common form of cancer -- after lung cancer -- among men in 
the United States.

 A 30-year-old Glendora man remains paralyzed after being shot three times 
during a botched robbery attempt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Tufia arrived at the offices of the Nationwide Consultants Group at 
1025 W. Arrow Highway about 9 a.m. Sunday and shots were fired, said Glendora 
Police Sgt. Tim Pfeiffer.Tufia was hit in the leg, left lung and spine, but 
managed to get to a phone and call 911. He remains hospitalized and doctors 
think he will be paralyzed for the rest of his life, Pfeiffer said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pfeiffer said Tufia is an alleged con man and is wanted by the FBI. He 
apparently was expected to be carrying a large amount of cash when he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on information provided by Tufia, police on Sunday arrested a co-owner 
of Nationwide Consultants, Robert Kirkland Comas, 23, of Upland, and Eugene 
Campbell, 22, of Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were arraigned in Citrus Municipal Court on Tuesday and charged with 
attempted murder and robbery with intent to cause great bodily injury, Pfeiffer 
said. The two remain in custody in County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail each.

 ALHAMBRA: A gunman stole an undisclosed amount of cash from the registers at 
the Grocery Warehouse at 1000 E. Valley Blvd., police reported Friday. The man, 
who was armed with a large-caliber handgun, walked into the store about 10:15 
a.m. and demanded money. No injuries were reported and no arrests have been 
made. 
</P>

 AZUSA: Two men were arrested Tuesday after neighbors allegedly saw them 
breaking into an apartment and alerted police. David Soto, 28, and Andrew 
Ramirez, 30, of Azusa were stopped by officers as they drove away from an 
apartment complex at 601 E. 8th St. about 9:30 a.m., police said. The back seat 
of their car held a TV, a VCR, a stereo and other items taken from the 
unoccupied apartment, police said. Both were charged with burglary. Soto is 
being held at Azusa Jail in lieu of $30,000 bail and Ramirez is being held 
without bail because of a parole violation, police said.

Sunday in the 13700 block of Francisquito Avenue, police said. Joseph Salas 
died at Queen of the Valley Hospital in West Covina about 10:30 p.m., about 
three hours after the shooting. Details in the killing are sketchy, but 
witnesses said Salas and another man in his late teens spoke briefly before the 
other man drew a gun and fired several rounds into Salas' chest. Police suspect 
the shooting was gang-related.

<P>
 EL MONTE: A 23-year-old El Monte resident was arrested Thursday after police 
served a search warrant on his home in the 4100 block of La Madera Avenue about 
2 p.m. and found a homemade bomb. After the sheriff's bomb squad defused the 
device without incident, John Peter Archer was arrested on suspicion of 
possessing and manufacturing an explosive device at his workplace in Vernon. 
Police said they also found a pipe bomb and some explosive chemicals at a 
garage Archer rented in Arcadia. He is in County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 WEST COVINA: Robert Ellis Archie, 30, was shot to death as he sat in his car 
at Vine Avenue and St. Malo Street Sunday, police said. Apparently a large, 
dark car pulled up next to him as he waited at the intersection about 10 p.m. 
and shots were fired into Archie's vehicle from a large-caliber handgun. Archie 
was taken to Queen of the Valley Hospital, where he was pronounced dead, police 
said. They said the killing may be gang-related.

 GOLDEN SEATS: For her upcoming singing appearances at Anaheim Arena, Barbra 
Streisand is letting several charity groups each buy 250 "Golden Circle" 
tickets to resell for their own fund raising. One of them is the Alliance for 
Children's Rights, based in Los Angeles. Its spokesman, Jeffrey Schwartz, calls 
it "a fantastic opportunity." . . . Adds Schwartz: "We still have to pay $350 
for each ticket, but we're selling them for $1,000 each, so we'll make a very 
nice profit." Scalper prices for Golden Circle tickets, he predicts, will go 
well above $1,000.

 DEAN OF BOOKS: Books of all kinds can become collector's items, but fantasy 
and horror are areas of particular interest. (OC Live!) One of the most 
collectible authors in those genres is Dean Koontz of Newport Beach. First 
editions of some of his books, such as "Phantoms" and "Whispers," can sell for 
$300 and up. . . . "He's by far the biggest author in Orange County" among 
collectors, says James Cahill, of Cahill's Book Store in Fountain Valley. 
Nationally, "he's not quite as big as Stephen King, but he's close." 
</P>
<P>
 HIS INSPIRATION: Roxie Campanella did not get the publicity of her late 
husband, Roy, the Hall of Fame catcher for the Los Angeles Dodgers. But family 
friends credit her for being the inspiration for her husband, always at his 
side after his career was cut short when a car accident left him paralyzed. . . 
. Now she's in the spotlight herself. She'll be the speaker at the Anaheim 
Family YMCA's Good Friday services at the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 BREN BUCKS: Irvine Co. Chairman Donald Bren, a reclusive sort rarely seen or 
heard in public, lets his money do the talking when it comes to politics. Bren 
recently ponied up $50,000 to the campaign of Gov. Pete Wilson, a longtime 
chum. The cash accompanies another $50,000 the Irvine Co. has donated to the 
governor. . . . Such generosity isn't new for Bren. The developer has been 
helping Wilson since 1975, and hosted a fund-raiser for him in 1989 that 
brought in $86,200.

 TAKING NO CHANCES: The "Jackson Family Honors" TV special, which aired in 
February, has had trouble from the start. The latest came this week with word 
that the crew may still be owed about $2 million. Well, there is some good 
news. The $25,000 allocated to Northridge Hospital Medical Center should arrive 
in April. . . . "I'm not stupid," said a charity official. "The money has 
always been in the bank."

 SCRIBE SCRUBBED: She thought it was going to be a friendly game of Scrabble 
with Grandma's friends. One problem: Grandma's friends didn't cooperate. They 
played serious Scrabble, giving writer Suzanne Schlosberg a quick lesson in 
humility. . . . The wordsmiths belong to the Dee Mandeson San Fernando Valley 
Scrabble Club, which meets weekly in Granada Hills (E1). 
</P>
<P>
 PUNISHMENT: His initials are B. K., and he's a college coach who knows how to 
get angry. No, not Bobby Knight. Try Bill Kernen, CSUN's baseball coach. 
Furious with his team's mediocre play (17-16) this season, he barred players 
from the clubhouse and wouldn't let them wear team jerseys in Wednesday's 2-1 
loss to Cal Lutheran (C8). Mike Vasey, above, sports the plain-wrap black shirt 
sported by CSUN players. . . . At least Kernen didn't throw any chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 SELLING EDUCATION: Public TV is going retail, and why not? Pledge breaks don't 
exactly break the bank. So KCET-TV, Channel 28, will open a Store of Knowledge 
at the Glendale Galleria, selling books, games and puzzles. . . . "It's 
absolutely essential we develop new sources of revenue," said William H. Kobin, 
KCET's president (F1). 
</P>
<P>
 TALENTED TEEN: Kudos to Derek Kwan, 17, of Agoura Hills, who won the jazz 
instrumental category of the Music Center Spotlight Awards at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion this week. . . . Derek, playing sax and flute, "blew everyone 
away," according to one organizer. Along with the cheers came a $5,000 prize.

 Israeli warplanes attacked hilltop bases of Lebanese guerrillas on Wednesday, 
in the latest clash in nearly two months of heightened tension in southern 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike on Hezbollah positions in the hills of Iqlim el Tuffah came hours 
after guerrillas fired three rockets into an Israeli-held enclave in southern 
Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no reports of casualties from either attack, security sources said, 
speaking on condition of anonymity. Four Israeli soldiers and seven guerrillas 
have died this year in similar clashes.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PIECE STILL MISSING IN GUATEMALA PEACE MOSAIC; CENTRAL AMERICA: 
THREE-YEAR DEADLOCK IN LENGTHY CIVIL WAR IS BROKEN. BUT THE QUESTION OF 
ATROCITIES REMAINS UNRESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Intense international pressure has helped force the two sides in Guatemala's 
long civil war to break a three-year deadlock and agree on a human rights 
treaty and a timetable aimed at bringing peace by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The accords, participants in the negotiations say, take Guatemala a big step 
closer to ending the oldest, last war in Central America; they give a boost to 
the besieged administration of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Guatemala's government and its leftist guerrillas gathered amid 
fanfare Tuesday evening in Mexico City to sign the documents, a crucial element 
was missing: 
</P>
<P>
 To get the government to sign, the guerrillas agreed to put aside, 
momentarily, their demand for a commission to investigate atrocities committed 
in a war that claimed some 100,000 lives, many of them Mayan peasants killed by 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides agreed to discuss the commission later, but its exclusion from 
the new and widely praised agreements underscores the fact that a host of 
sensitive and divisive issues that go to the heart of the Guatemalan conflict 
have yet to be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the accords, signed as a high-level mission from the United Nations and 
diplomats from six countries looked on, come after nearly three years of talks 
in which the Guatemalans could agree on little. Had participants failed to 
reach agreement, the talks probably would have been doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a historic date for peace in Guatemala," De Leon said in Guatemala 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good accomplishment," Miguel Angel Sandoval, a member of the 
guerrillas' political committee, said Wednesday. "It does not fill all of our 
hopes, but it is a very positive step." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the human rights accord, the two sides signed a timetable for monthly 
meetings to discuss issues ranging from land reform to indigenous rights. The 
timetable establishes December as the date for a final peace treaty and 
demobilization of the rebels who have fought Guatemalan governments for 33 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these problems -- like land -- have plagued Guatemala for a century; 
some -- like the resettlement of refugees -- are extremely complicated. It is 
unclear how they will be resolved by the year's end. "They are very complex 
(issues), but if the will to solve them exists, they will be solved," Sandoval 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significant in the accords signed Tuesday, the government for the first 
time will allow U.N. human rights monitors into Guatemala, a country with one 
of the worst human rights records in the hemisphere. The accords also ban 
paramilitary groups and clandestine jails; end forced army recruitment; 
guarantee the right of free movement and association, and provide protection 
for human rights workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The guerrillas' earlier insistence on including the war crimes commission had 
been a major stumbling block until now. Their willingness to postpone it helped 
make the accords possible, but it angered human rights activists at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for the guerrillas, grouped in the Guatemalan National Revolutionary 
Union, say they are confident the commission will be established by May. But 
the government, and especially the army that backs it, vigorously oppose an 
investigation of war atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemalan generals look with trepidation at neighboring El Salvador, where a 
Truth Commission established as part of peace accords that ended the Salvadoran 
civil war blamed most massacres and torture on the military. The Salvadoran 
army was purged and has lost much of its power. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, veteran observers weary of Guatemalan talks that go nowhere were 
counting their blessings with the progress that was achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the separation of the war crimes commission, the talks advanced in 
large part because of pressure from the United Nations, the United States and 
five other countries that are lobbying for peace as the "Friends of Guatemala." 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations late last year appointed gifted mediator Jean Arnault to 
assume control of the talks. And in negotiating sessions in Mexico in January 
and again last week, powerful U.N. trouble-shooter Marrack Goulding, 
undersecretary general for political affairs, sat down with the two sides. 
Goulding was instrumental in the El Salvador settlement, often cited as a U.N. 
success story despite lingering trouble there. 
</P>
<P>
 American officials in Guatemala have also been taking a more activist role. 
They have impressed upon De Leon the importance of stopping the last war in the 
region as the best way to attract investment and heal Guatemala's battered 
economy.

TRADING IN FUTURES MARKETS NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Futures markets allow investors to buy or sell a specific amount of a 
commodity (such as gold, pork bellies or heating oil), or financial instrument 
(Treasury bills or a stock-market index) at a particular price in a stipulated 
future month. 
</P>
<P>
 By buying a futures contract, you can control a fairly large investment with a 
fairly small amount of money. That's because you're allowed to use "leverage" 
-- a fancy term for making a purchase with a very low down payment. A $1,000 
investment, for example, might buy you a contract for $20,000 worth of wheat. 
If wheat prices rise just 5% -- a gain of $1,000 on your contract -- you've 
just doubled your money. However, if they drop by the same amount, you lose 
your $1,000 investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse still, if prices drop more than 5%, you could lose far more than your 
initial investment. If your wheat contract suddenly was worth just $10,000, you 
lose $11,000 -- the $1,000 you put in initially plus the $10,000 investment 
loss, plus any brokerage fees you paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Many professional traders use the futures markets to hedge risk. If they plan 
to buy a huge amount of pork bellies in the future, they can buy a futures 
contract to protect themselves in case the price of bellies rises or falls by 
the time they want to take delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 5% of futures trades now involve agricultural products, which in 
the 1970s accounted for three-fourths of all trades. Currently, most futures 
trades involve financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing hasn't changed: The vast majority of traders lose money in the 
commodities markets, says David Gary, a spokesman for the Commodities Futures 
Trading Commission in Washington. Roughly 80% of all the people who invest in 
commodities come out losers after trading costs are taken into account, he 
says. KATHY M. KRISTOF

REP. NATCHER; HELD RECORD OF 18,401 VOTES IN ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. William H. Natcher, a courtly and ever-vigilant Democratic legislator who 
earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records for his unbroken string of 
18,401 votes in Congress, has died at the age of 84. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky congressman died Tuesday night of heart failure at Bethesda Naval 
Hospital near Washington, according to a statement from his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June, 1992, Natcher had been chairman of the House Appropriations 
Committee, which controls most discretionary spending. His record 40-year 
string of consecutive floor votes ended March 3 when his failing health 
prevented him from reaching the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, he had been wheeled onto the House floor on a gurney for what 
would be his final vote, hooked to oxygen and intravenous tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 Natcher later said that he knew his unbroken series of votes would come to an 
end, but said he would try to keep it up "because I believe members of Congress 
should vote." 
</P>
<P>
 The House halted business to honor him when the voting streak hit 18,000 in 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously proud of his record, Natcher once confessed to The Times that it 
could also be a burden hung around his neck. "I wouldn't say it's an anvil -- 
but it's something similar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, who recently presented the hospitalized Natcher with the 
Presidential Citizens' Medal, commented from his vacation retreat in Coronado, 
Calif.: "Some may think that Bill Natcher's death marks the end of an era in 
politics. I hope not. I hope that Congressman Natcher's devotion to public 
service serves as an inspiration to the young men and women of America for as 
long as his voting record stands." 
</P>
<P>
 In 40 years on Capitol Hill, Natcher never took a campaign contribution, 
filmed a political advertisement or even hired a press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 He won 20 elections the old-fashioned way, by driving by himself around 
Kentucky's mostly rural 2nd District, shaking hands and stopping to chat. He 
paid his campaign expenses out of his own pocket and rarely spent more than 
$10,000 on a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Natcher was born in Bowling Green and grew up on a Kentucky farm. He graduated

FRANCES DONALDSON, 87; HER BIOGRAPHY OF EDWARD VIII WAS BASIS FOR MOVIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Frances Donaldson, who wrote an award-winning biography of Edward VIII, the 
king who abdicated in 1936 to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Warfield Simpson, 
has died. She was 87. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord John Donaldson said his wife died Sunday of cancer at their London home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1974 biography of the king of England won the Wolfson Literary Award and 
was the basis for the 1981 HBO movie "Edward and Mrs. Simpson." Lady Donaldson 
served as script supervisor for the TV film, which won an Emmy for "Masterpiece 
Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Donaldson's first biography, in 1957, was "Freddy Lonsdale," a loving but 
candid portrait of her father, a playwright and bon vivant. 
</P>
<P>
 Her other books included a sketch of author Evelyn Waugh, a biography of 
humorist P.G. Wodehouse and a history of the Royal Opera House. 
</P>
<P>
 When her "P.G. Wodehouse: A Biography" was published in 1982, a year after the 
humorist's centenary observance, Charles Champlin wrote in a Los Angeles Times 
review: "It is worth waiting for because it is a superior piece of biographical 
research and a careful job of literary placement." 
</P>
<P>
 Lady Donaldson wrote two autobiographies, "Child of the Twenties" in 1959 and 
"A Twentieth Century Life" in 1992.

WENDELL NILES, 89; VETERAN RADIO, TELEVISION ANNOUNCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wendell Niles, a veteran radio and television announcer who worked with such 
performers as Bob Hope, George Burns and Milton Berle, has died at his San 
Fernando Valley home. He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
 A Toluca Lake resident for 55 years, Niles died Monday of cancer, said his 
son, Wendell Niles Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his many credits, Niles served as announcer for such radio and 
television programs as "The Bob Hope Show," "The Milton Berle Show," "The 
Colgate Comedy Hour," "The Tennessee Ernie Ford Show," "It Could Be You" and 
"The Chase and Sanborn Hour," with ventriloquist Edgar Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the greatest radio personalities of our time and he was a great 
friend," Berle said in a prepared statement. "He had one of the best voices the 
radio has ever known." 
</P>
<P>
 Niles also appeared in more than three dozen motion pictures, including the 
1940 film "Knute Rockne, All American," with Ronald Reagan. In 1960, he was 
honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his son, Wendell, Niles is survived by another son, Richard 
Niles; a brother, Donald Niles; a sister, Grace Campbell, and nine 
grandchildren.

CNN ACCUSED OF CONTEMPT FOR AIRING NORIEGA TAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cable News Network was charged Wednesday with criminal contempt for 
broadcasting tape recordings of ousted Panamanian leader Manuel A. Noriega's 
prison conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN was charged with "knowingly and willfully" disobeying an order from 
Noriega's trial judge by broadcasting translated excerpts of conversations 
between Noriega and his attorneys' staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is a constitutional showdown over freedom of the press and fair-trial 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Network attorneys pleaded not guilty, and U.S. District Judge William M. 
Hoeveler scheduled a non-jury trial to begin July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "CNN welcomes the opportunity for Judge Hoeveler to hear all the evidence in 
this matter and believes it will not be found to have violated any of the 
court's orders," CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, the company would face a fine, with the judge deciding the 
amount. No individuals are named in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge was filed by Robert Dunlap, a former federal prosecutor appointed 
by Hoeveler to review the tapes issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nina Vinik, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union in Florida, 
called the criminal charge inappropriate but said CNN was wrong in broadcasting 
the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our position that criminal sanctions against the press are not an 
appropriate means to dealing with this kind of problem," she said. "But 
absolutely, the stuff was privileged and should never have been disclosed, and 
the person or persons responsible for that disclosure should certainly be 
pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 CNN never revealed the source who leaked the tapes, routinely recorded by the 
U.S. Bureau of Prisons, as Noriega was preparing his trial defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The network stopped airing the tapes when the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of 
Appeals in Atlanta upheld Hoeveler's order banning broadcast. The U.S. Supreme 
Court refused to review the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 One broadcast covered Noriega speculating about whether two Panamanians 
captured after the U.S. invasion that ousted him from power in December, 1989, 
would testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Noriega is serving 40 years in the same prison southwest of Miami where the 
tapes were made.

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; PACOIMA'S OUTSPOKEN,TIRELESS 
BOOSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By REBECCA BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Marie Harris first set foot in Pacoima in September, 1959, her impulse 
was to turn around and run. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got off the train, I thought, 'Oh God, where is California?' " she 
said. "I thought California was palm trees and streets paved with gold and 
diamonds. When I got off the train, I will never forget that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 35 years later, Harris has become a tireless booster of the small 
northeast San Fernando Valley community. 
</P>
<P>
 For her work, the sometimes controversial, always outspoken Harris has been 
named Woman of the Year for the 39th District of Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Houston, Harris was raised in Pittsburgh by a mother and stepfather 
she adored. She still carries her mother's identification as an auxiliary 
policewoman in her wallet. Her mother was a joiner, involved in civic and 
community activities, volunteering much of her time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swore I wasn't going to be like her when I got grown," Harris remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plaques of recognition and thanks on her living room wall hint that 
she didn't live up to that vow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, where she lived with her husband and three children, Harris was 
the toast of the fashion community, running her own design house. They had 
moved to Detroit only as a compromise. Harris' husband wanted to move to 
California. She refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was like the other side of the world to me," she said. "I didn't want to 
be that far away from my family." 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1959, she relented. And at first she hated Pacoima. She traveled to the 
more affluent areas of Los Angeles for fashion shows, spending little time in 
her new home. 
</P>
<P>
 But when her children started school, her focus shifted. 
</P>
<P>
 "To make a better place for them, I knew I had to get involved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She started meeting other community members. She also started hearing from 
friends around the state about Pacoima's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that happens in Pacoima is blasted as a negative. Even if it's done 
in a surrounding area, it's labeled Pacoima," she said. "All this bad publicity 
we were getting." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1979, Harris founded the Pacoima Property Owners Assn. to unite residents 
to improve the community and its image. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Harris started the "Back to Pacoima Expo" to spotlight the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was to honor our many, many superstars, our business and professional 
people and the trailblazers who were here long before I got here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer festival at Hansen Dam lasted seven years until it got too big to 
handle financially, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 She took a break from the Expo, expecting to bring it back the following year. 
Harris said she became too busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris has served as executive director of the Pacoima Chamber of Commerce, 
ran unsuccessfully for a City Council seat, organized the community for a 
"Peace on Our Streets" campaign after the second Rodney G. King beating trial 
and been named honorary mayor of Pacoima. She's put on beauty pageants, fashion 
shows and picked up a couple of papal citations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The foundation of our community remains strong in large part because of 
Marie's fortitude, courage and enthusiasm," said Katz, who nominated Harris for 
the Woman of the Year award. "With the strength of Marie's visions, the 
community of Pacoima will never wane." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Perkins, president of the San Fernando Valley section of the National 
Council of Negro Women, said Harris was an important part in forming the 
section three years ago. Harris is one of the first 50 charter members of the 
Valley section. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is one of the people, as a new community leader, I really look up to and 
admire for her dedication to the community, her consistency and her willingness 
to help after some 30 years," Perkins said. "You can always call on her and 
she's always fully available to help."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To Southern Californians schooled in the nuances of our region's varied 
landscapes and mind-sets, Orange County and Los Angeles may seem light-years 
apart at times. But to visitors from around the nation and abroad, this is not 
necessarily so. For them, all Southern California is likely to be one big "L.A. 
Story," and from afar it has a coherence, even today when sunny images of 
Hollywood and Disneyland seem all too frequently to give way to morbid 
projections of life on the brink of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County leaders and tourism industry officials have been giving some 
thought lately to how they might position the county to lure visitors, even in 
the face of all the far-reaching depictions of the region's earthquakes, fires 
and other horrors. They are planning to hold a tourism summit, and 
understandably they are interested in featuring Orange County as a safe 
destination. Some also are tempted to go a step farther and say, as a few 
indeed have, that Orange County should separate itself completely from Los 
Angeles as a tourist destination. The latest from the realm of the unthinkable, 
the murder of two Japanese students during a carjacking in San Pedro, was 
especially compelling because the Japanese tourist is so vital to tourism here. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, we are one region for better or worse, in sickness and in 
health, in times of balmy sunshine and in times of rattled nerves. Orange 
County developed as an attractive suburb -- in many ways a psychological 
alternative to Los Angeles, and a geographically handy one at that. 
Increasingly, however, the evidence has been of the two counties' interrelated 
destinies, not of their independence and isolation. Moreover, what happened 
outside a supermarket in a "safe" area of San Pedro no longer can be considered 
an impossibility in "safe" Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not hard to see how the idea of deliberately distancing Orange County 
from Los Angeles may tempt some tourism interests. But an 
Orange-County-versus-L.A.-County strategy is not a wise course when the 
fortunes of both areas in fact are linked.

KINGS MIGHTY CLOSE TO ELIMINATION, 5-2; HOCKEY: DUCKS KEEP THIN PLAYOFF HOPES 
ALIVE WITH FIRST VICTORY AT FORUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clearly, there is a lot more than four points separating the Mighty Ducks and 
the Kings in the Western Conference standings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither team has been mathematically eliminated from the playoff 
race, any realistic postseason chances evaporated when the San Jose Sharks 
picked up seven of a possible eight points on a tough trip last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was easy to tell which team is worth watching the final two-plus weeks 
remaining in the season. With their 5-2 victory over the Kings, the Ducks 
showed on Wednesday they haven't departed from their usual tenacious style, 
which earned them their 30th victory of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (25-40-11) haven't departed from their normal lackluster style, 
either. They have showed very little fire and very little pride this season and 
displayed an appalling inattention to the basic tenets of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven games remaining, the Ducks (30-42-5) are eight points behind the 
Sharks in the race for the final playoff spot. The Kings have eight games left 
and trail San Jose by 12 points and the Ducks by four. Anaheim lost the season 
series, 4-2, but the Ducks won the final two meetings and this was their first 
victory at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, the Kings didn't get the message after Coach Barry Melrose pulled 
them off the ice Monday, about 30 minutes into a sub-par practice. Now, it 
seems to be a matter of days before it becomes official -- the Kings will be 
the first team in 24 years to miss the playoffs after reaching the Stanley Cup 
finals the previous season. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion Ducks, who finished strongly with three third-period goals, are 
still trying to hit their goals. The scoring highlight for the Ducks was center 
Stephan Lebeau's pool-type shot from behind the net that banked in off King 
goaltender Kelly Hrudey into the net at 5:54 of the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like something Wayne Gretzky would make. "I'm not 10% as good as he 
is, but tonight it worked," Lebeau said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, making the playoffs are a bit more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel we have hope, the light is growing dim, though," said Duck 
Coach Ron Wilson. "To get 30 wins, is the last thing I expected. Florida has 32 
wins, we would like to pass them up."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Melrose: "I don't have anything smart to say to you guys. We just didn't 
make the play." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game, there were memories of a happier time for the Kings -- like 
last week. There was a 15-minute ceremony honoring Gretzky, who became the 
NHL's all-time leader when he passed Gordie Howe with his 802nd goal on March 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe, citing a family obligation, was not at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Bruce McNall gave Gretzky a gift from the organization, a $275,000 black 
Rolls-Royce convertible, which was driven out onto the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel a little embarrassed standing here and getting this car, but 
I'll take it," Gretzky said. 
</P>
<P>
 King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kariya won't join the Mighty Ducks this season. Contract talks between 
the Ducks and Kariya's agent, Don Baizley, have been suspended until the World 
Championships in Italy conclude in May, according to Anaheim General Manager 
Jack Ferreira.

NBA ROUNDUP; PACERS BEAT CELTICS, THEN CALL FOR A BOSTON PLUMBER

 Enough of this lore stuff. There's no more magic at Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, no hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 After Indiana defeated the Celtics, 103-99, Wednesday night, assuring Boston 
of a losing record at home for the first time in a quarter-century, the Pacers 
found only one working shower in the visitors' locker room at ancient Boston 
Garden -- and it had ice-cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's freezing. That's a damn shame," snapped Byron Scott, preparing to head 
out into a wintry, windy 39-degree night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Pacers loudly cursed the Boston Garden, which is to be torn down at the 
end of next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rik Smits had 21 points, and five teammates also scored in double figures for 
Indiana, which won at Boston Garden for the first time since Nov. 24, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've watched Boston play, and they certainly aren't the team they were in the 
past," said Pacer Coach Larry Brown, who got his 700th pro coaching victory. 
That total includes 230 in the ABA. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Fox had 28 points and 11 rebounds for Boston, which has lost five in a 
row at Boston Garden. The Celtics have lost 21 of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacer point guard Pooh Richardson suffered a separated right shoulder in the 
second quarter when he collided with Celtic forward Xavier McDaniel. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 111, Miami 101 -- Kenny Anderson scored nine points in a 21-7 spurt 
at the end of the third quarter and the Nets moved ahead of slumping Miami in 
the standings by handing the Heat their sixth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the eighth in a row at home for New Jersey (37-32) and moved 
the Nets into sixth place in the Eastern Conference, a half-game ahead of the 
Heat (37-33). 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 114, Golden State 104 -- Vernon Maxwell scored 28 points in leading 
the Rockets to a victory at Oakland.

THE NIT; VILLANOVA RALLIES TO BEAT VANDERBILT FOR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Villanova completed a turnaround season with a turnaround game Wednesday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats, 8-19 last season, won the National Invitation Tournament 
championship, 80-73, at Madison Square Garden by overcoming a 15-point halftime 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Steve Lappas' team now and its record is 20-12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, it was like 'Let's just get this season over with.' This year, it 
was like 'Let's do something,' " said Jonathan Haynes, whose three-pointer with 
3:22 to play gave Villanova the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a poised performance from a team made up primarily of sophomores and 
freshmen, and it even surprised Lappas, a second-year coach who took over the 
program when Rollie Massimino left for Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys have been messing me up all year," Lappas said. "Despite their 
age, they respond under adverse conditions. Being young is one thing, but being 
composed is another. These guys surprised even me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats' composure beat Vanderbilt (20-12), which led, 41-26, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Villanova opened with a 30-16 run in the first 10:50 to 
draw within one point, then won despite the outside shooting of Vanderbilt's 
Frank Seckar, a junior who finished with a career-high 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good first half; they had a good second half. They're a hungry 
team," Vanderbilt Coach Jan van Breda Kolff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes scored 19 points, Kerry Kittles had 18 and Eric Eberz 16 for Villanova, 
which became the 15th school to win both an NCAA and NIT championship and 
finished its first 20-victory season since 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation game, Doremus Bennerman scored 51 points, the last 19 from 
the free-throw line, as Siena (25-8) was a 92-79 winner over Kansas State 
(20-14).

MORNING BRIEFING: DIFFERENT WAYS OF LOOKING AT MAGIC'S ENTRY INTO COACHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Columnist Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe is skeptical about Magic 
Johnson's return to the Lakers as coach: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to escape the feeling that we're seeing something akin to Babe 
Ruth closing out his professional career as a wrestling referee.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing Joe Louis glad-handing high rollers at a casino. We're seeing 
Frank Sinatra forgetting lyrics, then collapsing on stage in the middle of 'My 
Way.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic naturally doesn't see it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Why should he?

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Can you name the only Pacific 10 school that has never reached 
the Final Four? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Incentive: Corliss Williamson, the Arkansas Razorbacks' 6-foot-7, 245-pound 
forward, pumps up his teammates by punching them in the chest before games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his way of showing he'll be there for the team," teammate Davor Rimac 
told the Sporting News. "And maybe if we don't give 100%, he hits harder. I 
don't want to find out." 
</P>
<P>

 Exit entrance: Art Aragon, on a fight where he had to lose too much weight to 
make the required weight:  
</P>
<P>
 "That night I became the first fighter in history to be carried into the 
ring." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Priorities: Volleyball star Bob Samuelson, on why the U.S. team went through 
an 18-38 season: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think, in a middle of a game, we should be worried about getting a 
bulkhead seat on the way home." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 New goal? Duffy Mahoney, USA Track and Field's athletic manager, on Michael 
Jordan's next sporting endeavor: 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not Olympic high jumping? He can do 7 feet right now, why not 7-6 with a 
little practice?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Time consuming: Asked what it is like to play against Gheorghe Muresan, the 
Washington Bullets' 7-foot-7 Romanian center, Robert Pack, former USC standout, 
now with the Denver Nuggets, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting around him on a pick is like going around the block." 
</P>

 Easy sell: Buzzie Bavasi, former San Diego Padre president, on the Dodgers' 
great attendance:

just to see what the lights were about."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PARK IMPRESSES AGAIN, AWAITS ROSTER DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chan Ho Park made one of his final bids to solidify a spot on the team's 
opening day roster Wednesday at Vero Beach, Fla., in the Dodgers' final Florida 
game, pitching the first four innings and giving up one run in a 4-1 victory 
over the Yankees. He got his second victory of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 After the four-hit, one-walk, two-strikeout performance, pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski said the South Korean rookie will pitch -- probably in relief -- in 
Sunday's final game of the Freeway Series against the Angels at Anaheim 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did my best, and I worked as hard as I could, and I'm just waiting for the 
decision," Park said.  
</P>
<P>
 Park, who was called for his fifth and sixth balks of the spring for fidgeting 
on the mound while set, lowered his earned-run average to 2.35. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very confident I will be in the majors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Peter O'Malley and Manager Tom Lasorda have said they hope Park makes 
the opening day roster. "That's a very good sign," Park said when asked of 
O'Malley's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure Peter's still hoping and I'm still hoping," Lasorda said, refusing 
to officially place Park on the pitching staff. "I think everybody's pulling 
for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Right fielder Cory Snyder, who has resisted going on the disabled list despite 
nursing injuries all spring, acknowledged it might be best to start the season 
on the DL after suffering a minor knee injury earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a possibility, yeah," said Snyder, who was left behind in Vero Beach for 
extra work when the team flew out Wednesday evening. "We've got a good team 
here, and I don't want to do anything that hurts it or me. If they call me 
Sunday and I'm not 100%, I'm not going to lie." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza hit his ninth home run of the spring, a second-inning solo blast 
over the left-center field fence that crashed high into the trees. . . . Pedro 
Astacio, who entered the game with an 8.00 ERA, pitched five shutout innings. . 
. . Lasorda mixed up the batting order against left-hander Jimmy Key, dropping 
Delino DeShields from leadoff to the third spot and Darryl Strawberry from 
fourth to fifth, and moving Brett Butler from second to leadoff and Jose 
Offerman from eighth to second. "I would have to call that experimenting," 
Lasorda said . . . . The Dodgers set their pitching schedule for the Freeway 
Series: Opening day starter Orel Hershiser and Ramon Martinez will pitch Friday 
at Dodger Stadium, Tom Candiotti is set for Saturday and Astacio and Kevin 
Gross for Sunday, both at Anaheim Stadium.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SNOW'S STATUS HINGES ON SMITH'S CALF INJURY 
</P>

<P>
 The Angels officially decided that first baseman J.T. Snow will be sent down 
to triple-A Vancouver Saturday night unless outfielder Dwight Smith goes on the 
disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will continue to shop Snow in trade talks, but General Manager Bill 
Bavasi does not foresee a trade before opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eduardo Perez is my first baseman," Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said. "Not 
that J.T. Snow is not a good first baseman, but that fact is becoming more 
evident that if I'm going to get 500 at-bats for Eddie Perez, it's at first 
base, not at third base or the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think he has a chance to be an impact player." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who was relieved a week ago when he was not traded to the New York Mets 
for Anthony Young, now wishes the trade would have been consummated just to 
remain in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason why I should get sent down," said Snow, who did not 
start for the third consecutive game in the Angels' 4-3 defeat to the Milwaukee 
Brewers. "I think I can definitely help a team when I'm out there every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to play in the big leagues. I don't need to go down there and hit .300 
again. What's that going to prove?" 
</P>
<P>
 Snow could be spared the demotion if Smith's strained right calf does not heal 
by Saturday. He injured the calf in his last at-bat Tuesday against the San 
Diego Padres, and it worsened Wednesday. There's a 60% chance, Rodgers said, 
that Smith will be placed on the DL. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Langston was officially told that he will be the Angels' opening-day 
starter Tuesday against the Minnesota Twins. Langston becomes the first Angel 
pitcher to make three consecutive opening-day starts since Mike Witt in 
1985-89. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Finley pitched two scoreless innings Wednesday and experienced no ill 
effects from his stiff neck, which forced him to be scratched from his last 
start. Finley will start Saturday against the Dodgers in the Freeway Series, 
and become the No. 3 starter in the rotation . . . . Reliever Bill Sampen was 
forced to leave the game in the sixth inning with a tight muscle near his right 
biceps. Sampen, who yielded three hits before being removed in the sixth 
inning, said it's a chronic condition that is not serious . . . . The Angels' 
scheduled pitchers for the Freeway Series: John Dopson on Friday; Finley and 
Phil Leftwich on Saturday; Mark Leiter on Sunday. BOB NIGHTENGALE

UPPER DECK BASEBALL TOURNAMENT; EL DORADO TAKES IT ON THE CHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Suffering a blowout loss should prompt concern from any coach worth his salt 
-- no matter the talent level of a superior opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was easy to understand the somber demeanor of El Dorado baseball Coach 
Steve Gullotti on Wednesday night after his team was routed by San Diego Rancho 
Bernardo, 10-2, in the semifinals of the Upper Deck Classic at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 And while there was no disgrace in losing to a team ranked third in the nation 
in the preseason poll by USA Today, Gullotti saw some bad signs -- very bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of improving to do," Gullotti said. "These games against good 
teams have exposed some of our weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're making too many mistakes at critical times." 
</P>
<P>
 Things went much better for Rancho Bernardo (7-3), which did its part to set 
up an all-San Diego championship game. The Broncos will meet San Diego Mission 
Bay (10-0) -- ranked No. 4 by USA Today -- for the title at 7 tonight at Cal 
State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Hawks (9-4) play Clovis (10-4) at 1:30 p.m. at El Dorado for third 
place. Clovis lost to Mission Bay, 9-5, in the other championship semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos were boosted by a strong performance from junior right-hander Ryan 
Bailey (1-1), who was making only his second start. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who was called up from the junior varsity at the start of the season 
after injuries decimated the varsity pitching staff, pitched six innings and 
allowed both runs. He gave up nine hits and had seven strikeouts before being 
relieved with two on and none out in the seventh inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was over early. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by four El Dorado errors, Rancho Bernardo scored all of its runs in the 
first four innings. The Broncos held a 6-0 lead after two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Bernardo tagged El Dorado ace Benito Flores (2-3) for all its runs. The 
senior left-hander gave up seven earned runs and was pulled in the fourth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't as bad as it looked," Gullotti said. "He doesn't give up as many 
runs if we cover the bags and don't make so many errors." 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Troy 10, Brooklyn Xaverian (N.Y.) 5 -- Trevor Brown drove in three runs, 
including the game-winner, as the Warriors advanced to play Cooper City (Fla.) 
in the consolation championship game at 3:30 p.m. today at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper City (Fla.) 8, Esperanza 3 -- Joey DeSantis pitched a complete game, 
striking out seven and walking one, in leading Cooper City (Fla.) to a 
consolation-bracket victory at Esperanza High. Esperanza (5-7) faces Xaverian 
(Brooklyn, N.Y.) in the 11th-place game at 10 a.m. today at El Dorado High. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei 1, Lafayette (Kent.) 0 -- Adam Harris retired 21 of the 23 batters 
he faced, allowing one hit and striking out 11, as the Monarchs advanced to 
play Canyon Del Oro (Ariz.) in the fifth-place game at noon today at Amerige 
Park.

VICTORY

 Brea-Olinda continued its assault on the scoreboard Wednesday by defeating 
Santa Margarita, 10-3, to win the Pride of the Coast baseball tournament at 
Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea scored 39 runs in its first three tournament games, including 19 in a 
victory over Orange Lutheran Tuesday.But the Wildcats didn't need to flex their 
hitting power against Santa Margarita, instead taking advantage of six walks 
and four hit batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (5-7) took a 3-0 lead in the first inning. Brian Griffin beat 
out an infield single and scored on Mike Penney's home run, his third of the 
season. Craig Harrison doubled and scored on Paul Nicotra's single before 
Brea-Olinda pitcher Steve Trombly settled down to record his fifth consecutive 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (10-2) tied the game in the bottom of the first. Trevor Lords was 
hit by a pitch, Jason Theis' checked swing produced a single to right and John 
Stoddard, unable to bunt, singled to load the bases. Mike Brambilla walked on 
four pitches to score Lords and a double play and an error scored Theis and 
Stoddard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats took the lead in the third on two runs without the benefit of a 
hit. Stoddard and Brambilla walked and Marc Anspach and Matt Weyant both were 
hit by pitches. Ryan Knuth's sacrifice fly scored Brambilla for a 5-3 Brea 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard put the game out of reach in the following inning with a three-run 
double. The Wildcats added single runs in the fifth on a hit batter, two 
sacrifices and a single by Dan Anderson and in the sixth on a double by Theis 
and single by Brambilla. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar 11, Costa Mesa 3 -- Jim Houston had three hits for the Sea 
Kings in a consolation game, breaking a scoreless tie with seven runs in the 
fourth. Matt Friend earned the victory, pitching four innings, allowing no runs 
and two hits for host Corona del Mar (10-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In consolation games: 
</P>
<P>
 Century 1, Estancia 0 -- Century got its only hit off the Eagles' Jose Cabrera 
in the bottom of the second when Jorge Frausto doubled. Frausto moved to third 
on a wild pitch and scored the only run of the game on Jose Romero's sacrifice 
fly. Cabrera struck out five in pitching a complete game. James Gomez pitched 
four innings, allowing two hits, to earn his first victory for Century (8-3), 
and Christian Duran recorded his second save. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena 18, Newport Harbor 10 -- Rudy Maldonado had two hits and three RBIs 
for the Vanguards, who scored nine runs in the fourth to break a 6-6 tie. Brett 
Hlista and Mike Freeman hit home runs for host Newport Harbor (3-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Lutheran 6, Rancho Alamitos 5 -- Paul Peterson had four RBIs for Orange 
Lutheran (3-8), including a game-winning two-run double in the bottom of the 
seventh. Peterson also hit a bases-empty home run in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Valley 8, Bolsa Grande 6 -- Tom Uribe and Jeff Munney each had two hits 
and drove in a run for Victor Valley (10-4). Bryan Baughman had three RBIs for 
Bolsa Grande (5-6).

WEST ANAHEIM LIONS BASEBALL TOURNAMENT; LOARA CONTINUES TURNAROUND SEASON WITH 
TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't take it wrong, but Loara third baseman Ean Brown is going to beam about 
every victory this season. His satisfaction just bubbles over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, teams would play us and we'd see that another-cake-walk look in 
their eyes," Brown said. "It's a whole different story now." 
</P>
<P>
 A 180-degree-type of difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara, everybody's patsy a year ago, has made it clear that those 
roll-over-and-play-dead days are over. The Saxons made that point clear 
Wednesday night with a 5-1 victory over Dana Hills in the West Anaheim Lions 
tournament final at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons, who were 3-20 a year ago, have already tripled their victory total 
and done so impressively. First, they reached the semifinals of the Loara 
Tournament and now they have won the Anaheim Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, Loara (9-4) is off to a fast start in the Empire League race 
with a 2-1 record. Not bad for a team that was everybody's favorite opponent in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had everyone coming back, but they were coming off a negative 
experience," Coach David Lappin said. "We needed to see if the kids could turn 
it into a positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons got solid pitching and solid hitting -- traits missing last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Ortiz, pitching his first game in more than a week, baffled and confused 
the Dolphins. He wasn't overpowering, but he made few mistakes. One mistake was 
a 3-2 fastball that Seth Etherton hit well over the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortiz (1-0), the tournament MVP, gave up only three other hits, two of which 
were infield singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, among others, supplied the offense, knocking in two runs with two hits. 
His infield single in the third put the Saxons ahead to stay, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Cramer and Mike Boomsma also had RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even talk about last season," Brown said. "We have put it behind 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 That was easier than putting away the Dolphins (6-6-1), who had tap danced 
through the tournament without much help from their two top pitchers, Etherton 
and Chris Toomey. They were being saved for key South Coast League games today 
and Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Without their aces, the Dolphins relied on less experienced players on the 
mound. Senior third baseman Rick Currier was the pitcher for a day Wednesday, 
making his first appearance since he was a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 Currier wobbled at times, but kept the game close. He gave up three runs and 
five hits in 4 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 In another tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
 Katella 6, La Habra 1 -- Jason Stockstill struck out six and allowed one 
earned run in seven innings to lead Katella.

PREP BASEBALL ROUNDUP; CANYON HOLDS ON TO WIN IN LAS VEGAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Chandler had two hits and scored two runs and Casey Wilson had two hits 
and drove in a run to lead Canyon to a 5-4 victory over Bell Gardens in pool 
play at the Las Vegas Durango Tournament Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell Gardens scored four runs in the top of the seventh on two walks, a hit, 
two hit batters and a wild pitch. But the Comanches (7-4) were able to hold on 
by forcing a popup to end the inning. In an earlier game, Canyon lost to San 
Diego Mira Mesa, 1-0. The Comanches will play Tuscon Sabino today. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sunset League baseball: 
</P>
<P>
 Marina 12, Westminster 2 -- David Titov and Travis Anderson each had three 
hits, with Titov scoring three runs and Anderson driving in three for Marina 
(8-4, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Lynch went the distance, allowing four hits, all in the first inning 
for the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Santa Ana Elks Tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill 8, Mission Viejo 7 (8 innings) -- Bill Reinsch's single drove in the 
winning run for Foothill (7-6). Ryan Zeber led off the inning with a single and 
was replaced by pinch-runner Jeff Spurlock, who scored the winning run. Jeff 
Pickler had three hits for the Knights, drove in three runs and scored two. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mission Viejo (3-12), T.J. Kopkash hit a bases-empty home run in top of 
the seventh to tie the score, 7-7, and send the game into extra innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 13, Buena Park 11 -- Tony Zuniga hit a three-run inside-the-park 
home run to cap an 11-run fifth inning and lead Saddleback (7-6-1) in a 
consolation game. Sam Perla had three hits, including a triple, and scored two 
runs for Saddleback. Buena Park is 4-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley 4, Redlands 1 -- Johnny Garcia had a triple and a single, 
scored a run and had two stolen bases for Santa Ana Valley (6-7), which gave 
Falcon Coach Herschel Musick his 299th career victory. Robert Serrano pitched a 
complete game, striking out seven for the Falcons.

THOROUGHBRED RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; AT THE HEART OF THE MATTER IS BIRTHPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the winner's circle after the San Felipe Stakes at Santa Anita 10 days ago, 
Burt Bacharach mentioned that Heartlight No. One, his champion filly in 1983, 
was actually a West Virginia-bred, even though she had been advertised as a 
Maryland-bred while winning stakes races from California to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject came up because Bacharach's Soul Of The Matter, the winner of the 
San Felipe and now a leading contender for this year's Kentucky Derby, is a 
West Virginia-bred and related on his dam's side to Heartlight No. One.  
</P>
<P>
 West Virginia-breds are the poor relations of the breeding world. A horse from 
West Virginia has never won the Derby, and, going back to 1966, the first year 
that the Daily Racing Form's past performances listed states for all of the 
starters, there has never even been a West Virginia-bred who has run in the 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late for Bacharach to transfer Soul Of The Matter out of West 
Virginia, something that he said hadn't been done with Heartlight No. One, 
either.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess this is a confession, but I'll go on with it," the award-winning 
composer said. "We always said Heartlight was from Maryland, but she was really 
a West Virginia-bred." 
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach didn't exactly voice this revelation pianissimo. His confession was 
carried on the simulcast betting network across the country, which included the 
telecast that was seen in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder how the guy feels who finished second to Heartlight that year," 
somebody at Laurel Race Course said. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Heartlight No. One was bred had no bearing on her national Eclipse 
Award, but Bacharach's filly had also been voted best 3-year-old distaffer 
among Maryland-breds for 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't talked about much else in this office since we heard that Burt 
Bacharach said that," said Cindy Deubler, research editor for The Maryland 
Horse, the bimonthly magazine published by the Maryland Horse Breeders Assn. 
"Nobody's said anything, though, about taking away Heartlight's award. What 
would this come under, the statute of limitations? Our policy is that if the 
Jockey Club accepts the (breeding) registration, we do, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Rest easy, Burt. There will be no extradition back to Maryland to face 
charges. Your manager at Country Roads Farm in Charles Town, W.Va., Vinnie 
Moscarelli, vouches for the authenticity of Heartlight No. One as a 
Maryland-bred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heartlight's dam (Icantell) was a little early (foaling), but we got her to 
Maryland in time, about a week ahead of time as I remember," Moscarelli said 
this week. "Heartlight No. One was foaled at Dennis Kamber's farm. That's in 
Maryland, about a 30-minute ride from the West Virginia line, about 45 minutes 
from Country Roads. Everything else about Heartlight was West Virginia, though. 
She went back to Country Lands with us after she was foaled, and after she left 
us, as a 2-year-old, the only places she raced were California and New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Breeding rules vary according to the state. To qualify as a Maryland-bred, a 
foal must be sired by a stallion standing in the state, and the mare must be in 
the state at the time of foaling. The California rule is similar, but with this 
extension: If the California-dropped foal is sired by an out-of-state stallion, 
it will still be considered a California-bred as long as the mare is next bred 
to a California stallion. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the story has been knocking around -- never corroborated, probably 
apocryphal -- about Needles, the 1956 Kentucky Derby winner. Needles became the 
first Florida-bred to win the Derby, but the report lingers that his dam, 
Noodle Soup, was in a railroad boxcar, somewhere in Georgia, when she foaled 
the colt short of the Florida state line. Georgia and West Virginia are just 
two of 36 states that have never produced Derby winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Pennsylvania left the list of have-not states when Lil E. Tee won the Derby in 
1992. According to Moscarelli, Lil E. Tee became a Pennsylvania-bred when his 
dam, Eileen's Moment, was moved from New Jersey late in her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had something to do with the generous (state) purse fund that was 
available to Pennsylvania-breds," Moscarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the combination of being a Pennsylvania-bred and a yearling who had 
undergone stomach surgery did nothing for Lil E. Tee's salability. His breeder, 
Larry Littman, took the colt to Florida to consign him to an auction, but was 
so discouraged by word of mouth about his horse that he withdrew him from the 
sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Littman finally sold Lil E. Tee for $2,000. That offer, the only one Littman 
got, came from the colt's blacksmith. Lil E. Tee was sold two more times, for 
$25,000 and $200,000, before winning the Derby for Cal Partee. Retired last 
year, Lil E. Tee earned $1.4 million, joining Go For Wand as the most famous 
Pennsylvania-breds ever. Should Soul Of The Matter win this year's Derby, he 
would stand alone in West Virginia. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Antley, winning the last three races and four for the card, was aboard 
Silver Music, a 23-1 shot, for a half-length victory Wednesday in the Baldwin 
Stakes. Fifteen lengths back early, Silver Music outfinished Eagle Eyed in the 
3-year-old colt's California debut. Before the Baldwin, Silver Music raced in 
Florida, where he broke his maiden last October in a $50,000 claiming race. His 
only other stake appearance was an 11th-place finish in the Tropical Park 
Derby. The Baldwin gave Silver Music his third victory in 12 starts. . . . 
Antley moved into fourth place in the Santa Anita jockey standings with 52 wins 
for the meet, but trails the leader, Kent Desormeaux, by 20. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse was killed and another horse and an exercise rider were injured in an 
accident at Santa Anita Wednesday. Bold Current, a 7-year-old gelding, died of 
a broken neck and his rider, Korrin Wardlaw, was sent to a hospital for 
treatment of pain in his lower back and numbness in his left leg. Bold Current 
was working in company with a stablemate when Maisonsaire, who had been jogging 
near the outside rail, spooked and angled in their direction. Bold Current ran 
into the rear end of Maisonsaire, who is owned in a partnership that includes 
Wilt Chamberlain. Maisonsaire suffered a bruised hip that might also be 
fractured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, probably the best 3-year-old filly in the country, has been nominated 
to the Triple Crown races. . . . Richard Cummings, vice president at Churchill 
Downs, has resigned to become president of R.D. Hubbard's greyhound track in 
Portland, Ore. Cummings succeeds Lonny Powell, who will become general manager 
of Turf Paradise, the Phoenix thoroughbred track recently bought by Hollywood 
Park. Hubbard is chairman of Hollywood Park.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CHAPMAN REAPING THE BENEFITS OF 
CATON'S REBIRTH IN SOFTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be hard for opponents of the Chapman softball team to believe, but 
Susan Caton is just getting back into this softball thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Caton, the Panthers' leadoff hitter, is batting .446, with an on-base 
percentage of better than .550, and she has scored 29 runs and driven in 12. 
</P>
<P>
 And she plays a mean center field. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, however, Caton wasn't even on the team. She tried out almost 
on a whim. Caton had mentioned to a sorority sister, Kim Gray, that she had 
played at Irvine High School several years back. Gray happened to be an 
infielder for the Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last fall, Chapman coaches didn't expect much when Caton tried out. 
</P>
<P>
 One of her first throws from the outfield to home plate was a strike. There 
were no more skeptics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, I don't have much luck with the people I try out," Chapman assistant 
coach Janet Lloyd said. "But when she got out there, I said, 'Oh my God, Susan, 
where have you been?' She's probably one of the best outfielders we've ever 
had. She's definitely the quickest." 
</P>
<P>
 Caton helped Irvine to the playoffs in her junior and senior seasons. After 
graduating in 1990, she planned to play at Saddleback College, but after a 
couple weeks of practice she decided it wasn't for her. 
</P>
<P>
 So other than playing in a slow-pitch league with her co-workers at 
Disneyland, Caton stayed away from softball during her 2 1/2 years at 
Saddleback and Irvine Valley. Softball wasn't in her plans at Chapman, either, 
but she's doing so well and having so much fun that she is thinking about 
prolonging her academic schedule so she can play again next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really great," Caton said. "And I've never hit so well. My batting 
has always been terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caton, who said she batted in the low .200's or high .100's in high school, 
credits the Chapman coaching staff with getting her going at the plate. Lloyd 
and her father, Coach Lisle Lloyd, decided Caton should bat left-handed to take 
advantage of her speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janet and Lisle have done a good job with me," Caton said. "They had me try 
to bat left-handed in high school but they kept saying, 'Go right, go left, go 
right, go left' until I couldn't hit either way." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of a season-ending rotator cuff injury to pitcher Leslie Gerbin, Caton 
has also been called upon to pitch for the Panthers. She is 2-0, giving up only 
three hits and one run in nine innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman has plenty of standout players, which has the coaches excited at the 
prospect of becoming a full-fledged NCAA Division III program next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Hernandez, a senior catcher from Los Amigos High, leads the team with a 
.464 average. Hernandez, the NAIA District 3 player of the year for Southern 
California College last year, transferred to Chapman at the semester break. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Fancuberta, a freshman pitcher from Sunny Hills High, is 10-7 and was 
named most valuable player of the Redlands tournament last weekend. The 
Panthers (22-11), who lost only one of seven tournament games, avenged their 
only loss by beating Gustavus Adolphus (Minn.), 4-1, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The victory over the Gusties moved Lisle Lloyd within three of his 400th 
victory as a college coach. In 13 seasons, including one at Christ College, 
Lloyd is 397-261-1. He could reach the milestone in the UC San Diego tournament 
next week. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California College's Augie Pena was named NAIA District 3 baseball 
player of the week. Pena batted .364 with four home runs, drove in six runs, 
scored five and had a victory and a save for the Vanguards, who won four of 
their six games. . . . Chapman's Jolee Lautaret set a school high jump record 
by clearing 4 feet 9 3/4 inches Saturday at UC San Diego. Lautaret, a freshman 
who also plays for the women's basketball team, broke the record of 4-8 set by 
Lili Bess in 1987.

CSUN MOOD BLACK IN WAKE OF DEFEAT; COLLEGE BASEBALL: AFTER 2-1 LOSS TO CAL 
LUTHERAN, KERNEN SAYS HEARTLESS MATADORS HAVE QUIT ON HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cal State Northridge players wore black, though certainly not by choice. 
The mood was funereal. 
</P>
<P>
 Players elected to fly the American flag at half-staff over the clubhouse at 
Matador Field. Fitting, in light of the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely appropriate," Northridge Coach Bill Kernen said. "Because 
they're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Incensed by what he called the team's habitual inability to play with heart, 
Kernen threw down the gauntlet before Wednesday's 2-1 nonconference loss to Cal 
Lutheran and threatened to finish the season with reserves unless a sweeping 
change of attitude takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen barred players from the clubhouse and forbade them from wearing team 
jerseys. Many players were forced to wear black T-shirts or undershirts devoid 
of names or numerals, a violation of an NCAA rule regarding game uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen donned a different team cap out of disgust, just so he wasn't wearing 
the same hat as his troops. He also dumped the players' gear onto the clubhouse 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Startling revisions were made in the lineup, which included pitchers Marco 
Contreras in right field and John Najar at first base. The final five spots in 
the batting order entered the game a combined zero for six in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen hit ground zero after he said his players "quit" during Tuesday's 13-7 
loss to Loyola Marymount. Lions' Coach Jody Robinson, a former Northridge 
assistant, commented on the lackluster Northridge effort afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen couldn't argue. 
</P>
<P>
 But he could react. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-year coach, whose teams have qualified for the NCAA playoffs in each 
of their three years at the Division I level, said he made the moves to protect 
against "an erosion of the very heart of the program." 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't some joke," Kernen said. "I have to uphold the integrity of the 
guys who played in this program before." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (17-16) doesn't play again until Monday. Kernen said he will not 
attend practice over the remainder of the week and will instead scout high 
school and junior college games -- in search of new players for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that this is my fault," Kernen said. "I'm more upset at 
myself for my lack of recruiting ability." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the team, corrective action is up to the players, he said. Kernen said 
that had he taken similar action and "challenged their manhood" in previous 
years, teams might have "practiced for about eight hours or slept in the 
clubhouse" to prove their mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge irregulars would just as soon camp in the Sahara as make an 
encore appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something I want to do again," said Contreras, pointing to blisters 
on his hands left by swinging the bat. "We need our guys in there, but (the 
benched regulars) need to make a decision whether they want to play. Either 
quit or don't come to practice tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 The only regulars who started were outfielder Joey Arnold, at second base, and 
designated hitter Eric Gillespie, at catcher. Spot starters Brian Vasey and 
Jonathan Campbell also were in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have benched everybody, but I didn't have enough players to fill all 
the positions," Kernen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Jason Vargas (1-2) limited Cal Lutheran (16-4-1) to three hits. 
Once again, however, Northridge played as large a role in the loss as the 
opposition offense. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 1-1, in the top of the ninth, Vargas walked David 
Campaniello. After a sacrifice moved pinch-runner Chad Miyata to second, Vargas 
threw a wild pitch and Joe Gordon hit a sacrifice fly. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kernen) says we keep giving away games," said Vargas, who took the loss 
hard. "I made a mistake. I didn't finish it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Kernen reserved judgment on the team for several weeks, writing off its 
inconsistent play to the loss of two players to injury, the aftereffects of the 
Northridge earthquake and the loss of several players to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than Northridge's record, Kernen said, is that many players 
lack the fire of previous Kernen disciples, who were known for their work ethic 
and competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me five years to put this program where it is, and it's taken them 60 
days to put it into the dump," Kernen said. "The nine guys we had out there 
were ones who wanted to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they did pretty well. . . . I'd use them again. If we're gonna be 
bad, let's really be bad and I'll reload this S.O.B. (for next year)."

WOLF CRESTS EMOTIONAL WAVE, WINS; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: GRIEVING EL CAMINO REAL 
ACE GOES DISTANCE, GETS OFFENSIVE SUPPORT FROM MATES IN 14-7 TITLE-GAME VICTORY 
OVER THOUSAND OAKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was an unforgettable moment during a forgettable game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth inning of El Camino Real High's 14-7 victory over Thousand Oaks 
in the championship game of the Thousand Oaks tournament Wednesday, Randy Wolf 
hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 As the ball cleared the fence in center field, landing near the flag, which 
was flying at half-mast, Wolf glanced to the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of got me in the heart a little bit," El Camino Real's Justin 
Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, the Conquistadores' standout hitter and pitcher, was playing for the 
first time since his father, James, died of a heart attack Sunday. He pitched a 
complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I just wanted to do it for Dad," Wolf said of his decision to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf (4-1) was not at his best, but the seven runs he gave up are misleading. 
Only three were earned. He gave up 10 hits, struck out five and walked three. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wolf's teammates let him down in the field, making three errors and 
misplaying several other balls, they gave him more than enough offensive 
support. El Camino Real (8-2) had a 5-0 lead before Wolf threw a pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 The big blow in the first inning was a three-run home run by first baseman 
Craig Carlton, who had two hits and four runs batted in. The Conquistadores 
added a run in the third and five in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who had two of the Conquistadores' 10 hits, said the team wanted to 
win for Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came (Tuesday) and watched the game, he showed he cared enough about 
us to be here," Martin said. "We had to go out and show we cared enough about 
him to win it for him." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real right fielder Billy Burnette added a solo home run and a 
double. He had to leave the game in the bottom of the seventh after running 
into the fence tracking a ball hit by Matt Elam, who circled the bases while 
Burnette lay dazed in the outfield.  
</P>
<P>
 Greg Aguilar led Thousand Oaks (9-3) with three hits, including a double. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Services for James Wolf will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at the Oakwood Cemetery 
in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The family asks that, in lieu of flowers, donations be made to the El Camino 
Real High baseball program.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: BAKERSFIELD WON OVER NATIVE SON

<P>
 Reggie Phillips had the chance to jump to Division I college basketball two 
years ago. He received offers but turned them down. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters wooing the guard from Ventura College didn't represent winning 
programs -- a big drawback, according to Phillips, who played on a Pirate team 
that completed its season 33-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I wanted to go to a Division I school," he said. "After (junior 
college), I realized I wanted to go to a place where I could win a lot of 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 So Phillips turned down San Jose State, Eastern Washington, St. Francis and 
Morgan State and decided to return home: Bakersfield. For the sake of winning, 
it was the right decision. 
</P>
<P>
 With Phillips scoring 15 points Saturday, Cal State Bakersfield won its second 
consecutive NCAA championship, beating Southern Indiana, 92-86, before 2,007 at 
Blake Arena in Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind it was a Division II title. "The level of competition was good," 
Phillips said. "It was special. There was emotion. But not getting the 
recognition that you do in the Division I tournament, that didn't faze us. We 
went out and played our game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an experience I'll never forget." 
</P>
<P>
 That experience is perhaps more precious than the 1992-93 season when 
Bakersfield won the national title with a 30-0 record. This season, Bakersfield 
finished 27-6, stumbled at times but persevered in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team was motivated to play us every game this year," Phillips said. "It 
was hard. We had to fight through adversity. During the losses, we had to learn 
we weren't playing at the level we expected to be." 
</P>
<P>
 There were a couple of low-water marks for the Roadrunners, a team that 
included 11 members of the 1993 champions. Early in California Collegiate 
Athletic Assn. play, Cal State San Bernardino upset the defending champions, 
and Phillips scored a season-low seven points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about regrouping and getting refocused after that one," Phillips 
said. "We had to start playing hard and concentrate on getting the league 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Two losses to UC Riverside doused those hopes. But five days after losing, 
73-68, to the Highlanders, Bakersfield beat Riverside, 75-62, in the Western 
Regional final and advanced to the final eight in Springfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the worst record there and all the other teams had won their 
conference," Phillips said. "But we had the experience from last year, and the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Roadrunner defense ranked No. 2 in the nation in points allowed (63.3) and 
No. 3 in field-goal percentage (38.1%). Phillips, who averaged a team-best 15.2 
points a game, scored 22 in the semifinal, an 87-69 victory over Washburn. The 
5-foot-10 Phillips had 12 rebounds in the semifinal and final combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips isn't surprised at Bakersfield's success. The Roadrunners had reached 
at least the semifinals of the national tournament the two seasons before his 
arrival. Still, two national championships exceeded his dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's something you don't even dream of, really," he said. "It's so far out 
of reach, you don't imagine it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: North Carolina freshman Marion Jones (Thousand Oaks) has 
helped the Tar Heels reach the Final Four. The point guard had 12 points, six 
rebounds and three assists against Connecticut in the East Regional final, a 
season-high 10 assists and nine rebounds against Vanderbilt in the semifinal 
and 18 points, seven rebounds and three steals against Georgia Southern in the 
first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Quincy University's Reggie Bell (College of the Canyons) was selected to the 
All-Great Lakes Region second team after averaging 18.8 points and 11 rebounds 
for the Division II school. In two seasons, the senior had 1,016 points, 568 
rebounds and a school-record 63% shooting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 In baseball, the San Francisco Dons, led by former Cal Lutheran Coach Rich 
Hill, on Tuesday upset No. 12 Stanford, 18-5, on 21 hits. Outfielder Daryl 
Hernandez (Simi Valley/Moorpark College) singled in two runs.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; ROUGH YEAR FOR LOCAL RESORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quick phone check of local ski reports told the sad story. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Waterman? Closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kratka Ridge? Closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Sunrise? Closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Baldy? Open . . . but you'd better get there fast. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to spring skiing? 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that. What happened to skiing? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Southern California ski powerhouses -- the Big Three at Big Bear and 
Mountain High -- can boast of solid late-season conditions, the same cannot be 
said for smaller operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rough year," said Phil Edholm, general manager at Wrightwood's Ski Sunrise. 
"It's been skinny." 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Sunrise, which in a normal year can expected to be open 115 days, has been 
operational only half as many this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Small operators were hanging the rest of their seasons on the snow-making 
strength of last week's storm. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the system produced 12 to 15 inches of new snow at Mt. Waterman, it 
allowed the area to reopen for only a couple of days. Mt. Waterman closed again 
Monday, probably for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real good snow," said Mary Anderson, Mt. Waterman's longtime 
caretaker. "But there was no real base. You sunk right through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterman, usually operational for three months in good years, was open a month 
and a half this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent storms allowed Mt. Baldy to reopen last week, but warm temperatures 
threaten that status. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Snow Summit in Big Bear, which plans to remain open until April 17, has 
discontinued night skiing. 
</P>

<P>
 Some thoughts on Julie Parisien, who recently decided to put her race career 
on hold. Parisien, the athlete, thought she had to be tough. Toughness made her 
a world-class skier, a three-time World Cup winner. 
</P>
<P>
 When her brother and mentor, Jean-Paul, was killed by a drunk driver in 
December of 1992, Parisien the athlete jumped back into racing and put on a 
brave face. She thought she could turn grief into victories and leave a legacy 
for J.P. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien, the sister, was not up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago, before the World Cup races at Mammoth, Parisien announced she 
was taking a sabbatical at age 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether she returns is anyone's guess. It is not important, really, unless it 
is important to Parisien. 
</P>
<P>
 Understand, she cannot return to racing and not be reminded of J.P., the 
brother who first introduced the family to racing at the Burke Mountain 
Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Julie's dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 She almost quit the U.S. team last December, around the one-year anniversary 
of J.P.'s death, but decided to stick it out through the Olympics. At 
Lillehammer, however, she put unrealistic pressure on herself to win the gold. 
</P>
<P>
 When she failed -- missing a gate on her second run of Olympic slalom -- 
Parisien knew she needed time away. 
</P>
<P>
 She wobbled into the World Cup races at Mammoth on March 7, thinking she was 
going to race. Upon arrival, she learned that Derek Bonney, the drunk driver 
responsible for J.P.'s death, was scheduled for sentencing in Maine the 
following Thursday, the day Parisien was supposed to race the Mammoth slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien once said she didn't care what became of the man who killed her 
brother. She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of March 7, in her Mammoth hotel room, Parisien suffered an 
emotional breakdown, worse than the one suffered when she first learned of 
J.P.'s death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It opened my grieving all over again," Parisien said. "It was completely 
unexpected, but my grieving just got worse and worse. I guess I've really 
delayed my grieving until now. It hit me hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien left Mammoth the next day and flew home for the sentencing of Bonney, 
who received four years on manslaughter and drunken driving charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien spoke in open court about the man who had taken her brother and now, 
possibly, her career. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien isn't sure what she'll do next. Maybe facing Bonney face-to-face was 
the closure she needed to get on with her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisien plans on enrolling at the University of Colorado. She has talked of 
becoming a waitress. Next summer, she says, she will re-evaluate her race 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine Director, thinks Parisien will eventually return 
to racing. He says she is capable of rekindling the form that once made her No. 
1 in the world in the slaloms. 
</P>
<P>
 More important: Is that what Parisien wants? Skiing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Persons, 24, who won the giant slalom at the first U.S. Snowboarding 
Championships last week at June Mountain, Calif., is the step-brother of Tommy 
Moe, the Olympic downhill champion. In a random draw, Persons, from Whitefish, 
Mont., selected bib No. 8, the number Moe wore on his gold-medal run at 
Lillehammer. . . . Persons was one of five boarders who earned positions on the 
first U.S. team, which begins World Cup competition next season. The others 
were Tom Tuttle (Mammoth Lakes), Ross Powers (South Londonderry, Vt.), Stacia 
Hookman (Vail, Colo.) and Sabrina Sadeghi (Aspen, Colo.). Additional members of 
the team will be selected after summer training camps. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, Picabo Street, the Olympic downhill silver medalist, will be an 
"honored guest" of the New York Yankees on opening day. She will not, however, 
throw out the first ball. The Yankees have reserved that honor for some guy 
named DiMaggio. Street, who won last week's downhill title at the U.S. Alpine 
Championships at Winter Park, Colo., plans to race through the North American 
Championship Series, which began Monday and continues through Tuesday, at Mt. 
Bachelor in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, 24, says he will remain in ski racing until near the end of the century. 
"I'm young," he said. "I'd like to race in '98 and defend the ol' Olympic 
title. Look at Marc Girardelli. He's 30. There are a lot of skiers in their 
mid-20s doing well. I can see myself doing it for four more years. There are a 
lot of things I can accomplish." . . . With 1,007 points, Girardelli, the 
one-man team from Luxembourg, scored more World Cup points this season than 
nine countries . . . Ann Van Eps of Los Angeles won the 41-and-older division 
race in the recent Absolut Vodka Bartenders Ski Classic at Bear Mountain.

DIGEST: SHOULDER SURGERY TO END SEASON FOR EXPOS' FULLMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brad Fullmer, a former baseball standout at Montclair Prep and now one of the 
Montreal Expos' top prospects, will undergo season-ending shoulder surgery next 
week, Expo director of minor league operations Kent Qualls said. 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls said the surgery will be performed by orthopedist Frank Jobe in 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullmer, a second-round pick of the Expos in the amateur draft last June, has 
not played a professional game. The infielder signed after the 1993 minor 
league season, playing only in instructional league. His right shoulder had 
been bothering him since last summer. Women's Volleyball

<P>
 Rene Goth, a 5-foot-10 outside hitter from Buena High, this week became the 
first recruit to sign a letter of intent to play for Lian Kang Lu, Cal State 
Northridge's first-year coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Goth is a two-time All-Channel League selection and was team most valuable 
player for Buena the past two seasons. Track and Field

<P>
 Joe Hicks of Cal State Northridge, has been selected as the California/Nevada 
Track and Field Assn. university male athlete of the week.

 Hicks, a senior from Modesto San Benito High, put the shot 59 feet 11 inches 
in Sunday's Northridge Invitational to move to fourth on the all-time Matador 
list in that event. Names in the News

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: THE TIMING IS RIGHT FOR HEITMANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann went on the attack last week, and as a result the Cal State 
Northridge men's volleyball team is beginning to resemble a final four 
contender. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (13-8, 9-6 in Mountain Pacific Sports Federation play) have won 
five of their last six matches and three in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Price said Northridge's consecutive victories over Cal State Long 
Beach, Pepperdine and San Diego State are "as good a week as we've had since 
the (conference) tournament last year." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pretty tough couple of nights, beating Long Beach at Long Beach and 
the Waves at Pepperdine (in back-to-back matches), then coming back two days 
later and beating San Diego State at home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach was ranked 13th, but No. 6 Pepperdine and No. 7 San Diego State 
were rated ahead of ninth-ranked Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the three could handle Heitmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, a junior from Hamburg, Germany, had 88 kills in the three matches, 
including a personal-best 40 against Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Price attributed Heitmann's success to improved communication between the 
6-foot-7 middle blocker and Gary Reznick, the Matadors' setter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of (Heitmann) getting in a groove and making adjustments 
and Gary starting to set him better," Price said. "They've been struggling a 
little all year, but they seem to be getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing between the setter and the quick hitter is so important. The more 
they work together, the better they'll get." 
</P>
<P>
 If so, here's some bad news for Northridge opponents: Heitmann and Reznick are 
roommates. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN'S POLLYANNA 
</P>
<P>
 Good recruiters are eternal optimists and have the ability to turn almost any 
negative into a positive. 
</P>
<P>
 So score a point for Tom McCollum, the right-hand man of Pete Cassidy, 
Northridge's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 McCollum has managed to find a silver lining in the fact that budget-strapped 
Northridge can't afford to recruit prospects from outside the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids from California don't get spooked by the earthquake damage," McCollum 
said. "A kid from almost anywhere in California has lived through an earthquake 
at one time or another. There's no fear. If there is, it's suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see the damage of course, but we tell them it's all being fixed and as 
far as a conversation about it, that's pretty much the end of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marshall Evans appears to have hit his stride after two 
injury-hampered seasons, track Coach Don Strametz admits he and assistant Tony 
Veney were considering redshirting the junior sprinter as recently as five 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 They're glad they didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans has recorded personal bests in the 200 (21.50 seconds) and 400 meters 
(47.55) in the last two meets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47.55 clocking came in Sunday's Northridge Invitational and moved Evans to 
sixth on the all-time Northridge list. If he can stay healthy, he appears to 
have a good chance at becoming the second Matador sprinter to run the 400 in 
under 47 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony has altered (Marshall's) training this season and it seems to be 
working," Strametz said. "He's doing more high-quality speed work and less 
strength work. He's also taught him to slow down more gradually at the end of 
intervals and races." 
</P>
<P>
 In automobile parlance, Evans had a habit of applying the brakes as quickly as 
possible after crossing the finish line -- which led to pulled muscles -- 
instead of easing off the accelerator and coasting to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors have played 10 men's volleyball matches in the last three weeks, 
but they have only one -- a makeup contest against UC San Diego Friday night at 
Northridge -- until April 8 when they meet top-ranked UCLA at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're on a little bit of a roll like we are, you can't play fast 
enough," Price said. "I was hoping we'd get going a little sooner. Physically 
we could use the rest, but mentally I hope we don't shut down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge senior right-hander Amy Windmiller doesn't like to draw attention 
to herself. She is quiet, shy, perhaps the most humble player among the cocky 
Matador softball bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 But Windmiller cannot elude the spotlight. She has thrown five no-hitters, 
including two perfect games, in her last seven starts. She threw 27 consecutive 
hitless innings during one stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Windmiller would rather divert attention to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me a no-hitter is for the whole team," Windmiller said. "It shows how good 
the defense is." 
</P>
<P>
 Windmiller (12-1), the WAC player of the week who has lowered her earned-run 
average to 0.15, may have a point. Northridge committed only four errors in her 
seven victories. The Matadors were errorless in five games, helping Windmiller 
notch perfect games against Kansas and Minnesota last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her goal is to win," teammate Tamara Ivie said. "The no-hitter is just an 
extra for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Five no-hitters are the most in a season by a Matador since Kathy Slaten 
posted 11 at the Division II level in 1984. Windmiller, who has 117 strikeouts 
in 91 innings, has thrown 60 1/3 consecutive innings without allowing an earned 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Shannon Jones, Windmiller's roommate, continues to lead the 
Matador offense, batting .456 with four home runs and 19 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-ranked Matadors (23-4) are dominating their opponents. Northridge is 
batting .306 to its opponents' .117, while outscoring them, 136-12. 
</P>
<P>
 But statistics don't tell the entire story, Coach Gary Torgeson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some people right now that are just going through the motions," 
Torgeson said. After going 3-0 through pool play of the Cal State Fullerton 
tournament last week, Northridge lost, 2-1, in the first round of bracket play 
Saturday to Georgia State, an unranked team that was 0-3 in pool play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something is missing," Ivie said. "I don't know what it is. Hopefully we'll 
find it this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge embarks on its toughest trip of WAC play this weekend. The Matadors 
travel to face conference rivals Cal State Sacramento (17-11, 4-0) today and 
Fresno State (23-8, 2-0) Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher-designated hitter Eric Gillespie continues to make a bid for freshman 
All-American honors. The Millikan High graduate has hit safely in 28 of the 
Matadors' first 33 games and is hitting a team-high .362. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie leads the team in RBIs (35), doubles (11) and hits (51). He has 15 
multiple-hit games and has hit safely in each of Northridge's nine WAC games.

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: AMBULANCE TRIO CONQUERS RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ambulance driver must be able to get where he is going quickly and safely. 
Those are the same traits needed for a driver in a marathon rally, such as 
Paris-to-Dakar-to-Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Secoamerica, Inc., a Newport Beach-based holding company 
with interests in ambulance service, entered a three-man team in the 18-day, 
7,500-mile rally that twice crossed the Sahara Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Blevin, 30, an ambulance driver from Anaheim, was selected to drive the 
team's diesel-powered Toyota Landcruiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Secoamerica looked at it, if we can't get from Point A to Point B 
without getting in an accident of our own, we can't help the patient," Blevin 
said after finishing the grueling competition without mishap. "The company will 
use us as an example to all its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other words, if I can drive 12,000 kilos without being in a wreck, then 
the rest of them should be able to drive 12-hour shifts safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Secom, Inc., the Japanese parent corporation that owns Secoamerica, Inc., 
entered drivers from Japan in the Paris-Beijing Rally in 1992, and the company 
reported that the resulting focus on safety resulted in an 18% reduction in 
losses from accidents in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Blevin was on the road 62 hours 46 minutes 31 seconds and finished 47th 
overall of 127 entries. It was the only American entry in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'll always remember most about the trip was fatigue," Blevin said. 
"I don't think either Doug (Neal) or I was ready physically for it, even though 
we had trained for more than three months around Barstow, the Glamis sand dunes 
(near the Salton Sea) and in Japan. We were fatigued by the third day out when 
we broke the front end and lost the shocks and had to drive all night to catch 
up. Fatigue was with us all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, who was Blevin's navigator and rode every mile, is an emergency medical 
technician from Seattle. Eric Smith, a paramedic from Key West, Fla., was the 
team manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were chosen from 65 applicants throughout the United States after 
Secoamerica sent a bulletin to its 2,500 employees, asking for volunteers. When 
the list had been pared to eight, the remaining group was given off-road 
training by rally champion Rod Millen before going through a two-day test of 
navigational skills and driving ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the only one who had any racing experience of any kind," Blevin said. 
"I had never driven in an off-road race, but I had ridden with Ivan Stewart and 
Mickey Thompson and others in the Baja 1000, Mint 400 and other races. I had 
also worked as a mechanic for Cal Wells on the Toyota racing team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a dream come true, getting this chance. My interest in racing 
began when I was 15. A friend of mine invited me to an off-road race, and his 
dad was working on Jerry Welchel's car. He asked me if I'd like to be the gas 
man for one of the teams, and from that day on, I was hooked. I progressed to 
tire man and then became a mechanic and co-driver." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally started in Paris and crossed Spain to Gibraltar, where the 
contestants were ferried to North Africa. From there, they crossed the Sahara 
to Dakar, Senegal, then back north across the Sahara again to the Mediterranean 
and another ferry trip leading to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving Paris was exciting," Blevin said. "It was raining, but people were 
lined up along the streets, waving and hollering and cheering. In Granada, when 
we stopped for a red light, people swarmed around the car and when the light 
changed, they moved just enough for the car to squeeze through. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us that the streets were packed with people at 8 a.m. and the rally 
wasn't due until midnight. People in Spain just seem to love an excuse for a 
party."

<P>
 Although the teams were warned about camels in the desert, Blevin said the 
worst problem was with sand crabs and locusts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of days in Morocco, we ran through swarms of locusts. It 
looked like a blizzard. We had to get out and scrape them off the radiator, 
they were making the car overheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sand crabs were eight to 10 inches in diameter. We also saw a lot of 
donkeys. In fact, in some areas, donkeys were the main mode of transportation. 
It was funny being in a town and not seeing any cars. It was like old 
horse-and-buggy days, except instead of horses, they used donkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were out in the desert, we'd run across wild donkeys. They were a 
nuisance because they wouldn't move. They'd just stand and stare at us." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problems were getting stuck in the sand or lost in the vast 
wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got stuck for five hours, and we didn't make our checkpoint in the 
allotted time. We got penalized 16 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had trained for the desert in Glamis and had learned to read the sand, but 
the sand in parts of the Sahara is like an illusion. It looks hard, but it's 
soft as snow. For every shovelful of sand, three more fall in. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Altar to Nouadhibou (in Mauritania), we drove all day and night trying 
to catch up. All we got was about 20 minutes' sleep in two days. It's worst 
when it gets dark and you have to drive all night, after having driven all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no road signs, most of the time no roads of any kind. You go by the 
route book, charting the course by compass and global satellite positioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Speeds ranged from 5 to 80 m.p.h. in the Landcruiser. Motor Racing Notes

 The chance to advance was there. Florida had lost, and Quebec, 10 points 
behind the Panthers in the race for the Eastern Conference's final playoff 
spot, was at Ottawa, playing the Senators, a team 22 points out of 25th place 
in a 26-team league. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa is 20 points out now. The Nordiques, who had the fourth-best overall 
record last season, are down and out in the East after a 6-4 loss to the 
Senators on Wednesday.

 "We need three miracles, a little pride and the other teams not to win any 
games," said Quebec Coach Pierre Page before launching a scathing critique at 
his underachieving team.

<P>
 "There's no chemistry -- no hitting, no board contact, no back-checking, 
nobody comes to play. They're all trying to score goals."

 Tampa Bay 3, Buffalo 2 -- Brian Bradley's pass went in off Sabre goalie 
Dominik Hasek's pad with 1:08 to play in overtime to give the Lightning a

SENIOR GOLF; HIS HONOR GETS SOME RESPECT NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Tradition, the Senior PGA Tour's version of the Masters, opens today at 
Desert Mountain Country Club with legends such as Jack Nicklaus; and some of 
the past greats of golf, such as 1936 U.S. Open champion Sam Parks, 84-year-old 
Paul Runyan and Tommy Bolt; and even a mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "His Honor" in the Texas town of Toco, Rocky Thompson, who recently set 
a senior record by shooting a final round of 10-under-par 61 to win the 
tournament at Tampa, Fla., is in the field for the 72-hole event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino, player of the year Dave Stockton and Raymond Floyd also will be 
among those facing defending champion Tom Shaw in the $850,000 tournament, 
considered a major event for the 50-and-older set. 
</P>
<P>
 The only big names bypassing the event are Arnold Palmer and Al Geiberger. 
Palmer has another commitment, and Geiberger underwent rotator cuff surgery and 
will be out for six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Thompson, 54, wondered what he was doing playing alongside all 
the big names. Not anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 Known as "King Rabbit" because he participated in more Monday qualifying 
tournaments for the regular PGA Tour than any other golfer, Thompson has won 
more than $2 million as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most colorful players on any tour, he played in PGA events for 27 
years. By his count, he had been in 611 without a victory until he finally 
broke through at Syracuse in 1991, his third year on the senior tour. He now 
has three victories and more money than he ever thought he would earn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was only a marginal player on the tour, but partly because I was out there 
to have a good time," Thompson said. "I didn't worry too much about whether I 
qualified or not. I had at least one girlfriend in every town. It was a great 
life for a bachelor." 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, he earned $141,000, most of it before the PGA came up with its 
qualifying school and virtually ended Monday qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his colorful garb, Thompson is probably best known for the 
length of his clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaft on his driver is 52 inches long, and he has been using a 
long-handled putter since before he led the senior qualifying school by 10 
shots in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt if anyone will ever have a longer driver," Thompson said, "mainly 
because nobody else would be that stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1991, I've gone from 48 inches to 52, but the toughest change of all 
was the first one -- from 43 1/2 inches to 44 1/2. That one was a huge change. 
For a long time, I hit everything right. I had to make a major adjustment in my 
swing. Since then, I've been comfortable swinging a longer club practically 
from the start. It has enabled me become one of the long hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who is 5 feet 11, 172 pounds, was No. 6 in driving distance last 
year, averaging 268.9 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 Thompson broke the senior record for 18 holes with his 61 by putting well. In 
wiping out Mike Hill's lead, he sank birdie putts of 22, 18, 12 and 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times," he said, "when I feel like every putt will drop. That's the 
way it was that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep watching Arnie with his putting problems and just wish he would go to 
the long-handled style. He's fooled around with it, but he's never given it a 
real try." 
</P>
<P>
 Toco, Tex., has a population of 164. The name is an abbreviation of Thompson 
Oil Co., which is owned by Rocky's father. "I get elected (mayor) every time," 
Thompson said, "because nobody else wants to run." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, who was 14th on the money list with $571,844 earnings in 1993, 
believes the senior tour is about where the regular tour was in the mid-'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tour was like a big fraternity then," he said. "We knew everyone, and 
it's the same on the senior tour."

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; KARIYA CONTRACT TALKS ARE DONE FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What had become obvious is now official -- Paul Kariya won't join the Mighty 
Ducks this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks decided Wednesday to suspend their stalled contract talks with 
Kariya's agent, Don Baizley, until the World Championships April 25-May 8 in 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baizley and Paul and myself will sit down there and put more cards on the 
table about what the options are and what he really wants to do," General 
Manager Jack Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, the fourth overall pick in the draft last June, is reportedly seeking 
up to $2 million a year. The Ducks have offered a deal worth less than $1 
million a year. They also apparently have competition now from a couple of 
teams in Sweden that are seeking to sign Kariya for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the teams have inquired about whether he would come 
to Europe," Baizley told Canadian Press. "Our intention is to have further 
discussions with Anaheim. I do not want to pretend we have not had casual 
discussions. Europe is a possibility, but for the moment (we're focused on 
Anaheim)." 
</P>
<P>
 The sides had not talked for more than two weeks before speaking Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not going to be with us right now, so we might as well wait until we 
sign our No. 2," said Ferreira, who will draft second overall at this June's 
draft. "That could be another circus." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks are a lot closer to reaching an agreement with Maxim Bets, the 
prospect acquired from St. Louis in the Alexei Kasatonov trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira made an initial contract offer Wednesday and is hoping Bets will sign 
in time to at least practice with the team this season. Bets also has been 
placed on the playoff roster of the San Diego Gulls, the team's minor league 
affiliate, and might finish the season there after his junior team, Spokane of 
the Western League, ends its season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to be a player," said Ferreira, who scouted Bets personally for 
the first time Monday. "I don't know if he'll step right in next year, but he's 
a talent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guy Hebert is No. 1 again, and Mikhail Shtalenkov is No. 2, not No. 1-A. 
Hebert, benched for three games earlier this month, made 30 saves against the 
Kings Wednesday night at the Forum to win his third game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got Guy focused and toughened up, as long as we're alive, we'll keep 
going with him," Coach Ron Wilson said. "That's what he's got to learn to do. 
He's determined he wants to be a No. 1 goalie and it takes focus. He relaxed a 
little too much right after the trade (of Ron Tugnutt, the other half of the 
team's goaltending tandem)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Ducks tried flattery. 
</P>
<P>
 Or were they just being contrite after offending the Great One? 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Ducks had much to say about Wayne Gretzky, club president 
Tony Tavares accused him of using his position as the greatest player in the 
history of the game to influence officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky responded with five points in a 5-3 victory Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 This time? Gretzky was being honored for his record-breaking 802nd goal, and 
the Ducks presented him with a plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some records are meant to be carved in stone! With sincere appreciation and 
respect for your achievements, we honor the NHL's greatest player -- The Mighty 
Ducks of Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky responded with no goals and no assists.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: FINDING COMMUNITY ON BULLETIN BOARDS, BYWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the global village gets smaller, our own little piece of it seems to get 
bigger. We leave our sprawling suburban tracts and merge with traffic on 
multiple ribbons of four-lane highways. 
</P>
<P>
 It's down the off-ramp to drop the children at school, then back up the 
on-ramp to join thousands of others lurching along to some other neighborhood 
where we will toil or shop. 
</P>
<P>
 So how do we achieve a sense of community when we spend so little time at 
home? 
</P>
<P>
 We join the PTA or the Neighborhood Watch, and our kids become Boy Scouts, 
Girl Scouts or Little Leaguers. We throw block parties, attend garage sales and 
actually talk to our neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 And we shop locally, and when we do, we check out the neighborhood bulletin 
board at the market, at the Laundromat or in front of the pet shop. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what free-lance writer Leo Smith did. He spent some time in Thousand 
Oaks, at one of the county's busier bulletin boards, to find out more about the 
people and services behind the 3-by-5 cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell a lot about members of a community through the ads they place on 
a bulletin board. Each neighborhood has its own personality and its own 
particular needs," said Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, every place has its lost dogs and get-rich-quick ads. But in Ojai 
you are more likely to find ads of a spiritual and health-conscious nature. At 
the board I went to there was an emphasis on services for the two-career family 
-- housecleaning, cooking, baby-sitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, but not all, of those who advertised in Thousand Oaks needed money, 
Smith said. Others were looking to start or change careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of why they were advertising, all the people I talked with had 
really interesting life stories, which didn't surprise me," said Smith. "If you 
spend enough time with anyone, you'll find something that is interesting, 
touching, even poetic." 
</P>
<P>
 Which are just some of the qualities staff writer Leonard Reed will be looking 
for each week when he and his automobile go "On the Road." His new column, 
which premieres in today's section, will take Len and his readers around the 
county in pursuit of the odd, the funny, the poignant and the extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 If you spot him in his Volkswagen on some back road or at a busy intersection, 
don't just honk at him. Give a wave or tell him a story. That's why he's out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't just another driver on that crowded highway.

NIGHT LIFE: A MUSICIAN WHO KNOWS INDUSTRY WELL; PATRICK LANDREVILLE TALKS ABOUT 
HIS BAND, THE BUSINESS, HOW TO MAKE A HOT RECORD DEAL AND HIS BEARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Landreville could more than hold his own with other famous bearded 
guys -- Moses, Lincoln, the Smith Brothers, Wolfman Jack. If Landreville's 
beard was much longer, he wouldn't need a shirt. It's almost as long as some of 
his stories or the sets his band, Blues Deluxe, plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Blues Deluxe will be doing its incendiary brand of rockin' blues Tuesday night 
at the Midnight Hour in Ventura. Buddy Smith on guitar is the one who puts the 
"rock" in those rockin' blues with bushels of searing solos; Paul Fasulo hits 
the drums; Landreville sings, plays bass, and insists they start on time. He 
also writes all the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Landreville, now an Oxnard resident, is the president of Bald Ego Enterprises, 
and deals with all aspects of the music industry. He has played with everybody, 
knows everybody and has plenty of stories to tell. Without further exposition, 
here are his insights on the usual topics, plus advice on how to make a cold 
call to a record label that could end in a hot deal. On moving here: 
</P>
<P>
 I've lived in Oxnard for the last 12 years, but I first came up here in 1968 
or 1969. I was backing up Dave & Davis, a soul act who had this gig at this 
place called the Greasy Slough Duck Club in Goleta. 
</P>
<P>
 The band was myself; John Boutelle, a local guitarist who lives in Ventura 
now; Bob Siebenberg who ended up in Supertramp; and Scotty Gorham who later was 
in Thin Lizzy. We didn't have any songs, we just faked it, and sometimes played 
16 hours a day. On famous rock stars: 
</P>
<P>
 I've been fortunate to have played with a lot of heavyweights. I played with 
Muddy Waters after Willie Dixon had seen me. Whenever Dixon went off to do his 
own thing, I was his personal replacement. I stayed with Muddy for a few 
months, then played with John Lee Hooker for awhile. In the early '70s, I went 
to England for awhile, but I always seemed to end up backing up other touring 
Americans. Later, I was on the road with Little Richard and Chuck Berry for a 
few years. I've promoted shows, booked bands -- I've done everything in the 
music business except retail. On playing the bass: 
</P>
<P>
 By 1965 or so, I had been a roadie for a bunch of different bands and I 
figured I could do as well as those guys. So I placed an ad for a band and I 
figured whatever I didn't get, I'd do that. That's how I ended up as the bass 
player. Most bass players are just frustrated guitar players. Actually, the 
bass is a very difficult instrument. On the blues: 
</P>
<P>
 Blues is the mother of all American music. I just happened to grow up with the 
blues. If you're a blues man to the core, you just can't get away from it. Eric 
Clapton is a blues man, and no matter what he plays, it's still blues based. 
Blues is an approach to music, a way of playing. On Blues Deluxe: 
</P>
<P>
 I have a song called "Blues Deluxe," so that's where the name came from. Most 
of the songs we do, I wrote in 1966. They're old enough now so it seems that 
someone else wrote them. I think they have a modern sound. On Buddy Smith: 
</P>
<P>
 He's the next guitar god. I've known him since the '60s and I think he's 
better than Stevie Ray Vaughan. He just hasn't really shown his stuff yet. He's 
very transcendent in his thinking and he understands rhythm. On getting signed: 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the local bands seem to have the initiative to record themselves. They 
make demos, then probably send them to the labels. If you send them to the A&R 
(Artists & Repertoire) Department, they usually go straight to the wastebasket 
and you get some sort of form letter. Or, the mail room guy gets them and 
records over them -- free tape. That's why CDs are better. The music business 
is a social business and you have to know someone to be heard. Tapes get 
screened by personal recommendations. There are so many people trying to make 
it and there's only so many minutes in a day. Also, I'd say never pay to play. 
If anyone shows up, they just schmooze with each other, and it's on your tab. 
If you're generating enough heat, the A&R guys will come and see you. On making 
a cold call: 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you do is find a label that has signed a band most similar to 
yours, not the same, just similar. Then you call Artists Relations -- not A&R 
-- most people don't even know they exist. Then you ask about the act, who 
their booking agent is, and who signed them. It's an insider sort of thing; 
it's the job of Artist Relations to give out information. Once you find out who 
signed the band, then you have a name, a person to call. Even if they won't 
return your call at first, keep trying, send them a tape, or better yet, a CD. 
You never know what can happen. Schmooze a little bit on the phone with the 
secretary, get her name. Write it down. Take notes. This could be the person 
that opens the door for you. If you can get her interest, maybe she can get 
your stuff to the top of the pile. On beards: 
</P>
<P>
 I've had beards off and on since the '60s. I've had this one since 1981 or so. 
I used to have a really long one but it got caught in a motor and ripped half 
my face off. This one's only about a fifth of my old beard.

 On a gleaming sunny afternoon two weeks back, folding chairs were lined up in 
rows on the street on the UCSB campus, for scientists, administrators, 
curiosity-seekers and the architecturally minded. A building was being 
christened, a safe harbor for arcane thinkers known as the Institute for 
Theoretical Physics, founded in 1979 and finally with a home of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 As Director James Langer explained over the microphone at the new building's 
dedication, the ITP is "a facility for bringing together scientists from all 
over the world to tackle interesting problems."

 Physics is one thing, architectural celebrity another. What this building 
represents to many is the lasting thumbprint of its maker, the internationally 
renowned and sometimes controversial architect Michael Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves hasn't gained his formidable reputation by way of restraint. The 
Princeton-based architect has often worn post-Modernist tendencies proudly, 
freely weaving historical reference points and conjoining geometric volumes 
like so many building blocks -- all sprinkled with a playful sense of irony and 
unusually vivid exterior colors. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Graves' Southern California projects is a headquarters on the 
Eisner-era Disney lot in Burbank, a quasi-classical edifice with relief 
sculptures of the Seven Dwarfs serving as supportive columns. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the current visitor to UCSB finds in Graves' ITP building, which 
serves as a gateway to the campus from its southern entrance, is a subtle and 
even seemingly polite variation on familiar Southern California themes. Gabled 
red-tiled roofs, soft earth tones and trellises are nothing new around these 
Mediterranean-esque parts. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, however, fairly new to the fabric of the university's largely 
utilitarian architectural scheme. The ITP's home stands apart from its 
immediate surroundings even as it reaches out to the aesthetics of the hosting 
community of Santa Barbara proper, with its dominant Spanish Colonial motif. In 
this way, the ITP building literally serves as a gateway and a bridge between 
the city and the school's self-enclosed microcosm, which seems architecturally 
disassociated from the community that hosts it. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the ITP structure, for instance, is the massive engineering 
complex, a fairly straight Modernist rectilinear steamship of a structure. Gray 
and white surfaces and mechanistic, repetitive rhythms of windows prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves' structure, contrarily, involves two long wings fanning out from a 
cylindrical tower -- with an ocean view to die for -- that serves as the vortex 
on the site. One wing ties in at a right angle to the engineering building, the 
other, roughly tracing the line of the nearby cliff and, by extension, the 
Pacific coastline. 
</P>
<P>
 There it is, in a metaphorical nutshell: The ITP is situated at the juncture 
of engineering and the deep blue sea. And, at the risk of reducing things to 
simplistic symbolism, the engineering building exudes sobriety and pragmatism, 
whereas the ITP, with its soft, embracing image and gentle ironies, might be 
seen as either a suitable think tank or rehab center. 
</P>
<P>
 All is not as mild-mannered or vernacular as it initially appears, however. 
Graves has equipped the structure with a number of intriguing details and 
dichotomies. False window frames and semiclassical pediment motifs -- perched 
over the entrance and tucked into the ceiling of the conference room inside -- 
add a veneer of slyness to the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Trellises, which will one day play host to climbing vines to create a Western 
fringe Ivy League effect, are placed over the second-story windows and create 
raked, checkerboard shadows on walls depending on the sun's angle. Meanwhile, 
individual copper awnings act as eyelids over the ground floor windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years in the planning and building, the ITP structure is Graves' first 
design for the UC system, another in a series of projects that promise to give 
the architect a stronger profile in the state, and a notable architectural 
addition to the campus and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 It's high time that a self-congratulatory cultural haven such as Santa Barbara 
got a Graves. Now, it's got one -- if a tame one by this architect's standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Having completed his work here, Graves is on the institutional brain at the 
moment. At the University Art Museum is a show in the back gallery entitled 
"Michael Graves: Work in California." What's surprising, given his penchant for 
the slightly outlandish, is that Graves didn't start making an impact in this 
state earlier than he has. 
</P>
<P>
 The show includes documentation of the Aventine in La Jolla, which is like a 
mini-post-mod villa with a slender sliver of a Hyatt hotel that looks like a 
vintage toaster on a huge scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Another project in the exhibition is a significant, and yet-to-be-built Graves 
project, the mammoth "Metropolis" in downtown Los Angeles, along the Harbor 
Freeway. If projected computerized images tell the truth, the 
2.7-million-square-foot, mixed-use complex with earthy color scheme and 
geometrical playground-like design may steal the show down in that increasingly 
interesting urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves himself gave a dry-witted and substantial lecture at UCSB before the 
dedication ceremony. Using slides, mostly of paintings throughout history, 
Graves traced the connection of his work with the fundamental ideals of still 
lifes -- such as the work of Morandi -- as well as the architectural paradigms 
of Le Corbusier. 
</P>
<P>
 And, ever the grown-up, deconstructionist trickster, Graves used the term 
"putting Humpty Dumpty back together again" more than once. Mother Goose meets 
high aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
 Concluding his lecture, Graves noted that "the storytelling capacity of 
painting is well known, but the storytelling capacity of architecture has 
largely been lost. It is the responsibility of us to bring it back, at least on 
a subliminal level, to make it available to all of you." 
</P>
<P>
 ITP's storytelling era is now in session.

WORDS & IMAGES: HORSE TRAINER TRANSLATES HER LOVE OF ANIMALS INTO WRITING; SIMI 
VALLEY RESIDENT KATHRYN COCQUYT HAS JUST RELEASED HER SECOND BOOK BASED ON 
"LITTLE FREDDIE" AND HIS EQUINE FAMILY.

 Kathryn (Katie) Cocquyt has the best of two worlds. She and her husband train 
and breed show and race horses on their Simi Valley ranch, and she draws on her 
experiences with the animals to write books for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming from the backstretch to win the big race, or to earn ribbons in jumping 
competitions is every horse lover's fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cocquyt was a child she desperately wanted a horse of her own. As a young 
woman the dream was realized when her husband gave her Mardi Gras, a horse 
Cocquyt says is still her best friend. Cocquyt went on to work as an editor for 
a short time, after earning a degree in English literature. 
</P>
<P>
 But the passion for horses wouldn't subside, so she hired on at a Santa Anita 
racing stable to spend all her time learning about breeding and racing horses. 
Katie and her husband began breeding thoroughbreds in 1986 with the birth of 
Rue Royale, the real life archetype for the fictional "Little Freddie." 
</P>
<P>
 Cocquyt's first book, "Little Freddie at the Kentucky Derby," was published in 
1992 by Pelican Publishing of Louisiana. The just released "Little Freddie's 
Legacy" continues the adventures of a special family of horses. "I write 
stories about these magnificent animals in order to inspire children to face 
their own challenges in life," says Cocquyt, who also lectures on the history 
of the horse to schoolchildren in Southern California and Kentucky, where she 
tours every April before the Kentucky Derby. The "Little Freddie" books are for 
children 8 to 12 and are wonderfully illustrated by Sylvia Corbett of Simi 
Valley.

 Michel Englebert, recently returned from Japan where he lived for 10 years, 
will read from his new "American Epic" poem at 8 p.m. April 7 at Cafe Voltaire, 
34 N. Palm St., Ventura. Now a resident of Channel Islands Harbor, Englebert 
was born in Africa and raised in Belgium. By age 5, he was touring Europe 
performing poetic fables as Le Petit Michel. He came to America when he was 9 
to appear on "The Jack Paar Show," which launched his career as a child actor. 
Since earning a masters in fine arts at UC Irvine, his poetry has been

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: A VERY VISIBLE PERFORMER; DESPITE HIS QUIRKY NAME, RAYWOOD IS 
A HIGHLY POPULAR DANCE PLAYER WHO HAS DEVELOPED A FAITHFUL FOLLOWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 If your only exposure to country music and dancing has been a visit to new, 
glitzy urban cowboy spandex clubs, you might want to check out Camarillo's 
Crazy Bull Steakhouse & Saloon this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Since going country three years ago, the Bull has become a comfortable 
neighborhood club where newcomers feel welcome and regulars come to dance and 
even bring their kids. The attraction is a low-key atmosphere, nightly dance 
lessons and great weekend bands. But the common denominator is a guy named 
Raywood, who will be the featured talent this weekend, celebrating his third 
anniversary at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 He may call himself "Raywood and the Unseen," but this popular "solo 
performer" is very visible. He presides over line dance night on Mondays, a 
country mix on Tuesdays and couples dancing Wednesdays and Thursdays. He also 
plays for the Crazy Bull's popular early Sunday evening family format. 
Raywood's sense of humor, versatile musical talents and attention to dancers' 
requests have made him a fixture at the Bull and on the local country 
entertainment scene. All of this with a single name -- his middle one, Raywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Unseen" part refers to the fact that he plays and prerecords all his own 
instrument tracks. "What I do is the equivalent of all the band members 
learning their individual parts and putting them together. But since I can't 
simultaneously play all the instruments, I capture that performance on tape." 
Then he plays lead guitar and sings live to his own backup tape. Raywood 
performs five to seven original songs nightly. But he rarely announces that 
they are his own compositions. "That way they can take or leave the song on its 
own merits," he said. From his vantage point behind a guitar and synthesizers, 
Raywood nightly observes the human comedy and responds accordingly. "Careful, 
Cheryl," he shouts during a vigorous Tush Push, "you're gonna break that 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also knows how to call and count down the dances; he keeps aficionados of 
Spanish and cowboy reggae from colliding on the same floor, and he is every 
guy's buddy and a protective presence for every woman. But who is this guy, 
really? 
</P>
<P>
 Raywood arrived in Ventura County in 1972 from Richmond, Va., by way of 
Houston. As for age, he admits to remembering when the Beatles broke up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started performing at age 3 when my mom found me outside naked, strumming a 
pitchfork and singing, 'You Ain't Nushin' but a Hound Dog.' Since then I've 
given up the pitchfork for a guitar, moved my act indoors, and even learned to 
dress myself. But I don't do 'Hound Dog' anymore. It's just not the same with 
clothes on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a professional entertainer since 1979. Since I started performing 
solo in '86, I've been successful enough not to have to have a real job." 
Before going solo, Raymond had been in a few local bands, and though they were 
successful, the group thing just wasn't for him. "I'm a business kind of guy. I 
don't have gigs. I have jobs," he said. "And I think a lot of people in bands 
assume they have a blank check to be idiots as far as their craft goes. That 
attitude is what keeps me out of bands. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many nights that I'd show up for work and the drummer was out 
because he had a fight with his girlfriend. Or the guitar player was too drunk 
to play. Personally, I have to take care of business before I have fun. But 
it's my business to ensure the audience has fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of his success? "When I go to work, I put my ego in the glove 
compartment. I play for the audience because I am an audience member -- not a 
star. And there's a real difference between country music and country dance 
music. I don't play a song unless I think it's good and will make people 
dance." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Solo entertainer "Raywood and the Unseen." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Crazy Bull Steakhouse & Saloon, 4426 Central Ave., Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 8:30 tonight through April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Dance lessons start at 6:30 p.m. Sundays; 7 p.m. Mondays through 
Thursdays; 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Raywood plays an hour after lessons, normally Sundays through 
Thursdays. Call 988-4209.

COVER STORY; TAKING LIBRARIES OFF THE SHELF; THREAT OF MORE BUDGET CUTBACKS 
SPURS BOOK LOVERS INTO TAKING ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The architect, the printer, the librarian and eight others trickle into the 
Altadena home and sit around a pine table for a campaign strategy session. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk is of fund-raising letters, campaign mailers, endorsements -- the 
elements of a successful campaign. The candidate: the local library. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that budget cuts will decimate their library, the Altadena activists 
are gearing up a campaign to persuade voters to pass a library tax June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want my 8 1/2-month-old to be able to go to the library like I used to," 
said Reynolds Cafferata, 27, chairman of the Save-Our-Altadena-Library 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altadena activists are part of a wave of San Gabriel Valley book lovers 
who are going on the offensive to save their libraries. They are drawing their 
inspiration from neighboring Pasadena, where voters overwhelmingly approved a 
tax last year to keep their library system from being gutted. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Altadena, residents of South Pasadena have launched a similar 
campaign. The South Pasadena Library, which will celebrate its centennial next 
year, will have to close three days a week if local voters reject the proposed 
tax. It currently operates seven days per week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other institution which does things for all the people," said Jan 
Wetzel, 66, a retired business executive who chairs the Committee to Protect 
Our Library. "That's true whether you're young or old, well-educated, 
self-educated, rich or poor. The library serves all those people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four other cities, which are served by the financially battered county library 
system, have dipped into municipal coffers to prop up services until the end of 
June. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Walnut City Council decided to spend $102,200 to open its branch library 
three additional days a week, for a total of five days of service. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a basic service as far as I'm concerned," said Walnut Councilman H. 
Thomas Sykes, who strongly supported the bailout. "We really do need the 
library open, especially with some of the school districts cutting back on 
staffing in their libraries." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Diamond Bar City Council voted to spend $70,000 to add a fourth and 
fifth day of weekly service and to buy more books. 
</P>
<P>
 * Duarte council members decided to spend $16,000 for a third day of weekly 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 * El Monte officials are spending $9,000 for books and materials for their 
branch library. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in San Dimas, Claremont and La Verne, officials and residents have 
formed committees to investigate how their county library branches can be kept 
open more days. 
</P>
<P>
 Library funding has even become a campaign issue in La Verne, where city 
officials recently decided against spending money on the county library. A 
candidate for City Council is running on a platform of using local tax money to 
increase library services. 
</P>
<P>
 Such actions across the San Gabriel Valley have raised the hopes of library 
patrons, who have watched in dismay as political events outside their control 
have resulted in the diminution of library services. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 -- for the second straight year -- state legislators balanced 
California's budget by taking property-tax money that would have gone to 
counties, cities and special districts. As a result, library directors must 
stand in line to secure the scarce tax dollars that do make it to local 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "California public library services continue to deteriorate as local 
jurisdictions withdraw increasing amounts of funding from libraries to bolster 
police, fire and other safety service," according to a recently released report 
by the California State Library, a state agency that, among other things, 
administers grants to improve library services in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California ranks at the bottom nationwide in per capita public library hours, 
the report said. California offers just 72 hours per 1,000 people, while 
first-place Vermont provides 379 hours per 1,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen cities in the San Gabriel Valley run their own libraries. Most of 
those municipal libraries have been able to get by, trimming book budgets and 
making spending cuts in behind-the-scenes operations while largely maintaining 
hours and services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tax-rich city of Irwindale, library service actually increased last 
year by 20 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some cases, municipally financed libraries have suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Before its library tax passed, Pasadena had cut weekly hours at its main 
library from 70 to 46. Hours at the city's eight branch libraries fell from 40 
to 32 per week. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra closed a library branch and Monterey Park cut Saturday service. The 
library in Covina was one of the hardest hit. Covina officials slashed library 
operations from six to four days a week and have no plans to restore the hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Covina is flourishing compared to some local branches of the huge Los 
Angeles County Library, with a budget that has fallen during the past two years 
from $64 million to $47.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, nine library branches were closed, including three in the 
San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating hours were slashed at the 87 remaining libraries, including 21 
branches in the San Gabriel Valley. The hardest-hit branches, including seven 
in the San Gabriel Valley, are now open only two days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 And things could get worse. County librarian Sandra F. Reuben said the county 
may have to close as many as 50 more of its libraries on July 1, the start of 
the new fiscal year. Faced with continuing financial problems, the County Board 
of Supervisors is expected to make further cuts in library spending to balance 
its budget for the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we'll find a means to bridge us through, but right now I don't know 
where that's going to come from," Reuben said. "I'm even going to be turning to 
users of libraries who can give $10 or $15 each." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, library officials throughout the area deluge Edward M. 
Szynaka, Pasadena's library director, with calls seeking information about how 
to mount a library-tax effort. When Szynaka held a meeting last month to pass 
on campaign tips, representatives of more than 30 city and county libraries 
attended, including people from Altadena, South Pasadena and other San Gabriel 
Valley cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this interest: An overwhelming 79.9% of those voting last year 
approved taxing themselves to save the city's eight library branches from 
closure. The tax raises $1.3 million a year. Homeowners pay $20 a year, while 
apartment owners pay $13 per unit and non-residential property owners 
contribute $147. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Pasadena Library is flourishing. Instead of closing eight 
branches, library officials restored operating hours that were cut in recent 
years and are working to fill positions that were left vacant, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong fund raising, a good corps of volunteers and a deft absentee ballot 
campaign were keys to the victory, Szynaka said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Library taxes require two-thirds approval from the electorate -- a high 
hurdle. But right off, library proponents everywhere have something going for 
them, Szynaka said. "In the minds of the public, the library is pure good." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the county, the Altadena Library District suffered extensive budget cuts 
at the hands of state lawmakers. The district had a $1.4-million budget two 
years ago compared with $882,360 this year, said district librarian William J. 
Tema. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials there decided to close the library on Sundays and on Tuesday 
nights beginning last October to save money. One employee was laid off. Library 
officials have spent $305,000 in reserves over the past two years to avoid 
bigger cuts, but the reserves will be depleted after this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's shelves for new books attest to the cutbacks. They were empty on 
a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby sign reads, "The children of Altadena need these books. Can you 
donate them?" It lists the 1994 Newbery Award winner, "The Giver," by Lois 
Lowry, and this year's Randolph Caldecott Medal winner, "Grandfather's 
Journey," by Allen Say. 
</P>
<P>
 If Altadena's tax measure fails, officials say they will have to close their 
main library two of the six days a week it is now open. The branch library will 
open two days instead of five. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't take a chance on losing this (tax measure)," Tema said. "Our budget 
cuts would be too drastic." 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax passes, it will raise about $430,000 a year to restore the funding 
lost the past two years, Tema said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the owners of single-family homes will pay $29 a year, 
apartment owners $20 per unit and commercial and industrial property owners $59 
to $79. 
</P>
<P>
 Tema and the Save Our Altadena Library committee began organizing late last 
year to push for the library tax. The group has hired political consultant 
Wendy Soltes to manage the campaign, which will include telephone banks and 
direct mail. So far the campaign has raised about $10,000; its goal is $55,000, 
Tema said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Altadena campaign should benefit from the wide use its library gets; the 
library's meeting room is a key gathering place for community groups, Soltes 
said. Also, Save Our Altadena Library has won key endorsements, including the 
support of the Chamber of Commerce. That contrasts with the campaign in 
Pasadena, where business leaders opposed the library tax. 
</P>
<P>
 But Soltes said the Altadena campaign lacks the well-organized cadre of 
wealthy library supporters who contributed about $200,000 to the campaign war 
chest in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no formal opposition has surfaced in Altadena. But that could change 
after word of the proposed tax spreads. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walk around . . . and talk to people about the library tax most of the 
people are furious," said Steven Lamb, who is on the town council of the 
unincorporated community. "So if that continues, I won't support it." 
</P>
<P>
 This is Altadena's second try at a library tax. Voters rejected a tax measure 
in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 If the current measure passes, it will stay in effect for five years, as would 
the South Pasadena tax. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Pasadena library has been spared budget cuts so far. But the 
library's funding will fall from $982,000 this year to $762,000 next year if 
voters don't approve the library tax, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 The library has the city's largest operating budget after the police and fire 
departments, and city officials say they have no choice but to trim it to make 
up for state funding cuts. Along with reducing the library's operation to four 
days a week, the cuts would result in the layoffs of nearly 20 workers. Its 
special programs for children, including story time and its summer reading 
program, would probably die, said city librarian Mary Lou Wigley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would go from a full-service library to check in, check out and 
reference," Wigley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed tax would cost homeowners $24 to $48 a year, depending on the 
size of the house. The owners of apartments and non-residential buildings would 
be taxed as well. The levy would be $12 per apartment and $24 to $96 for 
non-residential buildings. The tax is expected to raise about $220,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax measure passes, the library budget and programming will remain 
stable, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena's Committee to Protect Our Library will run its campaign 
without the help -- and expense -- of a consultant. The group, which includes 
Mayor James C. Hodge Jr. and Councilman Jim Woollacott, hopes to raise $30,000 
to $40,000 but has nothing so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Pasadena City Council voted to put the measure on the ballot earlier 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel we can sit back and relax, but I think there's sufficient time 
to be successful," Hodge said. 
</P>

 A handful of residents called the South Pasadena Taxpayers Assn. opposes the 
measure because it would collect revenue only from property owners and not 
renters, who also benefit from the library. Bob Cook, a spokesman for the 
association, said he would prefer to raise money by increasing the city's 
utility tax, which hits both groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate we have to oppose the library tax because that's almost like 
going against motherhood and apple pie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While county officials say they would like a tax of their own to benefit the 
county library system, the two-thirds voter approval would be a difficult, and 
costly, standard to meet in a 4,079-square-mile county with 3.5 million 
registered voters. The Book on Libraries

SIGHTS; VENTURA ART WALK LETS VIEWERS SET OWN PACE; THIS YEAR'S EVENT SHOWCASED 
THE TOWN'S MIXED BAG OF ARTISTIC ENDEAVORS WITH FREE COFFEE THROWN IN FOR GOOD 
MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just another early Saturday night in the relatively sedate burg of 
downtown Ventura. Club hoppers geared up for a night of lurching. People milled 
around with that mid-weekend idleness, going nowhere special, with a purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 But another crop of folks filtered onto the streets on this night, a 
coffee-addled bunch wandering the streets like nervous zombies, looking for art 
and free joe. It was time for another Ventura Art Walk. The idea was simple and 
twofold: to showcase old town art spaces -- as previous city-sponsored Art Walk 
events have -- but with coffee added into the mix. Numerous coffeehouses that 
have sprung up around Ventura in the last year participated in the newly 
christened "Java Jump" by freely dispensing various flavors to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous events, the latest Ventura Art Walk succeeded in reminding us 
that Ventura has energetic cultural sub-currents, and more artistic activity 
than might initially meet the eye. To say the art on display represented a 
mixed aesthetic is to understate the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 This point was plain to anyone who, for instance, stopped by Art City II to 
see sTeVe Knauff's video-centric maze of an installation and then on to the 
calm historical exposition of local Portuguese culture at the Ventura Museum of 
History and Art. Anyone who descended into the subterranean Orifice Gallery and 
then moved on to sample the tamer stuff at the Buenaventura Gallery knows the 
meaning of variety. 
</P>
<P>
 And vive la difference ! Nothing like a not-so leisurely, art-consuming stroll 
to get a picture of what the scene is like. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were hopping over at the Livery Arts Center, where various performance 
and dance activities were occurring at the Performance Studio. Meanwhile, 
coffee heads gravitated toward Cafe Voltaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kelly, who seems to be the artist-in-residence at the Voltaire, is 
showing some interesting new work, along with paintings by John Shippey and 
sculpture by Matt Harvey, in a show called "Color & Form." 
</P>
<P>
 In Kelly's vivid paintings, ancient iconography echoes the patterns of 
graffiti art and other contemporary-primitive strategies. Kelly strives to make 
a connection between Eurocentric art ideals and ancient culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in the Livery, the Momentum Gallery featured stone lithograph work by a 
diversified trio of Ventura College students. Janet Blevins depicts cuddly 
animals, and Laura Gallardo presents dreamy erotic figures. Robert Martinez 
goes for the vein of graphic surrealism popularized by M.C. Escher. Martinez's 
fondly rendered but gaunt portrait of Escher is the finest piece in the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all spots on the Art Walk, Nicholby's offered perhaps the most multifarious 
experience between coffee, liquor, pool tables and some art worth looking at. 
The artists showing here deal in figurative work depicting half-cooked humanity 
-- as if the subjects have had too much coffee, liquor and/or pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Day's figures tend to be smudged and swollen, discolored either from 
too much passion or oxygen deprivation. Sometimes, it's not clear whether 
they're locked in embrace or mortal combat. Things turn gruesome with 
"Marinated Tenderloin," a dinner table setting with a naked, emaciated figure 
in the soup. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Dahl's gallery of everyday grotesques are slathered with thick swipes of 
paint, their angles slightly twisted and their flesh sometimes given that 
Lucien Freud-esque mortal pallor. Her series here, under the title "Lost in the 
Funhouse," portrays woozy revelers in close-up, caught up in the dizzy haze of 
hedonism. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing these paintings amid the elbow-bending billiards players and the 
nightclub atmosphere is entirely fitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best art spaces on the tour were off the beaten path. You wound 
your way upstairs to Nicholby's, and down to find the Orifice, Ventura's most 
decentrally located gallery. Literally underground, beneath the Medusa Hair 
Salon, the Orifice is a promising venue, housing a show by the fledgling new 
artist's organization, the Ventura Artist's Union. 
</P>
<P>
 As you walk through a twisting passageway lined with walls of figurative 
sketches and corrugated metal, Eric Richards' life-size "Birdfeeder," a rusty 
metal nude with bird-feeder attached, serves as the greeter. Getting to the art 
is part of the appreciation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Art of various types is scattered throughout the gallery, from the animalia of 
Lane Rowell's sedate lithographs of fowl and Paul Lindhard's "Baboon" to Joe 
Cardella's xerography, Richard Peterson's sociopolitically charged work, and 
Eric Richards' surreal painting, "Third World Door," in the heart of the 
gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 In 3-D, we find Hiroko Yoshimoto's vibrant wing-shaped canvas piece and M.B. 
Hanrahan's elaborate "Reality of the Unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at Eternal Comforts, the casket and urn emporium, the art shown this time 
around was much calmer than the apparitional figures of Paul Berchan that were 
last on view. This time, watercolorist Sue Woods provided the pretty pictures, 
mostly generic landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main attraction there was just the peculiar experience of looking at 
art among these shiny, unused resting places, including a plain pine casket -- 
the deconstructionist model. 
</P>
<P>
 All roads on the Art Walk led, appropriately, up to the gallant old Ventura 
City Hall edifice. There, a swarming crowd gathered while a full moon shone 
overhead, illuminating the town below. 
</P>
<P>
 A raffle was held, official bon mots offered, and some offbeat music was 
performed in the atrium until after midnight. Next to the "stage" area, the 
looming wooden sculpture of Padre Junipero Serra seemed to look away from the 
stage disapprovingly. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, for better or worse -- mostly better -- it was a Ventura thing.

REWIND; 'DAY OF JACKAL' LIKE A CHESS GAME -- WITH MORE SUSPENSE; MOVIE BASED ON 
FREDERICK FORSYTH NOVEL EMPLOYS MOVE AND COUNTERMOVE IN POLICE DETECTIVE'S 
EFFORT TO TRACK DOWN AN ASSASSIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the suspenseful "Day of the Jackal," a master assassin hired to kill French 
President Charles de Gaulle works to complete his mission while government 
detectives race to uncover his identity and stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, based on the novel by Frederick Forsyth, begins as French generals 
are plotting to kill the president and entice an assassin known only as "the 
Jackal" to do the job. Police soon discover the plot but have no idea who the 
hit man is or when he may strike. Worse, the president insists on maintaining a 
schedule of risky public appearances and refuses extra security measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Fox is the Jackal, a villain who is all the more menacing because his 
attitude is so matter-of-fact and businesslike. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the film follows the Jackal as he prepares for his mission, doing such 
tasks as getting passports to match his disguises and a collapsible rifle 
capable of firing explosive-tipped bullets. Dialogue is often sparse because he 
is alone in many of the scenes, preparing, planning and evading capture, but 
the action is involving because it reveals only one small piece of his plan at 
a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Michel Lonsdale plays Claude Lebel, the police commissioner charged with the 
seemingly impossible task of identifying and capturing the assassin. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrewd and thorough Lebel is up to the task. When he unmasks the source of 
an information leak among more than a dozen cabinet-level officials, they 
challenge him to provide evidence. So he plays a recording of one of the 
officials' lovers phoning information about the investigation to the 
conspirators. Later, the impressed prime minister tells him: "There is one 
thing, though. How did you know whose telephone to tap?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't," Lebel replies. "So I tapped all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie unfolds as a kind of chess game between an assassin bent on taking a 
life and a detective determined to save one. Each employs move and countermove, 
hoping to catch the other off balance and strike the final blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Day of the Jackal" (1973), directed by Fred Zinnemann. 143 minutes. Rated PG.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; ELECTRONIC GADGETS BRING MOVIE THEATER 
EXPERIENCE HOME; WITH THE PROPER EQUIPMENT, CONSUMERS CAN HAVE THE FEELING OF 
THE CINEMA IN THEIR LIVING ROOMS. BUT THE INITIAL COST CAN BE HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Consumer electronic pioneers are pushing the envelope of home entertainment 
with the latest gadget for home theater, letterboxed laser discs and 
wide-screen TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination generates the same oblong dimensions as screens in movie 
theaters. At a ratio of 16:9, the picture is one-third wider than the 4:3 ratio 
of TV screens. 
</P>
<P>
 A letterboxed video viewed on a regular TV results in black bands along the 
top and bottom of the screen, but when viewed on a wide screen, it re-creates 
the movie-going experience without the confiscatory prices of the ticket booth 
and concession stand. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the tip of the microchip. Home theater accouterments, the digital 
video signal and surround-sound audio are threatening the movies the way fax 
machines and E-mail are threatening the U. S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I don't go to many theaters," said John Seder, a physician at 
Community Memorial Hospital in Ventura and a home theater owner. "I bought it 
because I enjoy really good sound and it's better than the sound you get at 
multiplex theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 All the Hyper Bass-Acoustimass-Pro-Logic techno-babble seems like the 
electronic equivalent of muscle car jargon from hot rod magazines of the '60s 
and '70s. It's no coincidence then that most of the customers whom salesman Joe 
Spina serves at Classic Video and Stereo in Newbury Park are men between the 
ages of 30 and 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of buyers are trying to impress other people. The neighbors have it so 
they have to have it," Spina said. "With that type of customer, you have to 
appeal to them that the system you're going to sell them is better than the one 
the Joneses have." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, Spina said, is that you can only impress your friends once. After 
that, new owners forget about impressing their friends and start enjoying the 
system themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sizable investment," Seder said, "but I don't think it was significant 
given the entertainment value I get from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Seder adds, it's good for the kids. Seder's daughter, 7, has learned 
how to play laser discs herself, a skill she uses to watch Disney films. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost roughly equal to a set of braces or a year's tuition at a UC campus, 
how much benefit can a parent genuinely expect from "Fantasia" with digital 
Dolby stereo? 
</P>
<P>
 That's a personal issue, but if you'd rather have a child with straight teeth 
or a university degree, try Cliff Roepke's low-cost guerrilla tactic. Roepke, 
an installer of high-end home theater, offers the suggestion with the caveat 
that it should only be attempted on a stereo you're not afraid to damage. "Take 
the wire that goes to one of the speakers and connect the positive wire to the 
negative terminal. That inverts the phase and produces an effect similar to 
surround sound," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then turn down the lights and scoot real close to the set."

AT THE MARKET: IF TREATED WELL, FINICKY AZALEAS MAY BLOOM ALL YEAR; ALTHOUGH 
MOST ARE SHADE LOVING, SOME VARIETIES WILL TOLERATE THE HOTTER, MORE ARID AREAS 
OF VENTURA COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RODNEY BOSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Spring is here and many gardeners are searching for a seasonally appropriate 
plant to complement path or garden. 
</P>
<P>
 While the often-biggish New Zealand Tea Tree, a previously featured shrubbery 
subject, can be an excellent hedge or screen, something small and containable 
might be more desirous. How about an azalea? 
</P>
<P>
 The generally low-lying family of azaleas can adorn a landscape in dramatic 
fashion, adding profuse blooms in vibrant reds, lavenders, orange blends, pinks 
and even white. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, area nurseries are well-stocked with azalea types for spring 
planting, most of which bloom throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Azaleas are probably best used for winter and spring color," said Keith Lenik 
of Baron Brothers Nursery in Camarillo. "Not many shrubs bloom in winter, and 
azaleas can be the grandest." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much fussier than the easy-to-care-for New Zealand Tea Tree, the 
azalea flourishes in Southern California. Its needs are fairly simple, but must 
be strictly attended to -- or else. 
</P>
<P>
 First, keep in mind that azaleas -- a rhododendron descendant -- are generally 
shade-loving plants. They thrive along the cooler coastal region, but there are 
also varieties that will tolerate the hotter, more arid inland areas of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, according to local nursery staff, is making sure you choose the 
correct variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can be tricky plants," said Maureen Shea, manager of Phil Lee Nursery in 
Moorpark. "If you're not careful where you plant them, they just bake." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the numerous varieties, Ventura County residents should choose from the 
Belgian Indica and Southern Indica. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Indica are fine for a cooler, coastal climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'sun azaleas' are the Southern Indicas," Shea said. "They can withstand 
direct sunlight." 
</P>
<P>
 Both types feature lush and full evergreen foliage and abundant blooms. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a locale in your yard, keep in mind that too much direct sun 
will burn the azalea's smallish leaves. The plant fares better in filtered 
shade beneath tall trees. Eastern or northern exposure alongside a house or 
fence is another possible spot, but beware, Lenik said. "They can take full 
sun, but not reflective heat. You don't want to put it next to a white wall or 
any reflecting surface." 
</P>
<P>
 Now reach for the shovel and start digging. Carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Digging the hole "is absolutely critical," Lenik said. Think of it as a 
rectangle or soup bowl, not a square, he said. It needs to be twice as wide as 
the plant. And the depth should be less than the root ball itself, Lenik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azaleas demand soil rich in acid and organic matter. The root system must also 
be provided with soil that drains quickly, but retains moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer in your yard may well be peat moss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under ideal conditions, they prefer at least 50% to 75% peat moss to soil," 
Lenik said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: You will generally find that area nurseries stock azaleas in the 
five-gallon container size. Depending on the nursery and variety, this size of 
plant will cost $12.50 to $18. For the next couple of months, Baron Brothers 
Nursery (7568 Santa Rosa Road, Camarillo) is running a sale on azaleas: Their 
large stock of five-gallon azaleas start at $10.50. You'll also find favorable 
prices and a colorful array of the plants at Phil Lee Nursery (6005 Grimes 
Canyon Road, Moorpark).

EARTHWATCH: CLEANUP PRODUCTS WITHOUT THE POISONS; SIMPLE GREEN, LIFE TREE AND 
ECOVER ARE NOW STOCKED AT AREA SUPERMARKETS.

 Spring is here and it's cleanup time, which is never much fun. But there is 
some news for the environmentally minded: You can get a vast array of 
earth-friendly products and services locally, no more dialing long distance or 
driving the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 One company, Tallon, specializes in pest control -- but without the usual 
poisons. So many calls from residents of this county were being made to their 
Santa Maria and Long Beach offices that they set up shop in Ventura last year, 
said branch manager Tim Williams. The company injects super-cold liquid 
nitrogen into the walls to purge the termites. No toxic chemicals. No tent. "We 
freeze their buns off," quipped Williams' boss, Jay Tallon. 
</P>
<P>
 And who hasn't noticed lately that in supermarkets, baking soda, vinegar and 
common salt are being featured on the labels of many new cleaning products? 
Even Efferdent and kitty litter. Goodby chlorine. Phooey to biphenyls. We've 
become suspicious of "super strength." Now the bias is toward biodegradable. 
We're watching what we wash into the water supply and onto the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than analyzing this trend further I thought I'd just report on some 
brands I have used with good results. 
</P>
<P>
 New cleaning products with names like Simple Green, Life Tree, Earth Wise and 
Ecover are becoming available at Ralphs, Vons and Walmart, as well as at 
Lassens' and Mrs. Gooch's. Trader Joe's now carries a full line of very 
eco-correct cleaning products bearing the store's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The labels on the the best of these products are beginning to read like the 
beauty counter or snack bar at a fitness salon: citrus, vinegar, salt, soy, 
coconut oil. No animal products. Only materials from natural, renewable sources 
-- no petrochemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 All this planetary probity doesn't mean we're sacrificing true cleanliness, by 
the way. I agree with David Goldstein, of the county's Waste Management 
District. He uses Simple Green on his walls and counters and says, "It works." 
I have also had the same experience with Ecover. 
</P>
<P>
 This might be a good time to point out that the very act of cleaning is not 
what we have traditionally thought it was -- getting rid of dirt. We are, if 
you think about it, just displacing it. We take it off the kitchen floor or off 
our clothes and it lands in the waste-water stream. 
</P>
<P>
 In the heyday of "super-strength" cleaners, we enjoyed the fantasy that we 
were nuke-ing dirt into nothingness. In fact, we were just adding toxics and 
perfume to it -- making it impossible for it to be returned to nature or to 
used for growing things. We were making toxic waste in our kitchens. And 
burning our skin and lungs, year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 The final word on this changing trend might be the comment by Karen 
Christiansen, author of the book "Home Ecology": "I rejected my father's 
environmental concerns when I was a teen-ager, but with the birth of my first 
child I became more interested in the future, in the way we have been using up 
the world's natural resources without a thought for what this will mean to our 
children and grandchildren." 
</P>
<P>
 She gives new meaning to spring cleaning. Details

SHOPTALK; EASTER GIFTS ABOUND; OPPORTUNITIES FOR BARGAINS ARE EVERYWHERE. 
SHOPPERS SHOULD PLAN AHEAD TO SAVE SOME TIME.

 Last week we compared prices on Passover items at local grocery stores. This 
week, in our continuing effort to be nondenominational, we will concentrate on 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Passover -- which offered few shopping options -- Easter items are 
everywhere. There are so many choices, in fact, that we recommend planning 
ahead before you shop. Map out a route and arrange it so you can hit two or 
three stores in one stop. You will probably be able to get everything you need 
without additional time and parking hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 We went Easter shopping last week at party supply stores, discount stores and 
grocery stores, most of which had shelves stocked high with pastel merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was the Dollar and More Store in Fillmore which, due to 
earthquake damage, is now operating out of a temporary structure in Central 
Park. What was most noteworthy at this store was that no tax is being charged 
on any items. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Easter supplies there were limited, we did find an attractive 
basket made by Willowbrook Farms of Commerce, Calif., filled with chocolate, 
taffy, jelly beans and other candy. Price: $6.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that a good deal? Well, we found comparable baskets at Vons in the Rose 
Avenue shopping center in Oxnard and at the Oxnard Target store on Vineyard 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At Vons they were going for $6.99 (plus tax) and at Target they were $5.99 
(plus tax). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, baskets and their contents vary, and they need to reflect the taste 
of the recipient, no matter what the price. And remember, there's always 
another option. If you don't want to buy a filled basket, buy an empty one and 
fill it yourself. Empty baskets, like the loaded ones, vary greatly -- in size, 
shape and design. The largest volume and variety we came across was at Bonnie's 
party supply store on Main Street in Ventura. Prices began at $1.29 for baskets 
large enough to hold a decent quantity of goodies. We found them as low as 
$2.98 at Vons, $1.48 at the Parties Galore store at the Rose shopping center, 
$1.99 at Target, and $1.49 at the Pic 'N' Save in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 It would probably be cheapest to fill these baskets with homemade craft items, 
but if you don't have the time or the talent, there are dozens of trinkets out 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the many little gifts in stock at Parties Galore, we found cute 
panoramic eggs (those eggs with a scene inside) for $1.98 (small) and $7.98 
(jumbo). Elsewhere, we found a 22-inch inflatable Barbara Bunny for 99 cents at 
Pic 'N' Save and miniature figurines for 97 cents each at Bonnie's, which 
offers shelves of basket fillers. 
</P>
<P>
 We also visited Fillmore Flower Shop, just down the street from the Dollar and 
More Store, where we discovered fancier items mixed in with the toys. A ceramic 
Easter egg salt and pepper shaker in a ceramic basket was $14.95, miniature 
bunny figurines were $3 and $4, a bunny head candleholder was $4.15, and place 
mats with egg prints were $7. The matching napkins were $3.25 a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if chocolate is welcome in your home, you will undoubtedly want to 
toss some into the basket. The best prices we found were at Pic 'N' Save. A 
2.3-ounce hollow egg was going for 99 cents. That was the good news. The bad 
news? Most of the eggs were cracked. The store also had solid 3.5-ounce ducks 
and rabbits for 99 cents. But again, some of the animals had been roughed up a 
bit. 
</P>
<P>
 For chocolate with virtually no damage: We found 3 1/2-ounce hollow chocolate 
eggs for just under $2, and 1 3/4-ounce hollow bunnies for just under $1, at 
both Target and Vons. Both stores, of course, had huge candy selections. Target 
was even selling a 1 1/2-ounce solid chocolate bunny with "no sugar added" for 
those on sugar-restricted diets. Price: $1.49.

FASHION; HATS OFF TO 'IN' HEADGEAR; THEY OFFER A LOT OF ROOM FOR A PERSONAL 
STATEMENT. SOME STORES GO TO EXTREMES -- SUCH AS OFFERING THE MAJESTIC AND THE 
BIZARRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hats are like religion. They come into favor every other generation, stir up 
passion, then are forsaken by the young. 
</P>
<P>
 It's their in cycle now. Those with hat hang-ups have passed the buying power 
torch; fresh hat-friendly types have seized it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, headgear is hot. Even in Southern California, where locks have long 
bleached in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's any doubt, look around you. Hats go to the beach, to parties, to 
school. They are featured at just about every clothing store in Ventura County, 
including shoe and swimwear shops. Even the Gap offers customers a few straw 
boaters and, if the Gap's got 'em, they must be in. 
</P>
<P>
 Hats offer a lot of room for a personal statement. You can express adventure 
with a safari style, modesty in a veiled pillbox, nonchalance in a tam. They 
can complement an outfit, add height to your stature or hide bad hair. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing they don't do particularly well is keep good hair looking good. We 
asked hatter Jessica Hanson of Ojai what the industry was doing to overcome 
this fault, and she admitted that there was nothing on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to overcoming the flaw, she said, is to carefully choose a hat that 
is comfortable and "just keep it on until you get home." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson has been in hats since their recent renaissance. She opened her 
boutique, Jessica, in 1989, and put in a few hats for fun and decoration. They 
took off; now, they are all she sells. 
</P>
<P>
 She carries fashions from cloches to straws, as well as further-out styles 
such as gold lame jockey caps. She likes wearing hats, trimming hats and 
helping customers find flattering styles that will serve them well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a hat for every face," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether there's a face for every hat is another question. It comes to mind 
upon entering the Village Hatter at Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 This place takes millinery to its outer limits. It has fashion hats, all 
right; but it goes beyond fashion to the majestic and the bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 We could hardly resist trying on the Viking helmets, the felt stovepipes or 
the knitted beanies with attached dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people buy hats," store manager Lydia Sandoval said, which seemed 
like a given. In fact, the store has been operating in this location for 10 
years, far longer than the current hat sanction has been in effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, customers have learned to come to the shop for diverse 
head-covering needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Church people buy church hats," said Sandoval, indicating wide silk hats with 
silk flowers that are kept on top shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 Car club members come to get matching nostalgic straws, the kind that tap 
dancers used to wave. Teen-agers, she said, have recently begun to favor 
derbies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they see them in a movie, and they think that looks cool," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Best sellers in the store are Greek fishing hats for men and berets for women, 
with soft bush hats for both sexes running close behind. Beyond that, she 
couldn't guess; there are hundreds of styles, each with its following. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing to watch out for should you decide to indulge: Hats are addictive. 
Hanson has acquired 20 of them, Sandoval 25. 
</P>
<P>
 A regular customer at Village Hatter, Nila La Duke of Ventura, admitted to 15, 
but offered a genetic excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother was a hat freak," she said while trying on a massive church 
hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Her companion, Chris Klein of Ventura, another collector, said hats draw more 
compliments from men than any other clothing item. She teams hats with many 
outfits, and may choose an offbeat combination to fit her personal taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you feel good in an outfit, no one will say, 'Oh, that's not the style,' " 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, that seemed like a good theory, but it could be put to a 
severe test with a dreadlock beanie.

MUSIC; ROOTS ROCKERS TO BLAZE PATH TO BENEFIT FOR ABUSED KIDS; ROCKABILLY 
ROUNDUP IN SANTA BARBARA WILL AID CHILD ABUSE LISTENING & MEDIATION, A 
NONPROFIT AGENCY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Moe Howard School of Child Rearing, where you line the little gum chewers 
up and slap 'em all at once, is definitely out this year. And don't expect 
anyone to cover the old Ramones tune, "Beat On The Brat" at the Fifth Annual 
Rockabilly Roundup at the Red Dog Saloon in Santa Barbara on Saturday night. As 
usual, this wingding is a benefit for C.A.L.M. (Child Abuse Listening & 
Mediation), the nonprofit agency in Santa Barbara whose aim it is to prevent, 
assess and treat child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Headlining will be those East L.A. roots rockers, the Blazers. Also on the 
bill for the third time is Ronnie Dawson, a Dallas-based rockabilly guy just 
back from a successful European tour; the Frantic Flattops are driving all the 
way from Rochester, N.Y., in a 1962 Cadillac hearse for the event; and opening 
at 9 sharp is the gig's organizer, Tony Balbinot and his band, the Roadhouse 
Rockers. There should be enough slick-backed hair at this gig to get Brylcreem 
stock sliding back up to 1959 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blazers have a new album just out on Rounder Records, and will surely be 
blamed for an outbreak of widespread dancing when they play songs off their 
"Short Fuse" release. The band includes a dual guitar attack featuring Ruben 
Guadarrama and Manuel Gonzales. Lee Stuart is the bass player and Ruben 
Gonzalez is the drummer. The Blazers are the latest in a long line of Latino 
rockers out of Los Angeles from Richie Valens to Thee Midnighters to El Chicano 
to Los Lobos. Guadarrama discussed his favorite band during a recent phone 
interview from his La Verne home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We grew up in Los Angeles and had the common thing with the neighborhood 
where there were a lot of different cultures. We'd be listening to mariachi 
music in the morning, then Chuck Berry in the afternoon, then country-Western 
would be on TV at night. The Mexican culture in East L.A. is just a little bit 
of everything. It's just the folk music from different cultures. Is it roots 
rock? I don't know, but I really don't know what else to call it." Since the 
Blazers sing in English and Spanish, incorporating blues and country, Western, 
early rock, plus traditional cumbias and a more recent norteno sound, the 
comparison with Los Lobos is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've known those guys for a long time because we're from the same 
neighborhood," said Guadarrama. "I know they mean it as a compliment to compare 
us to Los Lobos, but it's scary. I mean, I'm a fan of those guys. It puts 
pressure on us, but it's good pressure. One thing, I guess, is that we don't 
have an accordion. If we did, none of us could play it as well as Dave 
(Hidalgo) does, anyway. If people see us, and have a good time before they walk 
away, that's good enough for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The mutual admiration society goes both ways here. Cesar Rosas of Los Lobos 
was the producer of "Short Fuse." The Blazers have other famous fans. One night 
a few years ago at a gig, Bob Dylan showed up and ended up inviting the band to 
open for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, that was a lot of fun. We met him a few days before when he came to 
our gig at the Palomino and hung out. He was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Musicians tend to live in the salvageable future, unlike the crowded present, 
which is littered with broken MTV dreams and the reality of not getting signed. 
Not the Blazers. They had an unusual method of pursuing a deal, one that 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sort of a fairy tale how we ended up on Rounder. We sent demo tapes to 
everyone just like everyone does, then we heard that Rounder was kind of 
interested. So we printed up these little postcards with Rounder's address on 
them and passed them out at our gigs. We told people if they liked our music to 
send the cards to Rounder. They were getting bombarded by those postcards. Then 
last June, someone from the label came to see us in New Orleans, and we got 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
 It may take some time for Blazer to take off, but then Guadarrama and Gonzales 
have nothing if not patience. They've been jamming together since 1971 or when 
they were still attending Roosevelt High School. Countless bands in countless 
incarnations followed until the Blazers took shape about six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing this regular club thing -- a casino in Bell; I don't even know 
if it's still there. We were there for like a year and we had a new name every 
week. So after we became the Blazers in 1988, we realized that we hadn't 
changed the name for a month, so we figured we had something there and decided 
to hold onto that one." Details

THEATER REVIEW; 'JOINED AT THE HEAD' COMBINES HUMOR, PAIN; THE COMEDY-DRAMA 
SERVES UP PLENTY OF WITTY COMMENTARY ABOUT CONTEMPORARY ATTITUDES TOWARD 
ILLNESS AND LIFE IN GENERAL.

<P>
 A curious thing keeps happening to Maggie, the glib novelist who narrates the 
true story of a friend battling cancer in Catherine Butterfield's comedy-drama, 
"Joined at the Head." 
</P>
<P>
 Each time Maggie starts to indulge in some dramatic embellishment to the story 
she's telling us, one of the other characters will interrupt and 
matter-of-factly contradict her with a description -- less romanticized, 
perhaps, but far more accurate -- of what really occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a theatrical conceit with handsome payoffs in this strikingly inventive 
play, now in the last leg of its West Coast premiere production at Santa 
Barbara's Lobero Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maggie waxes particularly eloquent about a moving glance exchanged by her 
stricken friend (also named Maggy, but with a "y") and Maggy's stoic husband, 
the feisty Maggy calls a timeout and takes her case directly to the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell her heart's in the right place," she tells us. "But this is my 
life here and she's turning it into a Gothic novel." She then goes on to set 
the record straight. Rather than being immortalized as a heroic martyr, she'd 
rather be remembered as another person who got cancer, whose life had meaning 
just as all lives have meaning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, she neatly sidesteps the cliched pitfalls in the 
life-threatening illness genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Later on, when Maggy's husband, Jim, reveals his inner anguish in another 
direct address to the viewer, it's a scene that aches with all the longings and 
fears that go unvoiced between people. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsettled by her eroding control over the story she's telling, narrator Maggie 
apologizes at one point for all this fourth wall penetration, saying she 
"didn't mean this to be a Brechtian evening." 
</P>
<P>
 She needn't have worried. Where Brecht's asides and interruptions were 
designed to detach the emotions, the effect here is quite the reverse -- by 
constantly violating our expectations, "Joined at the Head" forces us to 
experience its story with fresh emotions rather than conditioned sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional tide pulls us as often toward laughter as it does to tears -- 
though the subject is painful, the play serves up plenty of witty commentary 
about contemporary attitudes toward illness (and life in general). 
</P>
<P>
 How could it be otherwise, with playwright Butterfield -- also a gifted comic 
actress -- playing the afflicted Maggy? Snappy and disarmingly honest, her 
Maggy, despite the character's denials, is a truly exceptional and inspiring 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Allin's portrayal of Jim is equally adept -- he brings depth and 
eloquence to a man who puts up a brave front against a keen awareness of the 
life possibilities that have eluded him. 
</P>
<P>
 As our increasingly unreliable guide through the story, Robin Pearson Rose's 
Maggie is suitably caustic and self-protective, but the performance is fairly 
unwavering. This is really Maggie's story after all -- she learns a lot about 
herself from Jim and Maggy -- and we should see more of the effect her 
experience has had on her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few of the peripheral characters, director Pamela Berlin has compromised 
the otherwise impressive emotional authenticity of the piece for the sake of 
comic caricatures -- Richard Tanner as a smirking New Age crystal salesman and 
John Towney as a pompous talk-show host are particularly distracting 
exaggerations who'd be funnier if they were played for real. 
</P>
<P>
 But minor blemishes don't obscure the fact that this remarkable new play 
offers a fresh take on an all-too familiar subject, and manages to be eloquent, 
profound and uplifting in the process. Details

 WANTED: Teens willing to sweat under a broiling summer sun, day after day, 
repairing trails in the Los Padres National Forest and doing other grimy 
chores. Must be willing to sleep on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 CREW, an Ojai-based group that puts kids to work on outdoor environmental 
projects, is looking for 100 or so workers for its new residential summer 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll be based in remote Rose Valley, 22 miles from Ojai, where they'll 
sleep in Quonset-style barracks -- when they're not camping out. There isn't a 
TV for miles. And wake-up is 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 If it sounds more like boot camp than summer camp, you've got the picture. But 
on the bright side, the kids will earn $5 a hour for their labors, build up 
their strength and develop a sense of responsibility about the outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 At least that's the goal of the organizers of CREW, which stands for Concerned 
Resource and Environmental Workers. The group was formed three years ago by 
Paul Starbard, a longtime Ojai resident and builder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked into the (U.S.) Forest Service office and said I wanted to work with 
youth in the forest," Starbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he was leading a crew of kids on weekends, grooming trails, planting 
trees, picking up trash, cutting weeds. In three years time, 100 or so teens 
have signed on. (Recently CREW took on the job of trash pickup for the GTE Golf 
Classic in Ojai.) 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, Starbard's efforts attracted the attention of Chris Danch of Ojai, 
who saw such promise in the program that he quit his law practice to help 
expand CREW. 
</P>
<P>
 They got a lease from the Forest Service for a cluster of abandoned buildings 
in Rose Valley. Surrounded by majestic mountains, the 10-acre compound had 
previously been used as a minimum-security jail. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several months, they have been readying the buildings -- 
including four barracks with rows of bunks -- for the arrival of the boys and 
girls accepted into the summer program. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two six-week work sessions open to kids ages 14 to 21, the first 
beginning in mid-June. They'll work five days, returning home for the weekend, 
or they may have the option of staying the weekend at the Rose Valley site, 
adjacent to a lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll start them out easy, picking up trash," Starbard said. "That gets them 
into shape and motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Starbard has a list of projects for the kids that includes restoring 
fire-damaged areas of Matilija Canyon near Ojai, maintaining trails and 
building tables and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, they'll work in remote areas, where they'll camp out until the work 
is done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of hiking involved," Starbard said. "They'll be in great shape 
when they leave here." 
</P>
<P>
 But they'll get more out of it than how to swing a shovel, he said. They'll 
learn how to work as a team and boost their self-esteem by doing something 
positive for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll also learn a lot about nature. The newest addition to the CREW staff 
is Lanny Kaufer, assistant project director. He has taught outdoor education at 
Ojai private schools and led nature walks for 17 years. He quit his public 
relations job at Wheeler Hot Springs to be part of CREW. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer program won't be all sweat. The staff hopes to set up a library and 
computer lab where kids can catalogue what they see out in the field. They also 
have plans to stock a California native plant nursery that would be used by the 
Forest Service and the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids aren't the only ones to benefit from their labors. The Forest 
Service, faced with dwindling funds, doesn't have the money it once did for 
keeping the forest in shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're thrilled to have CREW," said Linda Riddle, acting Ojai District ranger. 
"The Forest Service will depend more and more on volunteer programs like this." 
</P>
<P>
 By Starbard's estimate, it would cost the Forest Service three times what the 
kids are paid for the work they do. He and Danch have scrambled to raise funds 
from several sources: a federal cost-sharing program, Forest Service contracts, 
and donations from individuals, businesses and foundations. It's an ongoing 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The program benefits the young workers as much as the Forest Service, its 
backers say. It gives kids more than a job during hard economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all has to do with developing self-esteem," Kaufer said. "A kid can step 
back, look at a trail, see that it looks better and say, 'I did that.' " 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The new summer residential work program for teens is offered by CREW 
(Concerned Resource and Environmental Workers). 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Based in Rose Valley, 22 miles from Ojai, in the Los Padres National 
Forest. CREW's Ojai office is at 110 Matilija St. Applications are available 
there, as well as at the Forest Service's Ojai District office, 1190 E. Ojai 
Ave. in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: The first of two six-week summer programs begins in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>

disabled, is assisting in the program in hopes of making forest lands more 
accessible to people with disabilities.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; A GARDEN OF WELL-VERSED DISHES; THE CHARMING NEW OJAI EATERY 
OFFERS VEGETARIAN FARE AS WELL AS MORE OPULENT MAINSTREAM CHOICES. THE RESULTS, 
HOWEVER, ARE SPOTTY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Garden Terrace Restaurant occupies the former space of Govinda's Veggie 
Buffet, the vegetarian outpost just north of Ojai's downtown arcade on Ojai 
Avenue. A great charm of this site is the setting: a pillared, stucco-and-tile 
courtyard leading into a simple, well-lighted dining room that takes on added 
warmth from a commanding fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 An added charm now is the new menu of California cuisine -- mixed grill, light 
saute dishes, pasta and salad offerings -- though vegetarian specials are 
offered nightly. It is clear the place seeks to build a bridge that spans the 
sometimes severe world of vegetarianism with other, perhaps more opulent, 
mainstream choices. 
</P>
<P>
 To wit: It is possible to start out with a bracing fresh lentil soup, 
audaciously spiked with deep curries and free of meat or its byproducts, only 
to move on to a decadent helping of duck sausage fanned out over pears sauteed 
in brandy. Likewise, it is possible for two diners to order entrees from the 
extremes: rich rib eye steak with wild mushrooms and red wine sauce, and 
zucchini casserole, laced with fragrant fresh herbs and topped (optionally, for 
the asking) with a cheese of your choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 While this is a happy joining of two culinary worlds, the food in recent 
visits shows mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 The crab cake over corn cake with tangy dill sauce ($6.95) is a complete 
original and wonderful in result: fiery spicing frames a generous "burger" of 
sweet crab meat, all made silken by the intensely pungent dill. But a less 
demanding, though smartly conceived dish, cappellini with artichoke, sun-dried 
tomato, garlic, black olives and basil ($10.95), flopped: Pleasant but blurry 
and indistinct in its many flavors, this entree found little help in overcooked 
pasta that was chopped into pieces in the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 With some poking around the menu, you will find success at this pleasing new 
venue; for now, select carefully. One only hopes that in the coming months the 
Garden Terrace will fine-tune some of its dicier offerings so that its worthy 
vision can be fully realized. 
</P>
<P>
 The crab cake, clearly, is the appetizer of choice. The duck sausage ($7.95), 
sampled on two visits, was peppery and vivid in flavor once, and less so the 
next time; may the follow-up be aberrant. Shrimp cocktail ($7.95) is nicely 
turned out: fresh, firm, cooked just enough to avoid toughness. But baked Brie 
in puff pastry ($6.95) suffered from less-than-first-rate cheese and dough that 
was oil-soaked all round. You just may be happiest of all with soups -- 
particularly the lentil -- which in recent visits were uniformly excellent, 
fresh, deeply flavored. 
</P>
<P>
 The house salad of mixed greens ($2.50) is delightfully crisp and lightly 
dressed. Something called The French Touch ($7.95), if self-consciously named, 
succeeds in joining butter lettuce with apple slices, chevre and a delicate 
vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 Among meat dishes, roast pork loin with orange curry sauce ($12.95) was deeply 
flavorful and satisfying, if a bit over-roasted. Broiled lamb-loin medallions 
($17.95) were just good: The meat, perfectly cooked and fork-tender, lacked 
flavor, a problem compounded by a strangely wan thyme-infused sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Poached salmon filet ($13.95), however, a special, was a standout for its 
delicate flavor and texture and also generous cut. And two vegetarian specials 
(each $9.95), the zucchini casserole and layered grilled eggplant with herbs, 
were triumphs of the genre: firm in texture, deeply flavorful both in primary 
ingredients and in the incorporation of fresh herbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts here enjoy the highest standard of success. Pear/apple tarte tatin 
($4.95) is exquisitely fresh, with sharply defined flavors and textures. 
Chocolate hazelnut flourless cake ($4.95) is, appropriately, a killer; and the 
carrot cake ($4), but for its profusion of too-sweet icing, is dense, fragrant, 
moist -- the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Terrace has a small, smartly drawn wine list and some handsome 
offerings by the glass. But in recent visits the house had trouble furnishing 
the best of its reds by-the-glass, despite such labeling on the wine list; a 
first-choice glass of Byron Pinot Noir ($6) was bumped to an also unavailable 
second-choice Rancho Sisquoc Cabernet Sauvignon ($5.50) before, finally, the 
server arrived with an opened bottle of Sausalito Canyon Zinfandel ($5.50). You 
may have better luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottle prices are moderately high, moreover, a fact seen in the Sausalito '92 
Zinfandel itself, at $24. Down the street, at Nora's Bistro, the same spicy, 
peppery, satisfying wine goes for $18. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Garden Terrace Restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: 1002 E. Ojai Ave., Ojai, 646-1133. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Breakfast and lunch from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.; coffee and desserts from 3 
to 5 p.m.; dinner from 5 to 9 p.m. daily. 
</P>
<P>

11 STATES TO DEFY CLINTON ABORTION-FUNDING RULES; GOVERNMENT: OFFICIALS SAY 
THEIR LAWS PROHIBIT USE OF MEDICAID MONEY TO PAY FOR PROCEDURE IN RAPE, INCEST 
CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 11 states plan to defy today's Clinton Administration deadline to 
begin using Medicaid funds to pay for poor women's abortions in cases of rape 
or incest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a broad clash between state and federal governments over one of the 
nation's most divisive issues, state officials said they cannot comply because 
their own laws prohibit such a use of Medicaid dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 By some estimates, as many as 37 states could face conflicts between the 
federal mandate and their own regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Health and Human Services Department's Health Care Financing 
Administration said, however, it has yet to determine how many states actually 
will choose to stand their ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Those that do so risk a broad range of penalties, including the possible loss 
of billions of dollars in Medicaid funds that are funneled to the states from 
the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing we really need to do is go out next week with a letter to the 
states and ask them," said Sally K. Richardson, director of the HCFA's Medicaid 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Some state officials are betting that the Administration will not press for 
compliance out of fear of stirring more controversy over abortion at a time 
when it is trying to win support for a health care reform plan that would 
include abortion coverage for all U.S. women, said Arkansas Medicaid Director 
Ray Hanley, chairman of the State Medicaid Directors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them are saying the smart thing is just sit on it and see what HCFA 
does," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between the states and the federal government centers on what 
Congress intended when it loosened a 1976 abortion-funding law last year. That 
law, known as the Hyde Amendment for its sponsor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde (R-Ill.), 
bans the use of federal funds to pay for abortions for poor women who are 
enrolled in state Medicaid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, states were required to pay for those abortions only in cases when 
a pregnancy jeopardized a woman's life. But last fall, Congress expanded the 
exemption from the Hyde Amendment to include cases of rape or incest. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to state Medicaid officials last December, Richardson said the 
change in the law means that abortions in cases of rape or incest now fall 
under the category of "medically necessary" procedures, meaning that states 
must pay for them, just as they must when a woman's life is at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 In California and 12 other states, the issue is moot because they have long 
used their own money to pay for Medicaid abortions without restriction. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials in some other states argued that the Administration had 
overstepped Congress' intention, which they insist was merely to give them the 
option of paying for abortions in those cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state of South Dakota does not see that a letter generated by Sally 
Richardson is a properly promulgated federal regulation that supersedes its own 
regulations," said R. Shawn Tornow, an attorney with the state's Department of 
Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 South Dakota Gov. Walter D. Miller, a Republican, is among several governors 
who have written to President Clinton asking him to reconsider the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Health and Human Services has indicated that a lack of 
compliance, for whatever reason, would place our Medicaid funding at risk," he 
wrote in a letter dated Feb. 18. "However, as governor, I cannot allow existing 
state law to be violated." 
</P>
<P>
 An incomplete survey of states indicated that at least eight -- Pennsylvania, 
Arkansas, Michigan, South Dakota, Louisiana, Kentucky, Utah and Oklahoma -- 
have no plans to loosen their restrictions in compliance with the 
Administration directive. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's where we are at the moment -- kind of hoping that it goes away," said 
Joe Wagner, a spokesman for Louisiana's Department of Health and Hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of three other states say they do not plan to meet the deadline. 
Officials of Alabama and Colorado said they were waiting for advice from their 
attorneys general, while a spokeswoman for Nebraska's Department of Social 
Services said her state plans to schedule a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hyde Amendment is reviewed annually during the congressional 
appropriations process, and could be revised to make Congress' intention 
clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) has introduced legislation to reverse the 
Administration policy. Portions of it also are being challenged in federal 
court by Pennsylvania officials.

SKULL IS BONE OF EVOLUTIONARY CONTENTION; SCIENCE: RESEARCHERS SAY NEW FOSSIL 
SUPPORTS THEORY THAT A SUDDEN EVENT SPURRED HUMAN DEVELOPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT LEE HOTZ, TIMES SCIENCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scientists today announced the discovery of the first essentially complete 
skull of what may be humanity's earliest known ancestor -- an agile ape-like 
creature whose descendants developed language, discovered fire and, eventually, 
invented power tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-million-year-old skull, unearthed in Ethiopia by a team from the private 
Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley, is the strongest evidence yet that a 
single ancestral primate species -- best represented by a famous fossil 
skeleton known as Lucy -- thrived across Africa for almost 1 million years 
without significant physical change. The species, Australopithecus afarensis, 
is believed to have roamed the continent until something abruptly spurred the 
developments that led to modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in human origins at Yale University, UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins 
University said the new skull is a compelling argument for the theory that the 
evolution of human life on Earth proceeded in fits and starts, with long 
periods of stasis punctuated by relatively sudden periods of change. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull unveiled Thursday is from a large, adult male perhaps no more than 
four feet tall. His pugnacious jutting jaw, large canine teeth, tiny brain and 
thick, bony ridges above his eyes form the newest portrait of the ancient stock 
from which humanity apparently arose. 
</P>
<P>
 He is, institute researchers said, the root of the human family tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "This species was as widespread as baboons are today," said Tim D. White of UC 
Berkeley's Laboratory for Human Evolutionary Studies, who has discovered some 
of the oldest examples of the hominids, as pre-human species are known 
generally, in Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatomist Yoel Rak of Tel Aviv University discovered the first few 
gravel-sized flakes of the fossilized skull near the bank of a dry riverbed in 
Ethiopia's Afar badlands in 1992, shortly after delivering an impromptu 
lunchtime lecture on the features of the typical hominid skull. Eventually, the 
institute team unearthed 200 rock-encrusted fragments in all -- enough to 
reconstruct almost the entire skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, the skull is a dream come true," said institute president Donald C. 
Johanson, who led the 1992 expedition that found the fossil. The expedition's 
findings were published today in the British science journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something very captivating about being able to pick up the skull and 
look into those eye sockets, to realize that this part of the brain case (held) 
gray matter . . . to see the face," Johanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull is the centerpiece of a new collection of 53 pre-human fossils that 
the institute team discovered during three years of field work in one of the 
richest sources of early hominid fossils in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is of immense interest," said Elisabeth Vrba, an expert in paleobiology 
and mammalian evolution at Yale University. "It would be the best evidence we 
have" for the state of human development at a crucial juncture in evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The skull is 10,000 generations, about 200,000 years, younger than the Lucy 
skeleton, which was found in the same corner of northeastern Ethiopia. The 
skull is the youngest example of the species discovered so far. Lucy, found in 
1974 about a mile from the site where the skull turned up, is thought to be 
3.18 million years old; the oldest known afarensis specimens are 3.9 million 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional theory of evolution suggests that any species acquires new 
characteristics gradually at a measured, steady pace. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the long period of afarensis stability, researchers say, there was 
an explosion of new hominid species that included larger-brained hominids that 
had started using tools by about 2.5 million years ago. That species led 
directly to modern humans. 
</P>
<P>
 During the period of afarensis, "there is no obvious sign of evolution in this 
pre-human species for about a million years," said William H. Kimbel, institute 
director of paleoanthropology, who shared in the discovery. "Yet later, within 
only a fraction of that time, it gave rise to a great branching of the family 
tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees with the idea that the bones attributed to afarensis all 
belong to a single species -- some of the individuals represented by the 
fossils seem much larger than others. The larger fossils, which include the new 
skull, could instead belong to a separate "robust" species that coexisted with 
smaller hominids in East Africa, some experts have argued. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were two coexisting hominid species and not one, then human 
development may have been proceeding at a more stately, traditional pace 
without the need for a sudden change to speed up the evolution of Lucy and her 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have gone so far as to say the (afarensis) species has nothing to 
do with the line that led to genus Homo, " said Andrew Hill, curator for 
anthropology at Yale's Peabody Museum of Natural History. "If afarensis is a 
real ancestor of these later lineages, then something must have happened fairly 
quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Johanson and his colleagues say the size difference is simply a normal 
variation between male and female members of the species, like that observed 
among modern apes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the newest additions to the human fossil record may help settle 
whether the bones from Ethiopia represent one species or two, they will do 
little to resolve an argument about how far these primitive, upright-walking 
primates ventured from the trees their own ancestors had called home. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the new fossils announced Thursday is an especially long forearm bone 
more like that of a chimpanzee than a human being, indicating that the hominids 
had powerful arms, especially suitable for climbing trees. That has led some 
experts to suggest that the species was less evolved than Johanson and his 
colleagues believe. It may have spent as much time in the trees as it did on 
the ground, sleeping or hiding from predators in high branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one knows what may have spurred pre-humans to develop 
intelligence, many experts believe that a radical change in climate could have 
been the reason, by driving the creatures out of the trees or making them 
compete more fiercely for dwindling food and water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The single hominid species seems to branch into several new species at just 
about the same time -- 2.5 million years ago -- that a major ice age set in 
around the world, forcing dramatic changes in climate and the local 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many (animal) lineages of substantial duration either become extinct or give 
rise to new species at that time," Vrba said. "Perhaps climatic change did 
cause these events." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts believe that their arboreal habits could have delayed the 
evolution of intelligence, by making it harder for afarensis mothers to bear 
larger-brained infants. Newborn chimpanzees, for example, are agile almost from 
the moment of birth, but some experts theorize that more intelligent hominids 
were born with smaller brains, which developed fully after birth, like a human 
child. That means that as newborns they were helpless. In the trees, such 
creatures simply would have fallen to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that the reason that these things didn't go anywhere for so long 
is because these guys are happily climbing trees," said Steven Stanley, an 
expert on early human development at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 2.5 million years ago is just about when the ice age began. At that 
time, Africa became drier; forests shrank. It is exactly the kind of thing that 
would force creatures out of the trees," he said. Clues to Humanity 
</P>
<P>
 During three years of field work in Ethiopia, an expedition from the private 
Institute of Human Origins in Berkeley discovered dozens of new early primate 
fossils that shed new light on human origins. 
</P>
<P>
 * The discovery: The first complete skull of humankind's earliest known 
ancestor, Australopithecus afarensis  
</P>
<P>
 * How the fossil was found: In a dry riverbed about one mile from where the 
famous "Lucy" skeleton was found in 1974. Both are the same species. 
</P>
<P>
 * About the fossil: The 3-million-year-old skull -- with a protruding, 
ape-like jaw, jutting, bony eye ridges and a small brain case -- is from a 
large, adult male of the species many scientists think is the common stock from 
which all later hominid species, including modern humans, arose. 
</P>
<P>
 What the discovery means: The skull is the strongest evidence yet that a 
single ancestral hominid species flourished unchanged in Africa for almost a 
million years before climate change or some other unknown pressure spurred the 
sudden development of several different hominid species, one of which became 
the line that led to modern humans.

THE TIMES POLL; WILSON TRAILS DESPITE BRIGHTER ECONOMIC VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians have turned the corner toward optimism about the state's 
troublesome economy, defining the state's prospects and their own financial 
security in the rosiest terms in years. But the change in attitude has yet to 
substantially benefit Gov. Pete Wilson, who continues to lag behind his major 
Democratic opponents in gubernatorial election matchups. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Los Angeles Times poll, the perennially embattled Wilson is 
creeping closer to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi, but he would still lose the election to either if the election 
were held today. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown would defeat Wilson 51% to 41%, a smaller margin than the 49% to 34% 
registered in a Times poll last October. Garamendi would beat Wilson by a spare 
47% to 42%, down from October's 49% to 31%, the survey found. The governor 
gained a marginal boost from his recent emphasis on the issue of crime, which 
along with the economy ranks uppermost among the concerns of the state's 
residents, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic primary, however, the race was substantially unchanged. 
Brown continues to run well ahead of Garamendi, defeating him 39% to 25%. The 
third well-known candidate in the race, state Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), 
has not even risen to the level of a spoiler, garnering just 8%. Hayden was 
also the only Democrat losing to Wilson -- 55% to 33% -- in a hypothetical 
matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting a marginal improvement for Wilson, who keeps raising himself a 
few points here and there," said John Brennan, director of the Times Poll. "But 
the whole level is still low." 
</P>
<P>
 The other contest of note before voters this year remains a runaway for 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who pummels both Rep. Michael Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara) and former Rep. William Dannemeyer (R-Fullerton), her major 
Republican foes. Despite the more than $1 million he has poured into television 
advertising this spring, Huffington is still an enigma to most Californians, 
76% of whom say they don't know enough about him to judge him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll surveyed 1,608 Californians -- 1,211 of them registered voters 
-- between March 26 and 29. The margin of sampling error overall is 3 points in 
either direction; among Democrats or Republicans exclusively, it is 5 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The changing attitude about the state's economy was the most remarkable 
element of the poll. Undeniably, Californians are feeling better about the 
state's prospects -- but the change was relative and most are clearly still 
worried about the economy. It was also evident that a broad undercurrent of 
negativism exists about the future in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the state was going in the right direction or headed down the 
wrong track, nearly two-thirds of the respondents said it was on the wrong 
track. Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives agreed, the poll 
found. The finding was not good news for Wilson because it suggests that voters 
feel a need for change. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it was an improvement from October's poll, in which 74% said the 
state was on the wrong track. And on the more explicit questions about the 
economy, Californians were more positive than they have been in any Times 
survey taken since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of residents who feel the state is in a "serious" recession 
dropped to 34%, down from 51% last fall. About one in seven described the 
state's economy as "robust" and 85% said it was shaky. Of those, 31% described 
the economy as "very shaky," down from 43% in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latter reading was hardly a glowing endorsement, it was the 
lowest percentage registered since December, 1991. Asked how the economy would 
be in three months, 22% said it would be better, the highest in almost two 
years. An identical percentage said they expect unemployment to diminish in 
their area within three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimism extended to the pocketbook. Overall, 65% said that they consider 
their personal finances to be "secure," compared to 33% who said they were on 
economically shaky ground. The last time more than 60% of Californians were so 
confident of their own finances was December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Wilson can extend confidence about the state's economy to confidence 
in the state's incumbent leader is at the core of the governor's race. At least 
at this point, Wilson can count on little benefit from the economic turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
 He can, however, lay claim to incremental improvements in the way Californians 
judge him. The percentage of Californians who say he is doing a good job rose 
from 31% in October to 39%, though half those surveyed disapprove of his 
tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 In both increasing his job approval rating and closing the gap between himself 
and the Democrats, Wilson is leaning on the issue of crime, the poll showed. 
Thirty-one percent said that Wilson's approach to crime had made them think 
better of him, while 19% made them think less favorably of him. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, in contrast, proposals on crime made little difference to the 
electorate. And the weapon Brown has tried to wield against Wilson -- that he 
was derelict in allowing the release of repeat rapist Melvin Carter -- has had 
little impact. Most Californians, whether they live in the southern or northern 
part of the state, said Wilson was not to blame for Carter's release from 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's hold on the issue of crime is hardly firm, however. Although 37% said 
he has the best ideas about crime and only 16% said that of Brown, the margin 
narrows significantly when Wilson and all of the Democrats are compared. Then, 
Wilson barely ekes out an advantage -- 37% compared to 33% for Democrats as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Wilson has the edge on two of the four most important issues to 
Californians -- crime and immigration -- while Brown was judged to have the 
edge on education. In the fourth area, the economy, Wilson was seen by 30% as 
having the best ideas while Brown was endorsed by 25% and Garamendi by 18%. But 
here, too, Wilson's hold was not solid: People said Democrats overall had 
better ideas on the economy than Wilson, 47% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's weaknesses showed up in the head-to-head matchups with Democrats. 
Brown's lead over Wilson was fueled by support from the moderates and 
independents whose votes generally determine success in California. Among 
independents, Brown led 50% to 33%; among self-described moderates she won 58% 
to 33%. She was running even with Wilson among men, and holding a wide 
advantage among women, 56% to 36%. Her potential weakness was that 40% of 
voters say they do not know enough about her to rate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, may be poised to take advantage of a shift in the state's 
gender politics. Asked whether it was "time we had a woman governor," 52% said 
it was. The last time a woman was running for governor -- Feinstein in 1990 -- 
that figure rose only to 40%. The ensuing years, however, have seen Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer elected to the U.S. Senate from California, the first time a 
state has sent two women to its highest elective positions in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Brown, Garamendi defeated Wilson among women, but his hold on that 
majority of the electorate was not as strong as Brown's. Garamendi also 
received support among moderates and independents, but he was weaker within the 
Democratic Party than Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The race for the Senate was a straightforward blowout, with Feinstein 
solidifying her position as the state's most popular politician. Sixty-three 
percent of voters said they had a favorable impression of the first-term 
senator, who is now making her third statewide bid in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 52%-24% margin, Californians approved of the way Feinstein is doing her 
job, an improvement from last year. Boxer had a smaller approval rating, 39%, 
with 27% disapproving. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty any candidate would have in taking on Feinstein was apparent in 
the survey, and just as apparent was the current anonymity of those who are 
seeking to defeat her. Feinstein beat Huffington, a first-term congressman from 
Santa Barbara, by a margin of 58% to 28%. She bested Dannemeyer, a former 
Orange County congressman, by 56% to 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 It is within the Republican primary that voters expressed the most confusion, 
because none of the participants is particularly well known. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's million-dollar ad campaign has so far failed to raise his image 
much even among Republicans, 68% of whom said they did not know enough about 
him to say whether they liked him. Similarly, 69% of voters and 60% of 
Republicans said they did not know enough about Dannemeyer, despite his years 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, most Republicans asked about the Senate race -- 58% -- said 
they did not know whom to support. Twenty-two percent went for Dannemeyer, 13% 
for Huffington and 7% for Kate Squires, a lawyer and businesswoman from Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians' views were more definitive on two bond issues set to be 
determined June 7, as well as on one proposal whose authors are aiming for the 
November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of California voters favored releasing $2 billion in bonds to help 
the state rebuild from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake and to strengthen the 
state's bridges. Sixty-five percent said they favored a $1-billion bond issue 
to pay for public school construction and remodeling. Both were supported by 
voters across the political spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 A more controversial measure, a proposal that would exclude illegal immigrants 
from attending public schools or receiving social services, also was popular, 
winning the support of 62% of voters. THE TIMES POLL: Wilson Still Trails 
Potential Opponents 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's political position has improved but he still trails 
Democrats Kathleen Brown and John Garamendi in hypothetical trial heats. Brown 
continues to lead Garamendi for the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Democratic primary for governor were held today, and the candidates

Source: Los Angeles Times Poll How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,608 California adults by telephone from March 26 
through 29. The sample included 1,211 registered voters, 549 of whom are 
Democrats and 458 Republicans. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all 
exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that 
listed and non-listed numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in 
English and Spanish. Results were weighted slightly to conform with census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total and registered-voter samples is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for 
Democrats and Republicans it is 5 points. For certain other sub-groups the 
error margin may vary. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such 
as question wording and the order in which questions are presented.

PLO AND ISRAEL AGREE TO RESUME SELF-RULE TALKS; MIDEAST: NEGOTIATORS BREAK 
IMPASSE AFTER RESOLVING SECURITY QUESTIONS IN HEBRON, SITE OF MOSQUE MASSACRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY and MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 After agreeing on interim security arrangements for the West Bank city of 
Hebron in a nine-hour bargaining session, Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization announced early today that they will restart formal negotiations 
on Palestinian autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements broke a five-week deadlock that began when a Jewish settler 
massacred about 30 Palestinian worshipers in Hebron on Feb. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides issued brief statements announcing that the heads of their 
delegations will sign the Hebron agreement here this morning and that talks on 
implementing the long-delayed Palestinian autonomy in the Gaza Strip and the 
West Bank town of Jericho will begin later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The head of the Israeli delegation to the negotiations, Maj. Gen. Amnon 
Lipkin Shahak, announces that after midnight an agreement was reached between 
the Israeli and Palestinian delegations on the issue of security arrangements 
in Hebron," said the Israeli statement, released by an army spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Labeling the agreement "a compromise formula," Israel Radio reported today 
that PLO negotiators agreed to give up demands for a Palestinian police force 
in Hebron in exchange for a larger international observer force than Israel had 
originally been willing to permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting Nabil Shaath, chief delegate for the PLO, the Voice of Israel said 
that, under the compromise, the international force would include 150 military 
observers from several European nations and that they would be armed. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath emerged briefly from the hotel room where he has been negotiating with 
Shahak, Israel's deputy chief of staff, to confirm the agreement. "We have 
agreed on security in Hebron and on the resumption of talks on Gaza-Jericho," 
said Shaath, who added that he would provide details of the agreement later in 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am completely exhausted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton said the agreement means the Middle East peace process is 
back on track. "It's very, very encouraging to me, and I hope it will be to all 
the American people," he told reporters Wednesday outside the San Diego seaside 
manor where he is spending a week on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement on Hebron was the key to resuming what both sides had predicted 
will be accelerated negotiations to implement Palestinian self-rule in Gaza and 
Jericho along with an Israeli troop withdrawal that was to have been completed 
by April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators had made halting progress through the night Wednesday after two 
weeks of informal, face-to-face talks aimed at boosting security for 
Palestinians in the city where the massacre took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, PLO sources said up to 100 Palestinian police also would be assigned 
in Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 As the negotiations in Cairo went on, clashes continued to leave dead and 
wounded Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel has insisted on maintaining overall security control in Hebron, calling 
for Palestinian police to remain under Israeli command, although it has 
reportedly agreed that Palestinians on joint patrols with Israelis would travel 
in separate vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli negotiators also have refused to allow anything more than personal 
pistols as arms for the Arab police. And while Israel's negotiators agreed to 
the idea of lightly armed international observers, up until Wednesday night 
they opposed anything but Norwegian, Finnish and Danish troops on the 
international force. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, by Wednesday, negotiators made progress on several other key 
security points. For example, PLO sources said Israel agreed to allow the 
deployment of up to 10,000 Palestinian police in Gaza and Jericho, up from its 
previous limit of 8,500 officers, a key stumbling block in the self-rule talks 
since October. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis also reportedly agreed to allow the PLO to appoint the governor 
of Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Israeli-PLO talks continued in Cairo on Wednesday, Israel's military 
command took extreme steps in the occupied territories to prevent a fresh 
outbreak of widespread violence after Tuesday's storm of protests against the 
shooting deaths of six of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's activists in the Gaza 
Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 New military orders calling for restraint by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip were issued to minimize clashes, and strict curfews were clamped 
on more than two dozen towns -- Hebron among them. 
</P>
<P>
 The curfews confined more than 300,000 Palestinians to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the curfews, an 18-year-old Palestinian was shot and killed after he 
stoned an Israeli car near the West Bank town of Nablus. Palestinian sources 
blamed the shooting on a Jewish settler, who they said fired on a group of 
Palestinian youths by the roadside. An army spokesman said the incident is 
under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also reports of five more Palestinians wounded during clashes with 
Israeli security forces in Hebron, where violence has erupted routinely in 
spite of almost constant curfews in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 But, on a day of traditional Arab protest, the Israeli military's strategy 
appeared to have kept most of the occupied lands tense but largely peaceful 
after a day of violent demonstrations left one Arab dead and more than 75 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 General strikes and annual protest rallies unrelated to the troubled peace 
process also shut down East Jerusalem and most Arab towns inside Israel as 
well, as Israel's 850,000 Arab citizens staged demonstrations to commemorate 
Land Day. On that day in 1976, Israeli soldiers and police killed six Arabs 
protesting the confiscation of Arab lands in the Galilee region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Land Day demonstrations passed peacefully after Israeli authorities, 
fearing widespread Arab unrest, agreed not to enter any of the Arab towns 
within Israel or intervene in the rallies. 
</P>
<P>
 But anger seethed in Hebron. So did fears about a protest march scheduled for 
today by Jewish extremists and Israel's political right wing. The protest march 
is to take place in Kiryat Arba, the home of Baruch Goldstein -- the 
Brooklyn-born doctor involved in the Hebron mosque massacre -- and his family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlers and the nation's right-wing leaders organized their protest as a 
warning to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin that there will be a backlash of civil 
disobedience if he attempts to relocate the 415 Jewish settlers in Hebron -- a 
key demand of Arafat's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Israeli military authorities also sought to defend the actions 
of the undercover army unit in Gaza against a series of allegations and 
unanswered questions surrounding Monday night's shooting in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of continuing criticism that the undercover officers opened fire 
on the Fatah activists without provocation and without attempting first to 
identify or arrest their targets, army spokesmen and Defense Ministry officials 
said the undercover squad had no time to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting under orders that still permit security forces to shoot at any armed 
Palestinians who present a potential threat in the territories, the undercover 
squad was fully justified in opening fire on six masked men wearing camouflage 
uniforms and bearing arms, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They added that the army regretted that the squad had killed six of the 
activists who will be needed to help integrate the future Palestinian police 
force into the territories. One senior military officer in Gaza said the army 
will now work toward establishing a "hot line" to coordinate with Fatah in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the shootings, reports in Israel's Hebrew press said that 
Israeli commanders did issue new orders for all security forces in the 
territories to refrain from confrontations and to limit clashes in the coming 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was continuing criticism of the operation from the Israeli 
human-rights group B'tselem, which confirmed eyewitness accounts that at least 
one of the six men was killed in cold blood after he was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 And Israeli Communications Minister Shulamit Aloni, leader of the left-wing 
Meretz faction in Rabin's ruling coalition, called for the army to suspend its 
hunt for armed activists from all Palestinian parties in the Gaza Strip.

HILLARY CLINTON'S FUTURES TRADES UNUSUAL, EXPERTS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House has portrayed the commodities market trading that netted First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton almost $100,000 in a two-year period as a case of 
an ordinary small investor who took her chances and came up a winner with 
shrewd judgment and a little guidance from an experienced friend. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts and officials in the volatile futures trading industry said 
Wednesday that what she did would be highly unusual for the average small 
investor to pull off successfully. And many commodities trading firms would 
never have allowed such an investor to try it. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, the experts said, her activities involved exposure to possible 
losses in the unpredictable market for farm commodities futures that 
substantially exceeded the available capital -- losses that potentially could 
have been greater than her family's net worth if the market had turned sharply 
against her. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, commodities specialists said, an inexperienced investor with such 
limited assets would not be allowed to run the risks Mrs. Clinton did unless 
she had the backing of -- and perhaps financial guarantees from -- a wealthy 
backer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time she made her huge profits, starting with an initial capital 
investment of just $1,000, Bill Clinton was a rising political star in Arkansas 
but he and his wife had only modest assets. They did not even own their own 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Mrs. Clinton took surprisingly large positions in cattle futures, earning 
one-day profits as high as $30,000. Had the market moved the other way, she 
could have lost huge amounts virtually overnight, according to market 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has insisted that Mrs. Clinton risked her own money, made all 
decisions herself about when to buy and sell and bore full responsibility for 
any losses. They have said that she got advice from prominent Arkansas lawyer 
James B. Blair, but also consulted other advisers and studied the market 
through the Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Futures market analysts and officials who have examined the records of her 
activities, however, question whether a responsible broker would have allowed 
her to trade the way she did without some kind of financial protection. 
</P>
<P>
 One commodity trader with 30 years' experience who reviewed the records of 
Mrs. Clinton's market activity said that her account is highly unusual, both in 
the frequency and size of trades and in the small amount of capital behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way in the world that Hillary Clinton should have been trading 50 
(cattle futures) contracts. That's 2 million pounds of beef. The risk posture 
is just not consistent with (the Clintons') income and net worth," said this 
trader, who works for one of the nation's biggest brokerage houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not let either one of them (the Clintons) trade commodities. In the 
late 1970s, we required a couple hundred thousand dollars in liquid net worth 
before we let them in the door to trade commodities. This is not for the faint 
of heart," the broker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another commodities trader, Phil Tiger of Smith Barney Shearson, described the 
First Lady's successful trading as "unusual and fortuitous, and her timing was 
perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that she entered the market just at a point of rocketing growth and 
rode it until she had made a small fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprised me she stuck it out as long as she did. Most novices just take 
their profits and get out," Tiger said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other market experts noted that shortly after Mrs. Clinton ceased trading, 
her broker, Robert L. (Red) Bone, and the brokerage company, Ray E. Friedman & 
Co., were disciplined by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for "serious and 
repeated" violations of exchange rules on margin requirements and 
record-keeping functions at their Springdale, Ark., office. 
</P>
<P>
 Margin is the amount of cash a trader must put up versus the amount of 
borrowed money used to make the investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bone was suspended from trading for three years. The brokerage was fined 
$250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have said that Mrs. Clinton was unaware of allegations 
that her brokerage was allocating successful trades to clients or that Bone had 
previously been suspended for trading violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliot Bercovitz, vice president for strategic planning at Lind-Waldock Inc., 
of Chicago, one of the nation's leading commodities trading firms, said that it 
was possible at the time to turn a small stake into $100,000 with savvy trading 
in the booming market in cattle futures. 
</P>
<P>
 But one transaction caught his and a number of other brokers' attention: the 
very first trade in October, 1978, when her account balance went from her 
initial $1,000 investment to $6,300 in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no documentation for what was traded at what price, but some brokers 
said that she could not possibly have had enough in her account to cover the 
large position in cattle futures that she would have had to take to make that 
much profit that quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are holes in these records," said John Damgard, president of the 
Futures Industry Assn. and a former official in the Richard Nixon 
Administration who examined the Clinton trading records. "They show the 
original $1,000 and next day $6,000. How does that compute? 
</P>
<P>
 "Her $1,000 wouldn't margin the cattle position on that day, necessary to 
create the profit on the next day. Maybe there was more than $1,000 up front, 
maybe there were some guarantees." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most firms weren't taking small individual investors like Hillary Clinton. 
This is a professional's business. But somehow, Hillary Clinton made $100,000 
very quickly, and I would be remiss as president of the FIA to allow the 
general public to believe this is commonplace," Damgard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Blair nor Bone was authorized to trade on Mrs. Clinton's behalf, White 
House officials said. Blair offered "advice but no guarantees," said a senior 
White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading who asked not to be 
named. "He wasn't backing her trades and he wasn't custodian of her account," 
the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Blair and Bone did not respond to telephone calls from The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House official familiar with Mrs. Clinton's trading said that the 
initial $6,300 profit was based on a single futures trade but that the First 
Lady could not locate the documentation for it. 
</P>
<P>
 From that first trade, Mrs. Clinton traded aggressively, staking out 
ever-larger positions and booking profits of more than 3 to 1 over losses. When 
the market began to go sour in May and June, Mrs. Clinton switched from betting 
on rising cattle prices -- taking a "long" position -- to betting that the 
market would fall, or selling "short." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, she took a very large short position in cattle futures, selling them 
three weeks later in mid-July for a quick profit of almost $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Her boldness astounded market observers who have reviewed her record. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a very large and aggressive position. . . . This is heavy-duty 
trading by someone who was not averse to taking risk," said Bercovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 After that series of trades, Mrs. Clinton stopped trading, took a check for 
$60,000 from Friedman & Co. and never re-entered the market in any substantial 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She got the money and walked away," Bercovitz said. "You've got to give her 
credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Other brokers question how she could have taken such risks without the means 
to cover potential losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take a person of enormous wealth to take on 50 contracts of cattle, 
as she did," said a trader involved in similar transactions at the time. "If 
they lost, where would the Clintons come up with $100,000 to pay for it? They 
didn't have it." Trading Commodities 
</P>
<P>
 Futures markets allow investors to buy or sell a specific amount of a 
commodity (such as gold and pork bellies) or financial instrument (Treasury 
bills or a stock-market index) at a particular price in a stipulated future 
month. Here's how it works: 
</P>
<P>
 1) By buying a futures contract, the investor controls a fairly large 
investment with a fairly small amount of money. 
</P>
<P>
 $1,000 = $20,000 
</P>
<P>
 Through "leverage," a $1,000 investment, for example, might buy an investor a 
contract for $20,000 worth of beef. Leverage is just a fancy term for making a 
purchase with a very low down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 2) If the market . . .  
</P>
<P>
 . . . price for beef rises by just 5% -- a gain of $1,000 on the contract -- 
the investor has just doubled his money. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . price drops by the same amount, the $1,000 investment is lost. Worst 
still, if the price drops more than 5%, the investor is liable for the 
difference of his contract and the actual market value of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * FACT: Roughly 80% of the traders lose money in the commodities markets after 
trading costs are taken into account.

CHILD WELFARE AGENCY OFFICIALS TO REPAY $41,600 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Top officials of California's oldest private children's welfare agency have 
agreed to repay the organization $41,600 for pricey restaurant meals, hotel 
charges and attorneys fees, the state attorney general's office announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, James T. Spradley Jr. and two top aides of the Children's 
Home Society (CHS) will repay the expenses without admitting guilt or losing 
their leadership posts at the century-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based agency, which provides foster care and adoption 
services, has 19 offices statewide, about 300 employees, a $16-million annual 
budget and a clientele of about 10,000 needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement marks the end of the state's one-year investigation into 
reports by The Times that CHS officials engaged in questionable spending 
practices, including parties and meals for the staff at expensive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Simmons, who represents the agency, said its 21-member board 
continues to have complete confidence in Spradley, crediting him with the 
agency's enormous success since he took over in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in late 1992 that an internal audit of CHS found that 
Spradley and three aides spent $303,000 on meals, entertainment, travel and 
other expenses during a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley, who approved his own expense accounts, spent more than $155,000 for 
expenses, including the purchase of personal items ranging from tuxedo shoes to 
tennis balls and luggage, the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 On 100 occasions, auditors said, he spent at least $100 on CHS staff and 
executives. This included a $483 tab at the Fleur de Lys restaurant in San 
Francisco for a staff party. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi said in an interview Wednesday that Spradley has 
agreed to repay the organization $15,247. Most of the amount, he said, 
represents restaurant bills, but it also includes about $2,000 in hotel charges 
in Los Angeles, where CHS already was renting an apartment for Spradley. 
</P>
<P>
 The expenses were incurred between 1988 and 1992, Cordi said. He declined to 
detail all the expenses covered by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley's top aides, Anelia Nunez-Wells and Katherine Neworth, will repay 
meal charges of $3,461 and $1,667, respectively, Cordi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three people also pledged to repay a portion of CHS's legal fees incurred 
as a result of the attorney general's investigation, or $21,252. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley declined to comment, saying that the CHS board has directed him and 
his staff to refer all calls to Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley is paid $244,000 a year in salary and benefits, up from $184,000 in 
1991 and $92,000 in 1988, records show. In reviewing his compensation, the 
attorney general's office concluded it was not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Spradley's tenure, records show that by 1991 the agency bolstered its 
financial reserves from $3.8 million to $13 million and reduced its debt from 
$2.4 million to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1991, the agency cut back its program services from $16.6 
million to $13.3 million. And a staff of 700 employees was trimmed to 300. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's funding comes from public service contracts, foundation grants, 
corporate gifts and individual donations. The backbone of the organization has 
been its statewide network of auxiliaries and thousands of volunteers who raise 
more than $1.5 million a year for CHS through bake sales, road races and other 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 After reports of the agency's spending in December, 1992, CHS sued its former 
controller, Mike Love, alleging that he breached his fiduciary trust by 
obtaining and disseminating "confidential financial and proprietary 
information" belonging to CHS. The suit was recently dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a dozen of the CHS's 147 auxiliaries called for Spradley's 
resignation or said they planned to withhold money from the group or suspend 
fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, three board members resigned after expressing concerns about Spradley 
and the board's handling of allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons acknowledged some ordinary turnover among board members whose terms 
had expired but said that nobody resigned because of the Spradley allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, he said, "is obviously pleased to put this matter behind it."

DOW FALLS 72 POINTS AMID MARKET FEARS; STOCKS: THE SEVENTH DROP IN EIGHT DAYS 
PUTS AVERAGE FAR BELOW WHERE IT STOOD TWO WEEKS AGO. INVESTORS ARE WORRIED BY 
INTEREST RATES AND POLITICAL TURMOIL, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices tumbled Wednesday in the biggest one-day selloff in eight weeks, 
raising new fears that Wall Street's bull market has ended and that more sharp 
declines are ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 72.27 points to 3,626.75, its seventh 
decline in eight days, bringing its loss since March 18 to nearly 300 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic reversal of the optimism that drove stocks to record highs in 
January, analysts say investors have become deeply troubled by rising interest 
rates, the White House's spreading political problems and a growing number of 
foreign crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the stock market's long upward march since October, 1990 -- when the 
Dow bottomed at 2,365 -- has been so unblemished by significant declines that 
the severity of this one has taken professional and novice investors by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a highly volatile and vulnerable environment," warned Alan Ackerman, 
investment strategist at brokerage Reich & Co. in New York. The cascading 
selling of recent days, he said, reflects investors' mounting fears that "he 
who hesitates is lost" in a plummeting market. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume surged to nearly 400 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Wednesday, and 20 stocks fell in price for every four that rose, a 
lopsided count rarely seen except in bear markets and in crisis-induced panics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, where surging interest rates have been the stock market's 
chief worry this year, long-term Treasury bond yields reached 7.1%, up from 
6.35% at year-end and the highest level since February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the average investor, financial markets' stunning selloffs over the past 
two months have been difficult to reconcile with the extraordinarily good 
economic news. For the first time since the late 1980s, the economy appears to 
be in a sustained recovery. Companies are hiring again and corporate earnings 
are rising at a healthy pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the economy's improving tone, however, there have been relatively few 
signs of higher inflation -- the troubling upward push in prices of goods and 
services that has historically accompanied strong recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep the economy's growth moderate and inflation at bay, the 
Federal Reserve Board has twice raised short-term interest rates by a 
quarter-point this year, once on Feb. 4 and again on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wall Street pros had believed that most investors were prepared for 
the Fed rate hikes, the central bank's moves now are being widely blamed for 
frightening investors and sparking the stock and bond markets' accelerating 
declines. The Fed's Feb. 4 rate increase triggered a 96-point drop in the Dow 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say the problem is simply that investors had grown used to 
declining interest rates over the past three years and that the reversal of 
that long slide has had a worse-than-expected psychological effect on 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The watershed was that the Fed put its stamp of approval on the fact that 
interest rates were going up again," said Alfred Kugel, investment strategist 
at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, however, say the markets are responding not so much to the 
small rise in short-term interest rates as to the growing uncertainty about the 
Clinton Administration's Whitewater affair and to a sudden burst of turmoil 
overseas: the assassination of Mexico's probable future president, North 
Korea's intransigence over the nuclear issue and the U.S.-Japan trade conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 When the world economy's prospects look promising and political issues are 
few, investors are willing to pay relatively high prices for stocks, experts 
note. But as uncertainty about the future increases, investors naturally lower 
the prices they are willing to pay for stocks -- and may begin trimming what 
they own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the markets are just factoring in some political risk again, around 
the world," Reich & Co.'s Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock markets have declined sharply in many countries this year, not just in 
the United States. Whereas the Dow industrial average now has slumped 8.8% from 
its all-time high, British stocks are down 9.5% this year; in Thailand, the 
average stock is down 26% year-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unclear is how much further stock prices will slide before buyers are 
willing to return in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the New York Stock Exchange imposed so-called circuit breakers on the 
market after the 1987 crash, when the Dow plunged 508 points in one day, 
analysts believe that a crash of that type is unlikely. For example, when the 
Dow loses 50 points in one session, the NYSE automatically restricts some big 
investors' ability to trade stocks via high-speed computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of that circuit breaker has been to limit market volatility. But 
critics say that by artificially restraining selling, the NYSE guarantees that 
any market decline now will be stretched over a long period, gradually drawing 
out more sellers as investors see the market edge painfully lower day after 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, some analysts who have long been predicting a classic market 
"correction" -- a fast 10% to 15% pullback in prices, then a resumption of the 
bull market -- now believe that U.S. stocks are vulnerable to a plunge of 20% 
or more from their highs. A drop of that magnitude would officially qualify as 
a bear market and could drag on for many months, if history is a guide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last bear market, the Dow slumped from 3,000 to 2,365 between July and 
October of 1990. The 1973-74 bear market, one of the worst ever, lasted two 
years and cut 45% from the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 99% sure (this is) a bear market, not a normal correction," said Stan 
Weinstein, a veteran market analyst who writes a newsletter called the 
Professional Tape Reader in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein and others who expect heavier selling in part cite the market's lack 
of meaningful declines over the past three years. Stocks' 42-month climb has 
pulled in millions of new investors, many of whom may now feel compelled to 
sell some or all of their holdings as they see Wall Street sentiment turning 
bearish, some pros fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the higher short-term interest rates engineered by the Fed will provide 
new competition for stocks in the form of higher yields on safe bank CDs, 
analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, stock and bond mutual funds -- the investment of choice for 38 million 
Americans -- report relatively little selling by their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fund companies acknowledge that, as foreign stock funds have 
plunged in price this year, investors have begun to take money away from those 
funds, though in small amounts. The worry now is that investors also will begin 
to pull money out of U.S. stock funds as their prices erode and people fear 
bigger losses ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is, will we see panic selling by less sophisticated 
investors who have been told that mutual funds go up 10% a year?" said Arnold 
Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook investment newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that, because so many more Americans own stocks today than did 
five years ago, a bear market today could eventually depress the economy by 
leaving many investors feeling poorer as their investments lose value. 
</P>
<P>
 But some money managers argue that the bear scenario is vastly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rodriguez, manager of the FPA Capital stock fund in West Los Angeles, 
said he was buying stocks Wednesday as the market dove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is just a hiccup," Rodriguez said. Taking a longer-term view, he 
expects interest rates to settle down soon and the economy and corporate 
profits to continue growing, bringing investors back to stocks. Even at higher 
yields of perhaps 4%, short-term CDs will provide little incentive for many 
investors to run wholesale back to banks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that many blue-chip stocks have already plunged more than 15% this 
year, Rodriguez said, "If you wait for 'the market' to bottom, a lot of the 
stocks you want to buy will have already bottomed" and begun moving up again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon Jacobs, editor of the No-Load Fund Investor newsletter in 
Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y., said he is reminding worried clients to think about 
why they bought stocks in the first place. If they are long-term investors, he 
said, they should realize that bear markets come and go, but that stocks 
inevitably move higher in the long run if the economy continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one sure way to lose money in the stock market, and that's to 
buy high and sell low," Jacobs said.

2 ARRESTED IN CARJACK DEATHS OF 2 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week after the slayings of two Marymount College students during a 
carjacking, Los Angeles police announced that two South Bay gang members were 
arrested Wednesday in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken into custody in the Friday night slayings -- which this week sparked 
international outrage and Japanese calls for gun control in the United States 
-- were Raymond Oscar Butler, 18, of San Pedro and Alberto V. Reygoza, 20, of 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The two had been under round-the-clock surveillance since Monday, when 
physical evidence was discovered tying them to the deaths, said Los Angeles 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams. It was unclear what that evidence was, 
however, and police released few details about the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Takuma Ito, a Japanese citizen, and Go Matsuura, a U.S. citizen who grew up in 
Japan, were shot to death about 11 p.m. Friday in a carjacking in the parking 
lot of a Ralphs supermarket in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, in a statement that sought to dispel the Japanese furor over the 
case, stressed that the motive for the case is being viewed as robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 "These young men were not targeted because of their ethnicity or because they 
were students or because they were visitors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Williams, "We want to send a message to everyone who lives in Los 
Angeles and visits Los Angeles locally and abroad: The city of Los Angeles is a 
wonderful place to live. . . . It is not the most violent city in America. It 
is not the most violent city in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the attack had occurred almost as soon as the victims arrived at 
the store, when the two "were approached by a male Hispanic who at gunpoint 
proceeded to commit a robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 During the holdup, Williams said, the two men were shot in the back of the 
head, and Ito's white 1994 Honda Civic was stolen by their attackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the case was assigned to the Major Crimes Investigation Section 
of the LAPD's Robbery-Homicide Division, and by the next day, the abandoned car 
was recovered "in an out-of-the-way location" not far from the scene of the 
crime. Police said they dusted the car, whose stereo was missing, for 
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers staked out the vehicle for the next 24 hours, he said, but it was 
impounded when no suspects showed up. By that time, the two victims -- who 
earlier had been declared brain-dead -- were taken off life-support at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings were only two of 25 homicides last weekend in Los Angeles County, 
but they received wide coverage in Japan and sparked immediate diplomatic 
reaction. Carjackings occur in the city at the rate of about 300 a month, but 
in Japan, where gun control is taken very seriously, they were seen as shocking 
and reinforced a longstanding perception that the United States is a violent, 
dangerous place. 
</P>
<P>
 As public officials ranging from Mayor Richard Riordan to President Clinton 
rushed to extend condolences to the families of the two young men and dispel 
public concerns in Japan, detectives had narrowed their search to the two 
suspects, based on "physical evidence that tied these two people to the crime," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, police confiscated a videotape from the Bank of San Pedro, where a 
security camera at an automated teller machine had been scanning the parking 
lot when the slayings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the quality of the videotape needs to be enhanced before its 
value can be determined. In any case, he noted, the identities of the suspects 
were established without the video. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Williams said, arrest and search warrants were served on a 
number of addresses in San Pedro and Long Beach, and Butler and Reygoza were 
taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who were in the process of booking the two men late Wednesday night, 
said they expected each of them to be charged with two counts of murder and two 
counts of robbery.

SCOUTS CAN BAR GAY MEN AS LEADERS, STATE COURT RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTINA BOXALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ruling on an issue closely watched by gay-rights advocates and their 
opponents, a state appeals court has concluded that the Boy Scouts of America 
have the right to bar gay men from becoming scout leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision issued Tuesday, the 2nd Appellate District of the California 
Court of Appeal found that a state law prohibiting job discrimination against 
gay men and lesbians does not apply to the Boy Scouts and does not prevent the 
organization from excluding gays from the ranks of Scoutmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing the Scouts to accept openly gay leaders would violate the 
organization's 1st Amendment rights of association, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Boy Scouts' exclusion of an adult leader who openly models or advocates 
homosexual behavior is no more or less rational than its exclusion of a leader 
who modeled or advocated any other type of behavior that it seeks to 
discourage," the judges wrote in a lengthy opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Scouting can determine its own standards of morality, it will be 
disabled as a teacher of moral views on any subject," continued the opinion, 
issued in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Timothy Curran, who at the 
time wanted to become an assistant Scoutmaster for a Northern California troop. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran had been a Boy Scout for several years, attaining the rank of Eagle 
Scout, before he took a male date to his senior prom and was quoted in the 
local news media as proud to be gay. A few months later he expressed interest 
in becoming an assistant Scoutmaster but was rejected because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran's suit is one of several cases around the country challenging the 
Scouts' exclusion of gay Scoutmasters. The lawsuits contend that the Boy Scouts 
are unconstitutionally discriminating against gays, while Boy Scout officials 
say they are a private group and have the right to exclude homosexuals, whom 
they consider at odds with the organization's basic moral tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran's attorney, Jon Davidson of the American Civil Liberties Union, called 
the opinion "extremely distressing." He said the ACLU will seek a rehearing 
before the appeals court, and if necessary, take the case to the state Supreme 
Court. "The majority opinion," Davidson said, "rules that the Boy Scouts and 
numerous other charitable organizations are exempt from California's 
anti-discrimination laws and are free to exclude whomever they want, on any 
basis. This overturns decades of state law to the contrary. I cannot believe 
that the court would have reached this result if Tim had been excluded by the 
Boy Scouts because of his race or religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson pointed out that just last month a state appeals panel in a different 
district ruled that the Boy Scouts could not exclude two boys who do not 
believe in God. In that opinion, issued in an Orange County case, the judges 
found that the nonprofit Boy Scouts were a business and thus bound by state 
anti-discrimination statutes, specifically the Unruh Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Curran opinion, the judges concluded otherwise. "To extend the 
Unruh Act to Scouting councils would transform numerous charitable 
organizations that are fundamentally different from business establishments and 
commercial or business clubs, such as the Rotary and Jaycees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many charitable organizations," the opinion stated, "direct their services to 
a distinct religious, cultural, gender, ethnic or age group in a way that would 
be unacceptable in a business, but is neither offensive or improper in the case 
of a charity seeking to accomplish its particular mission." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar court case now being tried in San Diego, El Cajon Police Officer 
Chuck Merino has sued the Boy Scouts over his abrupt ouster in 1992 as a Scout 
leader after the Scouts learned of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Curran case, Boy Scout attorneys have argued that the organization 
is a private club, not a business, and thus not subject to the Unruh law. 
Merino is also suing under San Diego's human dignity ordinance, which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Anthony Joseph, hearing the case without a jury, has said 
he may make a decision when testimony ends today or Friday. He has also 
predicted that his ruling will be appealed regardless of which side he favors.

PUC PANEL SUGGESTS CLOSING SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR PLANT; POWER: AGENCY WILL BEGIN 
HEARINGS NEXT MONTH. EDISON CALLS COST ANALYSIS FLAWED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The fate of California's oldest nuclear power plant will hang in the balance 
at hearings beginning next month as the Public Utilities Commission discusses a 
staff recommendation that the San Onofre plant be closed by 1998 on grounds 
that it is too expensive to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation to close San Onofre, if accepted by Southern California 
Edison, the operator and majority owner of the plant, would have a major impact 
on the region's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, however, says the recommendation by the PUC's division of ratepayer 
advocates is based on a misunderstanding about whether the power generated by 
the nuclear plant could be easily replaced by other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling plant, located on the coast between Oceanside and San Clemente, 
employs 3,000 workers, contributes $200 million a year to the Southern 
California economy, and pays $25 million in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant's two remaining reactors, Units II and III, were designed after the 
Three Mile Island nuclear accident in Pennsylvania and went into operation in 
1983 and 1984. Among the nation's 109 nuclear plants, San Onofre has been 
considered a showpiece and received numerous awards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Utilities Commission does not have the authority to order Units II 
and III at the San Onofre plant closed down as the staff report suggests. But 
it could, as it did with Unit I, force closure on Edison by refusing to allow 
the company to pass the cost of upkeep on to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kinosian, an analyst with the Public Utilities Commission and principal 
author of the report, said the utility could save $50 million a year by 
shutting San Onofre's two remaining units and replacing their output with 
cheaper power from alternative sources, as well as increasing conservation 
efforts and boosting output from Edison's other plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The utility has not demonstrated that it is reasonable to pass on the cost of 
running the nuclear plant to ratepayers," Kinosian said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Wambold, manager of business and financial services for Edison's 
nuclear division, said Edison disagrees with Kinosian's analysis of how the 
power from San Onofre could be replaced. San Onofre supplies about 20% of the 
power used by consumers in Southern California, enough to serve 1.3 million 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 "We very much disagree with the conclusion (of the ratepayer advocates)," 
Wambold said. "There is a fundamental flaw in their analysis." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar recommendation by Kinosian in the late 1980s that Edison close Unit 
I at San Onofre was also met by opposition from the company. Later the company 
capitulated, and it closed Unit I in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Wambold said the issues are different this time. With Unit I, he said, the 
dispute was about the cost of putting it back into service and about how 
reliable it would be once it was repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over closing Units II and III -- the huge concrete domes visible 
from Interstate 5 -- is fundamentally different, involving a disagreement about 
whether the power can be replaced, Wambold said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Edison's numbers, keeping San Onofre open provides a minimum 
$41-million-a-year boon to consumers. If a price tag were put on the increased 
air pollution that would occur if Edison switched from pollution-free nuclear 
power, the saving would be even greater, Wambold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between Kinosian's numbers and projections and Edison's will be 
examined at hearings to be held by the commission starting next month and 
expected to last into the summer. The hearings, at the commission's San 
Francisco headquarters, are to consider a rate increase request by Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Shames, executive director of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers 
Action Network, said he is not surprised at the recommendation of the PUC 
ratepayer advocate staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the house provocateurs," Shames said. "They're supposed to put out 
ideas that might be controversial." 
</P>
<P>
 Shutting Units II and III has been discussed by utility watchers for some 
time, Shames said. "Units II and III at San Onofre have been (economically) 
marginal at best," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinosian said he came to the conclusion that it makes economic sense to close 
Units II and III after reviewing recent contracts Edison has signed, or is in 
the process of signing, with co-generation plants and small power companies 
that use wind, solar, natural gas and even agricultural waste products. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he used 1998 as a cutoff point because he had comparative figures 
starting in that year. The annual savings would probably increase as San Onofre 
aged and required additional maintenance, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Onofre is licensed by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission to operate 
through 2013. In a recent discussion with reporters, Edison Vice President Dick 
Rosenblum, who is in charge of Edison's nuclear power division, said the 
company might consider asking the commission for an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure recommendation comes amid concern in the financial community about 
Edison, including several negative reports by major analysts. The 
Morgan-Stanley investment house late last year said Edison is the most poorly 
positioned of any big utility to weather the new world of deregulation and 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's other nuclear power plant, the Pacific Gas & Electric facility at 
Diablo Canyon, began operation in 1985 and 1986.

STATE SMOG CHECK BILL IS SIGNED BY WILSON; LEGISLATION: THE MEASURE CREATES A 
TWO-STEP INSPECTION AND REPAIR PROCESS FOR SOME VEHICLES. IT IS DESIGNED TO 
REDUCE FRAUD AND IMPROVE RELIABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday signed legislation to overhaul the state's Smog 
Check program, ending a yearlong feud with the federal government over how best 
to remove pollution-spewing vehicles from California roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-bill package signed by Wilson without fanfare will force more than 1 
million drivers each year to use a new two-step inspection and repair process 
intended to reduce the chance of fraud and improve the reliability of the smog 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor also signed several other bills that the Legislature sent to his 
desk before its one-week spring recess, including a measure to tighten local 
open meeting laws and another to extend a tax break to victims of last fall's 
fires in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Smog Check program will require 15% of the state's cars and trucks in 
urban areas to be inspected and, if necessary, repaired at separate independent 
garages. The current system allows motorists to have their vehicles tested and 
fixed at the same location. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles will select a 2% random sample of vehicles to 
undergo the new, more rigorous inspections. Also subject to the new system will 
be cars whose smog controls have been tampered with, taxis, high-mileage fleet 
vehicles and so-called gross polluters. 
</P>
<P>
 The gross polluters are high-polluting vehicles that will be detected through 
the placement of special roadside sensors that will seek out the worst 
offenders and record their identities for action by authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of these smog-belching vehicles who have low incomes will be eligible 
for subsidies of $450 to help pay for repairs or as much as $800 if they junk 
the vehicle and buy a cleaner-burning one. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which takes effect in 1995, represents a compromise reached 
recently with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which had demanded that 
all the inspections be separated from repair services now conducted at about 
9,000 garages licensed as Smog Check stations in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the Clinton Administration threatened to withhold federal 
transportation money from the state's freeway building program but later backed 
down and agreed to the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This legislation is a win-win situation for California," Wilson said in 
statement released by his office. "It allows us the flexibility to target the 
worst polluting vehicles, get them fixed or off the road, and it saves the jobs 
of mechanics currently employed at Smog Check stations through the state." 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Wednesday, the governor signed: 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco) that is the final 
piece in a package of legislation intended to make it more difficult for local 
government agencies to meet behind closed doors. The measure clarifies the 
definition of a meeting and ensures that retreats and other out-of-town 
gatherings of public officials are open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure to extend income tax relief to the victims of last fall's Southern 
California fires. Fire victims will be able to deduct their losses on their 
income tax returns for the next 10 years. Similar relief already has been 
granted to victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), also waives a state fee 
that would have been charged to hospitals when they reopen buildings closed by 
the Northridge quake. In some cases, according to the governor's office, the 
fee could have been as much as $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Legislation by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) to end the 
state's ban on investments by state trust funds in companies that do business 
in South Africa. The prohibition originally was adopted as part of an 
international campaign to pressure South Africa to end apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 * A measure to prohibit the loaning of firearms to minors except with the 
written consent of their parents, for no longer than 10 days, and only for the 
purpose of lawful sporting, hunting, agriculture or ranching activity. The bill 
was carried by Sen. Steve Peace (D-Bonita).

CLASS-ACTION SUIT TARGETS TOP TOBACCO COMPANIES; COURTS: FILING BLAMES 
MANUFACTURERS FOR DEATHS OF MILLIONS OF SMOKERS AND ACCUSES THEM OF SPIKING 
NICOTINE CONTENT OF CIGARETTES. INDUSTRY SAYS LAWYERS ARE JUMPING ON 'PUBLICITY 
BANDWAGON.' 
</P>

<P>
 A team of lawyers on Wednesday launched a bid to hold tobacco companies 
accountable for the deaths and suffering of millions of smokers, claiming that 
manufacturers intentionally increase nicotine levels in cigarettes to keep 
their consumers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark class-action lawsuit filed in New Orleans, the attorneys contend 
that Philip Morris Companies Inc., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and four other 
manufacturers secretly spike their product so addicted smokers will continue to 
buy it and their profits will rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigarettes kill," said San Francisco lawyer Melvin Belli, a veteran of two 
unsuccessful lawsuits against tobacco companies. "We will prove that the 
tobacco industry has conspired to catch you, hold you and kill you -- all 
without a moment of remorse or self-examination." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed by lawyers from 26 firms specializing in class actions, 
many of whom represented victims in the just-settled, $3.75-billion case 
against makers of silicone gel breast implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said their decision to take on the tobacco industry was motivated by 
two factors. In February, ABC News reported that manufacturers boost the 
nicotine level of their product by adding a tobacco flavoring to a portion of 
the tobacco used in cigarettes. The report cited former industry executives and 
was supported by a laboratory study paid for by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Food and Drug Administration Commissioner David A. Kessler 
called nicotine "highly addictive" -- a charge consistently denied by tobacco 
companies -- and suggested the government might regulate it as a drug. Last 
week, Kessler told a congressional subcommittee that "accumulating evidence" 
suggests that cigarette producers control nicotine levels in a manner that 
"creates and sustains an addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris executives, who hit ABC with a $10-billion libel lawsuit after 
the network's broadcast, said Wednesday they do not artificially enhance the 
nicotine content of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying foundation of this (class action) lawsuit -- that we add 
nicotine to our product -- is simply not true," said Gary Long, an attorney for 
Philip Morris. Belli and his fellow lawyers, Long said, are simply "jumping on 
the publicity bandwagon to see if there's something there." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for R.J.R. Tobacco Co. agreed, and said the tobacco 
manufacturing process actually reduces the nicotine in cigarettes. Spokeswoman 
Maura Ellis also rejected the lawsuit's claim that cigarettes are addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more former smokers in America than there are current smokers," 
Ellis said. "The great majority of them quit without any aid or support group." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, more than 320 health-related lawsuits have been filed against 
tobacco companies. Most of the cases have been dismissed, and all but one of 
those that have made it to trial were won by the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, juries have found that smokers indulge in their habit based on 
their free will, and that label warnings advising consumers of risks insulate 
tobacco companies from liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers pursuing the class-action suit say the new information changes the 
legal picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have evidence that the issue is not an issue of free will, because of 
the addictive qualities of the cigarettes and the manipulative acts of the 
tobacco companies," said Richard Heimann, a noted San Francisco attorney. "For 
years, these companies have made misleading statements about their product and 
have concealed their deliberate manipulation of nicotine levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Heimann said Wednesday's suit marks the first time a class action has been 
brought against the tobacco industry. The case has three named plaintiffs -- 
longtime smokers Ernest Perry and George Solomon, and Dianne Castano, a widow 
who blames her husband's death on cigarettes. But because it is a class action, 
the lawsuit is also filed on behalf of untold millions who may have suffered 
similar harm. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit's aim is to compensate victims for economic losses caused by their 
alleged addiction, Heimann said. Such losses would include money spent on 
cigarettes, and also the costs of counseling or other assistance a person 
required in order to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation for cigarette-caused health problems will also be sought, but 
winning money for such injuries is difficult in class-action suits because each 
individual's experience is so different, Heimann said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the lawyers, a U.S. District Court judge Wednesday ordered 
the tobacco companies not to destroy or alter records that might relate to the 
case. Also named as defendants are The American Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco 
Co., R.J.R. Nabisco Inc. -- the parent of R.J.R. Tobacco Co. -- and the Liggett 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is the latest in a series of blows suffered by the $48-billion 
tobacco industry, which has seen sales decline about 2% annually since 1984. In 
recent months, several fast-food chains have banned smoking in their 
restaurants, President Clinton has proposed a cigarette tax increase to finance 
health care reform, and the U.S. Department of Labor is moving to outlaw 
smoking in all workplaces.

NAVY SEA LION BREAKS RANKS AND ESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pumpkin the wayward Navy sea lion remained free Wednesday in waters off Santa 
Cruz Island, eluding his Navy keepers who were trying to recapture him. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old California sea lion went AWOL a week ago from a routine 
training exercise clearing dummy mines in the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, animal activists decried Pumpkin's plight and criticized the 
Navy's use of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good for him," said Ingrid Newkirk, chairwoman for the Washington-based 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, praising Pumpkin's dash for 
freedom. "The Navy declared war on marine mammals a long time ago. It's too bad 
the Geneva Convention doesn't extend to sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
 After a weeklong search by air and sea, Pumpkin was briefly captured Tuesday 
on Gull Island, a rocky outcrop off the southern coast of Santa Cruz Island. 
But the sea lion, which had apparently been injured, wrestled free from his 
captors while they waited for a helicopter, and plunged back into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 A harness that the sea lion wore to recover dummy explosives fell off, leaving 
Navy frogmen no way of distinguishing Pumpkin from the thousands of other sea 
lions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is he's out there on his own, and he may want to stay out there," 
said Navy spokesman Tom LaPuzza. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said Navy personnel remain in the area and are trying to coax him back 
to the boat with an audible beacon and buckets of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without identifying marks, the only way they'll recognize Pumpkin is if he 
jumps in the boat," LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Local activists cited Pumpkin's captivity as an example of improper use of sea 
mammals for military experimentation. Simon Oswitch, vice president of Animal 
Emancipation Inc., called the practice cruel and increasingly unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know what they do with the animals that don't make the training 
cut," Oswitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal activists have long criticized the Navy's Marine Mammal Program, 
which includes 125 dolphins, sea lions and other sea mammals trained to recover 
training mines and intercept enemy frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, several former Navy trainers accused the Navy of employing brutal 
methods in training the mammals, but an investigation by the federal Marine 
Mammal Commission cleared the Navy of extensive wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Howorth, the director of the Marine Mammal Center in Santa Barbara, said 
Pumpkin's chances of survival are excellent, despite his naval training to 
avoid foraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even captive-born sea lions are only one or two generations removed from 
millions of years of evolution," Howorth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are highly intelligent and highly sociable, and the odds are extremely 
good that his instincts would take over. It's not like releasing a toy poodle 
into the national forest." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said other sea lions have wandered off during exercises in the Channel 
Islands, and some swam directly back to their pens in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teams of Navy animal trainers will remain in the area through today, 
and then end their search.

ITALY VICTOR APPARENTLY CLEARS WAY TO GOVERN; POLITICS: BILLIONAIRE BERLUSCONI 
SEEMS TO HAVE STRUCK DEAL WITH JUNIOR PARTNER IN RIGHT-WING ALLIANCE. ANALYSTS 
WELCOME NEWS AS SIGN OF STABILITY.

<P>
 Overnight political sensation Silvio Berlusconi apparently overcame objections 
from a fractious partner in his victorious right-wing electoral alliance 
Wednesday, clearing the media baron's path to become Italian prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old billionaire, who emerged from weekend elections as leader of 
the country's biggest political party, told reporters in his hometown of Milan 
that he expects quick formation of a government with himself at its head. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian analysts welcomed the news as a tonic for stability. They cautioned, 
though, that there are still any number of Machiavellian intricacies to be 
played out before any new government can take office in mid-April. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi made his remarks after meeting in Milan with Umberto Bossi, head of 
the federalist, sometimes secessionist Northern League, junior partner in the 
three-party alliance that rewrote Italian political history by toppling corrupt 
centrist parties from nearly half a century of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guaranteed the possibility of good government to this country. . . . I am 
personally sure that we will do it, and do it soon," Berlusconi said. "I think 
that government must be guided by the pole which won, and Berlusconi is the 
leader of this force," he added, referring to himself in the third person. 
</P>
<P>
 The abrasive Bossi, who sometimes talks of dividing Italy into three states, 
ran in the weekend election in tandem with Berlusconi's 3-month-old Forza 
Italia (Go Italy) movement and the neo-fascist National Alliance headed by 
Gianfranco Fini. 
</P>
<P>
 When the conservatives emerged with a stunning victory, Bossi immediately 
ruled out collaborating in a government with Fini, whose southern-based party 
-- the direct descendant of former dictator Benito Mussolini -- believes in a 
strong central government. 
</P>
<P>
 Bossi also said he would veto Berlusconi for the prime minister's job because 
he is a leading member of an Italian business Establishment that needs reform 
in the wake of its decades of conspiracy with politicians and their parties in 
institutionalized corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi, whose Fininvest empire had sales of around $7 billion last year, 
is attacked by critics for his close ties to his corruption-linked friend and 
former prime minister, Bettino Craxi. 
</P>
<P>
 The would-be prime minister, who jumped into politics two months ago because 
he feared a leftist victory, has not been named in a scandal that has tarred 
other leading Italian industrialists. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his reservations, Bossi was nearly as upbeat as Berlusconi after their 
first post-election meeting, which he said focused mostly on forging a common 
government program. "We found partial and reciprocal satisfaction. Next week we 
hope to tie things up," Bossi told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian analysts said Bossi has apparently agreed to a Northern League 
representative, but not himself, as deputy prime minister on the further 
understanding that Fini would not join the government, although members of his 
party would get ministerial posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Bossi had dropped his objections, Berlusconi told Italian 
reporters: "I think that was the conclusion of our meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fini, 42, who has renamed the neo-fascists and moved them away 
from the extreme right, said he was "trusting and optimistic of an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Fini, the party's vote has swelled. It controls nearly one-third of the 
right's 366 seats in the new 630-member Chamber of Deputies.

FRENCH ATOMIC SUB MISHAP KILLS 10

<P>
 Superheated steam leaked inside the turbine room of a submerged French nuclear 
submarine Wednesday, killing the commander and nine sailors during an exercise 
in the Mediterranean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emeraude surfaced and headed back to its base at Toulon using diesel and 
battery power, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident did not affect the vessel's nuclear reactor and "in no way puts 
into question either the nuclear security of the vessel or the environment," 
the Defense Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
 A leak in a pipe "filled the turbo-generating room with steam," burning the 
victims or asphyxiating them, Rear Adm. Philippe Roy said, adding that there 
was no word on the cause of the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 One of six nuclear attack submarines based at Toulon, the Emeraude is powered 
by a pressurized water-cooled nuclear reactor, which heats water to produce 
steam to drive two turbine generators. It carries no nuclear weapons.

NORTHWEST GROUP ISSUES QUIET CALL FOR LEGALIZED ASSISTED SUICIDE; COMPASSION IN 
DYING OFFERS COUNSELING FOR THE TERMINALLY ILL WHO WANT TO END THEIR LIVES. IT 
IS ALSO SEEKING COURT ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jack Kevorkian is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Northwest, quietly, without television cameras or heated public 
rallies -- and so far without interference from authorities -- determined 
activists are helping extend the frontiers of assisted suicide for the 
terminally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Compassion in Dying is the name the group of 25 volunteers and 1,400 financial 
backers has given itself. And so far it has lent encouragement, counsel and 
support to dozens of men and women who sought help in ending their lives in the 
final stages of disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe more significantly, the group is proceeding with court action asking a 
federal judge to declare a constitutional right for Americans to hasten their 
inevitable deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are changing in the country," said Susan J. Dunshee, board president 
of the group. "More and more people know someone who is terminally ill. Pretty 
soon, almost everybody is going to know someone who has AIDS. There is more 
about end-of-life issues on television. More books on the subject. More in the 
newspapers. It's not the same anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while suicide remains stigmatized and assisting in suicides is 
unlawful in more than half of the states, it is an everyday fact of life across 
much of the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But it occurs in a forbidden zone of American culture -- with knowing but 
uninvolved doctors, amateur how-to guidebooks, AIDS- or cancer-support groups, 
perhaps a loving partner or family member. Or worse, it occurs violently, with 
a gunshot or a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking is public acceptance. And uniform standards, reliable guidance, 
medical recognition and a solemn process or ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Compassion in Dying say they find this a cruel indignity for people 
who have suffered greatly. And so the group has stepped into the legal "gray 
zone," willing to help the dying -- up to a point -- and simultaneously nudging 
society toward lifting this taboo. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what does Compassion in Dying actually do? 
</P>
<P>
 Dunshee says the organization will only assist adults whose doctors attest 
that they have a terminal illness and less than six months to live. Patients 
are screened for mental competence and to make sure that no close friend or 
relative will object to suicide counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, it is up to the dying patient to procure enough barbiturates 
from a physician to enable suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, Compassion in Dying is different from Kevorkian, the former 
physician in Michigan who has provided the means for suicide. Also, Kevorkian 
has not limited his assistance to people with less than six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn L. Tucker, an attorney who advises Compassion in Dying, says the 
process by which a patient must obtain suicide dosages of drugs is 
unsatisfactory. She described a typical encounter between doctor and patient: 
</P>
<P>
 Patient: I'm having a terrible time sleeping.  
</P>
<P>
 Doctor: OK, I'll give you a prescription. But don't take more than "X" because 
it will kill you.  
</P>
<P>
 "They talk in that kind of code. They don't have direct communication. There 
is no opportunity for doctors to consult one another like they do on everything 
else. Yet these are people who critically need medical advice," Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
 With that dialogue lacking, Compassion in Dying will counsel patients about 
dosages, how to mix the barbiturates with soft food, about anti-nausea 
treatment and how to follow up the mixture with a shot of whiskey. In all 
cases, the organization says the patient must self-administer the drugs. Sleep 
follows in minutes, death within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tragedy for people who think they know how to do this and then botch 
it," Dunshee said. She also said it is a "tragedy" that a good many patients 
turn to their doctors and are refused barbiturate prescriptions in sufficient 
quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the terminally ill who contact the group have cancer, closely 
followed by AIDS and, a distant third, emphysema. Dunshee said several hundred 
ill people have made contact with the group and about 30 have followed through 
with the organization until their deaths, either by suicide or from the effects 
of disease before a suicide could be undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
 By reaching out to Compassion in Dying, patients and families are seeking more 
than just guidance. They are grasping for social validity for the decision to 
end a life. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ask for more. They seek spiritual counseling. Ralph Mero, executive 
director of the group, is an ordained minister -- and the organization calls 
upon a network of volunteer clergy from many religious denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients ask that Compassion in Dying volunteers be at their bedsides at 
the end. The organization honors these requests, although it is vague about how 
many suicides its volunteers have attended -- probably fewer than 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it possible for some people to die in their own beds with dignity. 
Nobody should have to die alone," Dunshee said. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid legal problems, Dunshee won't directly acknowledge witnessing a 
suicide. She will say only that she has been on hand when a person died at the 
time of his own choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the sense that this was the best possible death. A person is conscious 
before dying, surrounded by loved ones, in his own bed with his favorite 
music." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle and well-known 
right-to-life organizations in the state will denounce Compassion in Dying. But 
so far, the backlash has been temperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice of assisting in suicides is more widespread than some might 
think. Less than a year ago, the 145,000-member National Assn. of Social 
Workers issued guidelines saying it is "not inappropriate for a social worker" 
to be present at a suicide. Crusader Derek Humphry's book on the subject, 
"Final Exit," has sold more than 700,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Preston, a Seattle cardiologist and advisory board member to Compassion in 
Dying, guesses that between 30% and 50% of the doctors he knows would be 
willing to prescribe barbiturates for terminally ill patients. He has long 
advocated revising medical standards to help people avoid terrible suffering 
just before death. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of life, there is a clash between the two callings of medicine -- 
prolonging life and easing suffering. Today there are too many physicians using 
curative methods for people who are dying. These are intrusive, painful and 
cause distress. Part of the role of the physician is to help people die," 
Preston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compassion in Dying is an outgrowth of a 1991 Washington state ballot 
proposition that sought to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally 
ill, mentally competent adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was favored in pre-election polls but went down to defeat after 
opponents mounted a campaign suggesting that physicians would become killers. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar proposition was defeated in California in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of those defeats, organizers in Seattle decided to make their 
next big push in the federal courts. Like many states, Washington has a law 
making it a crime to assist or cause a suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lawsuit argued recently in U.S. District Court here, Compassion in Dying 
and a string of supporters argued that such laws violate the Constitution the 
same way that anti-abortion statutes do. 
</P>
<P>
 "People," Tucker said, "have basic rights over their lives and bodies." Their 
Terms for Helping 
</P>
<P>
 Under the self-imposed guidelines, Compassion in Dying offers suicide 
counseling and support only to individuals in sound mental condition and have 
less than six months to live. Certain diseases tend to fall under the 
guidelines and others do not. Here is a sample comparison. 
</P>

 An Alaska woman caught up in hysteria over rumors that Americans are stealing 
children was transferred to a hospital in Guatemala City after suffering severe 
injuries at the hands of a rural mob. Guatemalan officials identified the woman 
as Diane Werntock Jung, 52, but U.S. officials said they understood her name to 
be June Diane Weinstock. She is the third foreigner known to have been attacked 
in recent days over the rumors.

IRA PLEDGES 3-DAY TRUCE TO INDUCE BRITISH TO NEGOTIATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Irish Republican Army announced late Wednesday that it will observe a 
three-day cease-fire next week in its long campaign of terrorism against the 
British government to force it out of Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the IRA said it hopes the British will use the truce as a 
"further opportunity in the spirit in which it is offered." The implication was 
that the British should now negotiate with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the 
IRA, for a "clarification" of the Dec. 15 Downing Street Declaration, which 
offered talks with the IRA but only after a three-month cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, called Wednesday night for immediate talks 
between the Irish republican groups and the British government and said there 
will be several days in which to make contact. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish Prime Minister Albert Reynolds welcomed the cease-fire, which is to 
begin at midnight Tuesday. But he also called for a total "cessation of 
violence." He did not indicate whether he plans to make any contact with the 
IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 But British Prime Minister John Major, on a previously scheduled trip to 
Northern Ireland, said in Belfast that the IRA cease-fire overture was 
"cynical." He said the people of Northern Ireland want a "permanent end to 
violence," not a "public relations gesture." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the IRA nor Sinn Fein has accepted the conditions of the Downing 
Street Declaration, which Adams has insisted London must clarify. He made that 
demand during a 48-hour trip to New York earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Major's government has refused, arguing that the declaration is clear and 
that any further talks would constitute "negotiations," which cannot take place 
until after a three-month cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA announcement was the first time that the group, which demands that the 
British leave Northern Ireland, has called an Easter cease-fire. It observed a 
similar truce last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, IRA mortar attacks on London's Heathrow Airport disrupted 
flights at one of the world's busiest airports. 
</P>
<P>
 The truce announcement was received coolly by Northern Ireland Protestants, 
who said that only a permanent end to violence would be meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Hume, a moderate Roman Catholic member of Parliament, said Wednesday 
night that the British government should "leave no stone unturned," hinting 
that the British should talk with the IRA before or during the cease-fire.

RIGHTIST'S ANTI-SEMITIC REMARKS PROBED; GERMANY: EX-NAZI MAY FACE TRIAL FOR 
SUGGESTING JEWISH LEADER HAS SPURRED RISE IN INTOLERANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 German prosecutors launched a criminal investigation Wednesday of a far-right 
politician who suggested in the wake of last week's synagogue firebombing that 
certain Jews are themselves to blame for a rise in anti-Jewish sentiment here. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Schoenhuber -- a 71-year-old former volunteer in the personal guard of 
Adolf Hitler in the Waffen-SS and now leader of the rightist Republikaner party 
-- singled out one German Jewish leader as "one of those most responsible for 
provoking anti-Semitism." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey found that anti-Jewish feeling has risen somewhat over the 
past year in Germany, although respondents still generally prefer Jews to 
members of other minority groups. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been attacks on synagogues and Jewish monuments since the 
reunification of the former East and West Germanys in 1990; another Jewish 
cemetery desecration was discovered Wednesday, in the Bavarian town of 
Pretzfeld. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a crime in Germany to incite race hatred, but the case against 
Schoenhuber may still never get to trial, much less result in a conviction. 
Some legal experts say that by inciting hatred of a single Jewish leader, 
Schoenhuber is merely committing an act of personal slander and not the 
full-blown criminal offense of fomenting hatred against a racial or social 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, attempts to put Schoenhuber on trial for any offense will be 
unable to go forward unless he is stripped of the immunity that he enjoys as a 
member of the European Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoenhuber is known in Germany as the first serious, effective leader for 
right-wing extremism in modern times. He founded the Republikaner party in 
1983, two years after publishing "I Took Part," his controversial memoirs of 
his service as a Waffen-SS sergeant. Under his aegis, Die Republikaner became 
the first modern far-right party to win seats in any German legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Republikaner members still hold no seats in the federal Parliament, 
they have been represented in state and local legislatures in recent years, and 
the party receives official subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal elections are to be held here in October, and many mainstream German 
politicians would like to rein in Schoenhuber before his party can win any 
seats in the federal Parliament. Leaders of the major parties have called for 
Schoenhuber's prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts fear that a high-profile race-hate trial would only attract 
attention and sympathy votes to Schoenhuber and his party. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Schoenhuber has tended to speak out mainly against foreigners. It 
has been only recently that he has changed his focus to Ignatz Bubis, president 
of the Bonn-based Central Council of German Jews, the largest Jewish 
organization in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, for instance, Schoenhuber tried to file a race-hate suit 
of his own against Bubis, complaining that the Jewish leader was smearing 
rightists like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis had earlier complained that right-wing radicals like Schoenhuber were 
the intellectual authors of neo-Nazi violence in Germany. "Germans have had 
enough of Herr Bubis' finger-wagging," Schoenhuber complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after last week's bombing of the synagogue in the northern German city 
of Luebeck, Bubis once again called Schoenhuber a "mental arsonist," or one who 
gives ideas and ideological backing to neo-Nazis who actually carry out such 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Republikaners held a rally two days later, where Schoenhuber said he had 
nothing to do with the firebombing and went on to say that Bubis himself was 
promoting anti-Semitism. 
</P>
<P>
 Bubis told Reuters news service that he would not dignify Schoenhuber's claims 
with a response.

U.S. VOWS TO BOLSTER BOSNIA PEACE QUEST; BALKANS: JOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN AND 
AMBASSADOR TO U.N. VISIT SARAJEVO TO DISCUSS MORE INVOLVEMENT.

 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and Gen. John 
M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Wednesday paid the 
highest-level U.S. visit here since war broke out and pledged greater American 
involvement in the quest for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 While both repeated that U.S. ground troops would be deployed in Bosnia only 
after all three warring factions agree on a truce, Shalikashvili conceded that 
the recent reconciliation between Croats and Muslims might lead to eventual 
Western acceptance of a truncated Bosnia, which American forces could help 
protect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly would not exclude that," the top U.S. military officer said of 
the prospect of American intervention to stabilize and rebuild the reunifying 
remnants of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said privately that Albright and the general came here to evaluate ways 
of stepping up U.S. involvement in the peace process and talked over means of 
transferring the current U.N. peacekeeping mission to tighter NATO control. 
</P>
<P>
 One source in the general's delegation said the team came on a fact-finding 
tour and that he expected to be engaged in explaining to the American public 
why U.S. forces should be deployed in Bosnia, where a Serbian rebellion against 
independence two years ago has deteriorated into civil war. Civilians have 
borne the brunt of the battles, with more than 200,000 dead and 2 million 
homeless; Serbian nationalists have seized more than 70% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arguments for intervention are all very intellectual, and that's hard to 
sell," the officer said of the balancing act being practiced by the Pentagon in 
seeking to protect European security and discourage aggressive nationalism 
while heeding American fears of casualties and being dragged into a 
Vietnam-style quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in Europe for a long time in an effort to enhance security," said 
the aide. "This is where the insecurity is, so why not be here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shalikashvili made clear after a day of meetings with Bosnian and U.N. 
military commanders that President Clinton's precondition of a three-way peace 
agreement still stands; both he and Albright appealed to the Bosnian Serb 
rebels to join talks aimed at a negotiated settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message repeatedly pounded out to the people of Bosnia was that 
America is on the case and committed to finding a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Albright visited the site of the future U.S. Embassy in Sarajevo and declared 
to hundreds of community leaders that "today's ceremony should demonstrate for 
all to see that America's future and your future are inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
 She also announced $10 million in American aid for reconstruction in Sarajevo 
now that a Serbian artillery bombardment has been halted by threats of air 
strikes by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In an emotional conclusion, 
she adapted the words of the late John F. Kennedy when he visited divided 
Berlin in 1961 by proclaiming, "Ya sam Sarajevka" (I am a Sarajevan). 
</P>
<P>
 The American delegation held its longest talks with the U.N. commander for 
Bosnia, British Gen. Michael Rose, who has been appealing for swift, 
substantial reinforcement of the 13,000 troops already assigned to Bosnia. 
"Obviously any deployment from the United States would be an enormous help," 
Rose said when asked if he thought he could maintain the recent progress toward 
peace with the forces now available to him. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 of the Bosnia-based peacekeepers are actually on loan from 
U.N.-protected areas of Croatia, and a cease-fire signed early Wednesday 
between Croatian government forces and rebel Serbs is likely to step up the 
pressure for return of the borrowed soldiers. "If we have to move troops out of 
here, there is a risk of losing the momentum," Rose said.

S. KOREA, U.S. PLAN U.N. STEPS ON N. KOREAN SANCTIONS; DIPLOMACY: GRADUAL 
APPROACH IS INTENDED TO EASE CHINESE RESISTANCE TO A STRONG STAND ON INSPECTION 
OF NORTH'S NUCLEAR SITES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and South Korea agreed Wednesday on a gradual, step-by-step 
strategy to overcome Chinese resistance to U.N. Security Council sanctions 
against North Korea over its suspected nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is unlikely the Chinese will veto the kind of resolution we are 
working on right now," South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo said after a 
50-minute meeting with Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at the United Nations, in what many took as a sign that the strategy 
might be working, China proposed that the Security Council president issue a 
statement calling on North Korea to submit to inspections of its nuclear 
facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a statement would carry less weight than a formal resolution, but it 
would put the council -- and China -- on record. Under U.N. rules, presidential 
statements must have the unanimous support of the 15-member council. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the United States, Britain, France and Russia -- the permanent 
members of the Security Council along with China -- clearly would prefer a 
resolution, a senior U.S. official described the Chinese action as "a sign that 
on content they are moving in the same direction as we are." 
</P>
<P>
 The official said Washington and its allies have not yet decided whether to go 
along with China's proposal or to continue pushing for a resolution. But he 
said the proposed statement "says a lot of good things and has the Chinese on 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute with the North Koreans escalated this year after Pyongyang refused 
to allow international inspections of nuclear facilities under the requirements 
of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The IAEA has been trying to determine 
whether North Korea is diverting plutonium that comes out of its nuclear power 
plants for use in nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States hopes to persuade Beijing, a North Korean ally, to support 
mild Security Council criticism of Pyongyang, on the assumption that China 
would then be less likely to veto a stronger resolution later if North Korea 
spurns the council's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may act as early as today on a statement or a resolution requiring 
North Korea to go along with the inspections. If, after a reasonable time, the 
North Koreans fail to comply, the council would consider economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Christopher has predicted that China would not block U.N. action 
against North Korea, Chinese officials repeatedly have opposed sanctions, 
calling instead for "dialogue" with Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Han briefed Christopher in Washington after talks in Beijing 
between Chinese officials and South Korean President Kim Young Sam. Han went to 
the United Nations later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese are on board in the sense of discussing the form and the content 
of the Security Council measure," Han said. "We're still talking. There's no 
conclusion as to which way it would go. We are fairly certain about the content 
of either (a resolution or a statement) and that means there would be certain 
minimum requirements." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said the United States and South Korean positions "are completely 
congruent." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday evening in San Diego, where he is vacationing, President Clinton 
declined to speculate on the chances that the Security Council will adopt a 
resolution. "I'll just say that we and the South Koreans are exploring with all 
the relevant parties what our options are," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also cautious in predicting the Chinese response on the issue. "We'll 
have to see where China comes down on it in the end," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry conceded that the U.S. strategy could 
take time. But he said that a delay may be necessary to ensure Chinese 
acquiescence. "In a very deliberate, careful way, in a step-by-step way, (the 
Security Council) will begin to make clear the international community's 
determination to successfully resolve the North Korean issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea insists its nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes. But Kim 
Il Sung's regime has repeatedly blocked international inspections. McCurry said 
the IAEA must try to determine, based on information it has been able to 
gather, whether North Korea has an active nuclear weapons program. Such a 
finding, he said, would have "grave consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, North Korea's formidable propaganda apparatus has threatened 
war if the West invokes sanctions. Officials in both Washington and Seoul have 
said the North Korean threats are a cause for concern but that the West should 
not change policy because of them.

FARRAKHAN TO MOVE MEN-ONLY TEXAS SPEECH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Farrakhan decided not to give a speech at Texas Southern University 
because women would have been allowed to attend, a spokesman for the Nation of 
Islam leader said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The university had said Tuesday that the April 11 event, billed as a 
man-to-man discussion of issues involving black men, could not be held on 
campus if women were prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the Nation of Islam backed down from its men-only plan, saying that 
women would be allowed. But Farrakhan later decided that he didn't want to hold 
the event at the university if women could attend, said Houston-area Nation of 
Islam leader Robert Muhammad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not having it at TSU. It's not canceled, it will just be moved," 
Muhammad said. A new site has not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The school had said women must be allowed to hear the speech because it was to 
be held in a public building. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January, women have been barred from several events by the controversial 
Muslim group, whose leaders have been under fire for statements derogatory to 
Jews, Roman Catholics and others.

CLINTON SIGNS FEDERAL WORKER BUYOUT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in California on a weeklong vacation, Wednesday signed into 
law legislation that will offer federal workers buyouts of up to $25,000 as a 
means of trimming the federal work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is part of an effort to cut 272,900 federal workers and drop the 
total number of government workers below 2 million for the first time since 
1966. In a statement, Clinton said the legislation would give the government 
the incentives it needs to eliminate unnecessary high-level jobs, while 
avoiding layoffs that would disproportionately hit younger workers, "many of 
whom are recently hired women and minorities." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill provides that federal workers with 12 months of continuous service 
will be able to take severance pay or a lump sum of $25,000, whichever is less, 
when they leave the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Clinton has scheduled a public signing of the Goals 2000 education 
legislation at the Agustin Vincent Zamorano Fine Arts Academy in San Diego. 
Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
will join him for the signing of the bill, which calls for creation of 
voluntary national standards for the content of course work. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton divided the rest of Wednesday between foreign-policy briefings, 
jogging, walking and a round of golf at Del Mar Country Club. Clinton's 
briefings came from National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, who flew to San 
Diego Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of an early-morning walk with his wife, Clinton shook hands with 
people in a crowd across the street from the Ocean Boulevard home of hotelier 
H. Larry Lawrence, where the Clintons are staying until Saturday. He was 
serenaded by Glen Erath, a gag writer for KFMB Radio, who played a guitar and 
sang: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a Big Mac in my bag, a song in my heart, let's picnic in the sand." 
Clinton, looking amused, told Erath, "That's a great song," and shook his hand.

WHITE HOUSE PLANS BLITZ TO DEFEND CLINTONS; PUBLIC RELATIONS: CAMPAIGN IS ALSO 
AIMED AT KEEPING WHITEWATER CONTROVERSY FROM HURTING PRESIDENT'S AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House officials, concerned that the Whitewater case will remain a vexing 
issue, have launched a public relations blitz to defend President Clinton and 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and to keep the controversy from interfering 
with the President's congressional agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clintons feel an obligation to continue responding to questions about the 
Whitewater matter and plan to take a leading role in the campaign after 
returning to Washington this weekend from a weeklong vacation, senior White 
House aides said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons will travel to various cities next week promoting health care 
reform and other legislative goals while also responding to queries about the 
land deal controversy, the aides said. In addition, Cabinet secretaries and 
Democratic members of Congress plan to participate in 70 different "events" 
related to the legislative agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of the public relations campaign, officials indicated, will be 
that the Clintons are being fully responsive to Whitewater questions and that 
the American people do not want the controversy to become an excuse for the 
legislative gridlock that has characterized Washington in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of the concern we have in the country about Whitewater arises 
more in the question of whether it's going to disrupt government than what may 
have happened 15 or 16 years ago" in the Whitewater controversy, said 
presidential counselor David Gergen. 
</P>
<P>
 That message, said Gergen, who served as an aide to Republican Presidents 
Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, also has been heard by "a lot of Republicans" 
who are now talking about seeking bipartisan answers to important policy 
issues. Among them, he said, are House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel 
(R-Ill.) and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.). 
</P>
<P>
 Gergen and two other senior White House aides -- Chief of Staff Thomas (Mack) 
McLarty and congressional liaison official Pat Griffin -- discussed the 
Administration's plans to defend Clinton and promote his policies at a 
breakfast session with a large group of Washington journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Hillary Clinton has the same obligation as the President to respond 
to Whitewater questions, Gergen said she already has fully disclosed how she 
parlayed a $1,000 investment in commodities futures into a $100,000 profit in 
the late 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she feels it's important to be responsive" to questions about 
Whitewater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater label has come to embrace not only the Clintons' failed real 
estate investment in Whitewater Development Corp. in Arkansas and White House 
meetings that may have been intended to protect the Clintons from the 
controversy, but also questions about Hillary Clinton's financial affairs and 
her role as a Little Rock, Ark., lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady has been widely criticized for not being more forthcoming, but 
Gergen noted that in the last two weeks she has granted interviews to two news 
magazines and has answered questions five different times during travels 
outside of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the mandate of Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
might be broad enough to include Hillary Clinton's commodities trading, McLarty 
said Fiske has a reputation for thoroughness "and I would not be surprised if 
he included that in his reviews." 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides insisted that, despite the Whitewater controversy, Clinton's 
legislative goals remain on track. However, McLarty said the continuing furor 
tends to make people equate the Whitewater matter with gridlock and make them 
lose "a sense of, perhaps, optimism in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 People want the Whitewater matter resolved, he said, but that probably will 
take "some period of months" until Fiske finishes his work and makes a final 
report. "I think that's ultimately the way to get to the conclusion, and we 
just will have to endure that and march right on through it." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, who only recently became Clinton's chief assistant for congressional 
relations, denied reports that the Whitewater matter has already adversely 
affected the President's agenda. He said Congress had two of its most 
productive weeks just before beginning its Easter recess, capped by Senate 
enactment of Clinton's bill to set national education goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very aggressive but doable agenda until the end of the session, but 
certainly for the next 30 days," he said. The focus will be on health care and 
welfare reform and a controversial crime bill pending in the House, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot of momentum going," he said. "We don't see any evidence 
of anything that is slowing down."

GORE, PLEDGING AID TO TORNADO AREA, PRAISES PREACHERS' 'GRACE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carrying a promise of federal help to the tornado-swept Southeast, Vice 
President Al Gore stood in the ruins of a country church Wednesday and called 
the preacher couple whose daughter died in the rubble "a lesson in grace." 
</P>
<P>
 The series of tornadoes Sunday that killed at least 43 people in Alabama, 
Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina and South Carolina, left the darkest mark at 
Goshen United Methodist Church, headed by the Rev. Kelly Clem. Twenty 
worshipers, including Clem's 4-year-old daughter, died when the roof collapsed 
during services. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, vacationing in Southern California, declared Alabama a 
major disaster area Wednesday, making federal financing available to affected 
individuals and local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in awe of the strength and grace you've shown through this," Gore said, 
grasping Kelly Clem's hand during a quiet moment on the grounds of the ruined 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, the Rev. Dale Clem, said he recalled how Gore rearranged his life 
around his family after his son, Albert, nearly died in a car wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "That has been an inspiration to me," Dale Clem told Gore, explaining how he 
is coping with the death of his daughter, Hannah. Dale Clem heads a youth 
ministry at Jacksonville State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibly moved, Gore paused and said, "That really changes your perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple took Gore on a brief tour, stepping over a large sheet of foam 
rubber, twigs, balls of paper and bits and pieces of the church. Kelly Clem's 
eyes were swollen and her forehead was bruised from injuries sustained in the 
tornado. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no warning," she told Gore, pointing to the roof, now spread flat 
on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Clem cried later as Gore commended the couple in brief remarks to 
reporters. "On behalf of the country, I want to thank you for this lesson in 
grace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore told reporters he would announce today a proposal to improve severe 
weather forecasting in rural areas. Without elaborating, Gore said, "One of the 
lessons our nation must learn from this tragedy is we must do a better job of 
providing severe weather warnings to communities."

JUSTICES PONDER SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR HASIDIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can the government accommodate the wishes of a separatist religious sect by 
creating a special school district for its children? Or does the mere act of 
creating such a separate district violate the First Amendment's ban on laws 
"respecting an establishment of religion?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the questions before the Supreme Court on Wednesday as the justices 
struggled to decide whether to uphold a New York state law carving out a school 
district for a Hasidic Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
 The case (Kiryas Joel Village School District vs. Grumet, 93-517) has drawn 
wide attention because it could persuade the high court to blur the line 
separating church and state. Critics of the law claim that a ruling in favor of 
the Hasidim could foster "religious apartheid" in the United States as 
different sects press for separate public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the hourlong argument, the justices sounded as though they wanted 
to avoid a broad pronouncement in either direction. Instead, they concentrated 
on narrow, factual questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer representing the Hasidim argued that the special school district 
should be upheld because the Constitution envisions a "spirit of accommodation" 
among competing religions. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board in the village "operates a wholly secular public school," 
with no religious teaching, said the attorney, Nathan Lewin, a prominent 
Washington lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The separate school district is needed, Lewin said, because Hasidic Jews, who 
speak Yiddish, would not send their children to regular classrooms with 
non-Hasidic children. 
</P>
<P>
 But a lawyer for the New York State School Board Assn. contended that the 
special school district unconstitutionally favors a religious sect. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the law "was to create segregation along religious lines," said 
attorney Jay Worona of Slingerlands, N.Y. "It will politically fragment this 
nation . . . if the government can separate people based on religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the New York Court of Appeals agreed with the critics and ruled 
that the 1989 law that set up the separate district was unconstitutional. The 
law favors the wishes of one religious sect and creates a "symbolic union" 
between church and state, the state judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Antonin Scalia disputed 
that view. They questioned why it would be unconstitutional for a Mormon 
community in Utah or an all-Catholic neighborhood in a major city to have its 
own public school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me you're saying that, because all the (Hasidim) live together, 
they can't exercise the ordinary secular authority" to run a public school 
system, Rehnquist told the lawyer challenging the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the Hasidim benefited from a 
"special law" enacted just for them. "This isn't neutral, broadly based law. It 
is limited to one situation," she said, suggesting governmental favoritism for 
a sect.

CLUES WARN OF MASSIVE QUAKE IN NORTHWEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another strong clue that the Northwest is due for a massive earthquake has 
been found in highway surveys and changes in tidal patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent measurements from the different sources makes the evidence 
especially strong that the region is facing a major jolt, according to a team 
of Oregon researchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of other choices than a big earthquake," said Clifton E. 
Mitchell, the co-author of a University of Oregon study to be published in the 
Journal of Geophysical Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Several leading geologists praised the report, the first major study of its 
kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took these guys about four to five years to knock all the bugs out of it. 
Most of us feel pretty confident it's reliable work," said Robert Yeats, an 
Oregon State University geologist who has done extensive studies on the 
region's earthquake potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeats said there is little doubt among scientists that the Northwest is due 
for a giant quake.

ROADWAY PLANS TAKE HARSH TOLL ON SAN JUAN MONTESSORI SCHOOL; TRAFFIC: 
ENROLLMENT SUFFERS FROM THREAT OF CLOSURE TO MAKE WAY FOR THE SAN JOAQUIN HILLS 
TRANSPORTATION CORRIDOR.

 When Qudsia Roston opened her Montessori school here 22 years ago, she planned 
to never leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, Roston, her students, and the resident horse, rabbit and bird may be 
forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
 The school on Rancho Viejo Road that for so long has been trafficked by 
children must make way for cars -- actually, a toll road called the San Joaquin 
Hills Transportation Corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part, and possibly all, of the Roston Montessori School is expected 
to be closed by June so the roadway can be raised 25 feet for the toll road's 
construction. Expected to cost $793 million, the six-lane thoroughfare will be 
as wide as 14 lanes where it links Corona del Mar Freeway to Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is one of 10 properties on Rancho Viejo Road that the 
transportation corridor agency seeks to buy under its powers of eminent domain, 
according to agency spokeswoman Lisa Telles. 
</P>
<P>
 Roston, 58, a feisty woman who was born in India, sadly awaits the fate of the 
school that has been such a big part of her life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being dead and people talking about you," she said. "It's very hard 
to plan. I'm in a real predicament." 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a time for reflections and memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Roston came to the United States when she was 22, after getting a master's 
degree in education through a scholarship to Boston College. First she worked 
as a teacher, and later opened the Montessori school. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking around the school, she lamented the likelihood of having to leave. 
"It's like cutting off an arm," she said. "I never really thought it would 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 She has always taken pride in the Montessori system, which stresses not just 
the three R's, but also the belief that students are limited only by their 
environment, and when surrounded by learning tools and activities, think they 
are playing when they are actually learning, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school became so popular that Roston has since opened three others in 
Orange County. In 1990 and 1991, she had to turn away 100 children from the San 
Juan Capistrano schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, she spent $264,000 to build an extra room behind the main 
school for 60 or 70 more students. 
</P>
<P>
 But when local people heard that the school was in the toll road's path, 
enrollment plummeted and key staff people left to start their own schools, 
Roston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now enrollment at the school here is down to 60 from a norm of 160-200 
children, she said, and the newer building on a grassy hill is locked and 
empty. 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, as soon as that annex was finished, she learned that 
the toll road was planned. "If I knew I was going to be wiped out, I would not 
have built," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roston is not the only property owner upset by the tollway project, which 
transportation officials say is much needed to help relieve traffic brought by 
growth in South Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Save Our San Juan, a 100-person grass-roots community 
group, has fought the plan, claiming it will destroy the tranquillity of rural 
neighborhoods. Many members spoke out against it at a City Council meeting last 
week and others have protested that the toll road will destroy the habitat of 
wildlife living there.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency is eyeing Roston's and other properties on Rancho Viejo Road, but 
officials don't know when purchase agreements will be completed. Most of the 
property along the route for the 15-mile toll road has been set aside for 
construction, but few of the parcels are privately owned or have businesses on 
them, like Roston's school, Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roston said she was given maps three years ago from county officials that 
showed her school was not going to be affected. "Apparently in the last several 
years they changed their plans and kept me in the dark," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Telles said, project designs were not complete then. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew where the road was going to go, but we didn't know how far back we 
had to go," Telles said. "But now the project is more refined and we know what 
the impacts will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation officials say they want to be fair to property owners caught in 
the way of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is for us to be able to build our project, but also so that the 
school can work something out so they can continue their tradition," said 
Telles. "We will work to try to make a deal that's fair for both sides. Our job 
is not to ruin businesses, it's to help a traffic problem that's regional." 
</P>
<P>
 She added her agency will help businesses relocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Roston hopes she might be able to hang on by shifting the school's operations 
to the new building and adding portable classrooms. But she does not know 
whether parking, a sewage system or access from the street can be arranged, or 
if construction from the highway will detract from education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want children to know we will still provide service," she said. "I don't 
want people to say Roston's dead and buried."

ONLY SCRUPLES STOP HOUSEKEEPER FROM CLEANING UP; HONESTY: EMPLOYEE NEVER

 Maria Jimenez has found everything from jackets to shoes to tennis racquets 
left behind by residents of the rooms she cleans at the Newport Beach Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday, the 23-year-old part-time housekeeper found something that 
couldn't simply be dropped off at the hotel's lost and found desk: a collection 
of rare jewels valued by their owner at about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that came to my mind was that they were worth a lot of 
money," the shy Jimenez said in Spanish Wednesday. "It was beautiful jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez said she never considered doing anything but turning in the diamond, 
jade and 18-carat gold jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought about getting a reward or anything," she said. "I just did it 
because that's what my instinct was." 
</P>
<P>
 The jewels belonged to 56-year-old Shirley Rich Wagner, who said Wednesday 
that she was certain she would never see them again. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, who stayed at the Newport Marriott during a brief vacation last 
weekend, checked out of the hotel Monday night and unwittingly left behind 
several diamond rings, diamond and jade earrings, a diamond necklace, and 
18-carat gold brooch with emeralds, sapphires and rubies, a diamond bracelet 
and several gold chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner said Wednesday that she was carrying the gems in a jewelry bag because 
several homes in her Bel-Air neighborhood had been damaged March 20 in a severe 
aftershock to the Northridge earthquake. Wagner said she didn't want to lose 
the valuables in her home in the event that a major temblor struck again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to leave it in the house so I took it with me," Wagner said. 
"We were just going to dinner, so rather than put them in a safety deposit box, 
I just stuck them behind the drapes and forgot all about it." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Wagner returned home Monday night that she realized the jewels 
were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was at home unpacking and I just got frantic," she said. "I knew my jewelry 
was gone. It had to be. I thought there was no chance of anybody turning in 
that kind of jewelry." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner immediately called the hotel and was astonished and relieved to learn 
that the jewels were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very lucky and appreciative," Wagner said. "Here's this person who 
probably doesn't have that much money anyway and could have just as easily said 
that she didn't find anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner is planning to return to the hotel Saturday to present Jimenez, a 
resident of Garden Grove, with a reward of at least $400, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to present her with a check and with a big kiss on the cheek," 
Wagner said. Jimenez, who is studying to become a medical assistant, earns 
$6.20 an hour as a hotel housekeeper and works 20 to 30 hours a week at the 
Marriott. She volunteers two nights a week at the Orange County Health Care 
Agency's Maternal Health Clinic in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez, who discovered the jewels when she swept aside the drapes to clean an 
air conditioner, contacted her supervisor to ask him to come up to the room. 
When he didn't answer, she picked up the jewels and nervously brought them 
downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," said Jimenez, who has worked at the hotel for five years. 
"It's really something finding jewels like that." 
</P>
<P>
 As a tribute to Jimenez's honesty, she has been selected as the Marriott's 
employee of the month, said hotel spokesman Gregg Smith. A letter of 
commendation will also be added to her personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone at the hotel is very proud of her," Smith said.

YEAR OF BRAVERY, TRAGEDY; SHERIFF'S DEPT. HONORS OFFICERS, SLAIN DEPUTY 
</P>

 It was a day to honor acts of valor, courage, merit and lifesaving by deputies 
and employees at the Orange County Sheriff's Department. Wednesday also was a 
day to honor a lost colleague who would be remembered for his love of life, 
community and especially children. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a standing ovation of about 500 people, Sheriff Brad Gates presented a 
memorial medal to the widow of Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins, a seven-year veteran 
who was shot and killed by a fellow officer on Christmas Day during an 
impromptu training exercise behind a Lake Forest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-ever memorial medal marked an emotional moment for many in 
attendance, who recalled the 30-year-old deputy's love of helping 
schoolchildren resist drugs and gang involvement. He was known to hundreds of 
children as Deputy "Rappin" Robins for his frequent rap presentation of 
"Officer Friendly" at Lake Forest elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a positive role model for those kids," Gates said. "Darryn dedicated 
his career to his community, and to the children within it." 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, Rosemary Robins smiled proudly as she held the framed 
medal for photographers. She declined to talk about her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial medal came as part of the sixth annual Sheriff's Advisory Council 
Medal of Valor Luncheon at the Westin South Coast Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa. 
The sheriff, assisted by actor Joseph Campanella, presented awards to 14 
deputies and employees for outstanding acts above the usual call of duty in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The top medal of valor went to deputies Harry Watson, 39; Stephan Shandrick, 
34; and William Siegrist, 33, who were fired upon by an armed bank robber after 
a high-speed pursuit last June that ended on a road in semirural San Juan 
Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies had been chasing the suspect from Laguna Hills, where the robbery 
had occurred, when the man suddenly pulled off Interstate 5 and opened fire as 
the three deputies pulled up in their vehicles. The gunman was killed in a hail 
of gunfire as the deputies scrambled for cover. The deputies escaped injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The medal of courage was awarded to five deputies for their roles in three 
dangerous situations: Jerrald Van Wyke II, 29, for saving his wife and 
bystanders from a suspected carjacker; Arthur Heise, 36, for risking his life 
in preventing a jail riot by stepping between two fighting groups in the chow 
hall; and Michael Toledo, 31, Thomas Lucas, 31, and Linda Bertagna, 34, for 
their work in catching suspected bank robbers who had opened fire at them 
during an attempted getaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The medal of merit was presented to Eva Steinberger, a senior criminalist, for 
her laboratory work involving DNA evidence testing. Techniques she helped 
develop recently helped investigators make an arrest in the slayings of a 
Mission Viejo woman and her infant. A bite mark on the victim's arm yielded DNA 
evidence that led investigators to the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Medals for lifesaving acts were presented to Deputy Mark McCann, 32, who 
revived a jail inmate who had stopped breathing; Sgt. Clyde Walsh, 52, who 
revived a 5-month-old Laguna Hills baby; Reserve Deputy Don Hanson, 43, who, 
along with his bloodhound, found a missing elderly man suffering from 
Alzheimer's disease; Reserve Deputy Bradley Howard, 35, who talked a man out of 
killing himself by jumping off a freeway bridge; and Deputy Jim Pena, 36, who 
helped save a Villa Park family from wildfire in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Bertagna, echoing the sentiments of other medalists, said the ceremony 
was the "highlight of my career." 
</P>
<P>
 She said having "everyone here together" to honor Robins made the ceremony 
extra special. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribute to Robins was the first presentation of the day and brought a roar 
of applause from the audience, which included mayors, city officials and 
business leaders from throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the strangest incidents in the history of the Sheriff's Department, 
authorities have said that veteran Deputy Brian P. Scanlan accidentally shot 
Robins in the head with his service pistol as they were re-enacting a traffic 
stop behind a Lake Forest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury recently declined to indict Scanlan in the 
shooting. Prosecutors had recommended that Scanlan be charged with a count of 
involuntary manslaughter because of gross negligence. Scanlan's 9-millimeter 
handgun was loaded despite regulations requiring only unloaded weapons be used 
for training purposes, authorities said.

CONDOM NATION; CONTROVERSY DRAWS SAFE-SEX ACTIVISTS TO HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
 An AIDS activist group handed out 3,000 bright yellow condoms to arriving 
Hoover High School students Wednesday to protest school officials' cancellation 
of a play about safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters from the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power -- ACT UP -- handed 
out neon yellow and green stickers reading "Safe sex is hot sex" to students, 
many of whom asked for extras to stick on their lockers and give to friends. 
The demonstrators gave advice on condom use to teen-agers as they escorted them 
up school steps in the glare of television lights. 
</P>
<P>
 ACT UP member Maureen Perry told the students that her young daughter's 
father, who died of acquired immune deficiency syndrome two years ago at the 
age of 30, would still be alive today had he learned safe-sex procedures in 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was protesting Glendale Unified School District Supt. Robert 
Sanchis' cancellation of a production of "Secrets" last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, produced by health care giant Kaiser Permanente with a traveling 
troupe of actors, has been shown to more than 700,000 high school students 
statewide over the past eight years. It is scheduled to be produced at Burbank 
High School on April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the play -- which urges the use of condoms as a 
safeguard against disease -- clashed with district policy, which urges students 
to abstain from sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration was peaceful, with students clad in shorts and ties handing 
out neon anti-condom flyers next to ACT UP activists sporting combat boots, 
punk haircuts and nose rings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Clay Whiteley, who said he plans to wait until he is married to have 
sex, tried to explain to his peers the dangers of condoms as he passed out a 
flyer "dispelling the myths" of safe sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The human immunodeficiency virus, which is believed to cause AIDS, is so small 
that it can penetrate condoms, he said, passing out literature making that 
argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover High gym teacher Judy Thomsen, who coaches Whiteley's volleyball team, 
joined students in handing out the anti-condom flyers. "We should give these 
kids a little more credit -- they have the willpower to say no," Thomsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students offered mixed reviews of the demonstration. Some appeared annoyed by 
the commotion, while others gossiped with activists about their parents' sexual 
mores. 
</P>
<P>
 Many appeared uninterested in the play's cancellation but several students 
called for the Board of Education to loosen its sex education policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget abstinence. People in this school are getting pregnant," said senior 
Kelly Simmons, who wore a temporary tattoo of a red ribbon, the international 
symbol of the battle against AIDS, on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report by Jim Gibson, the district's administrator of secondary 
education, the district has 33 pregnant students and 43 teen-age parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the play's cancellation prompted the district to draft 
sex education guidelines that were accepted by the Board of Education this 
week, setting up a review panel but continuing to urge that teen-agers refrain 
from sex until marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 But board Vice President Sharon Beauchamp said the play would still not be 
approved under the new guidelines because it violates the district's 
pro-abstinence policy.

3 CHILD WELFARE AGENCY OFFICIALS TO REPAY $41,600; LOS ANGELES: THE SETTLEMENT 
WITH THE CHILDREN'S HOME SOCIETY ENDS A YEARLONG INVESTIGATION INTO THE 
AGENCY'S SPENDING PRACTICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Top officials of California's oldest private children's welfare agency have 
agreed to repay the organization $41,600 for pricey restaurant meals, hotel 
charges and attorneys fees, the state attorney general's office announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, James T. Spradley Jr. and two top aides of the Children's 
Home Society (CHS) will repay the expenses without admitting guilt or losing 
their leadership posts at the century-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based agency, which provides foster care and adoption 
services, has 19 offices statewide, about 300 employees, a $16-million annual 
budget and a clientele of about 10,000 needy children. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement marks the end of the state's one-year investigation into 
reports by The Times that CHS officials engaged in questionable spending 
practices, including parties and meals for the staff at expensive restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Richard Simmons, who represents the agency, said its 21-member board 
continues to have complete confidence in Spradley, crediting him with the 
agency's enormous success since he took over in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in late 1992 that an internal audit of CHS found that 
Spradley and three aides spent $303,000 on meals, entertainment, travel and 
other expenses during a four-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley, who approved his own expense accounts, spent more than $155,000 for 
expenses, including the purchase of personal items ranging from tuxedo shoes to 
tennis balls and luggage, the audit found. 
</P>
<P>
 On 100 occasions, auditors said, he spent at least $100 on CHS staff and 
executives. This included a $483 tab at the Fleur de Lys restaurant in San 
Francisco for a staff party. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. James Cordi said in an interview Wednesday that Spradley has 
agreed to repay the organization $15,247. Most of the amount, he said, 
represents restaurant bills, but it also includes about $2,000 in hotel charges 
in Los Angeles, where CHS already was renting an apartment for Spradley. 
</P>
<P>
 The expenses were incurred between 1988 and 1992, Cordi said. He declined to 
detail all the expenses covered by the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley's top aides, Anelia Nunez-Wells and Katherine Neworth, will repay 
meal charges of $3,461 and $1,667, respectively, Cordi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three people also pledged to repay a portion of CHS's legal fees incurred 
as a result of the attorney general's investigation, or $21,252. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley declined to comment, saying that the CHS board has directed him and 
his staff to refer all calls to Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Spradley is paid $244,000 a year in salary and benefits, up from $184,000 in 
1991 and $92,000 in 1988, records show. In reviewing his compensation, the 
attorney general's office concluded it was not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Spradley's tenure, records show that by 1991 the agency bolstered its 
financial reserves from $3.8 million to $13 million and reduced its debt from 
$2.4 million to nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1991, the agency cut back its program services from $16.6 
million to $13.3 million. And a staff of 700 employees was trimmed to 300. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's funding comes from public service contracts, foundation grants, 
corporate gifts and individual donations. The backbone of the organization has 
been its statewide network of auxiliaries and thousands of volunteers who raise 
more than $1.5 million a year for CHS through bake sales, road races and other 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 After reports of the agency's spending in December, 1992, CHS sued its former 
controller, Mike Love, alleging that he breached his fiduciary trust by 
obtaining and disseminating "confidential financial and proprietary 
information" belonging to CHS. The suit was recently dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 At least half a dozen of the CHS's 147 auxiliaries called for Spradley's 
resignation or said they planned to withhold money from the group or suspend 
fund-raising events. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, three board members resigned after expressing concerns about Spradley 
and the board's handling of allegations against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons acknowledged some ordinary turnover among board members whose terms 
had expired but said that nobody resigned because of the Spradley allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, he said, "is obviously pleased to put this matter behind it."

IRVINE KILLING SUSPECT HELD IN MONTANA; CRIME: MAN ARRESTED IN A PROMINENT

<P>
 A ranch hand suspected of killing one of the nation's most prominent cattle 
ranchers in Montana this week is also wanted in the 1986 slaying of a 
26-year-old man in Irvine, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Llamas, 32, of Corona was arrested in Hobson, Mont., after Tuesday's 
discovery of the body of Wayne Stevenson, 51, a leading cattleman in that 
state, said Jim Hubble, a Judith Basin County attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police said they were ecstatic at the news of Llamas' arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We presented enough evidence for his arrest for murder (in 1986) and haven't 
been able to locate him. Obviously, this is very helpful for us. Now . . . we 
can bring him back and hold him accountable for this murder," said Irvine 
Police Lt. Sam Allevato.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police say Llamas killed Ramon Anguiano when he lost his job and could 
not pay Llamas' $700 fee for smuggling his wife and children into the United 
States from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Anguiano had promised to pay as soon as he found work, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was shot to death a few days later. His body was discovered dumped on 
Bonita Canyon Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police obtained a $250,000 warrant for Llamas' arrest, but he fled. He 
was seen in Boise, Ida., but later vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montana, the 5-foot-2-inch Llamas apparently went to work six months ago 
for Stevenson, the patriarch of a cattle-raising family that includes his 
brother Keith and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson was last seen Sunday evening on his way to feed cattle, according to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of Stevenson's death is unknown, said Judith Basin County Sheriff 
Steve Knetch. But authorities investigating the case discovered that a murder 
warrant had been issued years ago for Llamas in Orange County. He was arrested 
and held in lieu of $250,000 bail on that warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say he is one of the suspects" in Stevenson's death as well, 
Knetch said. Still, he said, other people also are under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubble said Llamas refused to waive his extradition rights, so the state of 
California must start legal proceedings to extradite him. He said it will 
probably take about 30 days to complete the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Hubble said, however, that if authorities do tie Llamas to Stevenson's death, 
California is going to have a tough time getting him back. Irvine Police Lt. 
Pete Linton, who has been in charge of the Anguiano case from the beginning, 
acknowledged as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to wait to see what happens," Linton said. "If they get 
their case filed and charge him with this murder prior to extradition, then we 
will have to stand back and wait." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stevensons are among the leading Black Angus breeders in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 The death of Wayne Stevenson "will send shock waves through the industry," 
said Bob Cook, a spokesman for the Public Auction Yards in Billings, Mont. The 
Stevensons run what "is the biggest Angus cow-calf operation in America."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; EXCHANGE RATE THAT PAYS DOUBLE

 Fountain Valley High School students want to change the stereotypes their 
German peers hold about teen-age Americans. After all, not everyone in this 
country likes Michael Jackson's music or is a couch potato. 
</P>
<P>
 And 12 German students visiting here want their new American friends to 
realize they don't always eat sauerkraut and wear lederhosen in their hometown, 
Bad Nauheim, 6,000 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Building cultural understanding is most important," said 17-year-old Eike 
Hahlbohm, who added that he wants to dispel those two stereotypes about 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the German students -- who wear jeans and T-shirts -- came to 
Fountain Valley last week for a monthlong stay, it's been a mutual exchange of 
information about cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how much they like American music, though they don't 
always understand what it means," said Amy Kleckner, 16, who is host of a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brent Wagner, 18, said he's enjoyed playing host to a student so he can 
show what teens do for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "There they go to discos and pubs," he said, adding that the students "think 
politically" and enjoy discussing philosophy and religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the arrival of the 11th- and 12th-grade German students from their 
school, Ernst-Ludwig-Schule, their U.S. hosts and hostesses have given them a 
taste of hot dogs, tacos and burritos, taken them to the beach and Palm 
Springs, and taught them American slang. 
</P>
<P>
 The German students visited City Hall on Tuesday, and they plan to go to 
Hollywood today. On spring break next week, they'll be going with their host 
families to San Diego, Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon and the Colorado River. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's German teacher, Guido Reinhard, has organized the exchange 
program every other year since 1984. Teen-agers from his hometown of Bad 
Nauheim, near Frankfurt, come to Fountain Valley to stay with his students and 
their families.  
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Reinhard takes his students to Germany to experience life there as 
guests of the German students. Reinhard, who has taught at Fountain Valley High 
since 1967, is planning to take five of his students to his homeland in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhard said the program has developed invaluable cultural understanding 
among students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a travel program, it's an educational program," Reinhard said, 
adding it's also been a "lasting program" because of the friendships made. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ulrich, who teaches English in Germany and who accompanied the students 
here, said that while they gain a sense of the American way of life, it is more 
important that "they get the optimism that exists here." 
</P>
<P>
 "People here have a different attitude than back home," he said. "And, it's 
just more fun here." 
</P>
<P>
 The German students, who presented their city's flag to the high school, 
agreed that they're having a good time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are much more open, you can make friends easier," said 18-year-old 
Judith Wedel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedel also said she is overwhelmed by the size of things in Orange County. Her 
hometown of 27,000 people is half as large as Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is bigger -- the schools, the streets, the cars, the houses, the 
distances." 
</P>
<P>
 Matthias Zerb,17, said his English has improved and he has enjoyed the variety 
of ethnic foods available. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did notice one difference in Americans' eating habits: "We don't eat as 
much fast food," he said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; CITY STAFF BACKS BID BY O'NEILL, 
PARTNER 
</P>

<P>
 A city staff report issued this week recommends that the City Council sell a 
key downtown commercial complex to South County rancher Richard J. O'Neill and 
his partner, Stephen A. Nordeck, for $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, which will be discussed during a public hearing at City Hall on 
Tuesday, indicates that O'Neill and Nordeck have agreed to make $686,550 in 
improvements to the block-long complex. It is located at the intersection of 
Camino Capistrano and Ortega Highway, directly across the street from historic 
Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed agreement between the city and the developers, called San Juan 
Partners, will be reviewed by the council April 19. Based on earlier votes, the 
council is expected to approve the sale Tuesday and the development agreement 
two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to look out for what's best for the city, taking into 
consideration other local projects," Councilman Jeff Vasquez said Wednesday. 
"The O'Neill family has invested quite a bit into the city, particularly at the 
El Adobe restaurant. They have made a lot of upgrades to it, but still 
preserved its ambience . . . which is the kind of gradual development we want 
to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the Community Redevelopment Agency, which owns the complex, the 
council on Jan. 18 directed the city staff to enter into exclusive negotiations 
with O'Neill and Nordeck. Nordeck, a former mayor of Manhattan Beach and former 
county planning commissioner, is part owner of the well-known Swallows Inn, 
half a block away from the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote for O'Neill and Nordeck was close, however, at 3 to 2, with Mayor 
Collene Campbell and Councilwoman Carolyn Nash opting for the second-place 
bidders, Riverside Community Investors. The RCI group has continued to lobby 
intensely for the bid, Vasquez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we have ever been lobbied as strongly about anything," Vasquez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex houses the Cafe Capistrano and the El Peon, among other small 
businesses.LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CANDIDATE SAYS JOBS KEY TO CUTTING CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Standing in front of an abandoned warehouse, Republican Assembly candidate Jim 
Morrissey on Wednesday touted his credentials as a small business owner and 
said that creating jobs is the best way to stop the rise in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey, one of four Republicans hoping to capture the 69th Assembly 
District seat -- held by Orange County's only Democratic legislator -- was 
accompanied by state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) and Assemblyman Mickey 
Conroy (R-Orange). 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt and Conroy had clashed recently over endorsements in the contentious 
70th Assembly District race. But in backing Morrissey they said they were 
joining forces "for the good of the party" and because they believe Morrissey's 
business background makes him the most electable Republican in a district in 
which Democratic voters outnumber Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtt said he commissioned a poll about three months ago -- before the 
candidates were known -- to find out what kind of candidate would appeal to 
voters in the 69th District, which includes parts of Anaheim, Santa Ana and 
Garden Grove. Morrissey, he said, "fits the district perfectly," compared to 
another leading Republican candidate in the race, attorney Martin Ageson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ageson "is going to suffer a minus 20 points, according to our survey, because 
he's moved (into the district) and he's an attorney," Hurtt said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ageson said in a later interview that he has done a better job than 
Morrissey of raising campaign funds, an indication that he has widespread 
community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance statements filed last week for the period ending March 17 
showed Morrissey with a cash balance of about $2,000 more than Ageson. 
Morrissey, however, boosted his campaign coffers by lending himself $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poll was taken before I was in the race," Ageson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Also vying for the nomination are Santa Ana resident Judy Buffin-Edge and 
businessman Virgel L. Nickell, who also ran two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Also endorsing Morrissey on Wednesday was Jo Ellen Allen, the 1992 Republican 
nominee in the 69th District, who lost in the general election to Democrat Tom 
Umberg of Garden Grove. Umberg is leaving to run for state attorney general.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; A FEATHERED FRIEND BURIED AFTER ACCIDENT

<P>
 They buried Millie the duck Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine neighbors and their friends gathered in Kathryn (Aria) Jaeger's front 
yard, on Moorpark Street near La Maida Street, to bury the mallard and reflect 
on ways they can better protect their animal friends. Beverly Stallings, who 
found Millie, sprinkled dried flowers atop her body before it was interred. 
Michael Jaeger, Aria's husband, planted an almond tree to mark the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ask that you take back the spirit of Millie," Aria Jaeger prayed. "We will 
do better next time." 
</P>
<P>
 The mallard was the latest apparent victim of cars that zip down Moorpark, a 
residential street used by motorists to bypass Ventura Boulevard between Balboa 
Boulevard and Petit Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Mallard ducks have appeared on that stretch of Moorpark every spring for the 
past five years, according to Jaeger's neighbor, Marian Spagnola, who has lived 
in the neighborhood for 44 years. Between March and May, the ducks -- which are 
probably year-round residents at nearby Los Encinos State Historic Park -- 
breed, hatch eggs and tend their young before moving on. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have grown fond of their feathered friends, and have taken to 
setting out pans of food and water.  
</P>
<P>
 But animal control officials say the neighbors' heightened sense of concern 
may actually be putting them and the ducks in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is causing the ducks to stay in an "unnatural" environment, creating 
a danger of being hit by cars or preyed upon by cats, said Michael E. Burns, a 
district supervisor with the Los Angeles Department of Animal Regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ducks are better off going to Lake Balboa or the wild fowl preserve in the 
Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, both nearby, Burns said. He is also worried that 
people who chase birds out of the street could get hit by cars themselves. KAY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; GANGS DOWNPLAYED IN STUDENT SURVEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An overwhelming majority of Burbank students in the sixth through 12th grades 
said they do not feel personally threatened by gangs, while 49% said there is a 
gang problem in Burbank, according to an unprecedented survey of the city's 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first effort to reach so many students and probably the most 
comprehensive to date," said Mary Alvord, director of the Burbank Parks and 
Recreation Department, which polled students about crime and safety, city 
services and programs, as well as schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey of 4,000 Burbank students at 11 public and private schools was 
conducted last fall during question-and-answer sessions by city officials who 
visited individual campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The results, tabulated by a group of high-school students hired by the city, 
were presented to a joint meeting of the Burbank City Council and the Burbank 
Board of Education last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that while nearly half of the students think the city has a 
gang problem, 68% said gangs are not a problem on school campuses. A whopping 
80% said they do not feel personally threatened by gangs. Also, 72% said they 
feel safe in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is being used by the city to consider the kinds of youth services 
and programs needed in Burbank. It was prompted by a meeting of all youth 
agencies in Burbank last spring in which officials decided that they did not 
know enough about what youths want. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there were some real clear signals that although we offer a lot of 
programs and services, I don't think the word is getting to the city youth, 
especially at the high school level," Alvord said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students also said they wish a public library would be open on Sundays; that 
they need to find more jobs, and that most would use a teen center that would 
offer recreation as well as tutoring, counseling and comprehensive services. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found: 
</P>
<P>
 * 67% of students 16 and older were unemployed, and 37% said they were jobless 
because they could not find work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 67% of students ages 11 to 14 said there are enough activities for youths; 
48% of those 14 to 18 agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 64% of those ages 11 to 14 said they would use a teen center, while 67% of 
those 14 to 18 said they would. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council may use the survey to help set goals for the 1994-95 fiscal 
year, Alvord said. ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; MEETINGS TO ADDRESS HIKE IN WATER BILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents concerned about the proposed 6% water rate increase may address city 
officials at two public meetings in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rate increase would raise the average bimonthly residential water 
bill from $42.30 to $44.84, and would be used for water main repairs in the 
downtown area and to replenish cash reserves in case of drought, fire and other 
emergencies, water systems engineer Larry Sears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public outcry over the proposed hike during a February City Council meeting 
prompted the council to arrange for additional public meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 During the February meeting, consultant William Ferry of Brown & Caldwell also 
recommended that the council adopt two additional water-rate increases during 
the next two years that would boost the total water rate by 19%. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases are meant to raise $3 million for cash reserves. Without them, 
Ferry predicted, the city's current $2.75-million reserve will be depleted by 
late 1995. The city's total water budget, not including a reserve, is $14.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have an earthquake and it's depleted, then where do we get the money?" 
Sears said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the proposed water rate increase have suggested that the city 
trim its budget instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The public meetings are scheduled for April 28 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. and May 
19 from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Fullerton Senior Multi-Service Center at 340 West 
Commonwealth Ave.MARY LOU PICKEL

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY WAIVES $9,000 FEE FOR FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Permit fees of about $9,000 for an environmental fund-raising event have been 
waived by the city of Burbank over the objections of a conservative councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bob Bowne said the waivers amount to a de facto contribution to 
Earthwalk, a march sponsored by an organization of employees from several 
Hollywood studios. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one does not support some of these organizations, you're subjected to 
criticism," said Bowne, who was on the losing side of a 3-2 vote to approve a 
fee waiver for Earthwalk. "But that's OK. I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The walk, to be held April 17, will begin at Universal Studios and proceed to 
Warner Bros., NBC and Walt Disney Studios in Burbank. Comedian Jay Leno is 
slated to host the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor George Battey Jr. also voted against the waiver. But supporters said 
that the event will be good for the city's image and that their action supports 
the entertainment industry so critical to the city. Funds raised by the event 
will go to the American Red Cross earthquake relief fund and the Salvation 
Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit fees would have covered the city's costs for the walk, including 
police, traffic and crowd control, street barricades and cones. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds raised in the event will also go to a variety of environmental 
organizations, including American Oceans Campaign, the Center for Environmental 
Education, Heal the Bay, the National Resources Defense Council and TreePeople.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; BLACK LAWYERS SEE NEW OPPORTUNITIES

<P>
 African Americans have climbed to the upper reaches of the sports and 
entertainment worlds, but few are entering the legal profession to represent 
high-priced celebrities, according to a professional organization of black 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges of breaking into the sports and entertainment fields of law 
will be one of the issues raised during a summit for black attorneys and law 
students to be held in Burbank on April 9.Up for discussion will be why the 
number of black lawyers representing black celebrities is so low at a time when 
some say the opportunity to represent African American star clients is so 
great. Also to be addressed is what the term free agency means for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope is that we can get vital information to lawyers in the industry . . 
. and give more students an idea of what's happening," said Gary Watson, an 
attorney for Motown Records and this year's conference chairman for the Black 
Entertainment and Sports Lawyers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there are opportunities, but we'd like to see more," he said. "That's 
one of the major points of our organization." 
</P>
<P>
 When the nonprofit group convenes next week, Watson said, the most important 
topics will include future opportunities in a multimedia society and factors in 
choosing legal representation. 
</P>

 African Americans make up just 1% of lawyers nationwide, according to the 
American Bar Assn., and number even fewer in the entertainment and sports 
fields.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; OFFICIALS CHEERED BY HINTS OF RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Agoura Hills officials faced with the gloomiest economic outlook in city 
history are hoping that a spurt of interest by developers and the first 
construction in two years signal better times ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Grading for a furniture store at Roadside Drive and Cornell Road began this 
week, and final plans for a new office building and several remodeling projects 
are in the works, said David Anderson, Agoura Hills director of planning. The 
last construction project in town, he said, was a small office building about 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Several developers have also approached the city with "more than just 
curiosity" about building restaurants, a driving range and a church in the near 
future, although no plans have been submitted, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be some momentum gaining," Anderson said. "People are starting 
to come in, and these projects coming on line at the same time are something of 
a bright spot in our otherwise recession-ridden economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The surge in developer boldness underscores a UCLA report released Wednesday 
declaring that an economic recovery has begun in California, which has been in 
its worst financial slump in six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 It also comes as Agoura Hills confronts its steepest budget shortfall -- $1 
million -- since it incorporated 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially struggling cities are often eager for new development, which 
brings property tax revenues, a sales tax boost created by new jobs, and 
various fees for city services and road work. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeds & Son Furniture plans to open its 30,000-square-foot store in Agoura 
Hills in January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on a 13,666-square-foot medical office building on Palo Comado Canyon 
Road north of Agoura Road could begin within several months, Anderson said, as 
could the expansion of the Twin Oaks shopping center at Thousand Oaks Boulevard 
and Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of a 69-unit subdivision on Agoura Road between Palo Comado 
Canyon Road and Liberty Canyon Road is also expected to get under way soon, 
Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mini-boom won't solve all the city's financial woes right away, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of many long-term solutions," Councilwoman Fran Pavley said. "We 
still have a few years gap between this and the revenues flowing in. And 
there's still the big question mark of the state budget after the June 
primaries. Last year, they took from local budgets, and they may do so again."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; LETTERS HOPE TO TAKE BITE OUT OF CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These letters could spell trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sepulveda Boulevard Business Watch will soon send "citizen complaint" 
letters to Van Nuys merchants in an effort to clean up prostitution, drug 
dealing, graffiti and other crime near their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Flip Smith, president of the 75-member business watch, said the letters will 
begin going out next month to Sepulveda Boulevard businesses and are intended 
to bring community and business crime-fighting efforts closer together. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of the community working with businesses to help businesses out," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will alert Smith to businesses that seem plagued by criminal 
activity, then Smith will send the merchants a form letter informing them of 
the problems surrounding their location. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter also advises merchants on tactics to deal with crime, such as 
increasing security, improving lighting and joining the business watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the merchants may simply be unaware of the severity of the crime 
problems or just need a simple reminder that the community is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, businesses along the crime-plagued Sepulveda corridor have 
come under increasing fire for prostitution or other illegal activities that 
swarm around their locations. City zoning officials have ordered six motels to 
increase security or risk closure, and a doughnut shop and coin laundry are 
also being investigated for possible sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter-writing effort was praised by Romana Catton, a Neighborhood Watch 
activist who has encouraged businesses to clean up crime in their area. She 
said the new effort is a friendly form of peer pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a wonderful idea," Catton said. "It comes from their peers. And 
I hope the business owners take the letters seriously and listen to the needs 
of the residents, because we are their client base." JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHEAST VALLEY; ALCOHOL AWARENESS TOPIC OF CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifteen students could see their artwork plastered on billboards throughout 
the Northeast Valley as part of an anti-drinking campaign sponsored by the 
Pacoima and San Fernando Alcohol Coalitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at public schools in San Fernando, Sylmar and Pacoima, along with 
students at Los Angeles Mission College, have been asked to contribute artwork 
depicting the theme "Alcohol is a Drug" for a contest to be judged next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning entries will be posted on billboards in the three communities this 
summer. Deadline for entries is April 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima, San Fernando and Sylmar are saturated with billboards advertising 
alcohol, with many specifically targeting youth, said Xavier Flores of Pueblo Y 
Salud, a San Fernando-based alcohol-awareness group.  
</P>
<P>
 Flores said the contest is an opportunity to provide an alternative message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are often bombarded with mixed messages regarding alcohol 
consumption," he said. "While one message is given in the schools, another 
message is given in our communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Entries will be judged for elementary, middle and high school as well as 
college categories. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having their work posted on billboards, winners will receive up 
to $300.  
</P>
<P>
 Special certificates will be given to all who participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding is being sought from public and private agencies, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalitions include the Pacoima Coordinating Council, San Fernando 
Coordinating Council, San Fernando Gardens Tenants Assn. Pueblo Y Salud Inc., 
San Fernando Valley Partnership, Friday Night Live and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging for the contest by area residents, the announcement of finalists and a 
recognition ceremony for the winners will all take place in May. MIGUEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; MEALS ON WHEELS PROGRAM REINSTATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wheels are turning again for Meals on Wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a 17-year hiatus, the meal delivery program for the elderly and 
disabled was resumed by the city and La Palma Intercommunity Hospital in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 And Tom Davies, left slightly paralyzed after recent brain surgery, is among 
those who are glad to see the program again. He's one of five clients La 
Palma's Meals on Wheels caters to Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, Meals on Wheels volunteers Joe Staunton and Diane 
Danner served up a hot plate of Spanish rice, vegetables and biscuits to the 
Davies kitchen table. As usual, Staunton opened Davies' milk carton and 
buttered his wheat bread, which the 76-year-old Davies is unable to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great idea," said Davies, a former classical music teacher. "I really 
appreciate the service." 
</P>
<P>
 When word gets around it's available again, city officials expect as many as a 
dozen people to use the service. The program delivers hot, nutritionally sound 
meals to residents who are unable to prepare them on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 While the delivery is free, clients still must pay $2.40 for hot lunches, and 
$1.20 for a cold sack dinner. The meals are prepared at La Palma Intercommunity 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many of our clients, if it weren't for Meals on Wheels, they would be 
eating just TV dinners, and that's just not healthy," said Community Services 
Supervisor Janet L. Cates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals on Wheels in La Palma was canceled in 1977 after a local group could no 
longer provide volunteer help. Neighboring cities could not absorb La Palma's 
cases, either. Three attempts to start the program over the years also failed 
because of liability issues involving volunteer drivers, Cates said. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last year, the City Council agreed to accept liability for volunteer 
drivers, enabling the program to resume, Cates said. The council also paid for 
beginning costs, which included insulated boxes for food and office supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Clients aren't the only ones benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love helping people, and it's a wonderful program," said Danner, 51, who is 
studying opera at Cypress Community College. "I hope when I get older and can't 
make my own meals that someone will deliver them to me, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Meals on Wheels is still seeking a few more volunteer drivers and office 
workers who can work in the afternoon, Cates said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FAIR TO STUDY PLAN TO MOVE BUILDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plans to relocate farm buildings on Irvine's Buffalo Ranch to the fairgrounds 
in Costa Mesa took a step forward this week when the Orange County Fair hired 
an architectural firm to examine the feasibility of the move. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirtieth Street Architects of Newport Beach will craft a plan to move the 
buildings. The firm also will suggest placement of buildings at the fairgrounds 
and whether significant restorations are needed, said Georgia Cluver, marketing 
assistant for the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fair officials are continuing to discuss the proposal with the 
Irvine Co., which owns Buffalo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch, at the corner of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard, was an 
amusement park in the 1950s known for its odd collection of livestock. In the 
1960s, the architects who designed UC Irvine and parts of Newport Beach and 
Irvine used the site as their headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last month, the ranch buildings were used as offices by several 
businesses. But the Irvine Co. decided to remove the tenants, in part because 
an upcoming Ford Road widening project will limit vehicle access to the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buffalo Ranch land is zoned for residential development, and the Irvine 
Co. has stated its intentions to one day build homes on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said that moving the buildings to the fairgrounds allows the 
structures to be preserved in an area where the public can view and use them. 
</P>
<P>
 But preservationists who are trying to get the ranch placed on the National 
Register of Historic Places strongly oppose moving the buildings, saying the 
ranch is one of the last markers of Irvine's past. 
</P>
<P>
 No final decision on the proposal has been made. The architectural firm will 
present its findings to the fair board in April. The Irvine Co. is awaiting the 
results of a separate study on preserving the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials have suggested using the ranch buildings as meeting rooms and 
classrooms. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CONVENTION OFFERS SCIENCE TEACHING TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AILEEN CHO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When his bike was stolen three years ago, Keith Palmer didn't get mad. He got 
inventive. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a high school freshman, Palmer took a battery and wires and made a small 
device that could sense the motion of a would-be thief trying to move a 
bicycle. The device emits a 110-decibel sound that repeats like a car alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very annoying to hear," Palmer said Wednesday as he accepted a $1,000 
award at the Anaheim Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer, who lives in Orange and is now a senior at El Modena High School, won 
third place in an invention competition sponsored by Duracell Batteries and the 
National Science Teachers Assn. The awards ceremony was part of the 
association's 42nd national convention, which began Wednesday and continues 
through Saturday at the Anaheim Convention Center. About 11,000 people, mostly 
elementary and high school teachers, attended Wednesday, according to Ann Wild, 
a spokeswoman for the association. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the largest we've ever had," Wild said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 800 entries in the competition included a device that tells blind people 
the values of their paper money, a timed pill bottle to prevent overdoses and a 
page carrier that automatically releases a piece of sheet music when a pianist 
pushes a pedal. The inventions were on display as part of the convention's 
exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the convention offered more than 200 workshops, lectures and 
discussions at the convention center and nearby hotels. "I feel overwhelmed," 
said Nancy Washington, a kindergarten teacher from Duarte. "There are so many 
things to choose from and yet you're limited by time." 
</P>
<P>
 Many exhibits and lectures echoed common themes: finding ways to integrate 
science with math, English, art and other fields in education, and making 
learning as hands-on and technologically advanced for students as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science can't function in isolation," said Alan L. Towler, president of 
Austin, Tex.-based MediaGarden, which makes computer hardware and software for 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The displays included computerized blood-pressure tests and "Slime Chemistry" 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope to implement some of the stuff when I go back," said David Baas, a 
chemistry teacher from Valley Christian High School in Cerritos. But he and 
colleague Frank Zuidema, from San Dieguito High School in Encinitas, admitted 
that it isn't easy. "I may forget and two weeks from now I'll wonder what that 
pile is in the corner," said Zuidema of the brochures and workshop papers he 
had collected. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops offered methods for teachers to interest students in biology, 
astronomy and other sciences. Others showed how theater can be used to teach 
children about space travel and how chemistry can be taught through making 
cotton candy or rock candy. Several lectures discussed cultural and gender bias 
in science, encouraging teachers to specifically encourage more girls in the 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Baas and Zuidema said they have attended the National Science Teachers Assn. 
conferences for 20 years. "This is one of the better ones," Baas said. AILEEN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; DIRT PILE REMOVED FROM PARK ENTRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been more than five years since a developer left a giant pile of dirt 
blocking the entrance of Dixie Canyon Park in Sherman Oaks, rendering the 
20-acre mountain retreat inaccessible to all but the most determined hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a five-month, $250,000 restoration project by the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, the park will reopen at 2 p.m. Saturday boasting a new 
trail head and hillsides covered with new plants. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pile of dirt is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews began work in December to move the 100-cubic-yard mound of dirt and 
spruce up the canyon park, which was donated to the conservancy by actor Warren 
Beatty in 1987. A half-mile loop trail through the canyon, which hosts a 
year-round stream, was built a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, however, a developer building 10 houses nearby did some illegal 
grading on park property and left the dirt blocking the entrance. The developer 
admitted culpability and agreed to pay to have the mess cleaned up, but Los 
Angeles city officials never permitted the conservancy to begin the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rains last year made the mess even worse by causing the hillside to 
slide. "The whole top layer of hill came right down into the street," said 
Deputy Conservancy Director John Diaz. 
</P>
<P>
 So in December, after waiting more than 18 months for city approvals, the 
conservancy exercised its emergency powers authority and began the work without 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance to the park at the southern end of Dixie Canyon Place has been 
redesigned with a rock retaining wall and steps connecting the trail to the 
street. At present the trail does not connect to others in the area, but 
conservancy officials hope to link it eventually to Franklin Canyon and 
Coldwater Canyon Park. AARON CURTISS

<P>
 Three schoolchildren from the San Fernando Valley will compete in a state 
geography bee in Sacramento on April 8, and at least one of them is preparing 
for it by hitting the books during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner from among more than 100 competitors will participate in the Sixth 
Annual National Geography Bee in Washington and a shot at the top prize -- a 
$25,000 college scholarship. 
</P>

 "Even if I come in last place, it'd be pretty neat," said Jonathan Wilson, 13, 
a seventh-grader at Luther Burbank Middle School in Burbank. "I'm pretty 
excited I'm going there, period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just looking at atlases and statistics to see what I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 Also competing in the geography bee are Nassira Nicola of Welby Way Elementary 
School and Tri Nguyen of John A. Sutter Junior High School, both in Canoga 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Showdowns among fourth- through eighth-grade students in all 50 states, the 
District of Columbia and five U.S. territories also will take place April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Each state winner will get, among other things, a free trip to Washington with 
his or her teacher for the national finals May 24 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Geographic Society, one of the bee's sponsors, started the 
competition in response to concern over a lack of knowledge in geography among 
American youths. VIVIEN LOU CHEN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SWAT TEAM ARRESTS SUSPECT IN SLAYING

 A Los Angeles Police Department SWAT team used tear gas early Wednesday to 
capture a suspect in a slaying who retreated into his Reseda apartment when he 
spotted officers coming toward him, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives spotted Hector Rodolfo Mejia, 36, around 9 p.m. in front of his 
apartment in the 7400 block of Louise Avenue, Los Angeles Police Lt. Anthony 
Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia went back into the apartment, Alba said, and police spent the next three 
hours trying to persuade him to come out.  
</P>
<P>
 A Special Weapons and Tactics team fired tear gas into the apartment shortly 
before midnight, Alba said, and Mejia surrendered to police about 12:05 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejia is a suspect in the shooting death of Jose Napoleon Orellana, 29, who 
was killed Sunday outside his Van Nuys home in the 6700 block of Hayvenhurst 
Avenue, Alba said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said a lingering money dispute between the men may have led to the 
7:30 a.m. shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 Mejia, who owed money to Orellana, shot him several times in the chest with a 
handgun, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Police issued an alert for Mejia and the gray 1990 Toyota pickup truck that he 
used to flee the same day of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Mejia had lived with Orellana sporadically at the apartment 
until the day of the shooting. CHIP JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TRUCK SPILLS DIESEL FUEL NEAR CHANNEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dump truck overturned at a construction site near Talbert Channel on 
Wednesday morning, spilling about 15 gallons of hydraulic fluid and diesel fuel 
onto a grassy area next to a wetland. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much to be concerned about," said Patrick Moore, a spokesman for the 
state Department of Fish and Game, which oversaw the cleanup."Only traces of 
the oil went into the water and there was no loss of wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident -- near Magnolia Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway -- involved a 
truck owned by Lohrman Truck Inc. of the City of Industry. According to a Fire 
Department spokesman, the mishap occurred about 8:30 a.m. when the truck 
toppled because of an unevenly distributed load of rocks it was carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a mess," said Steve Safford, a local construction worker who 
drove by a short time later. "The truck was on its side and the cab was 
crushed." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the truck -- identified by the Fire Department spokesman as 
Robert Parra, 36 -- was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Moore, the trucking company will be cited for violating a state 
law that makes it a misdemeanor to dump petroleum products in or near a 
waterway.DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; CITY OKS CHANGES TO COUNCIL SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved changes in the way it conducts its sessions to 
make it easier for the public to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of waiting through half of the meeting, residents now may address the 
council right after the roll call. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the changes unanimously approved Monday were prompted by 
modifications to the state public meetings law, known as the Brown Act. The 
changes will take effect Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will publish a brochure that will explain the changes, City Manager 
Robert C. Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will provide the public the opportunity to participate more," Dunek 
said. "We'll make (the brochure) user-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 In future meetings, council members will be prohibited from taking action or 
even discussing items that are not on the agenda. City Atty. Thomas W. Allen 
said they may, however, briefly respond to questions or seek information on 
non-agenda items. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of the council meetings, Allen said, the Brown Act now prohibits even 
casual discussions of city matters by three or more members of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "The less business you do outside of the meeting room, the less you get 
yourself in trouble," Allen told the council members.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; NEIGHBORS OPPOSE HOTEL'S BIG TENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighbors of the Waterfront Hilton beach resort on Pacific Coast Highway say 
they will fight the hotel's request to erect a massive tent on three of its 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents cited concerns over noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel has asked the city for permission to build a 5,200-square-foot tent 
to accommodate social functions. The tent would be less than 40 yards from a 
289-unit condominium complex called Seaside Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel wants the 17-foot-high structure, which will have an aluminum and 
steel frame, to remain in place for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaside Village residents said outdoor music from the structure will bother 
residents. And neighbors also worry that since the tent will host large social 
events, it will snarl local traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that tent is made permanent, which is what five years sounds like to me, 
the amount of traffic down here is going to be a thousand times over what it is 
now," said Paul Schafer, a Seaside Village resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the tent, like any city establishment, would be 
subject to noise-ordinance codes, which should adequately protect neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a zoning administrator already approved a permit for the hotel to 
hold two events at the tent on April 20 and May 5, the city still must grant 
approval to erect the structure, according to city planners. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel will also need another permit to leave the tent up for five years, 
said city planners. No date has been set yet for either hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton officials were unavailable for comment.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; MAN HONORED FOR AIDING NEIGHBORS

<P>
 In a commendation presented this week, the City Council credited Louis Michael 
Weiser with saving the lives of his neighbors when he killed a suspected robber 
who broke into their home Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the suspect, 26-year-old Hector Armando Reyes of Anaheim, and 
an accomplice had robbed a McDonald's restaurant in Los Alamitos earlier that 
night.The accomplice was arrested, but Reyes ran into Cypress Village and 
apparently hid in yards before entering the home of Moshe and Sandra Joshua on 
Matinicus Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Reyes and Moshe Joshua struggled downstairs, Sandra Joshua called police 
and armed herself with a knife and a handgun that didn't work, police said. She 
then climbed out of her bedroom window and as she hung from a balcony railing 
screaming, Weiser ran over to help her. He then armed himself with a shotgun 
and returned, after Sandra Joshua repeatedly stabbed Reyes in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes managed to wrestle Sandra Joshua's gun away while struggling with both 
the Joshuas, Sgt. Ron Dickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiser saw the gun and fired once, fatally hitting Reyes in the chest. The 
couple were not seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 For his action, council members called Weiser a "hometown hero" as they 
presented him with a framed resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "My reward comes every morning when I see the smiling faces of my neighbors, 
who needed my help," Weiser said.MIMI KO

HOMELESS SHELTERS ADOPT SET OF BASIC STANDARDS; CHARITY: COALITION HOPES TO 
REGAIN PUBLIC'S TRUST AFTER RECENT SCANDALS WHILE PROVIDING A HIGHER LEVEL OF 
CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of homeless shelters have adopted a system of self-regulation in 
an attempt to restore confidence in charitable organizations recently tarnished 
by scandal and to provide a higher level of care to Orange County's increasing 
homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
 At least a dozen shelter organizations, which manage about 500 of the 900 beds 
available to the homeless in the county, have pledged to uphold a set of basic 
standards, from ensuring the cleanliness of bed linens to a guarantee of 
"religious liberty," regardless of a shelter's religious affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the people who use our shelters will notice a new attention to 
basic dignity," said Tim Shaw, executive director of the Orange County Homeless 
Issues Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that there are about 12,000 homeless in Orange County, a 
threefold increase since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the guidelines were adopted in part because of recent disclosures 
about financial improprieties at two local shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde E. Weinman, the former director of Irvine Temporary Housing, was found 
guilty in January of forgery and embezzlement in a scheme that netted him more 
than $400,000 in money intended to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman -- who prosecutors said used the money to lease a Mercedes-Benz and 
convert his home into a "virtual Taj Mahal," complete with sauna, pool and 
extensive landscaping -- was sentenced this month to four years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the credibility of charitable organizations, including homeless 
shelters, also was dealt a blow when reports of fiscal problems and 
mismanagement forced the ouster of administrators who ran the El Modena 
Community Center near the city of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The community center, which provided food, shelter, clothing and job 
counseling to the poor and homeless, reopened last month and has since provided 
a haven for local youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people go into this business with good intentions," Shaw said. "But 
there are some people out there like the Clyde Weinmans of the world. We want 
to make sure we are providing a higher level of service so that we can feel 
comfortable in referring people to facilities here." 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of the coalition's plan is to require each participating agency to 
conduct an annual audit that would review staff and client concerns, shelter 
conditions, health and safety operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed regulations, for example, staff and shelter residents will 
be allowed to submit grievances about shelter conditions or conflicts within 
the facility to that agency's officials. Rulings on those grievances would be 
required within seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the guidelines, each shelter would offer personal counseling, job 
referrals, recreation activities and referral services for employment and 
housing outside the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 When agencies are found to be out of compliance, Shaw said, the coalition 
would provide additional resources to those needy shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are people who are being mistreated, that is of concern to us," said 
Larry Haynes, co-chairman of the coalition, called the Shelter Provider Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is intended to be a harsh, harsh look at ourselves. We are holding 
ourselves accountable to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless run by local or state government, Shaw said most shelter agencies 
operate with little regulation. "Our goal is to upgrade the level of service, 
not to run anybody out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 It was hoped that the new rules would help the 12 participating nonprofit 
agencies become even more efficient in providing care since the number of 
homeless far exceeds the 900 available beds. Haynes said legitimate shelter 
agencies must work to regain the public's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone is giving us $10 of their hard-earned money, we want to assure 
them that it is going to a credible agency," Haynes said. "Sometimes, making 
contributions to a charity can be a real crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Participating shelters are: Anaheim Interfaith Shelter, Anchor House, 
Friendship Shelter, Human Options/Second Step, Huntington Youth Shelter, Martha 
House, Mercy House, New Vista Shelter, Orange Coast Interfaith Shelter, Orange 
County Homeless Issues Task Force, Precious Life Shelter and the YWCA South 
Orange County.

WILSON APPROVES TAX RELIEF BILL FOR FIRE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law Wednesday an Orange County legislator's bill 
providing tax relief to homeowners in Laguna Beach and other Southern 
California cities who lost their homes during the devastating fires that swept 
the region last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) provides better tax 
write-offs for residents who lost their homes in the fires, which caused $1 
billion damage to private and public property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipated the governor would sign it," Bergeson said. "I think this gives 
some reassurance to the victims of the Laguna Beach fire that they will get 
some help with tax time rolling around. For some, it will be a tremendous 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire victims will be able to deduct their losses on their income tax returns 
for the next decade. They can write off 100% of the losses for up to five years 
and then 50% of those the following five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the bill authorizes an estimated $1.3 million in state aid to the 
five counties that stand to lose revenue because property tax assessments were 
adjusted downward for residents whose homes were destroyed by fire. The 
counties hit by fires were Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, 
Ventura and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a boon for cities and counties," Bergeson said, "especially at a 
time when they're facing real fiscal problems that have nothing to do with the 
fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar tax benefits were provided in other regions hit by disasters in recent 
years, such as the Oakland Hills fire and the Loma Prieta earthquake in the San 
Francisco Bay Area. Earlier this month, Wilson signed tax-relief legislation 
for residents devastated by the powerful Northridge earthquake in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson worked to push the legislation quickly so residents could take 
advantage of it before the April 15 deadline for filing personal income tax 
returns.

IMMIGRATION DISCUSSION YIELDS NO ANSWERS; BUSINESS: VALLEY INDUSTRY AND 
COMMERCE ASSN. HOLDS TALK TO SEEK POSITION ON PENDING LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The complexity of the illegal immigration issue was demonstrated Wednesday 
when a panel of immigration specialists and politicians sought to answer the 
question of its impact on San Fernando Valley businesses. The resounding answer 
was: Nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
 And the division over the debate was exemplified by the opposing views of two 
Valley congressmen over the issue of denying automatic citizenship to U. 
S.-born children of illegal immigrants. Both were greeted with applause from 
the group of Valley business people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. held the luncheon discussion to help it 
form positions on pending federal immigration legislation. But the two-hour 
discussion may have raised more questions than it answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the majority of the group of about 100 people at the Airtel Plaza Hotel 
in Van Nuys seemed to agree that something needs to be done to stem the flow of 
illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the business community is ready to support stronger legislation, but 
only under the condition of not being made scapegoats," said Walter W. Mosher 
Jr., VICA's chairman and president of Precision Dynamics Corp. of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think VICA might support that because I don't think there are any business 
members of VICA who knowingly hire illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think there has to be better control of the border," said Benjamin M. 
Reznik, a land-use attorney and former VICA chairman who is a naturalized 
citizen from Israel. "Why have a border if you're not going to patrol it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The business community has had it both ways. We've benefited from lower wages 
but we don't want serious sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants. My position 
is, don't make the problem the workplace, make it the border. We can't be 
policemen at the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of denying citizenship to U. S.-born children of illegal immigrants 
separates Reps. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). Berman opposes changing the 14th Amendment, which grants 
automatic citizenship to anyone born in the United States, while Beilenson 
supports it. 
</P>
<P>
 But both congressmen support beefing up the Border Patrol and implementing a 
counterfeit-proof national identification card for all citizens and legal 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any other way not to discriminate against someone because of 
their skin color," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both politicians also oppose denying public education to children of illegal 
immigrants: "I just think that is a crazy idea," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographer Kevin McCarthy of the Rand Corp. think tank in Santa Monica 
further muddied the debate when he told the group that most perceptions of 
immigrants today are based on studies done 10 years ago. He said those studies 
were based on a limited pool of 10% to 20%, which is probably not 
representative of the immigrant population. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of how current the data, the attitude of Californians toward 
immigrants has definitely changed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few years, the majority attitude was one of at least benign 
neglect if not acceptance -- a general belief that immigrants and the state 
have served each other well," McCarthy said. "Today, there is a growing sense 
that if immigration is not out of control, there are simply too many 
immigrants, especially illegal immigrants, and their presence is hurting the 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said the state's economic slowdown and the increasing immigrant 
population has increased the visibility of immigrants. But he said there are 
still a lot of questions unanswered about the impact of a tougher immigration 
policy on the state's economy because the state's future labor needs are 
unknown at a time when its population keeps growing primarily because of 
increasing immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy said the debate should distinguish between immigration and immigrants 
-- those that will be entering the country in the future compared to those 
already here.

AROUND THE VALLEY: SLEEPLESS IN LANCASTER, OR HOW I LEARNED TO LOVE METROLINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are the few, the proud -- and the sleepless. 
</P>
<P>
 It's shortly after 4 in the morning as we trudge into the Metrolink station in 
Lancaster -- little more than a tent and ticket machine alongside the railroad 
tracks -- to catch the first train south to city jobs for the day. I'm there 
just to test the system, but for most of the two dozen bleary-eyed folks 
waiting, it's an everyday ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of Antelope Valley commuters, who ride the Metrolink 
trains begun on an emergency basis a week after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarring me out of the darkness of sleep, the alarm clock went off at 2:30 in 
the morning, time enough to quickly shower, dress and drive to the station. On 
the first day, I figure, you want to allow a little extra time. Then I think 
again with dismay, "2:30, that's a time for going to bed, not for getting out 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, extraordinary circumstances require extraordinary responses. 
With the normal commute route along the Antelope Valley Freeway closed for 
months due to collapsed overpasses, and the hastily arranged bypasses a 
frequent traffic nightmare, crazy alternatives suddenly start to sound sane. 
</P>
<P>
 So with the 4:11 a.m. train rumbling nearby, I queue up to plunk my fare into 
the automated ticket machine, $6.50 one way for the trip south to Sylmar and 
then a van on to work in Chatsworth. But even the machine doesn't awake until 4 
a.m., leaving those of us who lack monthly passes a slim 10 minutes to grab our 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, no one is left behind. But the crowd gets more than a little edgy 
as one man gums up the machine trying to insert his bills the wrong way. When 
my turn comes, the machine efficiently takes a $5 bill and a $1 bill, only to 
reject the final frayed $1. Fortunately, I have others to try. A 
Metrolink-riding tip: Carry lots of crisp, new bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the rail cars are a pleasant surprise -- clean, free of obvious 
graffiti and with comfortable, mauve-cushioned seats -- in marked contrast to 
the dirty, permanently etched and battered RTD buses I've ridden in the past. 
With the doors closed, we begin rolling south for the two-hour ride into the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is actually a late trip for me. When I drive, I leave earlier," 
confessed David Banks of Lancaster, a supervisor with the county's Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority who works in downtown L. A. He too gets up at 2:30 to 
make the morning train three days a week, showering the night before and 
skipping breakfast until work. He makes me feel better. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks says he's been driving for 23 years. Before the earthquake, he left home 
at 3:30 a.m. to get to work by 4:45. He could have begun work later but always 
left early to miss freeway gridlock. Now, after the quake, his former 75-minute 
drive is a 2 1/2-hour train ride. His train typically gets to Los Angeles just 
before 7 a.m., about 15 minutes late. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of time, Banks and others say they'd rather relax reading the 
newspaper and snoozing on the train than fight the freeway commute. Banks 
figures that he'll ride every day if Metrolink can cut 45 minutes off the trip 
by this summer, as promised. Meantime, many neighbors stay with their cars, he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip out of the Antelope Valley is unexpectedly quiet and soothing, with 
only an occasional clackety-clack on a section of rough track to disturb the 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Seta Baltakian, a bank supervisor who boards the train down the line in Acton, 
where she lives, calls her daily round trip to downtown L. A. "a third job," 
after her family and work. "You're spending six hours on the train for 
nothing," said Baltakian, who gets up at 3:30 a.m. and is lucky to get to bed 
by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 But she still calls Metrolink a blessing, saving her from traffic hassles. 
"Coming home was the problem. I drove one day and I said, 'No more.' That day 
when I drove home, it was horrible. People were mad, driving like crazy," she 
said en route to Santa Clarita. "No one wants to drive." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people move to the Antelope Valley and find they can't hack the 
120-mile-plus round-trip commute. Many more stay and bear the stress that has 
multiplied since the earthquake. But ask people like Banks and Baltakian if 
they would trade the open spaces and peace of their homes for a shorter 
commute, and the answer is a resounding no. 
</P>
<P>
 So we get up at insane hours, fight the freeways or spend one-fourth of the 
24-hour day on the train. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Metrolink's north county line -- the system's busiest, carrying about 
9,000 passengers a day -- often runs late because the trains tend to stop 
suddenly between stations and wait up to 10 or 15 minutes for track clearances. 
</P>
<P>
 There are restrooms on board, but much to the dismay of passengers, there's no 
on-board food service, leading one rider to jest: "There's airline flights 
shorter than this that serve dinner." And regulars tell stories of the times 
that their trains hit a truck (or a person who wants to end it all), and the 
ensuing delays. 
</P>
<P>
 By 6:15, about 15 minutes late, my train finally pulls into the Sylmar station 
after a two-hour ride. A 20-minute wait for the van and then a 30-minute drive 
to Chatsworth gets me to the office by 7 a.m. For the record, that's a 
three-hour trip -- about two hours longer than if I drove. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now 4 1/2 hours into my day, and I'm ready to start work with a sour 
stomach and feeling like I've got a hangover, despite not having touched a 
drop. For the time, I decide it makes more sense to savor two hours of extra 
sleep every morning and then put up with the traffic. Yet I also keep thinking 
about Metrolink and hoping that it will become a workable and convenient 
alternative for me, eventually. 
</P>
<P>
 And I remember what Banks told me about Antelope Valley residents who start 
their days when the night is still young: "It'll get you this afternoon."

WATER DISTRICT BOARD CATCHES MORE FLAK; UTILITIES: LOS ALAMITOS AGENCY DRAWS 
CRITICISM FOR $4,000 TAB AT LAKE TAHOE CONFERENCE. IT ALREADY WAS UNDER FIRE 
FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT. MEMBERS CALL EXPENSES ROUTINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The five directors of the Los Alamitos County Water District, who already are 
under fire for their financial management, are being criticized by city 
officials for spending nearly $4,000 to attend a conference in Lake Tahoe last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the expense of attending the conference, four of the directors 
each drew $100 per day in salaries as allowed under a district policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors said they did nothing wrong and that the expenses to attend the 
three-day California Special Districts Conference last September were routine. 
</P>
<P>
 But while city officials agreed that the expenses do not appear to be illegal, 
they said they are still outraged that district directors would receive $100 a 
day in salaries for attending the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that they are running a deficit, it's unethical and immoral," 
said Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi during Monday's City Council meeting, in which a 
longstanding proposal to separate the city from the water district was again 
discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Rosenthal, president of the water district's board of directors, said 
that a policy adopted in 1986 allows directors to receive $100 "for each day 
served as a director." 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave up four days of work to attend this conference," said Rosenthal, an 
engineer who charges $75 an hour for his work. "But I am committed to do my job 
as a director." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Arlyss Burkett, who was elected to a four-year term on the board in 
1992, said the charges that the district is operating in the red are not true, 
pointing to the $1 million that has been set aside for future repairs of the 
sewer lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (city officials) want our reserve fund and our property," Burkett said. 
"That is what's driving this whole thing. We will fight to the end to maintain 
the sewer district." 
</P>
<P>
 The water district collects sewer waste from about 7,000 households and 
businesses in Los Alamitos, Rossmoor and portions of Seal Beach and Cypress, 
charging property owners about $1.25 a month for the service. 
</P>
<P>
 William C. Poe and Joseph C. Martin, who both were elected to the water 
district board two years ago, and Edwyna Moyer, whose term on the board expires 
in November, also attended the conference. However, Martin refused the 
$100-a-day salary and drove his own car to Lake Tahoe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the council is trying to read something that is not there," said 
Sandra Montez, the district's general manager, who did not attend the 
conference. "It's overblown. It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 According to district financial records, the directors spent $856.88 for hotel 
accommodations, $1,375 for conference registration, $412 for plane fare and $68 
for a rented van. In addition, four directors received $300 each in salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Two directors and the general manager of the Rossmoor Community Services 
District also attended the conference, which is held annually by special 
districts in much the same way that cities hold their League of California 
Cities conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea for people who vote on millions of dollars in contracts to 
know what they are doing," said Bill Sheldon, general manager of the Rossmoor 
Community Services District, who attended the last two conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon said a variety of workshops and seminars are offered during the 
three-day conference, including sessions on state public meetings law that is a 
must for special district directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon, however, said that Rossmoor directors do not get paid for attending 
the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, City Council members postponed a decision until October on 
whether to ask the Local Agency Formation Commission to begin the process of 
separating the city from the water district. 
</P>
<P>
 But Selvaggi said he wants to move forward, particularly after details of the 
Tahoe trip surfaced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is suggesting it (the trip) was illegal," Selvaggi said. "I think it 
was a waste of taxpayers' money."

CITY TO PAY $450,000 TO SETTLE CONTRACT DISPUTE; BURBANK: ACTION TO AVOID GOING 
TO COURT OVER ABORTED PROPERTY SALE IS THE CLOSING CHAPTER IN A COMPLEX DEAL 
THAT WENT SOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has agreed to pay $450,000 to a property owner who alleged in 
a lawsuit that the city breached a contract when it backed out of a deal to buy 
his land four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 5-0 vote Tuesday night, the city agreed to the settlement with Martin 
Stayden, closing the final chapter of a complex deal that went awry and over 
the years has cost the city nearly $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very troubled project and it's very disappointing how it all came 
out," City Atty. Joseph Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayden, who sold the property on San Fernando Boulevard last year, was 
satisfied with the settlement, his lawyer said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's a reasonable compromise considering all the circumstances of 
this case," Paul Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement stems from a controversy involving the previous City Council 
and developer Thomas Tunnicliffe. In 1988, the council, acting as the 
Redevelopment Agency, agreed to help Tunnicliffe develop a three-story building 
at Angeleno Avenue and San Fernando Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunnicliffe owned one-third of the site, the city owned another third and 
Stayden owned the remaining parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Stayden's collection agency occupied his parcel, Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an executive session in September, 1990, the Redevelopment Agency approved 
a complicated plan to purchase Stayden's property, then sell it to Tunnicliffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunnicliffe's plan called for the Redevelopment Agency to also purchase the 
city-owned portion, a parking lot, and turn it over to him. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Tunnicliffe offered to build a parking structure for city 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Two council members "felt that wasn't fair and adequate compensation for the 
city," Fletcher said. "The bottom line is the city wasn't getting anything for 
its parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting, the two council members, Mary Lou Howard and Tim Murphy, voted 
against the proposal for the Redevelopment Agency to purchase the city-owned 
parking lot. The transfer required at least four yes votes to pass, rather than 
a simple majority. The council, as well as the Redevelopment Agency, needed to 
approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the parking lot, the plan collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right before escrow was going to close, the city decided not to go ahead," 
Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stayden sued for breach of contract, and a trial date was set for March 14 
this year. Although the city has not admitted liability, city officials decided 
to settle the lawsuit because the city faced the possibility of being required 
to pay significantly more if it lost the case, Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "On balance, we felt it's prudent," he said. "If this went to a jury, the odds 
were getting more likely of some judgment against the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys' fees on the case have already reached $150,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunnicliffe filed a lawsuit against the city for $10 million and in 1992 was 
awarded $1.5 million in a settlement agreement.

FIRMS TO FUND DESIGN OF TREATMENT SYSTEM; ENVIRONMENT: EPA OFFICIALS HAIL THE 
AGREEMENT AS A MAJOR FIRST STEP IN CLEANING UP GLENDALE'S GROUND WATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-five companies suspected of leaking chemical pollutants have agreed to 
spend about $4 million to design a treatment system to clean up tainted ground 
water in Glendale, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency announced 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials hailed the agreement as an important first step in the Superfund 
cleanup of Glendale ground-water supplies. However, they acknowledged that it 
does not resolve the thornier question of how to divide the much larger cost of 
building and running the treatment system when its design is completed two 
years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Superfund program, the EPA targets the worst toxic waste sites and 
seeks to make polluters pay for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale and neighboring areas of the San Fernando Valley have been declared 
Superfund sites due to lake-size plumes of chemically tainted ground water that 
have forced the cities of Glendale, Burbank and Los Angeles to idle municipal 
water supply wells. 
</P>
<P>
 The main pollutants -- trichloroethylene and perchloroethylene -- are common 
solvents that are thought to have been leaked or spilled over several decades 
by a variety of users, including aerospace, metal-plating, auto-repair and 
dry-cleaning firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms signing the design agreement -- including Lockheed Corp., ITT Corp., 
Southern Pacific Transportation Co. and the Walt Disney Co. -- did not admit 
liability for the pollution. But they pledged to join forces to design a 
treatment plant that will operate a dozen years, purifying 5,000 gallons of 
ground water per minute for use by Glendale homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials have estimated the total cost of the Glendale cleanup at $47 
million to $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In most Superfund cases, litigation or cost-sharing negotiations involve all 
phases of cleanup -- so that design is delayed for months or years while 
disputes are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Glendale case, however, design work will proceed while the EPA and 
companies negotiate over the more expensive phases of construction and 
operation, said Claire Trombadore, a Superfund project manager with the EPA's 
San Francisco regional office. 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit of this approach, Trombadore said, is that during the design 
phase the EPA will continue looking for other potential polluters, which could 
result in lower cleanup costs per company. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup efforts are farther along in North Hollywood and Burbank. In North 
Hollywood, where a small treatment plant has been operating for more than four 
years, the EPA is negotiating with some firms and has sued others to recoup 
$17.2 million spent on the treatment system and the wider investigation of 
Valley ground-water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, Lockheed has nearly finished construction of a large ground-water 
treatment system under an agreement with the EPA, and is threatening to sue 
other Burbank-area firms if they refuse to help pay for the work.

EX-DEPUTY TO LET JUDGE RULE IN JAIL SEX CASE; COURTS: HE IS CHARGED WITH AIDING 
CONSENSUAL CONTACT. ATTORNEY MAINTAINS THAT LAW APPLIES ONLY TO INMATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy accused of having sex with a 
female jail inmate waived his right to a trial Wednesday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, opting instead to let a judge decide his fate, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that they videotaped Larry Fraize, 43, performing a sex act 
with an inmate during a sting operation in May.They also allege that they taped 
Fraize as he watched two female inmates have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraize was subsequently charged with aiding and abetting a consensual sex act 
with an inmate, and aiding and abetting sexual contact involving two inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fraize waived his right to a jury trial Wednesday, he allowed Superior 
Court Judge Judy Champagne to reach a verdict based on evidence presented 
during his preliminary hearing. A court date has been set May 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson, the prosecutor, predicted that the judge 
will convict Fraize and that he will be sentenced to probation, which could 
include up to a year in jail. A former bailiff at Van Nuys Superior Court, 
Fraize has since resigned from the Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Kinion, Fraize's attorney, said that by allowing a judge to determine his 
fate, Fraize preserves his right to appeal, and that is what he plans to do if 
convicted, Kinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinion has long maintained that Fraize could not be prosecuted for engaging in 
a consensual sex act because the law he is accused of violating applies to 
inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is clear that he should not be prosecuted," Kinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a point of contention with Yochelson, who maintains that Fraize can be 
prosecuted under the law as an accomplice to the sex acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a novel legal issue," Yochelson said. "We'll see how it gets resolved."

KILLER CLAIMS INNOCENCE TO JURY WEIGHING DEATH PENALTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Ignoring his lawyer's advice, Sean Darnell Slade told the jurors who convicted 
him of murder and who will decide whether he dies for the crime that he is 
innocent and therefore feels no remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I have remorse about Eddie Maldonado because I didn't know him," 
Slade testified Wednesday, referring to the armored car guard he was convicted 
of shooting to death during a 1992 holdup."I didn't take his life." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is expected to begin deliberations today. Slade, 27, shot Maldonado 
in the back of the head during a robbery at a Home Depot store in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 In sometimes rambling testimony, Slade said he was raised a Christian and has 
respect for human life. He did admit that he gunned down a man in 1987 during 
an argument that prosecutors say involved drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing to control his emotions, Slade said he was sorry, and took 
responsibility for the slaying. "I'm not God," Slade said through his tears. "I 
can't just take somebody's life. That's something I have to live with." 
</P>
<P>
 Slade served four years for that crime, and killed Maldonado only 25 days 
after his parole. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did during the guilt phase of his trial, Slade blamed his predicament on 
the mother of his first victim, who called police and reported that Slade was 
the man depicted in a composite drawing circulated after the 1992 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sad for you (because) you got caught up in it," Slade told jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 In an emotional exchange, Slade attacked Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeff Jonas, 
calling him a pathological liar and a prosecutor who overdramatized the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I compared you to Rush Limbaugh, but the difference is Rush Limbaugh relies 
on the facts," Slade said to Jonas.

SEAL BEACH RUNOFF WILL OFFER VOTERS A DISTINCT CHOICE; ELECTION: COUNCIL 
INCUMBENT HASTINGS IS A SLOW-GROWTH PROPONENT. CHALLENGER KLISANIN IS A 
PRO-BUSINESS DEVELOPER.

<P>
 A runoff election on May 10 for a seat on the City Council will offer voters 
two candidates with significantly different backgrounds and visions for the 
city's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce Hastings, a community activist and longtime 
champion of slow growth, will face Jim Klisanin, a local realtor, Main Street 
developer and volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings is supported by residents concerned that some Main Street businesses 
create noise, parking and crime problems. Klisanin has the backing of merchants 
who accuse the City Council of favoring the needs of residents over those of 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings came within a few votes of winning Tuesday's general election 
outright, garnering 49% of the vote in a three-way race. Klisanin got 40.9%, 
and community activist Charles Antos received 10.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other incumbents, Gwen Forsythe and William J. Doane, were reelected 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings and Klisanin are vying to represent Old Town, a neighborhood of small 
Spanish bungalows, apartments and regal oceanfront mansions bisected by the 
Main Street shopping district. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping area's close proximity to homes has created friction between 
residents and merchants. Hastings has championed the concerns of residents who 
said some Main Street businesses that sell alcohol lure noisy customers to the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings has opposed increasing the number of Old Town businesses that serve 
alcohol and has generally expressed skepticism about new developments, 
including a proposal several years ago to build hundreds of homes on the 
Hellman Ranch property. 
</P>
<P>
 Hastings' outspoken views have prompted some merchants to label her 
"anti-business," which she strongly denies. She said she is only trying 
maintain the city's small-town charm. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin said that Hastings' actions have hurt the city's fiscal health. The 
City Council has faced several large budget shortfalls over the last few years 
and was forced to raise taxes and lay off workers to balance the city's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Klisanin said the current council has strapped businesses with too many 
regulations and made Seal Beach an unfriendly place to start or expand a 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city should encourage new businesses to open as a way of 
increasing revenue. He also has called for an improvement campaign on Main 
Street, including the installation of new street lamps and benches. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Klisanin and Hastings expressed disappointment with Tuesday's election 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had done better and finished it here," Klisanin said. "I don't need 
six more weeks of this." FINAL ELECTION RETURNS

DOG KILLING BRINGS TERM OF 60 DAYS, PROBATION; COURTS: FULLERTON MAN WHO TAPED 
ANIMAL'S MUZZLE TO QUIET BARKING MUST ALSO BUY FOOD FOR DOGS OF AIDS SUFFERERS 
AS PART OF COMMUNITY SERVICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Fullerton man who pleaded no contest to charges that he killed a neighbor's 
dog by taping its mouth shut was sentenced Wednesday to 60 days' confinement 
and ordered to make restitution by buying food for dogs owned by people with 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Richard E. Behn also sentenced Robert Steven Sakall, 39, to 
250 hours of community service and three years of probation. The community 
service should be related to the care of animals, Behn said. Sakall's 
confinement might be served at home because he has spinal injuries, the judge 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Sakall's community service, the County Probation Department 
recommended that he pay $25 a week for three months to the AIDS Services 
Foundation, which, among other programs, helps people with AIDS take care of 
their pets. Behn approved the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a dog. . . . If I lost him, I don't know how I would feel," Behn told 
Jeff and Debbie Hutchison, Sakall's neighbors, whose 5-year-old golden 
retriever died. "I have great sympathy for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Sakall did not attend the sentencing because of extreme back pain, said his 
attorney, Robert Tuller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Sakall is extremely distraught," Tuller said. "He was heartsick when he 
found out that the dog died." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuller said in court that he and his client have received death threats since 
Sakall was charged with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakall pleaded no contest in February to charges of animal cruelty. Sakall 
told Fullerton police investigators that the animal's barking gave him painful 
headaches, and that he meant to quiet the animal, not kill it, by taping its 
muzzle, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuller told the judge that his client was injured at work and has been 
housebound for the last two years from pain. Numerous surgeries have done 
nothing, and now Sakall cannot sit or stand, but must remain lying down, Tuller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Behn called the muzzling of the dog "mean-spirited." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog died because it was unable to pant to release heat. Its temperature 
rose to 108, according to a veterinarian who examined the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutchisons said after the sentencing that their children are still upset 
by the loss of the family dog, named Dylan. Jeff Hutchison said his children 
have asked him, " 'If we get a dog again, can we get one that doesn't bark, 
Daddy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Hutchisons have said that Dylan was never noisy and suggested that Sakall 
may have killed the wrong dog. Another neighbor has a German shepherd that 
could have been the irritant, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Mary Anne McCauley said she was pleased with the 
sentence. She said she will ask the Probation Department to make Sakall serve 
his 60 days in jail rather than under electronic surveillance at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sakall was ordered to report to County Jail on May 18. He also must pay $500 
restitution for the dog and $213.75 for emergency medical fees, in addition to 
buying dog food.

2 MEN KILLED, 1 WOUNDED IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gunmen killed two men and wounded a third outside an apartment complex 
Wednesday night, police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the wounded man was unknown.Police would not name the 
hospital where he was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were shot about 9 p.m. in the parking lot of a 36-unit apartment 
complex in the 8600 block of Wilbur Street, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 An apartment house resident, who asked not to be identified, said the victims 
were repairing a vehicle in the parking lot when they were approached by a 
carload of men who asked to buy drugs. The victims said they were not drug 
dealers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A gunman emerged from the car and demanded money; a scuffle ensued. One of the 
victims tried unsuccessfully to wrestle the gunman's weapon away, the witness 
said. Shots were fired and the three were hit, he said.

MAN, 39, FOUND SHOT DEAD AT POPULAR RESTAURANT-BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-year-old man was found shot to death in the parking lot of a local 
restaurant in a neighborhood authorities described as a quiet residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross John Carver, whose address is listed as Ventura, was found around 7:15 
p.m. Tuesday between two cars in the parking lot of Schoonerville, a popular 
neighborhood restaurant and bar in the 8900 block of De Soto Avenue, Los 
Angeles Police Detective Tom Broad said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was shot once in the back, and we believe he was sitting on the driver's 
side of a Buick station wagon when he was shot," Broad said. He would not 
elaborate on the details of the investigation. Carver was pronounced dead at 
the scene, according to witnesses who attempted to revive him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are still trying to establish a current address for Carver because 
information taken from his driver's license doesn't appear to be current, Broad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not exactly sure where he was living, and he doesn't appear to be 
connected to any place there (Ventura)," Broad said. "We're not sure where he 
belongs or why he was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie McArthur, a neighborhood resident who describes himself as a regular bar 
patron, said while at home nearby, he heard six shots fired. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived, "there was a black gentleman trying to keep him alive, you 
know, keep him with it," McArthur said. "We were trying to keep him with it, 
but it just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Broad said there were several people seen running from the scene, but it is 
unclear whether they are possible suspects or residents who fled when they 
heard gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting was the fifth homicide in the Devonshire Division this year, 
Broad said.

AUTO-BIOGRAPHY; MUSEUM WILL CELEBRATE THE HISTORY OF THE CAR IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By D. JEAN QUASHIE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether one loves or hates automobiles, the history of Los Angeles and the 
rest of Southern California is inextricably linked to our wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobiles have defined where and how Angelenos have lived, said Catherine 
Krell, deputy director of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum. 
Suburbs and billboards were created because of autos. The world's first 
drive-through grocery store and drive-in church originated in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 So why not celebrate our passion for pistons? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind the Petersen Automotive Museum, which will soon open in 
the former Orbach's building at Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. Natural 
History Museum officials are overseeing construction of the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said this week that plans are on track to meet the projected June 10 
opening date, despite the Jan. 17 quake that prompted additional work to 
fortify the building against future quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 One aim is to turn a deteriorating building that had been vacant for three 
years into a jewel that will help rejuvenate the Miracle Mile area of Wilshire 
Boulevard, officials said. The museum is expected to draw 2 million visitors in 
its first year, many of them from operators of two sightseeing tours that will 
add the Petersen to their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very supportive of the museum," said Renee Weitzer, a planning deputy 
for Los Angeles Councilman John Ferraro, who represents the area. "It will be a 
great impact on a building that has been an eyesore and had a problem with 
vagrants. It will help revitalize the Miracle Mile." 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 13 million automobiles on the streets of Greater Los Angeles, 
the museum is a natural for the area, said Matthew Roth, a staff member at the 
Natural History Museum who will be lead curator at the Petersen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is the capital of car consumption," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum will provide a cultural and educational spin 
through automotive history with detailed displays of about 200 authentic cars, 
as well as motorcycles, photographs, billboards and dioramas. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 museums in the nation are devoted to the automobile, including three 
in California. They are in Sylmar, San Diego and Danville. But Krell said the 
Petersen, in a four-story, 300,000-square-foot building, will be the largest in 
the country and will have the most comprehensive exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing like us. We're part of the Natural History Museum, which 
means it's big and serious. No museum deals with the impact of the auto as 
fully and as comprehensibly as we will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is expected to cost about $50 million, Krell said. It is named 
after Robert Petersen, the founder and chairman of Petersen Publishing Co., who 
donated $15 million toward its establishment. His company publishes 30 
magazines, including Motor Trend and Hot Rod. The history museum also obtained 
$20 million in bond money from Los Angeles County. Money was also given by 
benefactors and by corporations such as Arco. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of the museum will be education, Krell said, with information in 
English, Spanish, German and Japanese. Each of the first three floors will 
trace the history of the auto, and conference rooms will be located on the 
fourth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor, dubbed "Streetscape," begins a journey through the 1900s. 
There is a scene of a Breer Blacksmith Shop with a 1901 steam car, complete 
with cobwebs and reconstructed tools. There is a diorama of a 1911 American 
Underslung stuck in the mud in Las Tunas Canyon with a chauffeur and stranded 
motorists. Further along is a Laurel and Hardy scene depicting a crushed 
Model-T sitting between two trolley cars in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other exhibits include representations of Los Angeles' first L-shaped 
mini-mall and one of the first California Highway Patrol motorcycle officers 
perched behind a billboard in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 The second floor will include five rotating galleries with themes such as 
French luxury cars of the 1930s; Hollywood and the automobile; early 
motorcycles, and past and present automotive technology. The third floor will 
provide more views of Southern California car culture, with three art galleries 
of photography, toys and memorabilia. The museum began collecting automobiles 
in the 1930s as anthropological artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural History Museum officials decided to build a world-class automotive 
museum as a way to showcase its inventory of automobile memorabilia, which has 
been warehoused because of a lack of display space, Krell said.  
</P>
<P>
 A council of business people, race car creators and drivers, and car 
enthusiasts was formed to assist in developing the Petersen. Council members 
include actor Paul Newman; Bruce Meyer, president of Geary's Beverly Hills, a 
car dealership specializing in fine autos; Sanford Sigoloff, former chairman of 
the Wickes Corp.; J. David Power III, the chairman of J.D. Power and 
Associates, and race car driver Parnelli Jones.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; ANTELOPE VALLEY TRANSIT WORKERS ABANDON STRIKE 
</P>

<P>
 A strike against the operator of the Antelope Valley's public transit system 
has ended, five months after it started. 
</P>
<P>
 The International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 572 notified DAVE 
Transportation Inc. late Tuesday that it was abandoning the strike.No 
explanation was given although the union did ask the bus company to take back 
the workers who went on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Carson-based union could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Mackey, a bus driver who was among more than 80 drivers and mechanics 
who went on strike last Oct. 25, said, "We all made a stand. We did what we 
felt was right. We're still going to hold our heads up." 
</P>
<P>
 John Helm, a regional manager with the Santa Ana-based bus company, said jobs 
will be offered to the pickets who ask for them back, but only as positions 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickets had suffered a series of losses since they went on strike against 
DAVE Transportation, the company that operates the public transit system for 
the Antelope Valley Transit Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The union had charged that DAVE Transportation had engaged in unfair labor 
practices by, among other things, failing to bargain in good faith. The charge 
was rejected by the National Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Budlong, executive director of the Antelope Valley Transit Authority, 
said he was glad that the strike was finally coming to an end.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CROWDS INVITED TO VIEW B-2 BOMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Corp. is throwing open the security gates at its B-2 bomber assembly 
plant to the public today for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented openness is for a ceremony that includes the naming of the 
stealthy B-2 Spirit and the naming of the second operational bomber the Spirit 
of California -- in recognition of the state's contribution to the aerospace 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to share that with as many people as we possibly can," 
Northrop spokesman Ed Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Final assembly of the B-2 is done at Northrop's Palmdale facility at Air Force 
Plant 42, where about 3,700 people work. In all, about 12,500 people in 
California are involved in the B-2 program. 
</P>
<P>
 Large crowds are expected to take advantage of the opportunity to see the 
planes close up. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony comes at a time when Northrop is hoping that Congress will extend 
the program beyond 20 planes. The company is asking that $150 million be 
allocated in next year's federal budget to keep the production line moving 
until a decision can be made on the purchase of additional planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the money, Northrop officials said the company and many of its 
contractors will mothball much of their specialized equipment, and jobs will be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the bombers are in final assembly at Palmdale, with the last of the 
planes scheduled for delivery in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the bat-winged bombers will be on display at today's outdoor 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 For security reasons, people will have to stand 100 feet from the planes. 
Cameras are allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony's speakers will include U. S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.); 
Lt. Gen. Stephen B. Croker, commander of the 8th Air Force; Rep. Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), and Northrop Chairman Kent Kresa. Lancaster 
and Palmdale have declared today B-2 Stealth Bomber Day.

CITY CEREMONY MARKS LONG-HELD PLANS TO DESTROY THE DILAPIDATED CENTER AND 
REVITALIZE THE PROPERTY.

<P>
 After years of slow deterioration to become one of the most prominent eyesores 
in the city, Palmdale Plaza is finally being razed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bulldozers won't be moving in for a few more weeks, city officials 
held a brief ceremony Wednesday to mark the long-awaited destruction of 
Palmdale's oldest shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I moved here in 1968, this was the heart of Palmdale, the heart and 
soul," Mayor Jim Ledford said of the dilapidated 50-year-old shopping center. 
"I'm looking forward to bringing it back." 
</P>
<P>
 With sledgehammers painted gold, the five council members Wednesday took 
whacks at a brick-faced building at the open-air plaza that once housed a dime 
store. The store, like most in the worn center on Sierra Highway just north of 
Palmdale Boulevard, has sat vacant and boarded shut for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 The only occupied building in the nine-acre center is a former toy store that 
the city bought several years ago and converted into a community activity 
center. Three arson fires, in 1992 and 1993, gutted portions of the plaza. The 
gutted buildings were demolished last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least three years, Palmdale has wanted to buy the center, located just 
a few blocks from City Hall in the heart of downtown. Acquiring the center has 
been a lengthy process, although one council member said the delays were in 
part caused by the center going into foreclosure and its owners declaring 
bankruptcy -- which allowed the city to save quite a bit of money. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economy worsened over the past few years, the value of the center 
declined. Councilman Jim Root said the city is paying about $3 million less 
than what was originally asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Palmdale will spend about $4.4 million to buy the center, said Carol 
Seidl, assistant to the city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay a Pomona-based firm, Three D Service, up to $310,000 to raze 
the plaza. The first phases of the demolition, which includes asbestos removal, 
is expected to take two months. Destruction of the other portions of the center 
will begin once the city's purchase of the remaining buildings is final. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city had said senior housing might be built on the shopping center 
property, Councilwoman Teri Jones said Palmdale's older residents do not 
support the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee studying revitalization of the city's downtown is developing ideas 
for the property, Ledford said. Possibilities include replacing the old 
shopping center with a new one, restaurants, medical facilities and even a 
sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty soon, it will be a bare lot, a plain canvas that will be ready to be 
painted," he said.

KID STUFF: THE GOOD DIRT; WHEN IT'S TIME TO PURSUE OUTSIDE INTERESTS, THERE'S 
NOTHING LIKE THE CLASSICS: MUD, BUGS AND MOTHER NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORINNE FLOCKEN, Corinne Flocken covers children's events for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahhhhh, spring. The time when every young man's -- and young lady's -- fancy 
turns to . . . mud. 
</P>
<P>
 What with the rise in temperatures and the sprinkling of spring rains, this is 
the time of year when children are eager to drink up the great outdoors in big 
gulps: wriggling toes in mud puddles, filling pockets with smashed blossoms, 
bugs and other seasonal booty. 
</P>
<P>
 To further cultivate these budding interests, kids can participate in one of 
the several nature- and science-themed programs next week at sites countywide. 
The activity may be as simple as a walk through the woods with a knowledgeable 
guide, or more advanced, such as a foray into forensic science or an 
exploration of coastal ecosystems. There are programs available for a wide 
range of ages; some are free, others will set you back a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The following is a small sample of what's out there. Unless otherwise 
indicated, advance registration is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and be sure to wipe your shoes before you come in the house. Environmental 
Nature Center 
</P>
<P>
 At just 2 1/2 acres, ENC is a great thing in a small package, says its 
administrator, Debra Clark. Twelve California plant communities are represented 
here, including valley grassland, redwood forest and desert environments. The 
wildflowers and flowering trees and bushes are "gorgeous" right now, said 
Clark, making this an ideal time to stop by. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no charge to visit the center, but for a fee ($1 per head, $10 
minimum per group) visitors can take advantage of several guided walks, 
including a "Thanks for Plants" program for preschool-age children and walks 
that teach older children how early Native Americans used plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer teachers who lead the tours encourage questions and hands-on 
exploration, Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like lines," she said with a laugh. "We gather around and learn and 
touch and smell (and) use all the senses." The nature center also offers a 
small museum and library, where visitors can see (and in some cases, touch) 
live and taxidermied animals, Native American artifacts and other neat stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Wednesday from 2:30 to 5:30 p.m. children are welcome to help out at the 
center, clearing weeds and maintaining the stream, pond and trails. There is no 
minimum age for this, Clark said, but she does ask that the volunteers are "old 
enough to help and not be baby-sat."

 Launch Pad Science Center 
</P>
<P>
 If a seasonal shower dampens your plans for an outdoor outing, the Launch Pad 
is standing by with a new series of science- and nature-themed workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Launch Pad is an interactive science center that opened in the Crystal Court 
shopping center last June and was designed as a preview for the Discovery 
Science Center, a 76,000-square-foot facility scheduled to open in Santa Ana in 
mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring Break Discovery Days at Launch Pad continue through April 7. The 
90-minute sessions meet at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. in the center's community room 
and may include slide shows, hands-on activities and crafts, according to the 
center's director of education, Janet Yamaguchi. The $7.50 fee per class 
includes admission to the Launch Pad's permanent exhibits. The series features 
"Dolphin Days" (Monday, April 4, for ages 5 to 14), which includes slides, 
discussion and an "echolocation" game led by Donna Wirfs of the Dolphin 
Project; "Forensic Science Foray" (Tuesday, April 5, for ages 10 to 14), which 
sets up a mock crime scene to teach fingerprinting and microscopic fiber 
identification; "The Magic of Origami" (Wednesday, April 6, for ages 7 to 12), 
which touches on mathematical principles through an ancient art, and "The Zoo 
Comes to Crystal Court" (April 7, for ages 5 to 14), an introduction to zoology 
with live animals from the Santa Ana Zoo.

 Oak Canyon Nature Center 
</P>
<P>
 It seems as if there's a nature program of some type going on at this 58-acre 
Anaheim Hills facility at just about all hours. In addition, there are six 
miles of hiking trails, and a kid-friendly interpretive center stocked with 
taxidermied birds and animals, plus some local bugs, snakes and critters. 
Admission to the nature center is free. 
</P>
<P>
 From Monday, April 4, through April 8, Oak Canyon hosts the last of its three 
inter-session programs. That week's topic: environmental awareness. Running 
from 9:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., the classes are open to youths age 6 to 12 and 
include a guided hike, games and crafts that cover such topics as recycling, 
water conservation and extinction. The fee is $8 per day; children can enroll 
for as many sessions as they like. Also, every Tuesday and Thursday the center 
hosts its Afternoon Adventures series of hikes and hands-on activities. Next 
week's focus is on rain forest animals.

 Santa Ana Zoo 
</P>
<P>
 Although the zoo's education department won't be hosting any special classes 
next week, it will mark the season with its first annual Spring Fling, an event 
that promises to give new meaning to the term "egg hunt." From 11 a.m. to 2 
p.m., children can visit four stations throughout the zoo that introduce 
different egg-laying animals and birds, from the flightless rhea to turtles and 
garden-variety chickens. Crafts at each station will reinforce the lessons, and 
those who complete all four stations receive a prize. Games, face-painting and 
nature-themed stories are also included. Free with zoo admission of $1 to $3.

 Upper Newport Bay Ecological Reserve and Regional Park 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors can enjoy nature by land or by sea through one of the park's ongoing 
public programs. 
</P>
<P>
 These include Canoe the Back Bay (every Saturday starting at 8:30 a.m.; $11) 
and naturalist-led tours (first and third Saturdays at 9 a.m.; free). Down the 
road, there's an Earth Day wingding on April 17 with nature-themed games, 
booths and hands-on activities. We suggest you get one of their program guides 
and tape it to your refrigerator door.

 Dana Point Harbor Youth and Group Facility 
</P>
<P>
 This waterfront facility offers a slew of spring break camps and workshops, 
but nature-seekers will probably be most drawn to its Ocean Awareness program. 
Running Monday, April 4, through April 8, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m., this series 
for 7- to 10-year-olds offers an overview of coastal ecosystems through 
exploration of local tide pools, beachfront and caves. Activities include 
specimen collection, fishing, body-boarding and a barbecue party. Fee: $80.

THERE'S NO TIME LIKE THE FIRST; WHAT STEWART KNEW IS STILL TRUE -- ALL WE NEED 
IS A FRIEND TO LEND A GUIDING HAND

<P>
 Maggie May put down her London Times and sighed at the latest news of Rod. 
Another of his long tours was ending; two more dates to go. In an arena in 
California, it said, a place called Anaheim. Could it be near Disneyland? She 
had always so wanted to go there but never got the chance. Ah, well. 
</P>
<P>
 She picked up the paper again and rustled it with a shake of age-spotted 
hands. Peering through thick spectacles, she returned to the part about Rod 
joking on stage about his pretty young wife. Every show, it said, he would quip 
about how his Rachel was just a year-old baby in nappies when "Maggie May" made 
him a star. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That line was a bit cruel of him, Maggie thought. She had only just turned 38 
the spring -- oh, it was more than 30 years ago! -- when the dear lad appeared. 
He was so apologetic about kicking his football into her rosebush, but witty, 
too. Eighteen, he was. She smiled with the memory of how he started coming over 
after work -- he wasn't really in school, then; poetic license, you know. And 
not much with a billiards stick, either, if truth be told. He would ring at her 
door, holding a football and an armload of LPs by Muddy Waters and Sam Cooke. 
He would play those records for hours. When it was nice, they would go outdoors 
and put the gramophone in the window, and Rod would practice his soccer, 
dancing to the beat of American rhythm and blues and kicking the ball against 
her garden fence without breaking rhythm. It seemed he loved his football as 
much as his music. But if you asked Maggie, Rod loved romance best of all. He'd 
literally crow with glee at the idea of loving. That's why she called him her 
little rooster. Could it be he was thinking of her when he got that famous 
haircut of his? That came years later. When Maggie knew him -- 1963, wasn't it? 
-- he wore a Beatles shag. 
</P>
<P>
 They had long parted by the time Rod wrote the song about her. He left her in 
late September -- the song was accurate about that much. But the Rod of "Maggie 
May," and, for that matter, all of his early records, was so like the boy she 
had loved. Such a hunger for experience. Such an eager youth, who wanted to go 
places, feel feelings, get it all down, and have a laugh along the way. Warm, 
brilliant records, they were, and that voice, singing those lyrics, gave you 
the sense of someone piecing out life the way we all have to, letting himself 
feel sad, but never forgetting to keep his chin up. Every picture tells a 
story, don't it? Yes, you could get through life with an attitude like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie thought back on how she didn't care for it at all when Rod started 
acting like such a peacock, flaunting his starlets and his high life. Oh, maybe 
she was a little jealous, but the truth is that celebrity is such a dull story 
to tell. She much preferred the hungry, eager, down-to-earth young fellow of 
"The Rod Stewart Album," "Gasoline Alley" and "Every Picture Tells a Story" to 
the glamorous bon vivant he soon became. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod hadn't always been one to flaunt himself so. Why, she'd heard that the 
first time he went to America, with the Jeff Beck Group, he was so frightened 
he sang from the wings, and they had to push him on stage. Maggie wondered 
whether Rod's young wife had even heard the albums he made with the Beck Group, 
"Beck-Ola" and "Truth." Some of the best stuff he'd ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Maggie had privately cringed to see Rod lose his bearings. What was he 
thinking, singing "Hot Legs" and "Da Ya Think I'm Sexy," and putting his 
starlets in his videos? What was the use of hiring backup bands as slick and 
impersonal as a London street in a downpour?  
</P>
<P>
 The old warmth could still come through, though. Maggie remembered how proud 
she was when Rod sang "The Killing of Georgie" in 1976. They're making such a 
fuss now about that American, Tom Hanks, playing a doomed gay man in the 
movies. Times were different when Rod sang "Georgie." It took real courage for 
him to write about a homosexual character with such sadness and affection. He 
suffered for it, too; there were vicious, degrading rumors of a sexual sort. 
Maggie would be the first (yes, literally!) to attest that nothing was further 
from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 She read everything about him and bought all his records, but she never went 
to one of his concerts. She would have felt odd, sitting there. What if he saw 
her and recognized her? What if he saw her and didn't? So she watched from 
afar. Lately she had seen the "Unplugged" show that played on the MTV. As she 
watched, she found herself wondering: Who does Rod think about now, when he 
sings of sunlight on an aging face? Why, he's 11 years older than I was then; 
next January he'll turn 50. Ah, he probably wouldn't want a card from me. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with her hearing not what it used to be, Maggie could tell from that 
"Unplugged" show that Rod's voice wasn't all it used to be, either. That husky 
richness had thinned a bit, and he skirted high notes as warily as her cat 
Flounce stalking mice. Let's hope that young wife of his makes sure he takes 
good care of himself and puts her foot down if he tries to be too much the bon 
vivant. The first cut isn't the deepest; it's the ones that come later, when 
the faculties start to dim -- Maggie could swear to that. She wondered whether 
Rod would ever sing about growing older. A different picture, a new story. Ah, 
but a hard one. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, never mind his voice showing some wear. The fans still love him, that's 
obvious. The paper mentioned that Rod's "Unplugged . . . And Seated" album had 
sold more than 2 million copies in the States, and that arenas were still 
filling up for him. He was doing some shows in the round now, including the 
ones in that place, Anaheim. A way to be closer, more intimate. Good, Maggie 
thought. His strength's in the intimacy, not the strutting. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning sun, when it's in your face, really shows your age.  
</P>
<P>
 But that don't worry me none, in my eyes you're everything.  
</P>
<P>
 Who does he think about when he sings that, now? Himself and me, back then? 
Himself and his wife, today? 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie put down the paper and breathed another sigh. In the end, she thought, 
he could be singing about any of us. Getting older, wishing for somebody to 
still be fond of us. She shut her eyes and thanked the dear, sweet boy for 
putting her in a song so lovely, and, for all his inventions, so true.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: DR. JOHN: "TELEVISION", MCA/GRP  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to know what rap might sound like if its practitioners put as much 
thought into melody and harmony as they do into rhythm and rhyme? 
</P>
<P>
 Look no further. 
</P>
<P>
 Following his roots-digging 1992 album, "Goin' Back to New Orleans," Dr. John 
journeys deep into the heart of funkness. 
</P>
<P>
 If John, a.k.a. Mac Rebennack, knows anything, it's how to craft seductive 
rhythms, and he makes the first nine songs here virtually into one long, 
swirling and soulful groove. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's funky foundation owes as much to the street-parade rhythms of New 
Orleans' Mardi Gras Indians as to pop-funk pioneers Sly Stewart and George 
Clinton. In his own distinctive way, Dr. John even carries forward the 
truth-is-funk and funk-can-save-the-world credo that's been Clinton's hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the songs are Rebennack originals -- the exceptions being his 
cover of Sly & the Family Stone's "Thank You (Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again)" 
and a super funked-up reading of the Motown classic "Money (That's What I 
Want)." 
</P>
<P>
 The subject at hand is as broad or as narrow as the listener wants it to be. 
Of course, you can sit back and very happily float on the musical textures Dr. 
John whips up with considerable help from drummer Fred Staehle and bassist 
David Barrard as well as Alvin (Red) Tyler on tenor sax and David (Fathead) 
Newman on tenor, alto and flute, guitarist Hugh McCrackin and trumpeter Charles 
Miller, among his large support cast. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's also possible to dig beneath the peppery rhymes and wordplay to find 
some subtle, and not-so-subtle, broadsides against a culture sorely in need of 
a stronger sense of community and values beyond instant gratification of the 
yearnings of the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 The title track sets the tone with a character study of a sap whose life is at 
the mercy of his raging hormones. "Lissen" dares to suggest we shut off all the 
distractions -- the TV, the CD, the FM, the MTV, the BET -- that keep us from 
hearing the messages and the voices that really matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's as topical as 1-900 phone sex lines ("Spaceship Relationship"), and as 
timeless as man's ability to deceive himself and his friends ("U Lie 2 Much"). 
</P>
<P>
 As if to bring the excursion back to Earth, the final two numbers get a bit 
bluesier. The album concludes with "Same Day Service," a rollicking, James 
Booker-inspired pledge of unconditional love that's as applicable to human 
relationships as to the spiritual ones Dr. John finds so sadly lacking in the 
world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. John and Sam & the Moonlighters play Friday at 8 and 10:30 p.m. at the 
Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $19.50. (714)

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE "5" ROYALES: "MONKEY HIPS AND RICE", (ANTHOLOGY), 
RHINO  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quite apart from the hit parade, musicians have always had their own standards 
of who the top acts of any given time are. For a wide chunk of the 1950s, The 
"5" Royales were one of the standards to aspire to in R & B. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Carolina-formed sextet (hence the quotes around the "5") had a few 
hits, but it was others who found the most success with their songs "Dedicated 
to the One I Love" and "Think." James Brown didn't only cop the latter song 
from the Royales, but much of his flashy stage act as well. In their heyday, 
the Royales were legends for their wildly acrobatic shows, which, coupled with 
formidable musical abilities, made them a group no performer wanted to follow 
onstage. One can only imagine the dance steps, but, fortunately, the potency of 
their music came across on record, and their studio achievements are well 
represented in this duo-disc Rhino collection. In an era when most acts filled 
the space between their hits with lightweight filler, Royales leader Lowman 
Pauling was consistently writing inventive, intelligent and emotive songs. 
</P>
<P>
 His most familiar songs exemplify the poles of his writing. Think of the 
tender bridge in "Dedicated": "Life can never be, exactly what you want it to 
be, But I can be satisfied, just knowing you are near." Then think of the 
ripping, insistent groove of "Think." The Royales' version is maybe half the 
speed of Brown's manic cover, but it's no less compelling, driven by 
hand-claps, rhythmic backing vocals, Johnny Tanner's soulful lead vocal and 
Pauling's nasty, bluesy guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most vocal-group R & B of the time, the Royales often pushed the guitar 
up front in their sound, and with good reason. Pauling's electric solos mix the 
furious, unpredictable bluster of Guitar Slim with the sort of concise, 
song-serving lines Steve Cropper later brought to the Stax Studios' recordings 
(Cropper, not incidentally, was a huge fan of the Royales). 
</P>
<P>
 There is some less-than immortal novelty fare among the album's 41 songs -- 
such as the forced double-entendre "Laundromat Blues" -- but most are real 
gems, including the bad rockin' "Messin' Up" and "Don't Be Ashamed," raucous 
"Women About to Make Me Go Crazy," and gospel-inflected doo-wop "Tears of Joy."

COMEDY: OVERTON DRAWS ON CNN FOR BIG PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

County Edition.

 When actor-comedian Rick Overton takes time off from the daily grind, he likes 
to ride motorcycles, the horsepower-stuffed ones such as his Harley-Davidson 
FLT or his Kawasaki 750. So it's no surprise that the vignette best 
exemplifying Overton's stand-up style would be a motorcycle tale. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, the North Hollywood resident decided to see how much he loved 
riding by embarking on a six-day cross-country trip. In the Midwest, however, 
things got sticky. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing. Weather was at my back the whole way," he said, referring to 
the ever-threatening skies. "In the motels, I'd watch the Weather Channel to 
see where that dark blue, watch-your-ass blob was. I was averaging 90 to 100 
m.p.h. through some points to stay ahead of it." 
</P>
<P>
 And that pretty much sums up his routine. He likes to keep one step ahead of 
what's happening, or going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My act is like a high-speed roller-coaster ride through social events, which 
hopefully makes you laugh and think," he said from home in a phone interview 
earlier this week. "My style is more to look at the bigger picture. For 
instance, my head. I'm following the rings of my hair loss, and they're moving 
at the same rate as the hole in the ozone layer (and the deforestation of the 
rain forest). I've worked it all out on paper. My head is directly tied in to 
the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Overton, who plays Standing Room Only in Fullerton through Sunday, also 
grumbles about the much-ballyhooed information superhighway as a bad marriage 
of too much data and too much technology. Even something as simple as the 
convenience of cashless tollbooths has him seeing Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
 At first blush, he says, it's kind of cool just having a bar code scanned as 
you go through and not having to worry about having a quarter to toss into the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "But think," he continues, "they know where you are. You're probably showing 
up on a huge (tracking) map somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 To find his material, the 21-year stand-up veteran doesn't have to look far. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just watch CNN. The jokes write themselves," he said, adding that anywhere 
from 30% to 50% of his hourlong sets is of the political-topical variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan native, who spends a week or two each month on the road doing 
comedy, was exposed early to Lenny Bruce and Mort Sahl, who would open for a 
jazz quartet led by Overton's father, the late composer Hall Overton. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical lineage, however, didn't rub off, and a teen-aged Overton headed 
into acting and comedy in 1972, taking the topical nature of Bruce and Sahl 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a struggling actor in New York, one way to be seen was to do comedy," he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, he formed a comedy team whose act included sketches, routines and 
quick thinking. He did that for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still like to take an idea and riff on it, like verbal jazz. When I get 
bored, I like to do improv." 
</P>
<P>
 When not riding or doing comedy, he keeps busy looking for film roles. His 
credits include "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Groundhog Day," "Beverly Hills Cop" and 
"Airplane 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, he played a knight in "High Crusade," which is waiting to be 
distributed in the United States. It's about a bunch of knights who manage to 
seize an alien ship in 1300s England. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing you could give those nitwit knights was a high-tech alien 
spaceship," Overton quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, he has been seen on NBC's "Seinfeld" and Fox's "The Edge," "Bill & 
Ted's Excellent Adventure" and "Babes." He was also part of "Comic Relief" this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter Sellers is my hero. He did lead character work, riding his ability to 
make you laugh. That's been my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 He would prefer to concentrate on such roles, but he knows that 
less-than-ideal parts pay the rent. It's a constant balancing act. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough, but at the same time, you have to plan and be strategic. The pure 
actor in me says, 'I hate this role.' But the agent part of me says, 'You have 
to do it.' " 
</P>

DOING EDITION; THE WELL-READ HAVE MORE THAN A FEW PLACES TO TURN TO FIND THE 
WELL-READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Humanity can be sliced into endless categories: those who like anchovies, and 
those who don't; those who can watch golf on television, and those who consider 
it a form of cruel and unusual punishment; those who worship Madonna, and those 
who run screaming from the room at the mere mention of her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Used-book shops offer another dividing line. Some people would rate spending 
an afternoon among stacks of moldering books about as appealing as traffic 
school. Others consider used-book shops a sort of sacred sanctuary, a place 
where time stands still and dusty treasures await. 
</P>
<P>
 Count me among the latter. I can disappear for hours among the shelves, only 
to emerge with books whose appeal I have trouble explaining to family and 
friends. Among the titles on my shelves: "New York's Awful Excursion Boat 
Horror" (a turn-of-the-century disaster account complete with gruesome 
pictures), "Pennsylvania Report of Committee and Testimony, Railroad Riots 
1878" (a congressional report, no pictures), and the Victorian-era "What a 
Young Man Ought to Know" (with its spirited diatribe against -- gasp! -- 
dancing). 
</P>
<P>
 It's not a collection so much as an accumulation, a record of momentary buying 
impulses and quirks of personal taste. And they're all books of an 
unpredictable kind you would never find in the chain booksellers, even those 
discount mega-stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Used-book shops are full of discoveries waiting to be made, but their wares 
certainly go beyond the esoteric. By far the biggest customer base for most 
used-book shops is not collectors but general readers, cost-conscious types 
who'd rather not pay retail and others in search of books that have gone out of 
print. 
</P>
<P>
 Some county shops sell only used paperbacks, offering customers exchange 
credits for books they bring into the store. Romance novels tend to be popular, 
as do science fiction novels. But Jim Schroeder of the Paperback Exchange in 
San Clemente said he and wife, Mary, have steady customers for everything from 
Western fiction to history books. 
</P>
<P>
 At their shop, used paperbacks sell for half the cover price, and trade-ins 
are two-for-one (most paperback shops offer similar schemes). At retail 
bookstores, new paperbacks often sell for $7 and more, Schroeder said. "That's 
a price that you used to be able to buy a hardback for a few years back, so 
(customers) are glad to come in and recycle their books, as it were." 
</P>
<P>
 Even shops that carry a selection of rare and collectible books rely on 
non-collectors for most of their business -- as much as 90% for the Book Baron 
in Anaheim, according to owner Bob Weinstein. For prices ranging from a few 
dollars on up, customers can buy clean, hardcover copies of the classics, 
popular fiction or works that have gone out of print (most used-book shops 
operate a search service to help locate those hard-to-find books). 
</P>
<P>
 The line that divides reader and collector can be a fine one, though. Ask Art 
Stone of Villa Park. "I never thought of myself as a collector, never knew 
there was a community of collectors," Stone said by telephone. He was an avid 
reader, however, and decided on an impulse to take a class in book collecting 
about 20 years ago at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out I was already a book collector, and learned there should be a 
plan to what you collect," said Stone, who now specializes in baseball fiction, 
early Americana and Orange County authors. He haunts the county's used-book 
shops on a regular basis, and "if I come home without a book, I'm disappointed. 
I haven't satisfied my craving." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has a wide range of used-book dealers, from the cavernous Book 
Baron in Anaheim, with a wide general selection, to a handful of dealers 
specializing in collectible and antiquarian books, such as tiny Lorson's Books 
and Prints in Fullerton, and the Book Sail in Orange, which sells mostly by 
catalogue and is open only by appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling in the middle range are several general used-book stores, all of which 
carry at least some collectible books. Cahill's, in Fountain Valley, has a 
large general stock in addition to a selection of literary first editions, as 
does the Bookman in Orange. The Book Store in Costa Mesa features a small but 
wide-ranging stock, from cookbooks to literary first editions. Book Harbor in 
Fullerton, which is back in business after being damaged in a fire a few years 
back, is another general shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Some shops specialize. Book Carnival in Orange features used and new mystery 
and science fiction -- one of the hottest collecting areas -- and hosts 
signings by authors. Aladdin Books in Fullerton features a general used and 
collectible section in addition to specialized collections in cinema and 
performing arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Book Baron is the big guy on the block. Owner Weinstein opened it in 1980 with 
3,000 square feet of shop space, and has since expanded several times to the 
present behemoth of 20,000 square feet. There are aisles and aisles of general 
used books in addition to collectible first editions and books in such areas as 
Western fiction, military history and Western Americana. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop recently made a sale of 11,000 books to a single customer, a library 
in South Korea. The most recent expansion has allowed for a big selection of 
used magazines -- from Playboy to National Geographic -- and a section for new 
books, purchased at a discount from publishers and failed bookshops. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his stock consists of affordable used books, but there also are 
collectible books in a wide variety of categories. Weinstein said first 
editions of a few recent books are going for astronomical sums, particularly 
first books by authors who went on to greater fame. "A Time to Kill" by John 
Grisham, published in 1989, can sell for more than $2,000; Stephen King's 
"Carrie" sells for $600 to $700. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think the book has to be old to be valuable," Weinstein said, 
but clearly that's not the case. These kinds of prices have lured many 
speculators into the book market, but Weinstein cautioned that such price rises 
can be hard to predict and may not hold, as only time will tell if the authors 
will keep their popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lorson, owner of Lorson Books and Prints, keeps a small stock and 
prefers to specialize in proven writers and works. He marvels at some of the 
prices commanded by new works of fiction, such as the Grisham book. "You can 
buy a pretty good book for $2,000, in my opinion, and that wouldn't be one," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The advice of Lorson, and other dealers and collectors, is for beginning 
collectors to buy authors and works they have a personal interest in, rather 
than buying for speculation. The first rule of collecting, he added, is to buy 
copies in the best condition possible -- which isn't always easy. "Books are 
made to be handled, yet collectors are looking for pristine condition," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most works of modern fiction are collectible only in their first edition (a 
term used interchangeably with first printing) and in their original dust 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dust jackets are of prime importance," said Michael Cahill, owner of Cahill's 
Book Store in Fountain Valley. First editions of "The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott 
Fitzgerald have sold for about $25,000 at auction, in fine condition and in the 
jacket, Cahill said. On the other hand, "I've sold two copies without jackets 
in the $350 range." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule holds true for newer collectibles as well. "If a book is going to go 
up in value, it's going to be a copy in fine condition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think collecting books as an investment is something to 
recommend. It's too capricious," said collector Stone. "That shouldn't be the 
primary lure." 
</P>
<P>
 His greatest joy as a collector, he said, is coming across a book on his want 
list. "When you find something you've been looking for for a long time, that's 
enjoyable," he said. "Especially when it's underpriced." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Masino of Newport Beach started collecting about six years ago, beginning 
with some of his favorite authors -- William Styron, Norman Mailer, Irwin Shaw 
and James Jones. "I was just looking to read every one of their books," Masino 
said, and he started haunting the local used-book shops for reading copies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then when you notice one book for $10 and one for $150, you start wondering 
what the difference is," he said. Through talking to dealers, he started 
learning about the hobby of collecting, and then asked himself, "If I'm going 
to buy these books, why not buy a nice first-edition copy?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has since moved to collecting some classic American authors, such as 
Hemingway, Steinbeck and Faulkner. His collection was helped along by a bit of 
luck. An architect and theater consultant, Masino was traveling frequently to 
Las Vegas to work on the MGM Grand Hotel and won four $1,000 video-poker 
jackpots in six months. The winnings made him a popular figure among local book 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Well, heck, I'll go buy something I wouldn't normally buy,' " he 
said. Among his purchases: a $750 first-edition copy of "The Grapes of Wrath." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fun," Masino said. "I've enjoyed the book collecting, whether it's 
$200 books or $10 books." 
</P>
<P>
 Masino stressed that the best source of information on collecting is the 
dealers themselves, most of whom are passionate about the subject of books and 
more than willing to help guide a collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them started as collectors themselves, such as Brad Wilson, owner of 
the Book Store in Costa Mesa. He collected for years, until he had filled a 
double garage with books. "It just came to a point in our lives when we just 
decided that maybe we ought to do this as a business," he said. Opening a 
bookstore "was sort of in the back of my mind, but it wasn't something I 
planned on." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Nancy, opened their shop two years ago. Like most book 
dealers, they work to personalize their business, keeping an eye out for books 
in their buyers' areas of interest. It's a labor of love, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the service end of it is a big part of it, a real key," he said. "The 
different people you meet is one of the really nice things about the business." 
Footnotes 
</P>
<P>
 Used book stores take all forms -- from small specialty shops offering a 
handful of antiquarian treasures and paperback stores trading heavily in 
romances and mysteries, to general used-book marts that carry a little bit of 
everything. The following sampler of some of Orange County's bookshops includes 
all types. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other sources of used books: thrift stores, some antique shops, even 
garage sales. Libraries often have sales of used, donated books that can turn 
up some treasures; the library at UC Irvine and the Laguna Beach Library 
operate year-round shops with limited hours.

SURFING / ROCKIN' FIG & DAVE: FORECAST: MEGA 'BREAKERS' EXPECTED TO HIT THE 
BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you notice it? 
</P>
<P>
 It's spring! That means the grommets are out of school and about to invade the 
water and could be coming to a beach near you. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach lifeguard Capt. Bill Richardson said in anticipation of 
spring break, lifeguards at the city beach are being increased from 12 to 75. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Richardson said, scheduling is a problem because community colleges 
are out this week, followed by high schools next week. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's going to be wall to wall surfboards before the Big Bunny comes to 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig, do you have any hints on dealing with heavy crowds? 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. Get down there early, because the early bird always gets the worm. Since 
there's lots of people, you might want to get in before everyone else does, 
probably right around the 6 to 7 o'clock time slot.  
</P>
<P>
 Geez, isn't that a bit early? 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you want to get some quality surf time. Remember, there's gonna be a 
lot of egos out there, so position is the most important thing going. Don't 
shoulder-hop anyone, and try to show a little respect out there for other 
surfers.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's call it Wave Ethics 101. 
</P>
<P>
 OK. You've bought the $350 board. It's got da kine surf graphics and decals 
that spell out "MOM." You've shelled out another $250 on the wet suit alone. 
Now it's time to surf, and you want to do it up at your home break, but it's 
crowded. All those people, and on weekends it's worse. It boils down to making 
a decision: Do you want to be The Terminator and mow down anyone who gets in 
your way? Or Joe Cool, Mr. Soul Archer, a surfer whose attitude is, "The ocean 
is our Mother; we should all share in her glories?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there's a happy medium. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Rockin' Fig surf differently in crowds? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, I do. You gotta change or you don't get any waves. Like the other day, 
this guy and I were both dropping in; he went straight down, and I had just 
gotten up and banked a bottom turn. Now, in my book I had priority, not only 
because I was farther back in the tube, but I had turned. Well, he doesn't give 
me priority and he's dropping RIIIIGHT in front of me. It's collision time. But 
I hit a hard turn, goosed it and went right around him. Whoooooa! I cranked the 
turn around him and came out in the barrel, high and dry.  
</P>
<P>
 Did you let him know he got in your way? 
</P>
<P>
 When I paddled back to the lineup, he wasn't there. I told his friend that his 
buddy is gonna get hurt if he keeps getting in people's way like that.  
</P>
<P>
 Hurt? Like you were gonna punch the dude out? 
</P>
<P>
 Naw, he was a hazard. I might have speared the guy with my board. We were on a 
collision course.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig said he recently surfed at Trestles and noticed that a berm holding back 
the lagoon had been breached. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably caused with all the new rain runoff we've been having. It's 
changed the place a bit and the way it breaks.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Surfrider Foundation, not only can heavy runoff change the 
beach contour, it can also cause the bacteria count in the water to soar. After 
a heavy rain, it's recommended that surfers stay out of the water for several 
days, a foundation spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County didn't have any major winter storms, lifeguards said. It's the 
powerful storms that scour the coastline and can change beach contour that can 
cause dangerous rip currents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our coast is pretty normal-looking right now," San Clemente lifeguard 
supervisor Richard Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente lifeguards will be patrolling in Jeeps and monitoring the beach 
in towers during spring break. They also have about five lifeguards who live 
nearby on call, "just in case the weather warms up considerably," Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig offered some advice for those surfers who are just getting back into shape 
and hoping to catch some waves during spring break. 
</P>
<P>
 Check out the situation. Look for the drift and see if there's any obstacles. 
If you're surfing next to a pier, you definitely don't want to paddle out on 
the side where the swell is pushing, because you're going to get racked up.  
</P>
<P>
 If you don't know which direction the swell is coming from, don't be 
embarrassed. Ask the lifeguards, Richardson and Chew said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lifeguards are friendly," Richardson said. "And they don't mind it at all 
when people come up and ask them questions."

DO IT!: SPRING INTO ACTION: TAKE A WALK ON THE WILDFLOWER SIDE 
</P>

<P>
 It's spring and time for wildflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 With a boost from the recent rainstorms, wildflowers are beginning to appear 
throughout the locals hills. If the warm weather holds through the weekend, 
blossoms will continue to open up, making for a strong display in the weeks 
ahead and through early May. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best local spots to see a lot of flowers without a lot of walking 
is Santiago Oaks Regional Park in Orange. A Tuesday walk in the park revealed 
numerous species already starting to bloom: baby blue eyes, Johnny jump-ups, 
wild cucumber, purple nightshade, blue-eyed grass, fuchsia-flowered 
gooseberries and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A good walk for flower buffs starts at the visitors building in the park and 
switchbacks up the ridge above, along the Windes Nature Trail, a loop trip that 
can be combined with the Pacifica trail loop. Combined, the two trails take 35 
or 40 minutes and are moderately strenuous. Besides the flowers, it offers some 
sweeping views of the surrounding foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the the plants already in bloom, others expected to blossom 
soon include fiddlenecks, sticky monkey flowers, California peonies and 
California poppies. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the park was burned in last season's Anaheim Hills brush fire, but in 
at least one sense that may be a boon to nature buffs. Some plant species grow 
and flower only after a fire, and some of those may be found in the park as the 
season progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangers at the park are well-versed in wildflowers and print a running list of 
the blooms seen in the park. They also maintain a recorded wildflower hot line 
( (714) 538-4429). 
</P>
<P>
 Several other county parks will offer flower-viewing opportunities in the 
weeks ahead. These include: Whiting Ranch Regional Park, Aliso and Wood Canyons 
Regional Park, Oak Canyon Nature Center, Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park, 
Tucker Wildlife Sanctuary and the Environmental Nature Center. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Wildflowers at Santiago Oaks Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Daily, 7 a.m. to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: 2145 N. Windes Drive, Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Exit the Newport (55) Freeway at Katella Avenue and go east. 
Follow the road as it becomes Santiago Canyon Road, and turn left on Windes 
Drive. Park in the lot at the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 538-4400.

REWIND: SINATRA, ARMED AND DANGEROUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year after Frank Sinatra won an Oscar for his passionate performance as 
Maggio in "From Here to Eternity," the scrawny man with big voice again 
explored the role of the edgy loner in the far lesser known film "Suddenly." 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly" is a simmering thriller set in a lazy, rural California town (the 
film's title is the city's unusual name) where the strait-laced sheriff 
(Sterling Hayden) has nothing better to do than roam the streets and chat with 
shopkeepers and children. 
</P>
<P>
 That idyllic setting is quickly set on its ear when a legion of state and 
federal authorities descends on town, which will soon host a surprise visit 
from the President. The commander-in-chief is passing through on his way to Los 
Angeles, and the Secret Service suspects that Suddenly will be the site of an 
assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Sinatra, who plays bloodthirsty gun-for-hire John Baron, a World War II 
veteran who was decorated for his battlefield acumen before he was discharged 
for his sadistic streak. Despicable in every way, Baron is an angry brute with 
a sharpshooter's eye and a chip on his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The film holes Baron and his two henchmen up in a hillside home overlooking 
the railroad station where the President will be arriving in a few hours. The 
sheriff stumbles onto the trio of hired hoods and is taken prisoner along with 
the home's family. From there on, the movie ticks away the tense minutes as the 
uneasy group, and the audience, await the President's train. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden as the stiff, square-jawed lawman and the always enjoyable James 
Gleason, playing the patriarch of the captive family, are watchable, but the 
small movie clearly belongs to Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 After gun-whipping a hostage and scolding a frightened youngster, Sinatra 
stares straight into the camera, his eyes glazed and fierce, and describes the 
power of guns, how they make him someone, how they make him God. In his voice, 
you can hear the power that made him a great singer and the passion that made 
him a film star. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly" (1954), directed by Lewis Allen. 77 minutes. Not rated.

KIDS ON FILM: 'D2' SCORES WITH GOOD AND BAD SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "D2 The Mighty Ducks," an injured NHL hopeful (Emilio Estevez) leads a 
peewee all-star hockey team to a Junior Olympics, but his stated goal of 
"having fun" is temporarily derailed by his love of the sponsor's bounty and 
hatred for the vicious team from Iceland. (Rated PG) Early on in the movie, the 
team sponsor takes coach Gordon Bombay to a Hollywood cocktail party and 
observes that nothing is as it appears to be on the surface. Which is also true 
of the Disney movie they inhabit.  
</P>
<P>
 In it, coach Bombay professes to champion having fun and doing your best. Yet 
winning and flag waving are clearly the point. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is a dream of harmony amid ethnic diversity. Yet, they all hate their 
rivals because they're, well, from Iceland.  
</P>
<P>
 The coach doesn't want them to stoop to the level of the violent, 
unsportsmanlike Icelanders. Yet when the Americans earn time in the penalty box 
for intentional injury, it seems to be a matter of pride.  
</P>
<P>
 These discrepancies did not in the least bother kids who loved this movie (the 
weekend's highest grosser) and expressed a remarkable tolerance for ambiguity. 
Some, conditioned to the cliches of sports movies, thought they were getting 
the standard message. Which was, according to Shahna Shevitz, 12: "It doesn't 
matter if you win or lose, it's how you play the game, or something like that. 
Or you tried your hardest, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 But others understood the movie's real mixed message -- winning isn't 
everything; it's the only thing. And its corollary -- when They do the wrong 
thing, it's wrong, but when We do it, it's OK.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Nolan Sainick, a hockey player himself, put it this way: "Good 
violence is when you're moving someone out of the way, or when they try to 
fight back when you're trying to get a goal. Bad violence is when they knock 
you into the wall for no reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the tattooed "bash brothers," the all star team's teen-age goons, were 
"bad and everything, but they worked together" for the sake of the team, Shahna 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the two female team members, who didn't get to play much, pushed and 
shoved their way to victory. "That was good," said Emily Boshneck, 11, a figure 
skater who also plays hockey. "They were sticking up for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience was teeming with kids, some carrying their skateboards and 
helmets into the theater, and most of whom seemed to have seen the original 
"Mighty Ducks" and had their favorites. I heard them yell out to the screen, 
"Give it to Luis!" when I, who missed the original, was still trying to 
straighten out the characters. 
</P>
<P>
 The original was more upbeat, the girls agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Emily said, "I liked this one better. They matured more. They learned 
how to work as a team." Moreover, she and her friends decided, this sequel had 
an original plot as opposed to a "Home Alone" rehash where the hero, Shahna 
said, was simply "lost again." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was more of a story in this one," said Brian Kazarian, 14. "There were 
more hockey scenes, which was better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin Grant, 15, said: "It was overdone the second time. I play hockey, 
and I thought it was cheap what they did. It was kind of fake. Like a goalie 
would move out of the way when a guy made a shot. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Corny" was the word Kevin used for the team's final period uniform change 
from red, white and blue all-star jerseys to their old "Mighty Ducks" jerseys, 
accompanied by a swelling brass orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the kids didn't think about any particular Olympic ice skater when 
coach Bombay was deliberately whacked in the knee by an opponent -- twice.  
</P>
<P>
 But Brian said: "It's got to the point where violence has got into sports. 
People like to see that." In the movie, he said, it may have been overdone, 
"but I liked it."

BISTRO IS A PERFECT AVENUE TO RELAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bellflower is not exactly a hotbed of ambitious cuisine. When the much-praised 
Magdalena's closed two years back, that pretty much left Cafe Camelias as the 
genre's sole local representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the owners of Cafe Camelias -- among them the chef, Richard Alm -- have 
endeavored to improve the situation. Their brainchild is the new Boulevard 
Bistro, on the very spot to which Magdalena's once drew crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant has been totally remodeled and given a spacious, almost 
classical appearance. The walls are warm ocher, painted with a soft sponge; 
flocks of coppery lampshades hang from the ceiling; one lone booth, upholstered 
in a rococo fabric, sits rather defiantly against a back wall. Tropical plants 
add exotic charm; short-backed designer chairs add style. But the crowds have 
not yet rediscovered this location. Perhaps it's because Boulevard Bistro is 
not as flashy as Magdalena's -- or as French, despite the handful of Art 
Nouveau prints posted around the two dining rooms.  
</P>
<P>
 It offers something else: solid Mediterranean fare at reasonable prices. This 
is a restaurant where you can get paella in a huge iron pan, pasta alla 
puttanesca done with rustic flair or even a simple plate of roast chicken. 
There are a few holes in the cooking, but to tell the truth, in many ways this 
restaurant is better than Magdalena's ever was. 
</P>
<P>
 You can relax here, too. Magdalena's could feel crowded, almost 
claustrophobic, but the tables at Boulevard Bistro have more space around them. 
In fact, you may have to relax; some of the cooking -- pizzas and certain main 
dishes, for instance -- is done at a deliberate, often downright slow pace. 
Things start out quickly, anyway. When you're seated, you find a basket of 
warm, homemade rolls and little crocks of aioli , garlicky mayonnaise mixed 
with whole roasted garlic cloves. You'll probably see this sauce again later in 
the meal. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, you might see more aioli right away when you order an appetizer. 
Good, greaseless fried calamari are the perfect foil for it. The aioli is a bit 
much, however, on the grilled artichoke, which is already somewhat oily from 
grilling. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly good appetizer choice would be the escargot, prepared in an 
inventive manner. Instead of serving them with the usual garlic butter, Alm 
tosses half a dozen snails with garlic, tomatoes, prosciutto and onions.  
</P>
<P>
 The best salad is probably the classic Greek: greens, tomatoes, Kalamata 
olives, dry cubes of feta cheese and a muscular vinaigrette with a bite to it. 
Warm rock shrimp salad runs a close second, tossed with red bell peppers, the 
flavorful little shrimp and a garlic and balsamic vinegar dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the menu is pizza or pasta. The pizzas have medium-thick crusts and 
toppings such as wild game sausage, large shrimp or ripe black olives. Just as 
at Spago, there's a smoked salmon pizza, but somebody here forgot to leave off 
the mozzarella.  
</P>
<P>
 The pastas tend to be rich -- in fact, too rich for the true Mediterranean 
taste. There are ravioli filled with goat cheese and salmon and then drenched 
in a fresh herb-Champagne sauce; just fine, if you only eat one. Similarly, 
rigatoni Bolognese come with a hearty beef ragout for a sauce, about three 
times as much meat and sauce as good pasta should have. 
</P>
<P>
 It is at the main course that this restaurant really shines. No visit here 
seems justified without a helping of Alm's paella. At $17.95, it's the priciest 
thing on the menu -- but when you consider that the serving is really big 
enough for three, it starts to look like a steal. The components (besides rice, 
of course) are sausage, chicken, crawfish, calamari, mussels, clams and 
scallops, and they blend marvelously. The chef uses just the right amount of 
saffron and then cooks it perfectly so that the rice forms a golden crust on 
the inside of the pan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouillabaisse is also on this menu: more aioli, natch, plus the same seafoods 
as the paella. But instead of being a saffrony casserole, it's a soup based on 
an unspectacular stock. I'd take the garlic prawns or the lamb chops or maybe 
even a plate of roast chicken over the bouillabaisse. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, those other dishes are remarkable competition. The prawns are 
sauteed in a garlic and white wine reduction, served on a bed of white beans 
and andouille sausage. The free-range chicken is roasted with lemon and 
balsamic vinegar to a nice tenderness.  
</P>
<P>
 And the lamb chops are as tender as a baby's kiss, broiled with balsamic 
vinegar. Their only problem is an overly rich herb sauce. In fact, I've more 
than once wished there were a little judicious restraint in the sauces here. 
The great virtue of Mediterranean cuisine is simplicity -- there's no need to 
dress everything up. 
</P>
<P>
 That's also true at dessert, when pastries come cloaked in vast pools of creme 
anglaise. Pastry chef Frank Huyghe has talent, though; he was formerly pastry 
chef at Champagne in Los Angeles, where he worked with the masterful Patrick 
Healy, and his works are beautiful and well conceived. His three-layered 
cappuccino mousse torte, for instance, is the essence of chocolate and 
espresso; his light, creamy strawberry shortcake leaves your palate refreshed. 
He makes a macadamia nut pie laden with coconut and bits of chocolate and a 
plum and pear tart I think would have been spectacular had it tasted fresher. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe when the crowds materialize, this will not be a problem. I hope not. If 
Boulevard Bistro keeps up the good work, that shouldn't be too far in the 
future. And then, who knows, Bellflower might be in for a culinary, er, 
flowering. 
</P>
<P>
 Boulevard Bistro is high-end moderate. Appetizers are $5.95 and $6.95. Pastas 
are $6.95 to $8.95. Pizzas are $8. Main courses are $10.95 to $17.95.

LOST IN O.C.: FELLOW CAT-LOVERS: TELL ME, HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

<TEXT>
<P>
 My girlfriend and I were camping in a tent in my back yard recently. This had 
nothing to do with the earthquake. Rather, I'm just too cheap and lazy to take 
her to a real campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The experience isn't much different from real camping, and it's always better, 
neighbor relations-wise, to wake up in the back yard instead of on the front 
lawn. What at-home camping misses, though, is the element of surprise: There's 
no wondering if a bear or raccoon will show up; no trying to dissolve your 
Swiss Miss with a finger because you forgot a spoon; no Bob Dole-shaped 
insects. It's a little tame. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank God for cats. Around 3 a.m. my girlfriend and I were awakened by the 
distinctive sound of a small animal using his head as a battering ram, trying 
to get into the tent.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Smokehouse. It was always Smokehouse -- the all-gray master of all he 
surveyed -- doing whatever brilliant thing came into his head. You have to 
wonder just what resembling a thought process went on in that furry mind: "Now 
I'll meow from midnight until I'm let in so I can stand on Jim's stomach for a 
minute as he tries to sleep; now I'll knock things over until he lets me out. " 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's missing, and I sure miss him. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 15 he took off over the back fence, back hairs bristling and making 
that otherworldly yowling cats use to presage a fight. Both pre- and 
post-neutering, he's always been a scrapper. He'd add new territories; we'd add 
up vet bills. A true predator, in his prime we had to put a bell around his 
neck to warn birds, and he'd still litter the yard with feathers.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, you might be thinking, "picks fights; eats birds: not management 
material." It doesn't make him sound especially lovable, but he was -- and I 
hope still is somewhere. Many cats aren't particularly demonstrative. I always 
wonder about those stories of animals trekking across the nation to be reunited 
with their humans, because ours could scarcely be bothered moving 14 inches to 
say hi. It was an understated affection. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade ago he was a young stray hanging out at a Stater Bros. parking lot. 
He jumped into my next door neighbor's car, hitched a ride home, got out, 
walked straight in our front door, and he'd been there ever since.  
</P>
<P>
 I'm not overly mystical-minded, but there are moments when you can feel a 
shift, a cold instant when you know things will be different from then on. My 
roommate and I each felt that way as Smokehouse went over the fence, though he 
had done the same countless times before. Now he's gone, leaving only fleas and 
memories. 
</P>
<P>
 We've scoured the neighborhood. My roommate has put up posters and knocked on 
doors for blocks, meeting neighbors we'd never bothered to introduce ourselves 
to in 15 years. We've peered through fences, under bushes, checked the animal 
shelters repeatedly. I rushed down to the O.C. Humane Society upon word they'd 
received a gray cat over a mile from my house and so wanted it to be Smokehouse 
that I believed it was, briefly, though only one hell of a fight could have 
lightened him five pounds and changed the contours of his head. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of nights later I thought I heard a cat fight in the distance. I ran 
to the next block and couldn't hear anything but a noisy St. Pat's party. A 
reveler on the lawn (Hey! Get a tent!) said he'd seen a gray cat down the block 
just 15 minutes earlier, which kept me out looking for another hour. Other 
neighbors reported spotting it too, and I started to suspect that our cat was 
just messing with our minds. It turns out instead that there is a new gray cat 
on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I see a shadow or crumpled sweat shirt on the dark floor, I briefly 
see him. How the hell do people have children and bear to ever let them out of 
their sight? This isn't my blood; I haven't experienced the labor and birth. 
It's a cat , with a brain smaller than those little cans of gourmet food he 
insisted on, and I'm going nuts wondering about him.  
</P>
<P>
 At least when humans check out, it generally isn't over a fence, howling. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't even grieve properly when you don't know what's happened. Is he 
still off somewhere, waging the cat version of the Hundred Years' War? Did a 
younger, more spry cat do him in? Did he get wedged in a woodpile, wounded and 
is now slowly expiring? Did humans get him? Tires? Is he in someone's trash can 
? As nice as it's been finally meeting some neighbors, you wonder about some, 
"Is he secretly a cat-kicker ?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Smokehouse is on a spirit quest. Maybe he wants to spend his golden days 
sniffing out a new territory. Perhaps he just found a home with a more liberal 
chicken-serving hand. 
</P>
<P>
 As in times of non-pet tragedy, some people have been a real help, sharing 
their experiences and stories. It's amazing how many pets do go missing for a 
time, only to show up weeks later, smelling of cheap perfume. One friend said 
her cat disappeared, who knows where, for four months. Another knows someone 
with a cat that showed up a year later. It had been living the whole time in an 
apartment right across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to think that one of these days Smokehouse will pull up with a 
Citroen and an Oxford accent, explaining, "I didn't want to come back until I 
knew I could make you proud of me." But I'm not especially counting on this. 
</P>
<P>
 I find what little humor I can in this -- I like to think I'll be able to 
laugh at myself on my deathbed. But I think our cat is gone, and it's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you should happen to think you see him -- he's about 15 pounds, has a nick 
in his left ear and a lighter patch of fur on his otherwise all-gray self -- 
please give a holler in this direction. There is a likeness of him above, along 
with a variety of disguises he might be affecting. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an olive tree in my back yard that was recently pruned by some yard 
butchers, and my girlfriend gave me a bird feeder in hopes that the denuded 
tree would feel a little better about itself if there were more birds around. 
It seems to be working, and I've been diligent about keeping the little guys 
supplied with seed. They've also been pecking away at the cat food we still 
leave out for Smokehouse, an indignity he certainly wouldn't have abided. 
</P>
<P>
 I like these birds but have to admit that if a yardful of chubby, feed-stuffed 
birds attracted my cat back to the yard, I wouldn't so much mind raking up a 
few feathers.

3-HOUR TOUR: THE LAB: X MARKS THE SPOT TO TEST THEORIES OF RETAIL; FROM THE 
LIVING ROOM TO THE (GYPSY) DEN, IT'S AN ALTERNATIVE TO HANGING AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They call it "the anti-mall," and design and merchandise at the Lab, a 
40,000-square-foot complex in Costa Mesa, "alternative." But even if a mall by 
any other name is still a mall, it's way more fun than its mainstream big 
brother a few blocks to the north.  
</P>
<P>
 11 to 11:10: The entrances say it all. At one end, just inside the rough-hewn 
concrete-and-pipe ocher exterior, a wall of doors in all shapes and sizes 
provides backdrop for old shoes, LPs and dried flowers, each perhaps suggesting 
one of the shops within; opposite, a triptych of alcoves features a Virgin Mary 
flanked by a pair of Cupids, one with a Heineken can. The entrance at the rear 
boasts a huge fountain composed of 40 or so rusting barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex is anchored by an area called the Living Room, which has a pool 
table, comfortable chairs and couches, old Persian rugs, a red-velvet-curtained 
stage booked most evenings and weekend afternoons, a jigsaw puzzle, a TV and 
even a mirror. Return here at the end of your tour and hang out until 
Generation X hits middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 11:10 to 11:25: A fabulous sunflower with huge yellow petals and a blue face 
called "The Seedling" welcomes you into "Space for the Moment," an exhibit of 
wire sculptures by David Torosian at the Gallery. Gently endearing, mildly 
archetypal works include "The King" and a blue "Mermaid" with rusted hair and 
marbles for eyes. (Exhibits change monthly.) 
</P>
<P>
 11:25 to 11:40: Half a dozen surfboards hang overhead at Modern Amusement, and 
children's clothes feature 1950s and '60s fabrics: "Vintage clothes, only new," 
owner Jeff Yokoyama explained. "All new designs, all new production." Also for 
sale are a huge wooden saw ($48) and a rawhide shade rooster lamp ($42). 
Dominating the store is a seven-by-seven-foot T-bone steak flanked by a vintage 
rodeo photograph and a framed "How do you like your steak?" explanation of 
rare, medium and well done from the days when steak was king. Ambient music is 
provided by LPs including Elvis' "Roustabout" and Don Ho -- "Again."  
</P>
<P>
 11:40 to 12:10: Tower Alternative -- there's that word again! -- sells incense 
and clothes along with its music, and it's a great place to browse. Literature 
runs the gamut from the "I Ching" to the Marquis de Sade. Alongside mainstream 
magazines are "Phat: Hot Stuff for Hoodlums," "Anarchy: A Journal of Desire 
Armed" and " 'O,' Fashions Fetish and Fantasies." Distinctive trading cards 
include vintage aircraft "Nose Art," "Drug Wars -- the straight dope on 
America's dirtiest deals" and "Dictators -- 36 of America's most embarrassing 
allies."  
</P>
<P>
 12:10 to 12:25: The Lab Store features clothes designed by Shaheen Sadeghi, 
developer and owner of the complex, and vintage bottles and flasks ($5 unless 
otherwise marked) in keeping with the lab theme. 
</P>
<P>
 12:25 to 12:45: More flasks, only new, at Urban Outfitters, and at similar 
prices. Also "Dog From Hell" gourmet dinnerware for the pet set; an inflatable 
desk-top "Scream, Jr." ($9) based on the Edvard Munch masterpiece, and rubber 
duckies. (Oh, yeah, and alternative clothes.) Among the more interesting tomes 
are "Saints Preserve Us -- Everything You Need to Know About Every Saint You'll 
Ever Need" and "The Great American Bathroom Book, Single Sitting Summaries of 
All-Time Great Books," Vols. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 12:45 to 1: Trading cards at Collectors Library include "Sexy Robots" and the 
"Sandman" comic characters Death, Delight and Delirium. Alongside Marvel comics 
are "Pinhead" and "Hothead Paisan: Homicidal Lesbian Terrorist"; the shop will 
search for such Golden Age classics as "Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis" on 
request. Fans of biomechanisex will appreciate Giger's oversize book 
"Necronomicon II" and Sorayama's "The Gynoids," while fleshy Vargas-like prints 
by Olivia will appeal to, gosh, who knows, the Playboy crowd? A porcelain 
Superman with a removable plastic cape "for easy storage" goes for $150, while 
a bronze bust of Doc Savage, one of 60, commands $1,200.  
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:20: All beads are handmade, no two are exactly alike, at the Spencer 
Collection. "This is an alternative bead shop," said Spencer Brown. Popular 
"sputniks" (75 cents) are from India, while "hand of protection" beads ($2.25) 
are of domestic origin. In the incredible shrinking world department, Africans 
use kabuki face beads ($6.25) based on Japanese designs to ward off evil 
spirits and chevrons ($1.90) made in Europe for trading beads. Spencer 
incorporates them into his watches ($45 to $149). The shop also sells starter 
kits, and the staff will cheerfully help you make your first bracelet or 
necklace.  
</P>
<P>
 Beaded Masai gourds ($60 to $300) used for a drink of milk, blood and crushed 
beetles retain an amazing smell: "Pretty wild," agreed Brown, "soured milk and 
the stench of dried blood." Yum! 
</P>
<P>
 1:20 to 2: The aromas are far different at the Gypsy Den Cafe and Reading 
Room, which offers a variety of teas and coffees and a limited but healthful 
menu including, for example, a vegetarian Greek sandwich ($3.75) with feta 
cheese and olives. Cookies and biscotti are $1.25, more substantial homemade 
desserts such as chocolate bread pudding are $2.50. Oriental rugs and discreet 
nudes hang on the walls, an inspired range of tasteful literature fills the 
shelves. Turkish coffee is on the way. The Lab

FAHRENHEIT 451 BURNED BY MONEY WOES; BOOKSTORE: LAGUNA GROUP SEEKS TO HELP KEEP 
IT AFLOAT. ITS OWNERS SAY AN EMBEZZLEMENT IS TO BLAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 From its humble beginnings as a cozily cluttered counterculture bookstore in 
the '60s to its more yuppified reincarnation in the '90s, Fahrenheit 451 has 
been as much a part of Laguna Beach as art galleries and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 But after 26 years as Orange County's best-known literary oasis -- a place 
where beat poet Allen Ginsberg and former Yippie leader Jerry Rubin once held 
court -- the landmark bookstore named after Ray Bradbury's science fiction 
novel about censorship is about to close because of financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The end could come today or it could come Sunday -- owner Dotti Ibsen is not 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on if there's any books left and if we can make enough money 
selling coffee and dessert," said Ibsen, who has been running a 50% liquidation 
sale since last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibsen says the bookstore's problems are due to an embezzlement, which the 
Laguna Beach Police Department confirms it is investigating. News of 
Fahrenheit's financial woes has spread faster than last October's wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a grass-roots group that has sort of bubbled up that's very 
heartening," Ibsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of about 100, which calls itself the Friends of Fahrenheit, is 
planning a benefit next weekend and hopes to attract investors to keep 
Fahrenheit afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the only place on the (Orange County) coast that a person can 
go and actually get a taste of the '60s and the Haight-Ashbury days and the 
coffeehouse and the metaphysics and the artists and the whole bit," said Ron 
Watson, a syndicated radio talk show host who lives in Dana Point and has been 
a Fahrenheit aficionado for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibsen, who says customers continue to express disbelief that a store that 
seems so successful could be closing, reported to police that the alleged 
embezzlement caused Fahrenheit to lose about $100,000 over a 17-month period. 
Police declined to give any other details. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind on $23,000 in rent, she and her husband, Ken, recently 
lost their lease on the store. With diminished cash flow in recent months, she 
said, they were unable to pay for restocking their shelves and their main book 
distributors stopped supplying them. And when that happens, Ibsen said, "you're 
not in the book business anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ibsens had planned to move Fahrenheit 451 from its address on South Coast 
Highway into a much larger store on Forest Avenue by this month. A prime 
location only three storefronts from Main Beach, the new store would have been 
what Ibsen terms a combination bookstore, restaurant and arts forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, "we're trying really hard to put together some kind of an investment 
package so that we could actually sell half (the interest in) the store and be 
able to continue on at our new location on Forest Avenue," said Ibsen, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite facing imminent closure with no investors in sight, Ibsen nevertheless 
remains hopeful that Fahrenheit 451 will rise from the ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so many people wanting it to happen," she said, "I can't see how it 
can't help but happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Tannebring, whose jazz trio plays at Fahrenheit every Monday night and 
who will play at the benefit, is one of those people. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that has made this such an interesting place is it really 
seems to reflect Laguna's ambience. It's an eclectic mix of people, not only in 
terms of their intellectual and cultural pursuits, but families, kids and 
students come here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahrenheit is a place where customers can listen to a jazz group one night and 
a Brazilian folk singer the next night, he said. It's a place where they can 
hear poetry readings and get books autographed by their authors. It's a place 
where a patron can be found playing chess in one corner and a psychic or 
numerologist will be chatting with customers in another corner. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, it's the kind of bookstore where a customer can order a 
cappuccino, pick up a book "and treat the place like a library. There is nobody 
there to discourage that kind of activity. Dotti is an unusual woman. She loves 
the bookstore and the atmosphere and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ibsens -- she's a former mechanical engineer, and he's a professor 
emeritus of biochemistry at UC Irvine Medical School -- bought Fahrenheit 451 
in 1988 when it was still situated near the Hotel Laguna on the beach side of 
South Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop had a tradition of providing a warm, friendly atmosphere and an 
eclectic inventory not found in chain stores -- from books by small publishers 
and obscure poets to magazines on alternative medicine and vegetarian food. 
When British mystery writer P.D. James dropped in during the mid-'80s, she 
called it "my idea of a perfect bookstore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ibsens continued the store's traditions when they moved Fahrenheit into 
more spacious quarters in a mini-mall across the street in 1991. (Ray Bradbury 
himself attended the grand opening, calling the store with a dozen tables on a 
tiled patio outside "a reader's paradise.") 
</P>
<P>
 In making the move, the Ibsens doubled the store's book inventory, added a 
cappuccino bar that serves gourmet pastries and computerized the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically for a bookstore named after the temperature at which paper burns, 
Fahrenheit's financial problems came to light in the wake of the Laguna Beach 
fire last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibsen said that business had fluctuated from month to month, but because of 
the recession she and her husband did not suspect anything. 
</P>
<P>
 But after closing during the fire, they began "to get involved in the finances 
more than we usually would have," she said. "We were preparing a disaster loan 
application. In doing that, a lot of things came painfully to light." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the alleged embezzlement, which Ibsen reported began in July, 1992, 
and continued through last November, "we were holding our own." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a year ago the Ibsens had begun planning for the move to the new 
location at 225 Forest Ave., the former home of Marriner's Stationers 
Booksellers & Furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant new store boasts vaulted skylights, small balconies and two 
mezzanines that overlook the performance and restaurant area. With lighting 
"that looks like a stellar constellation," Ibsen said, "the place is absolutely 
exquisite. Nobody has ever seen any bookstore like this in the whole world. It 
feels like an opera house." 
</P>
<P>
 Ibsen said the carpets are already in. They have picked out used kitchen 
equipment and would only need to have the bookshelves made and order the books. 
"All it takes is just funding and then we'll do it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacant new store will be the site of the upcoming benefit open house on 
April 9 and 10. The open house -- to run from noon to midnight both days -- 
will include food, music ranging from jazz to opera, psychic readings, mimes, 
and displays of local artists' works. Any money raised will go first toward 
paying the store's 14 employees, Ibsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sign of what Fahrenheit 451 means to Laguna residents, those involved in 
the open house are donating their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who is helping rally Friends of Fahrenheit, said that when he asked 
the owner of the Greek restaurant near the bookstore if he would help donate 
food, he said, "Whatever it takes, I'll be there." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole community is just trying to get behind this," he said. "There's a 
great amount of love for the bookstore. It's just a sad thing that's 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, like other every other longtime customer, cannot picture Laguna Beach 
without Fahrenheit 451. 
</P>
<P>
 To see it disappear from Laguna, he said, would be no less than the loss "of 
some of its soul." Lore and the Lure 
</P>
<P>
 * How it all began: Dennis Madison and his wife, Lynn Chevli, opened 
Fahrenheit 451 at 509 S. Coast Highway in 1968. The counterculture bookstore 
was a magnet for the hippies of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Owners arrested: Police arrested Gordon and Evelyn Wilson, who owned the 
store from 1972 to 1976, in 1973 for selling allegedly obscene underground 
comic books. The offending publications? Zap and Greaser. Charges were dropped 
two years later and the case was dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anything goes: In 1978, a performance artist sat in the store window and 
typed what he was hearing when people walked by. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ginsberg speaks: In 1985, Playboy Video paid Lorraine Zimmerman, the store's 
third owner, to close the shop on a Sunday to tape an interview with beat poet 
Allen Ginsberg, in town for the Laguna Poetry Festival. "He actually sat and 
talked -- about everything -- for six hours and didn't even ask for a glass of 
water," Zimmerman says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wet mishap: In 1987, the washing machine in the apartment above overran and 
water dripped down into the store. Recalls Zimmerman: "It dripped over history, 
philosophy, nature, science. . . ."

ECONOMISTS SEE TURNING POINT IN O.C. JOB FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In what economists say could be a turning point, state figures released 
Wednesday show that job losses in Orange County have slowed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The county unemployment rate fell to 6.6% in February, down from 7.2% in the 
previous month, according to the state Department of Employment Development. 
There were 6,700 new jobs created between January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 If the trend continues as expected, economists say Orange County will see 
meaningful job growth for the first time since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first report in 1994 that indicates there is a significant change 
in job losses," said Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi. Orange County 
is still losing jobs on a year-to-year basis, including 1,100 non-agricultural 
positions that evaporated between this February and the same month of 1993. But 
Adibi said this a trickle compared to the disappearance of up to 9,000 jobs per 
month at the low point of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the county's job reports are "quite encouraging," said Lynn 
Reaser, chief economist for First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles. "It would 
indicate that Orange County is beginning to turn the corner. I think it will be 
moving faster than Los Angeles," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 6.6% rate in February was significantly below the February 
jobless rate in Los Angeles County, at 9.7%, or California as a whole, with 
9.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers statewide are sure to improve over the next few months. A UCLA 
study released Wednesday said California is squarely in an economic recovery. 
The state is expected to declare, as soon as Friday, that the number of 
California jobs increased during the two-month period of January and February. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, more jobs could be found in tourism, construction, 
agriculture, government and transportation in February, compared to the year 
before. But fewer were available in retailing, finance, insurance, real estate 
and wholesale trade, according to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Job losses in the high-tech and manufacturing sectors were offset by job gains 
in the service sector. 
</P>
<P>
 This reflects lingering cutbacks among defense-related firms, while health 
care providers and other service companies continue to grow, said Anil Puri, a 
Cal State Fullerton economics professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Job seekers and employment agencies say they have noticed an uptick in the 
number of new positions available. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were surprised at the job orders that came in," said Charlene Walker, a 
partner in the Womens Focus career counseling company in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in January, she said, a surge of requests for professional positions 
came from some of Orange County's largest technology companies, such as 
computer distributor Ingram Micro Inc. in Santa Ana, computer tape storage 
manufacturer Odetics Inc. in Anaheim and computer component and software maker 
Emulex Corp. in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 One Womens Focus client, Terri Feld of Yorba Linda, said that while she has 
not yet found the job she wants after six months of dedicating hunting, she 
remains encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 A former marketing manager for a stationery company in New Jersey, Feld said 
she has turned down offers for lesser positions and gone on a few interviews 
for jobs that pay more than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that employers are being extremely specific," she said. One company, 
she said, "wanted someone who could do product development that has bake ware 
and metals experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Employers say workers with highly specialized skills are in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Lantronix, a fast-growing Irvine data communications products maker, has had 
little trouble filling accounting clerk openings. But a position for a computer 
products manager has gone unfilled for three months because no applicant so far 
has quite the credentials sought by the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Some professions are so in demand that few candidates are available. Linda 
Whickum, office manager for the Total Recruiting Services Inc. subsidiary of 
Fluor Daniel in Irvine, said that electrical engineers with petrochemical 
experience seem hard to come by. O.C. Jobless Rate Dips 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Orange County dropped to 6.6% in February from 7.2% in 
January. The rate remains below the July, 1993, high of 7.4%, but well above 
the two-year low of 5.4% in January, 1992. 
</P>

 January 1992: 5.4% July 1993: 7.4% February 1994: 6.6%

SCHOOLS' MOCK-QUAKE DRILL UPSETS PRINCIPALS, PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Principals, teachers and parents are balking at a Los Angeles Unified School 
District plan to stage a mock 7.5 earthquake next week, claiming the drill 
would be an all-too-vivid reminder of January's magnitude 6.8 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Students still are too traumatized by the quake and its aftershocks and will 
not react well to an extensive practice drill, according to some critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual drill, scheduled for Tuesday, also could be difficult for teachers 
and other school staff members, who lost homes and possessions in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've had enough practice," said Maureen Diekmann, the principal at 
Van Gogh Street Elementary in Granada Hills, which remains closed -- with its 
students relocated -- because of earthquake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely not going to do the whole nine yards. We're not going to 
have anyone hurt and we're not going to have anyone stuck anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials say that the drill, called Shake '94, is scheduled 
every year at this time to coincide with the state-designated Earthquake 
Preparedness Month and that it is particularly important this year to test 
schools' emergency plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we stop everything?" said Jim Sugahara, a district administrator who 
oversees the emergency services office. "If you have a car accident, when do 
you go back in the car? How long do you want us to wait? I'd rather see our 
schools prepared and going through this exercise than not." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulletin sent to schools describing Shake '94 tells principals to simulate 
a magnitude 7.5 quake at 10:30 Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact upon the metropolitan Los Angeles area is significant," the memo 
says. "Power, water, gas, sewer and telephone systems fail in all areas. 
Freeway bridges have collapsed, critically disrupting the transportation 
system. Fires are reported at District sites. Hazardous materials are released 
into the air in South Gate. Superintendent Sidney A. Thompson declares a state 
of emergency and orders staff to remain at their sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The drill typically is elaborate. Students pretend to be injured or missing 
and some are carried off in stretchers. Teachers administer first-aid and 
conduct search-and-rescue missions. Others hold up signs depicting fires. A 
large aftershock hits 25 minutes into the drill. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, principals across the district say it will be a low-key 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the kids need to go through this -- they've been through enough 
already," said Dan Balderrama, the principal at Langdon Avenue School in North 
Hills, where about 70 students just returned after the January quake. "We'll 
just walk through it with the office staff and support people." 
</P>
<P>
 And at Canoga Park Elementary, Assistant Principal Sara Applebaum said: "We're 
still living it. We haven't stopped living it. Ideally, we'd like to not have 
to think about this again." 
</P>
<P>
 At Hobart Boulevard Elementary near Downtown, teachers will be told to keep 
reminding students that it is just a practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to take every precaution so that our children won't be scared by 
it," said Betty Daniels, the assistant principal in charge of the drill. "My 
main emphasis will be to reassure the children that everything will be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a 45-minute drill, most principals said they will scale it back to 
about 10 minutes and avoid giving students much description about the effects 
of the simulation. Some principals say students have just returned to school, 
others are sharing homes with two and three families, and still others are 
getting counseling because of quake trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids need more structure, more stability," said Debbie Moorman, whose 
daughter attends Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, where classroom 
buildings are closed and students take classes in portable bungalows. "I don't 
think it's wise right now. I think they should wait until at least the fall 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are required to test their emergency communications plans and submit 
an evaluation of Shake '94. The questionnaire asks principals for 
recommendations to improve the schools' plans and whether any major problems 
developed during the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 All district schools are required to have an emergency plan that includes 
having teachers assigned to various search-and-rescue and first-aid positions. 
Schools are required to have emergency supplies, but the level of preparedness 
is spotty throughout the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools have enough supplies to keep students on campus for 72 hours 
after an emergency, while others barely have enough for the day. The district 
is reviewing its emergency plans and schools' supplies in the wake of the Jan. 
17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Emylou Ballard, the president of the 10th District Parent Teacher Student 
Assn., said local schools should decide how to conduct the drill and whether 
their students and staff can handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe they should have more psychological mending and education (about 
quakes)," Ballard said. "But the more kids understand what will happen, the 
better they'll be able to handle a big earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and teachers agreed. Said Pamela Goldstein, a teacher at Van Nuys 
Elementary: "They (the students) really do need an avenue to talk. It's good to 
open it up for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 But even with the drill, some parents and others say the schools still are 
unprepared for a quake. Practice, they say, won't make schools perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schools just aren't ready and able to handle a big earthquake," said Helen 
Fallon, a parent who has criticized the district's quake readiness. "I think 
kids need to know that schools are prepared and safe."

DOW FALLS 72 POINTS AMID MARKET FEARS; STOCKS: THE SEVENTH DROP IN EIGHT DAYS 
PUTS AVERAGE FAR BELOW THAT OF TWO WEEKS AGO. INVESTORS ARE WORRIED BY INTEREST 
RATES AND POLITICAL TURMOIL, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices tumbled Wednesday in the biggest one-day selloff in eight weeks, 
raising new fears that Wall Street's bull market has ended and that more sharp 
declines are ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 72.27 points to 3,626.75, its seventh 
decline in eight days, bringing its loss since March 18 to nearly 300 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic reversal of the optimism that drove stocks to record highs in 
January, analysts say investors have become deeply troubled by rising interest 
rates, the White House's spreading political problems and a growing number of 
foreign crises. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the stock market's long upward march since October, 1990 -- when the 
Dow bottomed at 2,365 -- has been so unblemished by significant declines that 
the severity of this one has taken professional and novice investors by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a highly volatile and vulnerable environment," warned Alan Ackerman, 
investment strategist at brokerage Reich & Co. in New York. The cascading 
selling of recent days, he said, reflects investors' mounting fears that "he 
who hesitates is lost" in a plummeting market. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of Orange County's public companies, however, have generally fared 
better than the overall market, analysts said, because many local companies 
have long been undervalued by the market and have therefore escaped the brunt 
of the national selloff. 
</P>
<P>
 And with a large concentration of high-technology and medical companies in the 
county, the increasingly bearish market will probably take longer to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few companies are taking a hit along with everyone else," said Chris 
Johndrow, a stockbroker at Cruttenden & Co. Inc. in Irvine. "But for the most 
part, they are doing OK. This is a hotbed of technology. They don't usually 
fall out of favor as much as most stocks." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, among the top 100 public companies in Orange County, four of the 
five shares that lost 9% or more in value Wednesday were high-tech issues. 
Enhanced Imaging Technology Inc., a maker of specialized films and filters for 
the medical industry, was the greatest percentage loser. Its stock dropped 
10.34% in value to close at $6.50 a share on the Nasdaq market. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 60 of Orange County's top 100 stocks lost ground Wednesday, 16 were up 
and 24 were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading volume surged to nearly 400 million shares on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Wednesday, and 20 stocks fell in price for every four that rose, a 
lopsided count rarely seen except in bear markets and in crisis-induced panics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, where surging interest rates have been the stock market's 
chief worry this year, long-term Treasury bond yields reached 7.1%, up from 
6.35% at year-end and the highest level since February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the average investor, financial markets' stunning selloffs over the past 
two months have been difficult to reconcile with the extraordinarily good 
economic news. For the first time since the late 1980s, the economy appears to 
be in a sustained recovery. Companies are hiring again and corporate earnings 
are rising at a healthy pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the economy's improving tone, however, there have been relatively few 
signs of higher inflation -- the troubling upward push in prices of goods and 
services that has historically accompanied strong recoveries. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to keep the economy's growth moderate and inflation at bay, the 
Federal Reserve Board has twice raised short-term interest rates by a 
quarter-point this year, once on Feb. 4 and again on March 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wall Street pros had believed that most investors were prepared for 
the Fed rate hikes, the central bank's moves now are being widely blamed for 
frightening investors and sparking the stock and bond markets' accelerating 
declines. The Fed's Feb. 4 rate increase triggered a 96-point drop in the Dow 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts say the problem is simply that investors had grown used to 
declining interest rates over the past three years and that the reversal of 
that long slide has had a worse-than-expected psychological effect on 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The watershed was that the Fed put its stamp of approval on the fact that 
interest rates were going up again," said Alfred Kugel, investment strategist 
at Stein Roe & Farnham in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts, however, say the markets are responding not so much to the 
small rise in short-term interest rates as to the growing uncertainty about the 
Clinton Administration's Whitewater affair and to a sudden burst of turmoil 
overseas: the assassination of Mexico's probable future president, North 
Korea's intransigence over the nuclear issue and the U.S.-Japan trade conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 When the world economy's prospects look promising and political issues are 
few, investors are willing to pay relatively high prices for stocks, experts 
note. But as uncertainty about the future increases, investors naturally lower 
the prices they are willing to pay for stocks -- and may begin trimming what 
they own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the markets are just factoring in some political risk again, around 
the world," Reich & Co.'s Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock markets have declined sharply in many countries this year, not just in 
the United States. Whereas the Dow industrial average now has slumped 8.8% from 
its all-time high, British stocks are down 9.5% this year; in Thailand, the 
average stock is down 26% year-to-date. 
</P>
<P>
 What is unclear is how much further stock prices will slide before buyers are 
willing to return in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the New York Stock Exchange imposed so-called circuit breakers on the 
market after the 1987 crash, when the Dow plunged 508 points in one day, 
analysts believe that a crash of that type is unlikely. For example, when the 
Dow loses 50 points in one session, the NYSE automatically restricts some big 
investors' ability to trade stocks via high-speed computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of that circuit breaker has been to limit market volatility. But 
critics say that by artificially restraining selling, the NYSE guarantees that 
any market decline now will be stretched over a long period, gradually drawing 
out more sellers as investors see the market edge painfully lower day after 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, some analysts who have long been predicting a classic market 
"correction" -- a fast 10% to 15% pullback in prices, then a resumption of the 
bull market -- now believe that U.S. stocks are vulnerable to a plunge of 20% 
or more from their highs. A drop of that magnitude would officially qualify as 
a bear market and could drag on for many months. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last bear market, the Dow slumped from 3,000 to 2,365 between July and 
October of 1990. The 1973-74 bear market, one of the worst ever, lasted two 
years and cut 45% from the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 99% sure (this is) a bear market, not a normal correction," said Stan 
Weinstein, a veteran market analyst who writes a newsletter called the 
Professional Tape Reader in Hollywood, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein and others who expect heavier selling in part cite the market's lack 
of meaningful declines over the past three years. Stocks' 42-month climb has 
pulled in millions of new investors, many of whom may now feel compelled to 
sell some or all of their holdings as they see Wall Street sentiment turning 
bearish, some pros fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the higher short-term interest rates engineered by the Fed will provide 
new competition for stocks in the form of higher yields on safe bank CDs, 
analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, stock and bond mutual funds -- the investment of choice for 38 million 
Americans -- report relatively little selling by their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fund companies acknowledge that, as foreign stock funds have 
plunged in price this year, investors have begun to take money away from those 
funds, though in small amounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big question is, will we see panic selling by less sophisticated 
investors who have been told that mutual funds go up 10% a year?" said Arnold 
Kaufman, editor of Standard & Poor's Outlook investment newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that, because so many more Americans own stocks today than did 
five years ago, a bear market today could eventually depress the economy by 
leaving many investors feeling poorer as their investments lose value. 
</P>
<P>
 But some money managers argue that the bear scenario is vastly overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rodriguez, manager of the FPA Capital stock fund in West Los Angeles, 
said he was buying stocks Wednesday as the market dove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is just a hiccup," Rodriguez said.

JUSTICES SAY SCOUTS CAN BAR GAYS AS LEADERS; RIGHTS: APPEALS COURT RULES THAT 
FORCING ORGANIZATION TO ACCEPT HOMOSEXUALS AS SCOUTMASTERS WOULD VIOLATE THE 
1ST AMENDMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ruling on an issue closely watched by gay-rights advocates and their 
opponents, a California appeals court has concluded that the Boy Scouts of 
America has the right to bar gay men from becoming Scout leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 2-1 decision issued Tuesday, the 2nd District of the Court of Appeal 
found that a state law prohibiting job discrimination against gay men and 
lesbians does not apply to the Boy Scouts and does not prevent the organization 
from excluding gays from the ranks of Scoutmasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Forcing the Scouts to accept openly gay leaders would violate the 
organization's First Amendment rights of association, the judges said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Boy Scouts' exclusion of an adult leader who openly models or advocates 
homosexual behavior is no more or less rational than its exclusion of a leader 
who modeled or advocated any other type of behavior that it seeks to 
discourage," the judges wrote in a lengthy opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless scouting can determine its own standards of morality, it will be 
disabled as a teacher of moral views on any subject," continued the opinion, 
issued in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in a 13-year-old lawsuit filed by Timothy Curran, who at the 
time wanted to become an assistant Scoutmaster for a Northern California troop. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Orange County case decided just last month, a separate appeals panel 
ruled that the Boy Scouts could not exclude two boys who do not believe in God. 
In that opinion, the judges found that the nonprofit Boy Scouts were a business 
and thus bound by state anti-discrimination statutes, specifically the Unruh 
Civil Rights Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney James G. Randall, who represented his 12-year-old twin sons, William 
and Michael, in the Orange County case decided by the 4th District Court of 
Appeal, said that Wednesday's contradictory ruling will force the California 
Supreme Court to sort out the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that the Boy Scouts are a business," Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly I am disgusted" with Wednesday's ruling, he added. "The court 
hasn't the foggiest idea of what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the Orange County Council of Scouts could not be reached for 
comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran had been a Boy Scout for several years, attaining the rank of Eagle 
Scout, before he took a male date to his senior prom and was quoted in the 
local news media as proud to be gay. A few months later he expressed interest 
in becoming an assistant Scoutmaster but was rejected because he is gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran's suit is one of several cases around the country challenging the 
Scouts' exclusion of gay Scout masters. The lawsuits contend that the Boy 
Scouts are unconstitutionally discriminating against gays, while Boy Scouts 
officials say they are a private group and have the right to exclude 
homosexuals, whom they consider at odds with the organization's basic moral 
tenets. 
</P>
<P>
 Curran's attorney, Jon Davidson of the American Civil Liberties Union, called 
the opinion "extremely distressing." He said the ACLU would seek a rehearing 
before the appeals court, and if necessary, take the case to the state Supreme 
Court. "The majority opinion," Davidson said, "rules that the Boy Scouts and 
numerous other charitable organizations are exempt from California's 
anti-discrimination laws and are free to exclude whomever they want, on any 
basis. This overturns decades of state law to the contrary. I cannot believe 
that the court would have reached this result if Tim had been excluded by the 
Boy Scouts because of his race or religious beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Curran opinion, the judges concluded that "to extend the Unruh Act to 
scouting councils would transform numerous charitable organizations that are 
fundamentally different from business establishments and commercial or business 
clubs, such as the Rotary and Jaycees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many charitable organizations," the opinion stated, "direct their services to 
a distinct religious, cultural, gender, ethnic or age group in a way that would 
be unacceptable in a business, but is neither offensive nor improper in the 
case of a charity seeking to accomplish its particular mission." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar court case now on trial in San Diego, El Cajon police officer 
Chuck Merino has sued the Boy Scouts over his abrupt ouster in 1992 as a Scout 
leader, after the Scouts learned of his homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Curran case, Boy Scouts attorneys have argued that the organization 
is a private club, not a business, and thus not subject to the Unruh law. 
Merino is also suing under San Diego's Human Dignity Ordinance, which prohibits 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Anthony Joseph, hearing the case without a jury, has said 
he may make a decision when testimony ends today or Friday. He has also 
predicted that his ruling will be appealed regardless of which side he favors.

1ST TEMPLE TO OPEN FOR OJAI VALLEY JEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the sun dips behind the mountains surrounding the Ojai Valley early 
Friday evening, the first locally organized celebration of the Jewish Sabbath 
will be observed inside a long-abandoned church. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment will culminate months of planning spawned by the dreams of a Jewish 
family that has lived in the area for just two years. 
</P>
<P>
 David Feigin and Nancy Greenfield already have opened escrow on the 
once-dormant chapel in Meiners Oaks they plan to transform into the valley's 
first Jewish temple and cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be more than just a place to have (temple) services," Feigin said. 
"It will be a place for people of all interests and faiths to come together and 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
 The building is a nondescript meeting hall that has stood vacant since the 
Ojai Valley Church of Christ merged with another local congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials hung a For Sale sign out front more than a year ago, and have 
dropped the asking price steadily as months passed with no takers, the 
building's listing agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been driving by it for more than a year and not noticing it," said 
Feigin, who is an Ojai Valley realtor and is handling the purchase for what he 
hopes will become a congregation of Ojai-area Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just two or three months ago when it occurred to me that there are a 
lot of Jewish people in the area and we could use a place to call home," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is located at 619 W. El Roblar Drive in Meiners Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Feigin and Greenfield, who are married and have a 3-year-old son, expect more 
than 100 people to crowd the meeting hall at 7 p.m. Friday to hear Rabbi Don 
Singer of Malibu deliver the temple's initial sermon. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they started getting the word out among the area's Jewish community, 
dozens of people have committed to establishing the temple and services center, 
Feigin and Greenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 They already have an attorney drawing up articles of incorporation and 
applying for federal tax-exempt status, Feigin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be such a need to do this, we were able to get pledges from 
about 15 people of about half of what it would take for the down payment," 
Feigin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feigin and Greenfield have until June 1 to come up with the sale price, which 
they declined to disclose. But real estate agent Judy Pugh, who is handling the 
sale for the Church of Christ, said the building was most recently listed at 
$135,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did appreciate and acknowledge that the congregation needed some place to 
assemble," Pugh said. Opening a temple "is very much in keeping with the 
spiritual diversity of the Ojai Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi at Temple Beth Torah, the Ventura temple that the couple have been 
attending, also endorsed their efforts wholeheartedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am touched by the enthusiasm of Jewish people saying they want to get 
together and express a Jewish presence (in Ojai)," Rabbi Michael Berk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get this image of Ojai and the people who live there as people who have 
fled other places," Berk said. "It is not unusual for those who flee larger 
communities to begin to miss things they had." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they have not formalized their plans for the center because 
the ongoing success of the temple and Jewish center depends on offering a 
diversity of activities 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the first temple in Ojai, but we don't want people to think it's 
only a temple," Feigin said. "For a lot of Jewish people, when they hear the 
word 'temple' it means only religious stuff and turns people off." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenfield said she has been approached about using the center for art 
classes, Yiddish lessons, senior activities and events for children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still kind of discovering our identity," she said.

MAN ADMITS FIRING 1ST IN BEACH MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old man accused of starting a shootout on a crowded Ventura beach 
testified Wednesday that he got a gun only after two years of living in fear of 
assaults by a Santa Paula gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Alejandro Garcia -- the only person charged in the Aug. 5 shooting at San 
Buenaventura State Beach -- admitted to a jury in Ventura County Superior Court 
that he fired the first shots that day, but said it was in self-defense. He 
said he was carrying the .44 magnum because Santa Paula police have not stopped 
gang intimidation and violence in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he knew three teen-agers who died in violent, gang-related 
incidents. Going to the police was not an option, he said, because "people get 
away with murders in my town." 
</P>
<P>
 While his testimony offered a glimpse of how local gang violence reached the 
shores of a popular beach, law officials said Garcia brought a lot of his 
troubles upon himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "He created a situation for himself that is continuing to grow," said Santa 
Paula Police Cmdr. Bob Gonzalez. "The average citizen doesn't go to the beach 
armed with a gun to get some sun or play and frolic in the waves." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez also said officers have done a commendable job responding quickly to 
gang violence in Santa Paula, a city of nearly 27,000 residents. He attributed 
unsolved gang crimes to a lack of cooperation by witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is charged with two felonies -- assault with a firearm and grossly 
negligent shooting -- and two misdemeanors, carrying a concealed firearm and 
carrying a loaded firearm in public. Authorities say he is not a gang member 
but associates with known gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 During about three hours of testimony, Garcia told the jury that gang violence 
and intimidation is an everyday occurrence in Santa Paula. He said teen-agers 
carry heavy artillery in their cars and students hide guns in the pockets of 
their oversized sports jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would they actually take them on campus?" asked Deputy Public Defender Todd 
Howeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Garcia responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently astonished, Howeth repeated: "On campus?" 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia again said yes. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant said gang members first began picking on him after he stood up 
for his cousin. Once, he said, he was pummeled by gang members as he left a 
local fast-food restaurant. He was also assaulted several times at school, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1991 and the first part of 1992, gang members pointed a gun at him five 
times, Garcia testified. On two occasions they pulled the trigger, but the gun 
apparently jammed each time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It clicked," he told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed that police and school authorities would not do much to 
help him. "And then you would be known as a rat, and it would get worse," he 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he finally moved to Fresno with his grandparents in March, 1992, after 
gang members fired at his car when he went to buy water for his mother one day. 
</P>
<P>
 He had come back to the area to visit his family the day before the beach 
shooting. By then, he said, he had acquired a gun for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he went to the beach to fish with two cousins and a friend. One of 
them saw the gang members. Garcia said he pulled his gun to scare them off. He 
said the gang members kept approaching. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the jury he fired into the sand. His targets ran but turned around and 
shot back. He said he and his friend got back in their vehicle and sped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the beach, however, Garcia said he reloaded his gun and shot in 
the sand again. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination by Deputy Dist. Atty. Kim G. Gibbons, Garcia admitted 
that he had problems controlling his temper and fought a lot while a student at 
Santa Paula Union High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury in Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr.'s courtroom is expected to begin 
deliberations in the case today.

SEA LION KEEPS NAVY ON THE RUN; MILITARY: ANIMAL ACTIVISTS RALLY TO PUMPKIN'S 
PLIGHT AND CRITICIZE USE OF MARINE MAMMALS FOR TESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Pumpkin the Navy sea lion remained free in waters off Santa Cruz Island 
Wednesday, eluding the efforts of his Navy keepers to recapture him. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old California sea lion went AWOL a week ago from a routine Navy 
training exercise clearing dummy mines in the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, animal activists rallied to Pumpkin's plight and criticized the 
Navy's use of marine mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good for him," said Ingrid Newkirk, chairperson for the Washington-based 
People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, praising Pumpkin's dash for 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Navy declared war on marine mammals a long time ago. It's too bad the 
Geneva Convention doesn't extend to sea lions." 
</P>
<P>
 Following a weeklong search by air and sea, Pumpkin was briefly captured 
Tuesday on Gull Island, a rocky outcrop off the southern coast of Santa Cruz 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sea lion, which had apparently been injured, wrestled free from his 
captors and plunged back into the sea while they waited for a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 A harness that the sea lion wore to recover dummy explosives fell off, leaving 
Navy frogmen no way to distinguish Pumpkin from the thousands of other sea 
lions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is he's out there on his own, and he may want to stay out there," 
Navy spokesman Tom LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said Navy personnel remain in the area and are trying to coax him back 
to the boat with an audible beacon and buckets of fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without identifying marks, the only way they'll recognize Pumpkin is if he 
jumps in the boat," LaPuzza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pumpkin's disappearing act surprised Sam Ridgeway, the Navy's senior 
veterinary officer who started the Marine Mammal Program at the Point Mugu 
Lagoon in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had Pumpkin for 15 years," Ridgeway said. "He's been a good, steady 
worker. But who knows what goes through the mind of a sea lion." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Pumpkin, a neutered male that turned 16 on Saturday, had been trained 
in the open ocean at least 2,000 to 3,000 times over the years. Ridgeway said 
sea lions are more closely related to dogs and bears than to dolphins, and are 
as easily trained as dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Local activists cited Pumpkin's dash for freedom as an example of improper use 
of sea mammals for military experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon Oswitch, vice president of Animal Emancipation Inc., called the practice 
cruel and increasingly unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to know what they do with the animals that don't make the training 
cut," Oswitch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some animal activists have long criticized the Navy's Marine Mammal Program, 
which includes 125 dolphins, sea lions and other sea mammals trained to recover 
training mines and intercept enemy frogmen. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, several former Navy trainers accused the Navy of employing brutal 
methods in training the mammals, but an investigation by the federal Marine 
Mammal Commission cleared the Navy of extensive wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Howorth, the director of the Marine Mammal Center in Santa Barbara, said 
Pumpkin's chances of survival are excellent, despite his naval training to 
avoid foraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even captive-born sea lions are only one or two generations removed from 
millions of years of evolution," Howorth said. "They are highly intelligent and 
highly sociable, and the odds are extremely good that his instincts would take 
over. It's not like releasing a toy poodle into the National Forest." 
</P>
<P>
 LaPuzza said other sea lions have wandered off during exercises in the Channel 
Islands, and some swam directly back to their pens in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all return, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several teams of Navy animal trainers will remain in the area through today 
before calling off their search.

5.5% WATER RATE HIKE APPROVED; UTILITIES: TWO-THIRDS OF VENTURA COUNTY 
RESIDENTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE INCREASE, WHICH TAKES EFFECT IN JULY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 5.5% rate hike that will boost the cost of water from Simi Valley to Oxnard 
was approved Wednesday night by the wholesaler that provides water to 
two-thirds of Ventura County residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Calleguas Municipal Water District agreed to up its rates to 
cover the cost of an increase imposed last month by its supplier, the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate increase will affect nearly 500,000 residents and commercial 
customers in Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and parts of 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 If the companies that buy water from Calleguas pass the increase directly on 
to their customers, a typical four-person household that pays about $390 a year 
for about 163,000 gallons of water will see that cost creep up to about $411. 
The new rates will go into effect in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past across-the-board rate hikes, however, Calleguas officials have 
decided to base the increase on the amount of water used by each of the 
agencies that buy from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of levying a per-unit increase for water at the time it is 
purchased, Calleguas has calculated a flat annual fee each member agency will 
pay based on how much water they have used in each of the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected from the fee will go directly toward Calleguas' 
$2.5-million annual debt service. Calleguas' action follows a recent MWD 
decision to phase in a similar change over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 For bill-paying residents and businesses, the change in how the increase is 
levied may not lessen the effect of the rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 But Calleguas General Manager Don Kendall said the new approach could help 
stabilize the cost of water when a similar rate plan by MWD takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than looking at increasing rates every year, we've decided to try this 
fixed fee," Kendall said. "Knowing that we have this guaranteed, fixed amount 
of money coming in could help us keep the cost to our customers the same over 
the next several years." 
</P>
<P>
 Calleguas began pursuing the new rate structure last fall after customers 
complained about the district's rates and MWD's annual price hikes. After 
keeping its rates flat for five years, Metropolitan levied increases of 13% in 
1991, 23% in 1992, and 19% in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charged that the MWD increases unfairly saddled Ventura County 
customers with the cost of water projects in other parts of Southern 
California, including a $1.5-billion reservoir in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they're passing through something from MWD there's nothing we can do 
about it," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said. "But they always seem to add a 
little extra." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kendall denied the charge, saying Calleguas merely passed MWD's increases 
on to the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we're trying to do is control water rates and cover our costs," Kendall 
said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DAY-CARE CENTER'S LICENSE IS REVOKED

<TEXT>
<P>
 State officials have revoked a Ventura woman's license to run a residential 
day-care business after allegations that she endangered children under her 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Social Services revoked Susan Hill's community care 
license March 17 after she withdrew her protest of the charges against her and 
waived her right to a hearing.Hill had been licensed to care for up to 12 
children in her home in the 9600 block of Lucerne Street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state investigation, the children staying at Hill's home were 
endangered by her husband, David Hill. He allegedly battered his wife, used 
cocaine in the home and had marijuana in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill also has a history of criminal convictions, some violent, and had 
not been cleared by the state to live in the day-care setting, said Liz Brady, 
a spokeswoman for the Department of Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a gentleman who would be appropriate to have around day-care 
children," she said. "You never know when a volatile person is going to lose 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Susan Hill lied to state investigators about her identity on one 
occasion in 1993, Brady said. Hill could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 She will not be eligible to apply for another day-care license for two years, 
officials said. JULIE FIELDS

 Two Oxnard police officers disguised as Amtrak employees apprehended a 
fugitive traveling by train from Oregon, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Rojo, 22, suspected of stealing a car and a gun in Oregon, stepped off 
the train in Oxnard on Tuesday night and asked two luggage attendants where to 
pick up his bags. 
</P>
<P>
 The attendants were actually Police Officers Martin Polo and Michael 
Radziewicz, who had received Rojo's name and description from officials in 
Lincoln City, Ore. The officers arrested Rojo and confiscated a .22-caliber 
pistol from his pants pocket, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojo remained in custody Wednesday at Ventura County Jail on suspicion of 
receiving stolen property, carrying a concealed weapon and five misdemeanor 
warrants. In addition to the theft charges, Oregon officials have two 
outstanding misdemeanor warrants for his arrest. PHYLLIS JORDAN

 Ventura County authorities raided six homes and arrested two Fillmore men 
early Wednesday morning as part of an ongoing program to stem gang violence, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A team of 46 officers from the Ventura County Sheriff's Department, the county 
Probation Department and the Fillmore Fire Department arrived after 1 a.m. at 
the homes of six individuals who agreed to such searches as part of their 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
 The team turned up no guns or drugs, but discovered gang graffiti and gang 
paraphernalia at two homes. Serafin Garibay, 19, and an unidentified 
17-year-old youth were arrested and cited for probation violations, police 
said. They were both released after meeting with their probation officers.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; GIRL'S EFFORTS SAVE FATHER IN HOUSE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A 10-year-old Oxnard girl, awakened by a smoke alarm early Wednesday morning, 
alerted firefighters and saved her father from a fire that did $80,000 in 
damage to their Ivywood Drive home, the Oxnard Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter was injured in the two-alarm blaze that burned for nearly 45 
minutes.Firefighter Dan Gildea received second-degree burns on his back after a 
piece of melting aluminum fell on him. The department sent 13 firefighters and 
three engines to fight the fire, which started about 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Matakiewicz discovered the fire when she woke to the sound of the smoke 
alarm. She tried to wake her father and when he did not wake up, she called the 
911 emergency line, said her uncle, Paul Matakiewicz. She shook her father 
again and then ran from the flaming house. He then woke up and jumped through a 
window to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, he was oblivious to what was going on, and his little girl saved 
his life," Battalion Chief Clarence Slayton said. The father, Robert Mietchry, 
suffered cuts from the window glass. The fire destroyed the living room, 
kitchen and patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are focusing on the kitchen stove as the source of the fire, Slayton 
said. PHYLLIS JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CYCLIST INJURED IN CRASH AT INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An argument that started with a bicycle cutting off a van in traffic ended 
with a Camarillo cyclist in the hospital suffering from serious head injuries 
and a Ventura County employee suspended from his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hager, 37, of Camarillo remains in serious condition in the 
intensive-care unit at St. John's Regional Medical Center after Monday's 
incident at an Oxnard intersection. The driver of the county van, Scott 
Andrade, 28, has been put on leave with pay awaiting the results of an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Oxnard police have not filed charges, but they intend to speak to 
Hager before closing the case. "At this point, it's not as serious as it would 
seem," said Sgt. Charles Dunham of the Oxnard Police Department. "It's just an 
unfortunate set of circumstances that led to a serious injury." 
</P>
<P>
 The story, as told to police, goes like this: 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when Hager's bicycle suddenly pulled in front of Andrade's 
van. Andrade, who drives for the county Public Social Services Agency, slammed 
on the brakes in panic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hager then made an obscene gesture toward Andrade. Andrade stepped out of the 
van at the intersection of Pacific and Emerson avenues and held his hands out 
as if to say, "What's going on?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hager then turned his bike and drove straight toward Andrade and veered off 
before reaching him. But Andrade put an arm out and hit the cyclist. Hager flew 
over the handlebars and landed on his head. Police are uncertain whether he was 
wearing a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hager suffered a subdural hematoma, an injury causing blood to build up on the 
brain, Dunham said. Hager's condition improved after surgery to relieve the 
pressure, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade, who lives in Ventura, will remain off the job until county officials 
decide what action to take, if any. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's under investigation," said James Isom, director of the 
Public Social Services Agency. "Until I have an opportunity to review the case, 
he's currently on leave with pay." PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; OWNER OF DOG KILLED BY POLICE FILES CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dusty the pit bull died in a hail of gunfire and a cloud of confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police say the dog was shot dead after he charged officers and then 
clamped his powerful jaws on the hind leg of a police dog. But Dusty's owner, 
Modesto Estrada, says his dog was attacked by the police dog and then 
needlessly gunned down in full view of his wife and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 So convinced is Estrada that his dog died unnecessarily that he filed a claim 
against the city earlier this month, seeking $15,000 in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I should have asked for more for what my kids and my wife went 
through," Estrada, 47, said. "There was no need for any of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman David Keith would not comment on the shooting, saying a 
lawsuit could result from Estrada's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to a police report, officers were conducting a yard-to-yard 
search last month for a wife-beating suspect when they found the suspect holed 
up in Estrada's garage with the pit bull. Police said there is no indication 
that Estrada knew the suspect was hiding in the garage of his central Oxnard 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers kicked down the door and entered the garage, the pit bull 
charged out, the police report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the suspect was arrested, officers said the pit bull ran past them and 
began attacking the police dog, a German shepherd. Estrada's dog was shot once, 
and after momentarily releasing his grip and attacking again was shot a second 
time and killed, according to the police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers put the dog's body in a garbage bag and took it to an animal control 
shelter, where it remains frozen and awaiting pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada tells a different story. He said his dog never attacked the police 
dog, and that he offered to take his dog away when the two dogs began growling 
at each other. Estrada said he was never given the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said his dog was shot once, and as he lay on the ground unable to move 
was attacked by the police dog. That's when the pit bull was shot a second and 
fatal time, Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attached to Estrada's claim is a letter from his oldest daughter, Vanessa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am writing this letter on behalf of my father and my little sister to 
express our deepest hurt of losing our dog Dusty," the 13-year-old wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Estradas have a new dog, Vanessa wrote that the loss of the 
family pet has most affected her 5-year-old sister, Veronica. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is only 5 years old and she has never seen anything like that before," 
Vanessa wrote. "She has nightmares and will not sleep in her room because the 
dog was always under the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's claim is under review. FRED ALVAREZ

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; BRODSKY QUITS SEAT ON PLANNING PANEL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moorpark Planning Commissioner Steve Brodsky is resigning his post after 
learning his new job will keep him out of California for the next five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "My time on the Planning Commission has been one of the most fulfilling I've 
ever had," Brodsky said Wednesday."I helped to draw up an excellent General 
Plan and spent months working on the new slow-growth ordinance. I'm proud of 
all that. If I could have stayed on, I would have." 
</P>
<P>
 Brodsky, an electrical engineer with a consulting firm in Moorpark, recently 
was hired by a Michigan company to develop a hardtop sun roof for a new sports 
car made by Mitsubishi. He said the work probably would keep him out of 
California until at least the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped a new appointment would be made soon to give his replacement 
a chance to prepare for some of the bigger projects that will come before the 
commission in the next couple months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a little time for the next person to become familiar with 
everything," Brodsky said. "They need as much time as possible to be ready when 
the bigger projects come before the commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said that despite some strong political 
differences with Brodsky early on, he came to respect Brodsky's commitment to 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made the appointment, we had just gone through a rough election where 
Steve had supported my opponent," Lawrason said. "But I think he's done an 
outstanding job. The other commissioners have come to depend on his technical 
expertise. We'll all miss him." SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN, 19, PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN SLAYING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Port Hueneme murder suspect who may face the death penalty in 
connection with the slaying of a Simi Valley man pleaded not guilty Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert R. Curtis Jr. set a May 23 preliminary 
hearing for Timothy Chrestman, accused of fatally shooting 24-year-old Andy Lee 
Anderson and his dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's body was found March 6 at a remote campground north of Ojai. He had 
died two days earlier, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman was arrested after Anderson's 1987 pickup truck was found in West 
Hollywood. Authorities have refused to say what evidence, if any, implicates 
Chrestman in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael K. Frawley said Chrestman shot Anderson as the 
victim stood next to his pickup truck March 4. Chrestman then shot the dog and 
drove off in the vehicle, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is charged with murder, robbery and cruelty to an animal. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman also has been charged with a special circumstance that accuses him 
of killing Anderson during the commission of a robbery. Prosecutors are 
considering seeking the death penalty in the case, Frawley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrestman is being held in Ventura County Jail without bail, a jail spokesman 
said. DWAYNE BRAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN TO STAND TRIAL IN VENTURA SLAYING

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge Wednesday ordered a 45-year-old man to stand trial in connection with 
the December shooting death of a Ventura man outside the victim's apartment 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Herbert R. Curtis Jr. found that prosecutors had provided 
enough evidence to proceed with their murder case against Garabet Majoubian of 
Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoubian is charged with murder in the Dec. 20 shooting of Erasmo Moro, 48. 
Moro's body was found in the carport of the Scandia Apartments in eastern 
Ventura after residents reported hearing gunshots. Moro worked at a Ventura 
pizza shop. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's preliminary hearing, Ventura Police Detective Tom Burke 
testified that Majoubian and Moro had argued over a Simi Valley woman that both 
men considered to be their girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Majoubian, a construction worker, went to Moro's apartment and 
shot the man after an argument. Investigators later found a 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic pistol in the suspect's apartment, police testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Majoubian is being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 2 PASTORS ROBBED AT GUNPOINT IN FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An evangelical pastor who was robbed at gunpoint in a Thousand Oaks field 
Tuesday night said he and a fellow pastor prayed to God and preached to his 
assailant -- but to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman and two accomplices made off with the ministers' wallets, car phone 
and car keys, sheriff's detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies are looking for three men in their 20s who 
robbed the two ministers and then vanished, according to a police report by 
Detective Ernie Montagna. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bingman, a co-pastor at the Living Word Christian Fellowship Evangelical 
Church in Newbury Park, said the men did not harm him or fellow pastor Marco 
Molina, who was visiting from Mazatlan, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did the assailants heed Bingman's attempts to preach the Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingman, 53, said he and Molina, 24, were standing and praying in a field at 
the end of Sunset Hills Boulevard that overlooks most of Thousand Oaks when 
three men came up behind them about 9:50 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leader of the group . . . pulled out a gun, and the other guys frisked us 
and pulled out our billfolds," Bingman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My life's not worth a stupid billfold or a credit card, so I began to preach 
the Gospel to him," Bingman recalled. "I said, 'God will change you.' He said, 
'A man's got to do what a man's got to do, I've got three kids to support.' 
Well, I didn't believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 The three took the cellular phone and the car keys and pointed the gun at 
Bingman and Molina, forcing them to walk toward Thousand Oaks, Bingman said.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time the men turned back, the robbers were gone, he said. The ministers 
walked home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm minus the money and the credit cards and keys and dumbfounded as to how 
this could happen in Thousand Oaks," Bingman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm not naive. I know these things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery is under investigation. MACK REED

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 3 FIRMS TO BID ON POLICE STATION DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three architectural firms have been selected to bid on the design for a new 
multimillion-dollar police headquarters in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Civic Center Committee chose the top candidates from 10 
architectural firms applying for the right to assess the needs of the 
department and plan a new station. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the three finalists have worked on other projects in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach Mounce Architects, the only firm among the finalists based in Ventura 
County, designed the Ventura County East Valley Sheriff's Station in Thousand 
Oaks and fire stations in Oxnard and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs & Miguel, whose offices are in Sylmar and Valencia, designed the 
recently approved plans for Simi Valley's Cultural Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The third finalist, San Jose-based Ruth & Going, teamed up with a public 
safety specialist to design and engineer the police headquarters in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning architect will oversee the first nine-month phase of the four-year 
project. The station could cost as much as $11.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three have done some very impressive work with police design," Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. "Since this is the first phase, rather than looking for someone 
who builds pretty buildings, we need someone who understands police 
departments." 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, the finalists will be interviewed by the committee, made up 
of Stratton and Councilwoman Judy Mikels, along with City Manager Lin Koester, 
Police Chief Willard R. Schlieter and Deputy City Manager Bob Heitzman. 
</P>
<P>
 A final recommendation is scheduled to be made April 11 to the full City 
Council. SARA CATANIA

DISPATCHERS TRADE INDEX CARDS FOR COMPUTER; SIMI VALLEY: A POLICE 
RADIO-DISPATCH SYSTEM REPLACES A PROGRAM WHERE PAPER RECORDS AND MEMORIES WERE 
RELIED UPON TO BRIEF OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to send out better-informed officers faster, the Simi Valley Police 
Department has installed a computerized radio-dispatch system to replace one 
that relied in part on index cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers who once used paper records and their own memories to warn patrol 
officers about their next call can now summon the floor plan of a store or a 
suspect's entire criminal record with a few keystrokes. 
</P>
<P>
 By typing in an address, a dispatcher can call up a brief history of past 
troubles at the site so officers know what to expect. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the computer is tied into the statewide Enhanced 911 system in about 
six weeks, it will immediately identify a caller's number and address so 
dispatchers can send help faster than before, Chief Willard R. Schlieter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it's gonna be a faster way of dispatching, and with more 
information, so that the officer can service the needs of the people calling 
in," Schlieter said. "I think it's going to improve our response." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years in the making, the new system initially irritated and frightened 
some dispatchers, communications supervisor Lynn Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared to death," said Freeman, a Simi Valley dispatcher for 17 years. 
"I was just afraid I'd put (information) in the computer and I couldn't get it 
back again to do my job." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said she fought the plan at first. "I was one of those (who said), 
'Just leave me alone, we get the job done. We don't drop calls.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet after living with the system since it went on line at noon Saturday, 
Freeman said: "It's better than I ever thought it could be. It makes sense. . . 
. It does just impress me what we have access to."  
</P>
<P>
 Cross-referenced, streamlined and powerful, the new computer replaces a system 
that often left dispatchers at shift's end squinting into a 12-year-old 
computer terminal, laboriously typing in their own handwritten notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatch officers who answer phone calls from the public used to write the 
information onto index cards, then stick the cards into a clock that stamped 
the time, she said. The cards and written dispatch logs would help the next 
shift keep track of what had happened in case officers were called back to an 
address they had already visited. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the shift, the dispatchers had to transcribe the cards into the 
old computer -- which often led to duplicate, triplicate, even quadruplicate 
records if someone was arrested or helped more than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, a dispatch officer who answers the phone can type in the first few 
letters of a person's name or address and quickly call up any records of past 
crimes or police activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're going to a call, we can tell how many times we've been there, and 
why we've been there," Freeman said. "We used to keep that all in our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 The new system also will save time for dispatchers, who fielded 500 calls in 
the 24 hours from Sunday night to Monday night and dispatched officers 112 
times, said Ted Middleton, head of the city's department of Information 
Management Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at 112 calls in a day, that doesn't seem like an inordinate 
amount of work," said Middleton, who has been working for two years to help the 
department start the system. "But when you factor in all the other calls, which 
can range from 30 seconds to a long question on child custody rights, that's a 
significant amount of time on the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 The computer also will let police track crime patterns and adjust patrols to 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Pins pushed onto a paper map will be replaced by a computerized map showing 
the place, time and type of crime in any area in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give us a better way to analyze deployment," Schlieter said. "Maybe 
there are better ways to reshape beats, and it can show us that." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, police records clerks have been working overtime to catch up, 
translating records of more than 850,000 radio calls since 1988 from the old 
computer to the new one, and throwing out the duplicate records, said Debra 
Ruud, the department's crime analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The records clerks began working overtime March 4, often seven days a week, 
hoping to get a jump on the process by the time the system was running, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, they have been able to translate only a quarter of the records, 
and are expecting to chip away at it for another year while performing their 
other duties, she said.

U.S. HEALTH SURVEY TEAM TARGETS COUNTY RESIDENTS; MEDICAL: INTERVIEWERS ARE 
SEEKING RANDOM SUBJECTS FOR OSTEOPOROSIS STUDY. FREE EXAMS AND CASH ARE 
OFFERED.

 Answering a knock at the door in the next few weeks may get Ventura County 
residents a free physical, an opportunity to contribute to medical science and 
a little extra cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewers from the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services are 
fanning out across the county in search of random subjects for a national 
health survey on osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County is one of 88 counties randomly selected across the nation for 
the six-year study by the National Center for Health Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey is expected to provide a broad base of information because it 
encompasses such a wide group of residents from across the country, said field 
operations director Robert Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disease doesn't differentiate," Cuellar said. "We are all susceptible and we 
can all benefit from this." 
</P>
<P>
 Respondents also will be queried on general health issues and undergo physical 
exams that last three to four hours and include allergy tests, a gallbladder 
ultrasound and a dental exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Using U. S. census data, interviewers displaying government identification 
will visit 2,000 households to get the required number of 486 people to 
participate, Cuellar said. Workers will screen households to find people within 
certain age groups, including babies who are at least 2 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no obligation to participate, but to sweeten the offer, adults who 
take part get $50, and children receive $30. Respondents will be selected by 
April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Three teams of Health and Human Services workers have been roaming the nation 
since the fall of 1988 gathering data for the study. Cuellar's team comes most 
recently from Houston. They travel in four trailers and set up camp, usually in 
a central location within the selected county. In Ventura County, they chose 
Oxnard, in a lot next to St. John's Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailers are equipped with machines that test lung capacity, heartbeats 
and hearing and a camera that photographs the back of the eye to check for 
diabetic hemorrhaging. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poking and prodding will be at a minimum, Cuellar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our equipment is computerized, so we don't even touch the respondents 
for most of the tests," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the information gleaned from the survey is used to produce national 
health statistics and standards, the kind of figures that pop up in growth 
charts in pediatricians' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've heard people talk about, 'They say the national average is this,' " 
Cuellar said. "Well, we are they." 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the tests will remain confidential, he said. If any dangerous 
health concerns crop up during the physical, the respondent will be told 
immediately. Otherwise, results should take about two months to arrive at the 
respondent's home by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary goal is to research the incidence and cause of osteoporosis, but 
the data will also be used by a number of federal agencies -- from the Centers 
for Disease Control to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the sampling of counties is random and meant to arrive at a national 
standard, Cuellar said he and his medical personnel will sometimes come across 
health information unique to an area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like valley fever," he said. "We didn't have that in Houston." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of people willing to participate is usually quite high, but Cuellar 
said some people tell the interviewers they have health insurance and don't 
need a physical, then slam the door. Unfortunately, he said, if they fit within 
the criteria of the study, they have to be included, even though no health 
information on them is available. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just lost data," he said. "This survey impacts everyone. It's not just 
for people without insurance."

 Port Hueneme police have arrested two additional suspects in a gang-related 
shooting that left a 15-year-old Oxnard boy dead last weekend, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Raul Aguilar Jr., 21, and a 17-year-old male, both of Oxnard, were 
arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of Cesar Rueney Mata on Sunday 
in front of the Tradewinds Market on North Ventura Road in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar and the 17-year-old were arrested when police stopped two cars leaving 
a funeral wake for Mata. Inside the cars, police recovered two handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Aguilar and the juvenile were arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted 
murder and possession of a loaded firearm. Aguilar was booked at Ventura County 
Jail, where he was being held in lieu of $270,000 bail. The 17-year-old was 
taken to Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested during the traffic stops Wednesday were Agustin Ortega Gonzalez, 
19, and Rudy Perez, 20, both of Oxnard, on suspicion of possessing loaded guns. 
They were questioned at the Port Hueneme Police Station and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suspect in the homicide, 18-year-old Jose Luis Perez, is also being 
held in Ventura County Jail. JULIE FIELDS

LOCAL BUSINESSES FIND NO SOLACE IN NEW FEDERAL AIR QUALITY PLAN; REGULATIONS: 
SOME PREDICT THAT MEETING THE STRICTER SMOG STANDARDS WILL RUIN THE VENTURA 
COUNTY ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Federal and local air-quality officials offered little hope Wednesday for area 
business people who claimed the Ventura County economy could be ruined if a new 
federal plan to clean up the air is imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet standards set by the federal Clean Air Act, Ventura County must reduce 
its smog-causing emissions by 40% by 2005, officials told area residents and 
business representatives gathered at the Ventura County Fairgrounds for a 
workshop on the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures proposed in a 1,600-page federal implementation plan for Ventura, Los 
Angeles and Sacramento counties aim to reduce emissions from trucks, tractors, 
ships, trains, pesticides and other more traditional sources of pollution, such 
as cars and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (federal) plan is going to have some significant economic impacts," said 
William Mount, deputy manager of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District. "The trick is to come up with (local) alternatives to these measures. 
But we simply don't have enough tools to reduce emissions to meet the 
standards, and especially not by 2005." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA was required to step in to solve air-quality problems in Ventura, Los 
Angeles and Sacramento counties after local air-pollution districts were unable 
to devise enough regulations to reduce pollution to meet standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the local district has implemented strict controls on 
emissions from businesses within its jurisdiction. But cars, trucks, trains, 
ships and farm equipment and pesticides have been outside their legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan was required after Ventura County was designated as having a 
"severe" air-quality problem in the 1990 Clean Air Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other measures, it calls for a 70% reduction in nitrogen-oxide emissions 
from heavy trucks, such as those used to haul produce. The plan also would 
impose fines on ships using ports in Ventura and Los Angeles counties.  
</P>
<P>
 Al Zemsky, a spokesman for the Environmental Production Agency, said federal 
regulators came to Ventura to explain the proposed new regulations and to get 
feedback. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to hear from the public," he said. But he acknowledged that there is 
little room for the regulators to give on the proposed regulations if the 
standards are to be met. "It will be tough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Leavens said her family farming business depends on heavy trucks to 
transport citrus from the farm to the warehouse, from the warehouse to the 
packer and from the packer to market or port. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would shut agriculture down in a wink if it goes through as proposed," 
she said. She said the farming industry can handle new regulations to reduce 
emissions from pesticides, from engines that operate pumps to bring irrigation 
water to the surface and from heavy farm equipment. But the restrictions on 
trucking will kill the industry, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 New regulations on ship emissions would also hurt the Port of Hueneme, said 
port spokesman W. Kam Quarles.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the fines go through, it would make the ports in this region less 
competitive than other parts of the West Coast," he said. "Fines like that can 
push shippers away." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stan Greene, president of the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, said it 
hasn't been determined what the effects on business would be. On the other 
hand, he said there would be severe impacts if air pollution is not reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not just people's health and suffering," he said. "There are also 
economic costs to air pollution." He cited a reduction in crops, deterioration 
of architectural coatings and increased need for health care to treat lung 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 A public hearing on the plan, when comments from residents become part of the 
public records, will be held in July, Zemsky said.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / NCAA MEN'S FINAL FOUR; OBSCURE GATORS FEASTING; FLORIDA 
STORMS FINAL FOUR PARTY WITHOUT REQUISITE BIG-NAME PLAYERS, GLITZY REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 And now, how to build a Final Four team the Florida Way: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miss out on every top 50 high school player in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sign only one fewer recruit from Scandinavia than you do from your own 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feature a head coach whose press conferences are duller than an Agriculture 
Department briefing on turnip harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, just sit back and watch the magic. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow -- and even Florida Coach Lon Kruger isn't entirely sure what happened 
-- the Gators have advanced to the NCAA national semifinals at Charlotte, N.C., 
where they'll play Duke on Saturday. Duke and Coach Mike Krzyzewski seemingly 
have a lifetime pass to these things. Meanwhile, Florida needed net-cutting 
instructions after winning the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, here they are. The Gators. Coach K vs. Coach K Jr. Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt fortunate that everybody plays poorly against us," said Kruger, 
letting the sarcasm sink in. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Florida has won 29 games this season, the most in the school's 75-year 
basketball history. But if Kruger is suggesting that he predicted Florida's 
first Final Four appearance this fast, then he's in the wrong business. A 
better career choice: "Hi, I'm Lon, and you've reached the psychic hotline . . 
. ."  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody figured the Gators to go this far. Not the NCAA selection committee, 
which seeded them third in the regional. Not Lefty Driesell's James Madison 
team, which lost to Florida by two points in the first round of the tournament. 
Not Pennsylvania, the next victim. Or No. 2-seeded Connecticut, which lost in 
overtime after Huskies All-American Donyell Marshall clanked a pair of 
last-second and likely game-winning free throws in regulation. Not ninth-seeded 
Boston College, which figured it had as good a chance as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just did the things that we're capable of doing and that's the key reason 
we're going to the Final Four," said Gator sophomore forward Dametri Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida isn't a stylish team to watch. The most fluid thing about the Gators 
is their sweat, which is fine with Kruger, who played that way during his days 
at Kansas State. It shows, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps you saw center Andrew DeClercq sprint desperately downcourt as Boston 
College guard Howard Eisley pranced in for a sure breakaway layup in Sunday's 
regional final. Instead, DeCler blocked the shot from behind, keeping Florida's 
lead at a precious five points with 2:20 left. Typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Kruger did what he could to dispel the image of Gator 
overachievers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think today we won a ballgame," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. In fact, the Gators provide glimmers of hope to coaches 
everywhere. After all, if blue-collar Florida can do it, anyone can. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it helps to hit the no-name recruiting jackpot of all time. Florida 
assistant coach Ron Stewart and recruiting guru Bob Gibbons were talking about 
that very topic a few days ago. Gibbons, like most talent evaluators, didn't 
have a single Gator signee included in his list of prime names. At the time, 
Stewart couldn't have blamed him. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got nice players who have developed," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting five: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Senior guard Craig Brown, who buried Boston College with nine points in 81 
seconds, was hardly noticeable four years ago. Gibbons didn't even list him 
among his top 250 recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland, which was knee-deep in NCAA probation, was looking at him, as were 
St. Bonaventure and Temple. Florida, fresh from a 7-21 season that saw Don 
DeVoe fired and Kruger and his staff hired, also was interested. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the April signing period, Stewart came to watch Brown play 
in a pickup game. The rim was broken, but Brown's jump shot wasn't. Stewart 
offered him a scholarship, figuring, if nothing else, Brown was a good kid from 
a solid family. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Junior point guard Dan Cross, from Carbondale, Ill., was considered nothing 
more than a mid-to-high Division I player. Southern Illinois wanted him, so did 
Illinois State and maybe Mississippi State. Instead, he signed with Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know a thing about Florida basketball until my senior year of high 
school," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Hill committed to Florida shortly after his junior season at Dixie Hollins 
High in St. Petersburg. He had feelers from Auburn, Alabama, Wake Forest and 
several Big East Conference schools, who liked his wide body and his soft 
shooting touch. But Hill was in no mood to head north. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I was made to do all that cold weather stuff," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the recommendation of Stewart, Gibbons invited Hill to the prestigious Nike 
summer camp. Surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got him there, we thought, 'Oh, gawd, this kid can't run up and down 
the court,' " Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill weighed nearly 350 pounds. He was fine in a half-court game, but useless 
when the pace required actual running. Gibbons dropped him from the top 250 
after watching Hill struggle up and down the court. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sophomore forward Brian Thompson played at famous Oak Hill, Va., Academy 
and was the closest thing to an actual Florida blue-chip recruit. One problem: 
His SAT scores weren't available yet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gators gambled and signed him anyway. Soon thereafter, Thompson's test 
scores came in. He qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DeCler, now a junior, used one of his official recruiting visits to go to 
Duke. Once there, Krzyzewski told him the Blue Devils were pursuing six other 
players: Cherokee Parks, Erik Meek, Glenn Robinson, Juwan Howard, Alan 
Henderson and Chris Webber. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you're No. 7," Krzyzewski told DeClercq, "and we have two 
scholarships to give." 
</P>
<P>
 DeCler saw the writing on the wall and it said, Virginia or Florida. He chose 
the Gators. Florida coaches couldn't believe their luck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me early on that they got a steal on him," said Gibbons of the 
Gator staff. 
</P>
<P>
 So here they are, the non-Fab Five. Cross, an honorable mention All-America, 
leads the team in scoring, assists and scowls per game. Thompson does the best 
postgame victory dance. DeCler is playing the best basketball of his career. 
Brown, a second-team all-Southeastern Conference selection, has become a team 
leader and the Gators' best perimeter shooter. Hill, now down to 286 pounds, is 
proud owner of "DaMeat Hook," which is his surprisingly accurate jump hook 
shot. Hill also sets the meanest blindside picks in the college game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my gosh," DeCler said, "we heard Dan (Cross) crumble in practices last 
year. And last season at our place, we played Athletes in Action. They had this 
little point guard and he saw Dametri out of the corner of his eye. It's 
probably the reason he's alive today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point guard ran a big circle around Dametri. The crowd started laughing, 
but I can understand why he did it. Sometimes you just hear (the guards) hit 
him on the picks. You hear, 'Uhhhh.' Then you hear the crowd go, 'Ohhhh, 
oooohhhh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 These days at Florida, the sounds are more like, ooohs and aaahhs. Kruger has 
restored stability to a program that had none during the later days of Norm 
Sloan's controversial regime or interim coach DeVoe's doomed one-season stay. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cross: "It's been hard. The past couple of years people never thought of 
Florida basketball. But it was just a matter of time before Coach Kruger got 
the right players." 
</P>
<P>
 Kruger might not be Mr. Glib, but Florida was more interested in victories and 
integrity than one-liners, anyway. With Kruger, you get heartland values, 
discipline and a no-nonsense offense and defense. He preaches family and he 
means it, which explains why his 10-year-old son Kevin sits on the bench during 
games. Or why Kruger comes to the operating room when one of his players 
undergoes surgery. Or why he has immersed himself in community charities and 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, the school and the city have embraced Kruger and his team. For the 
first time in years, Gator spring football isn't more important than Gator 
basketball. Thank-you notes can be sent to Kruger. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just comes across as being a very open young man," Cross said, lapsing 
into Kruger-speak. "But there are times when he cracks jokes and wants to be a 
comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Kruger-watchers, stunned at the revelation, ask for an example. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he around?" Cross said, looking for his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown finally broke the cone of silence. He said that during a timeout in the 
Gators' victory over Connecticut, Kruger turned to Cross in the huddle. Moments 
earlier, Cross had just shot an airball from the baseline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time you take that shot," Kruger said that night, "make sure you hit 
something . . . . like the backboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross and Brown still laugh at the story. It seems to be going around -- the 
smiles, that is. Final Fours can do that.

JONES TURNS DALLAS INTO SWITZER-LAND; COWBOYS: ONE DAY AFTER JOHNSON LEAVES, 
FORMER OKLAHOMA COACH GETS THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The football world discovered Wednesday that there indeed exists something 
more implausible than the Dallas Cowboys without Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys with Barry Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Jerry Jones didn't even wait until the hair spray was cold before 
replacing Johnson with Switzer, a former University of Oklahoma coach who has 
not worked on a football field in five years and never in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, who was Jones' freshman coach at University of Arkansas, becomes the 
third coach in the Cowboys' 35-year history. He inherits a defending two-time 
Super Bowl championship team that was built by Johnson, who resigned Tuesday 
after a prolonged personality clash with Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get ready to watch the Dallas Cowboys be the best in the NFL," Switzer said 
at a news conference Wednesday in Irving, Tex. "We have a job to do and we're 
gonna do it, baby!" 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer, 56, won three national titles in 16 seasons at Oklahoma before 
resigning amid scandal in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer will have much less input on personnel decisions than Johnson, 
immediately evident when it was announced that he will keep every current 
Cowboy coach, including new offensive coordinator Ernie Zampese and defensive 
coordinator Butch Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a smart first step in gaining confidence of players who earlier had 
scoffed at the idea of playing for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Barry is an outstanding coach and the transition should be smooth," 
said Troy Aikman, the Cowboys' quarterback, who met with Jones and Switzer on 
Wednesday. "He's keeping the same staff. We're keeping the same offense and 
defense. I think we'll be comfortable with what he's trying to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman was recruited by Switzer out of high school in Henryetta, Okla., while 
being promised that the Sooners were switching to a passing offense. When 
Switzer reneged on that promise, Aikman transferred to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer implied that he would not attempt to bring that same wishbone offense 
to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will not be any changes," he said. "I hope the Cowboys don't change. 
Jimmy and I are a lot alike. We've always been motivated and able to 
communicate to our teams. I just hope I can be compared to what Jimmy did." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer won 84% of his games at Oklahoma (157-29-4), the fourth-best 
percentage in college football history. The Sooners won the first 30 games that 
Switzer coached, including two national championships during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time he resigned, the football program had been placed on NCAA 
probation, three players had been charged with rape, another was charged with 
shooting a teammate, and his quarterback was indicted on cocaine-related 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 He has spent the last five years as a businessman in Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would have an opportunity," he said of coaching in the NFL. 
"I thought my time had passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who Switzer claimed called him as early as last week about the job, was 
apparently the only executive in football who had been waiting to give him that 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones first mentioned Switzer's name during a late-night session with writers 
last week at the NFL owner's meetings in Orlando, Fla., loudly proclaiming that 
he should fire Johnson and hire Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that comment, which was later relayed to Johnson, that led to Monday's 
parting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy next to me has my total personal trust and commitment," Jones said of 
Switzer. "I feel very confident that the continuity can be kept in place and be 
motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 In three of Switzer's final four years at Oklahoma, his only loss came at the 
hands of University of Miami, which was coached by Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have an even more difficult task stepping out of Johnson's shadow in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy wasn't a big X's and O's guy, but he had a special ability to keep 
those players focused, intense and believing in each other and him," said Bob 
Ackles, the Phoenix Cardinals' assistant general manager, who helped build the 
Cowboys. "It's going to be very difficult to replace that." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Emmitt Smith, who announced several days ago that he wanted to be 
fired if Johnson was fired, was acting Wednesday as if he would give Switzer a 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no need for me to moan and groan," he said. "I have to make the best 
of the situation and keep moving." 
</P>
<P>
 The only Cowboy still openly hostile about the decision was receiver Michael 
Irvin, who slammed doors at the training facility and refused comment. He was 
apparently sticking to his earlier answer when asked if he would play for 
Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell no," he said.

A BIG SPLASH, THEN NO CASH; WFL MADE HISTORY IN 1974, BUT 'WHIFFLE BALL' DIDN'T 
LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years ago today, a couple of Newport Beach lawyers with hair over their 
ears and wide lapels shook the National Football League to its core by putting 
a bold experiment, the World Football League, on page one.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's hard to imagine anyone getting excited about a $3-million contract 
for one athlete, let alone three. But the WFL wanted shock value, and that's 
how much it had to pay for Miami Dolphin stars Larry Csonka, Jim Kiick and Paul 
Warfield.  
</P>
<P>
 The engineers behind the deal were Gary Davidson and Don Regan, the Newport 
Beach lawyers who organized the league.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting in the fall of 1973 and continuing in early 1974, there had been a 
smattering of stories about a new pro football league. But the reaction was 
mostly snickering, particularly after the WFL said it would play on Wednesday 
nights -- with a yellow football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whiffle ball," NFL people called it, often with a sneer. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sunday afternoon, March 31, 1974, all the WFL jokes stopped.  
</P>
<P>
 Csonka, Kiick and Warfield appeared with Howard 
</P>
<P>
 Cosell on ABC that day and announced they had signed to play for the WFL's 
Toronto -- later to become Memphis -- franchise in 1975.  
</P>
<P>
 It was a $3-million deal, the largest sports contract in history to that 
point, and a sensational news story. It gave the WFL instant credibility, and 
it made the half-century-old NFL tremble a bit, if but for a few months.  
</P>
<P>
 Kiick and Warfield were key performers at Miami, and Csonka is still perhaps 
the most effective fullback of the last 30 years. Moreover, all three were 
stars in a Dolphin dynasty, which began with Miami's perfect 17-0 1972 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the NFL, executive office doors were shut the next morning. Owners 
huddled with general managers and coaches, taking a close look at players who 
might jump.  
</P>
<P>
 Plenty did. Quarterback Virgil Carter had been the first to go. After him came 
veterans Calvin Hill, Ted Kwalick, Daryle Lamonica, Dick Witcher, John Elliott, 
Gerry Philbin, George Sauer and others.  
</P>
<P>
 In early 1973, Davidson and Regan found franchise owners in Anaheim, 
Birmingham, Chicago, Detroit, Orlando, Honolulu, Houston, Jacksonville, 
Toronto, New York (later Charlotte), Philadelphia and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in league meetings, it was agreed the league needed to sign a big-name 
NFL player early and parlay that into season-ticket sales and a TV contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Prime target: Joe Namath. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of meetings with Namath's agent, a guy no one could stand, and 
we just weren't getting anywhere," Regan recalled recently. "Then the IMG 
(International Management Group) guy who represented Kiick, Csonka and Warfield 
contacted John Bassett, who at the time owned the WFL's Toronto franchise, and 
told him the three players' options would be up after the '74 season and that 
they wanted to talk to us. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bassett called us about it, and we called a league meeting. Everyone agreed 
we needed to sign all three guys. We forgot about Namath. Bassett paid for half 
the deal, and the rest of the owners chipped in the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The deal was agreed to, but no one outside the league knew about it. The 
three players went to Miami and asked (Dolphin owner) Joe Robbie if he wanted 
to match the deal, and he blew up and threw them out of his office." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, an angry Robbie told a reporter: "Has anyone ever asked you to 
deposit $3 million in a bank as the price to continue a conversation?"  
</P>
<P>
 The numbers, in 1974, were breathtaking: Csonka, 27, got $500,000 up front and 
a $325,000 salary for three years. Warfield, 31, signed for a $220,000 salary. 
Kiick, 27, signed for $150,000. The three would join the new league in 1975, 
but not in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian Parliament threw the WFL out of Canada, claiming it would 
endanger the Canadian Football League. Bassett moved to Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Paying high-profile athletes to jump leagues didn't begin with the WFL's 
signing of Csonka, Warfield and Kiick.  
</P>
<P>
 When Davidson and Regan organized the World Hockey Assn. in 1972, they passed 
the hat among owners, extracted $90,000 from each, and wrote a $1-million check 
to bring Bobby Hull out of the National Hockey League.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, Davidson and Regan created the American Basketball Assn., which 
later merged with the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
 After the WFL signed Csonka, Warfield and Kiick, business moved along briskly 
for the new league, headquartered in a two-story office building a stone's 
throw from Orange County Airport.  
</P>
<P>
 After Miami's Big Three signed, it seemed as if an NFL player jumped every 
day. Colorful uniforms -- the Southern California Sun team colors were magenta 
and orange -- were purchased. Season tickets went on sale. Schedules were made. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no network TV package, but an independent syndicator, TVS, televised 
the league's "game of the week" on Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of the Miami Three almost put Davidson on the cover of Sports 
Illustrated before the first league game. The magazine photographed him with 
Kwalick and Hill. It was to be the cover in April, 1974.  
</P>
<P>
 Unhappily for Davidson, Hank Aaron chose the same week to hit his 715th career 
home run, the day before the Davidson SI cover edition was to go to press. 
Today, a copy of the never-seen cover hangs on Davidson's office wall in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 When the games began, optimism was sky high. The league's first game was July 
10, 1974, a Wednesday night Southern California-Birmingham game at 72,000-seat 
Legion Field in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of more than 50,000 showed up, and Davidson was cheered loudly before 
the game. "I'm overwhelmed," he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember thinking to myself that night: 'I'll never have to prove myself 
again,' " he said recently.  
</P>
<P>
 In the first weeks, there were no sellouts, but crowds were decent-sized 
almost everywhere. A good base upon which to build, everyone agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, two trouble signs: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In a televised game at Philadelphia's 100,000-seat JFK Stadium, before an 
announced paid crowd of about 10,000, hundreds of small boys poured out of end 
zone seats, chasing loose balls.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, columnists everywhere wondered if the mobs of kids were included 
in the paid crowd count.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Ownership in Detroit informed league officials in Newport Beach that they 
soon would be unable to make their payroll. Shortly afterward, a similar report 
came in from Jacksonville. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philadelphia Bell team admitted that 100,000 of its first 120,000 "sold" 
tickets were either freebies or sold at big discounts.  
</P>
<P>
 In Detroit, the Wheels' program printer loudly demanded cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jacksonville, after it got out that owner Fran Monaco had team debts of 
$1.8 million, he said: "I never said I was Lamar Hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the beginning of the end.  
</P>
<P>
 Davidson recently talked about the first signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1991, I was asked to speak at the Harvard Business School about our WFL 
experience," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I likened it to being in a mountain small-plane crash in a snowstorm with 10 
people aboard. Six are very seriously injured and four are uninjured.  
</P>
<P>
 "The uninjured have a dilemma: Do they endanger the safety of the entire group 
by trying to carry out the injured?  
</P>
<P>
 "We did that in the WFL, and it was a mistake. We let Detroit and Jacksonville 
stay in, and the rest of the league covered their losses.  
</P>
<P>
 "If we'd folded those two up at the outset of trouble, I'm convinced today the 
league would have survived, that it would have had a network TV contract in its 
third year, that we'd have merged with the NFL a few years after that and that 
cities like Memphis and Birmingham would today be NFL cities." 
</P>
<P>
 Covering Detroit's and Jacksonville's losses steadily weakened the resolve of 
the other owners, Davidson added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we could have just made it to '76, when the economy turned around, we 
could have replaced all the owners, if we'd wanted to. Eli Broad (of the 
Kaufman & Broad construction firm) wanted in." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, the WFL limped to the finish line in rising tides of red ink and 
missed paydays. Players were sleeping on floors and eating canned tuna.  
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath, Davidson and Regan were ousted and the league was 
reorganized under a new leader, Chris Hemmeter, owner of the Hawaiians 
franchise.  
</P>
<P>
 But 1974 baggage followed the cash-short league in its second and final 
season, too, even with the arrival of Csonka, Kiick and Warfield.  
</P>
<P>
 The WFL officially died on Oct. 22, 1975, late in its second season.  
</P>
<P>
 When Tom Fears, coach of the Southern California Sun, told his players the 
league had folded, 14 of them met at the nearest bar and rallied around 27 
pitchers of beer. When the WFL's obituaries were written, a common critique of 
the league was that it didn't make it because Davidson was in too big a hurry, 
that if he had spent all of 1974 organizing for a 1975 inaugural season, his 
league would have survived.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not true," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "In 1974, we had the best organization and the best people of any of the three 
leagues we'd started. If the economy had remained strong and if we'd cut our 
bad franchises early, we'd have made it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Csonka is a motivational speaker and co-host of the TV show "American 
Gladiators" and lives in Lisbon, Ohio. Warfield is president of a management 
consultant firm in Moraine, Ohio. Kiick is an investigator for the Broward 
County Public Defender's Office in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.  
</P>
<P>
 Davidson, 59, is founder and chairman of ARV Housing Group, a Costa Mesa-based 
firm that builds retirement communities nationwide. Regan, 59, is ARV's legal 
counsel. Bassett died of cancer in 1986, at 47.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, a year after the WFL died, a reporter added up the dollar impact 
Davidson had on pro sports in America.  
</P>
<P>
 Factors covered included everything from higher salaries the NBA, NHL and NFL 
were forced to pay their athletes to arenas and stadiums built or renovated to 
accommodate Davidson/Regan leagues. Grand total: Approximately $500 million.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; NEW YORK PREP STARS ARE STAYING CLOSE 
TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As always with recruiting news, the following should be taken with several 
grains of sodium. . . 
</P>
<P>
 According to talent scout Bob Gibbons, editor and publisher of All Star Sports 
publications, St. John's moved into the recruiting class top 10 with the recent 
signings of New York prep stars Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a shooting guard, has received the most hype, but none of it will 
matter if the Redmen don't find a point guard to get him the ball. The same 
goes for Hamilton, a 6-11 center. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, point guard Jelani Gardner from St. John Bosco is supposedly 
leaning toward Arkansas. Gibbons said Gardner's parents recently flew to the 
Fayetteville campus at their own expense and met with Razorback Coach Nolan 
Richardson. This isn't great news for UCLA or Cal, which both want Gardner. Cal 
Coach Todd Bozeman is dangling a starting job, now that Jason Kidd is leaving 
for the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks also might get 6-8 forward Jerod Ward of Clinton, Miss. Ward's 
fifth and final campus visit will be to Arkansas on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Arkansas landed those two kids," Gibbons said, "it would not be a Fab 
Five, but it sure would be a Magnificent Two." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Gibbons items: 
</P>
<P>
 -- UCLA and Duke are pursuing Brandon Jessie, a 6-6 small forward at Ventura 
College. The son of former Ram Ron Jessie, Brandon is friendly with Blue Devil 
center Cherokee Parks. Also interesting is that Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski 
never has taken a junior college player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gardner originally was leaning toward UCLA, but now, who knows? 
</P>
<P>
 "All the (Jim) Harrick bashing. . .with those West Coast kids there's some 
prima donnas," Gibbons said. "That's the problem Harrick has. Those guys are so 
jaded by they time they get there." 
</P>
<P>
 However it shakes out, Gibbons gives high marks to the recruiting classes 
assembled by Indiana, Duke, UCLA, Virginia, Boston College and St. John's, 
among others. DO THEY STAY OR DO THEY GO? Four of the five players on the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Assn. first team are underclassmen. One of the players, 
Kidd, already has decided to forgo his final two years of eligibility for the 
NBA. The other three -- junior center Clifford Rozier of Louisville, junior 
forward Glenn Robinson of Purdue and junior forward Donyell Marshall of 
Connecticut -- have yet to declare their intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, the four underclassmen have one thing in common: forgettable 
final games of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cal's second-round upset loss to Wisconsin Green Bay, Kidd scored 12 
points, but it took 17 shots (one of seven from the three-point line) to do it. 
He had 11 rebounds and seven assists, but committed six turnovers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In Louisville's Sweet 16 loss to Arizona, Rozier made only one of four shots, 
scored five points and collected seven rebounds in 36 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Purdue's regional final defeat to Duke, Robinson, the player of the year, 
scored a season-low 13 points (six of 22 from the field, 0 for 6 from the 
three-point line), but added 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Connecticut's regional semifinal loss to Florida, Marshall could do no 
better than 16 points (five of 13 from the field, 0 for five on three-pointers) 
in 44 minutes of playing time. With the score tied and only 3.4 seconds 
remaining in regulation, Marshall also missed two free throws. DO THEY STAY OR 
DO THEY GO? -- PART II 
</P>
<P>
 You also can add Michigan junior guard Jalen Rose to the list of star players 
who struggled in their final game of the tournament. Rose finished with only 13 
points on five-of-19 shooting in the Wolverines' regional final loss to 
Arkansas. Included in the misses were two game-tying shots -- one a layup, one 
a three-pointer -- in the last 4:52. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, beginning with a March 6 home loss to Purdue, Rose scored under his 
season average of 20.6 in six of the final seven games (13, 20, 13, 17, 16, 
13). 
</P>
<P>
 Cal junior forward Lamond Murray, also projected to go fairly high in the 
draft, ended his season with a 19-point, 11-rebound effort against Wisconsin 
Green Bay. But Murray, who has scheduled an April 11 news conference to 
announce his decision, was six of 21 from the field, 0 for 7 from the 
three-point line.  
</P>
<P>
 Two players who might have helped themselves: Yinka Dare, the George 
Washington sophomore center who has since declared himself eligible for the 
draft, and Michigan junior center Juwan Howard, who has yet to decide whether 
to leave Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
 In George Washington's loss to Connecticut, Dare had 19 points (nine of 15 
from the field), 12 rebounds and one block. Still, Dare's departure prompted 
Colonial Coach Mike Jarvis to say that the Nigerian center wasn't ready yet for 
the jump to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: Dare, who has played only three seasons of organized basketball, 
will be a lottery pick. His upside (7-1, 265 pounds, improved skills, defensive 
intimidator) outweighs his lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is lottery material, if he chooses to skip his senior season. He scored 
30 points against Arkansas, making 11 of 17 shots, and had 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the March 6 Purdue game, Howard scored 27, 21, 32, 28, 34, 24 
and 30 points. Even with his team eliminated, Howard would have to head a list 
of tournament MVP candidates, along with Duke's Grant Hill, Florida's Craig 
Brown and the Arizona tag team of Khalid Reeves and Damon Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan officials said Rose and Howard haven't indicated whether they will 
take advantage of a new NCAA rule that allows players to have their eligibility 
restored up to 30 days after the draft. DIGGING FROM THE RUINS 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Marquette's Kevin O'Neill was hired to revive a Tennessee program 
that hasn't been to the NCAA tournament since 1989 and hasn't won an NCAA 
tournament game since 1983, when it beat -- ta-da -- Marquette. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after taking the job, O'Neill, 37, had received 226 phone messages. 
If you can't play, don't expect a return call anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first priority is getting in touch with maybe some possible recruits," he 
said. "Then I need to put together my staff. Some of my guys are coming, some 
of them don't want to come. Then I want to get a handle on things here, 
especially with my players." 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck. The Volunteers (5-22) suffered through their worst season in 32 
years. In his five years at Tennessee, Wade Houston was 65-90, which is one of 
the reasons why the school's women's team was outdrawing the men. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when O'Neill called his former boss at Arizona, Lute Olson, the Wildcat 
coach told him not to think twice about taking the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the only time I wavered was when I was sitting down to tell Tony 
Miller (Marquette's junior point guard) that I was leaving," O'Neill said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Milwaukee's a memory, Knoxville the future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill never had seen the Tennessee campus until Marquette played in the 
Southeast Regional at 24,535-seat Thompson-Boling Arena. Volunteer fans must 
have loved it when O'Neill's Warriors upset Kentucky earlier in the tournament 
and then played Duke tough in the regional semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee is no easy reconstruction project. O'Neill signed a five-year, 
$1.2-million deal, which also allows for additional income via shoe 
endorsements and summer basketball camps. Considering the state of things, five 
years sounds about right. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite an 86-62 record at Marquette and two consecutive NCAA tournament 
appearances, O'Neill, who sometimes didn't get along with the Milwaukee locals, 
said he has adopted one new rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to learn to keep my mouth shut on certain occasions and not say 
stupid things like I've done in the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, no promises of a quick fix in a conference that includes Arkansas' 
Richardson, Kentucky's Rick Pitino, Florida's Lon Kruger, South Carolina's 
Eddie Fogler, Louisiana State's Dale Brown and Georgia's Hugh Durham. Of that 
group, only Fogler hasn't led a team to a Final Four appearance. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 One of Duke's biggest (and also smallest) fans might be sitting on the Florida 
bench Saturday. Kevin Kruger, 10-year-old son of Florida Coach Lon Kruger, is a 
Blue Devil fanatic. For Christmas, Florida sports information department 
officials arranged for Duke to send little Kruger an official Blue Devil 
sweatshirt. And when Duke played Florida State at Tallahassee earlier in the 
season, Kevin attended the game -- the tickets courtesy of the Blue Devils. No 
word yet on Kevin's NCAA semifinal allegiances. . .Just when you want to admire 
the Arizona team for a job well done in the tournament, Arizona's Olson opens 
his mouth. Rather than savor the moment of reaching the Final Four, Olson felt 
he needed to stick it to his program's critics. By doing so, he took the 
attention from where it belonged -- the surprising Wildcats -- and moved it 
toward him and his personal catfight with assorted media types. Not only was it 
unfair to his team, it was unnecessary. The Final Four appearance was enough to 
quiet the critics (ourselves included). The postgame rantings by Olson 
accomplished nothing. ... On Marquette's short list to succeed O'Neill: Duke 
assistant Tommy Amaker. Another Duke assistant, Mike Brey, is one of the 
leading candidates for the Auburn opening. Cliff Ellis, who "resigned" at 
Clemson, is also one of the finalists. . .New Southeastern Conference ties 
aside, O'Neill said his heart says to pick Arizona in the Final Four. "I really 
wish I wouldn't have gotten in the SEC right now," said O'Neill, whose 
conference features two Final Four teams, favored Arkansas and underdog 
Florida. "I want to see Arizona win.". . .O'Neill, whose Marquette team played 
both Duke and Arizona this season, isn't entirely alone in his pro-Wildcat 
stance. Boston College Coach Jim O'Brien was asked to compare Arizona's 
backcourt of Stoudamire and Reeves to Florida's wonderful guards, Brown and Dan 
Cross. "Boy, you know Arizona's backcourt. . .those guys are pretty darn good. 
I think these two (Florida) kids are two of the more underrated kids, but those 
two guys from Arizona are terrific." Arizona beat Boston College by five points 
in December. . .UCLA's Harrick, appearing on an InterSport Final Four preview 
show, picked Arizona to beat Duke for the championship. He also said he had 
heard that Purdue's Robinson could receive a multi-year NBA contract worth 
possibly $100 million if he came out. . .Also appearing on the show was LSU's 
Brown, a close friend of John Wooden, and outspoken Harrick critic Bill Walton. 
As a surprised Harrick looked on, Brown turned toward the camera and said, 
"Bill Walton, if you're watching tonight, will you get off Jim Harrick's back?"

 The President will be there. Then again, maybe he won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners for the NCAA Final Four are preparing to go either way depending on 
what the Arkansas Razorbacks' most visible fan chooses. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest version of President Clinton's weekend plans appear to rule out a 
trip to Charlotte on Saturday. Secret Service agents have told police planners 
Clinton will skip the semifinal games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monday is still up in the air, or any other day for that matter," police 
spokeswoman Mickey Casey said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said on national television last Sunday he planned to attend 
Saturday's game between Arkansas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 If the First Family wants to catch the games, they will be handed some of the 
hottest sports tickets of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the NCAA has a reserve pool of tickets in case something happens," 
said Kathryn Reith, spokeswoman for the NCAA entourage in Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Security measures would be tightened if Clinton came to Charlotte, Reith said.

 Arkansas has Corey Beck and Clint McDaniel.

 Forgive Richardson if he babbles on about Corliss Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, a 6-7, 245-pound sophomore forward, is averaging about 20 points 
and eight rebounds per game. Along with freshman center Darnell Robinson and 
junior forward Dwight Stewart, Arkansas now has an inside game not always seen 
in Fayetteville in past seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corliss, pound for pound, is probably the strongest kid in the universe," 
said Richardson, who compares Williamson to former Nevada Las Vegas star Larry 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was Johnson, when UNLV played Arkansas several years ago, who ran 
by the Razorback bench after a dunk and told Richardson, "Hey, you're going to 
have to get some men in there."

 Said Richardson Wednesday: "It was something I thought was real cute. And he 
was absolutely right."

 Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said he doesn't think Duke, which is located about 
120 miles from Charlotte, will benefit from the Final Four tournament site.

GROWING INTO THE GAME; FUERBRINGER GETS SERIOUS, MAKES MARK IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stanford volleyball Coach Ruben Nieves attended the 1991 State high school 
basketball finals in Oakland to catch a glimpse of Estancia High's Matt 
Fuerbringer -- and the Cardinal's volleyball future. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuerbringer, only a junior, left Oakland with a State championship medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nieves left so impressed that, three years later, he can still rattle off 
Fuerbringer's highlight reel like he just saw it on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 First minute, Fuerbringer went over two players and dunked. Went high for 
rebounds. Ran the floor well and showed the quick leaping ability that makes 
good collegiate volleyball players into great ones.  
</P>
<P>
 "Matt was just an animal out there," Nieves said. "He was dunking from the 
first minute of the game and was asking for the ball down the stretch. That's 
what really struck me about Matt, that when it gets down to the nitty-gritty in 
a game, he's at his best." 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine, Nieves thought, what this 6-foot-7 kid could do for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, he is finding out. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced by Nieves that his athletic skills were better suited for 
volleyball, Fuerbringer turned down basketball scholarship offers from several 
small West Coast schools to become the centerpiece of Nieves' fifth-ranked 
Stanford team. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a redshirt freshman season and arthroscopic surgery on his right 
hitting shoulder, Fuerbringer leads the nation in kills per game (7.22). His 44 
kills against USC in February is the second-best single-match performance in 
the nation this season behind San Diego State's John Hyden (49 kills). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty surprised to be getting as many sets as I have been," Fuerbringer 
said, "especially coming off last season. It wasn't really a freshman year for 
me because volleyball was still such a new sport to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played since the seventh grade and in high school, but not as much as I do 
here. It was a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And a painful one. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in fall practice, Nieves noticed several flaws in Fuerbringer's hitting 
technique. As the coaches and trainers worked with him to correct his approach 
and swing, they noticed swelling in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pre-existing condition," Nieves said. "Matt developed it long before 
he got here. Our adjustment in his arm swing not only helped him be more 
effective as a hitter, but it has helped him stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuerbringer has his own theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Estancia's basketball season ran late because of the playoffs every 
year, he only competed in about half of each volleyball season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he was hitting only about half as much as other high school 
players, and his shoulder strength wasn't developed for the amount of hitting 
required in a college practice or match. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford trainers told him a loose joint in his shoulder forced his muscles 
and tendons to swell and pinch against each other. Ice, rehabilitation and 
anti-inflammatory drugs helped, but it didn't solve the problem. But the 
arthroscopic surgery last May did, repairing some scarred tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They cleaned it out using this new laser technique at the Stanford Hospital," 
Fuerbringer said. "It worked great, but it was a long road back. The recovery 
time was supposed to be six to eight weeks, but it took six months. The first 
few weeks of practice I hit only every other day. It just wasn't strong enough 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuerbringer still ices the shoulder and takes anti-inflammatory drugs, but 
said the shoulder is nearly back to 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll have to do those things all my life," he said. "The surgery wasn't a 
cure-all, but it got me to the point where I can play." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, his shoulder, and Stanford opponents, have taken a pounding this 
season. Besides his 49-kill match, he has matches of 40 kills against Indiana 
Purdue-Ft. Wayne, 39 against UC Santa Barbara, 36 against Loyola Marymount and 
32 against Long Beach State. 
</P>
<P>
 "His shoulder has held up really well," Nieves said. "I think his hitting load 
speaks for itself. There's no way he could hit that many balls in a match with 
a sore shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuerbringer's play has a young Stanford team in contention for a national 
title. The Cardinal has started as many as two true freshmen, sophomore Mike 
Lambert and Fuerbringer. After a 1-3 start, they have improved to 11-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I would be playing basketball in college," said Fuerbringer, 
who averaged 19 points as a senior at Estancia, leading the Eagles to a 
Southern Section title and a State championship in his three seasons as a 
varsity starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I wanted to play for a national championship team in college, and the 
basketball schools recruiting me, UC Santa Barbara, University of San Diego and 
Cal State Fullerton, weren't going to contend for a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's volleyball team is a national contender almost every year, a point 
Nieves made clear during his recruiting visits. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we recruited Matt, we thought he could be a major international 
volleyball player," Nieves said. "He was a major high school basketball player, 
but we knew he could make it to the highest levels of volleyball, whether it 
was the Olympics, playing professionally in Europe or with the Assn. of 
Volleyball Professionals on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would he be able to do that in basketball, play in the NBA? That's 
debatable." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a debate Fuerbringer wasn't about to start. He had played for winners 
in basketball and in Balboa Bay Club's successful volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of Fuerbringer's basketball offers paid full tuition, the men's 
volleyball teams, because of NCAA limitations and gender equity, could offer 
him little more than book money. Playing volleyball would be somewhat of a 
risk, but with the help of some non-athletic financial aid, Fuerbringer thought 
it was a chance worth taking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized when I was playing basketball at Estancia that all the individual 
recognition is nothing compared to winning," he said. "And when you win, a lot 
of the individual recognition comes along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as All-American status, which might not be too much of a reach 
considering how well Fuerbringer is playing. But that thought is buried deep in 
the back of his mind, along with aspirations of playing in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think that's in my future," Fuerbringer said. "Hopefully, I'll stay 
healthy and everything will fall in the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 If not, there's always basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford basketball Coach Mike Montgomery recently invited Fuerbringer to join 
the team as a walk-on. He also mentioned a full scholarship could be opening up 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fuerbringer turned the offer down. He already had a sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "They needed another guy for practice, but they said they had another 
scholarship opening up next year," he said. "Besides, I don't think my body 
could take playing two sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'll give basketball a try someday, though. But with volleyball, at 
least I know I can control my destiny." License to Kill 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford volleyball player Matt Fuerbringer, a former Estancia High standout, 
has three of the top 10 single-match performances in the nation this season, 
according to statistics compiled by the American Volleyball Coaches Assn.

COMMENTARY; WHO'S GOING TO BE TOASTING THE COWBOYS NOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours after announcing in an Orlando hotel bar that he wanted to fire Jimmy 
Johnson and hire Barry Switzer, the owner of the Dallas Cowboys was confronted 
last week with his comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw," he said, "that was just whiskey talking." 
</P>
<P>
 So much became obvious on Wednesday in an announcement that made our skin 
crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the shots for America's premier sports franchise is not Jerry Jones, 
but Jack Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Who else would have hired Barry Switzer as a head coach? 
</P>
<P>
 Who else would have placed America's Team under the charge of America's Most 
Wanted? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever shreds of good publicity Jones garnered by allowing Jimmy Johnson to 
walk away with a fistful of dollars Tuesday vanished Wednesday when he handed 
his two-time defending Super Bowl champions to a man whose first task will be 
to read an NFL rulebook. 
</P>
<P>
 A man whose idea of a big play is a pitchout. 
</P>
<P>
 A man whose idea is a big game is one at Ames, Iowa, in November. 
</P>
<P>
 A man whose idea of a good quarterback is Thomas Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 A man who gave us Brian Bosworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer is not NFL head coaching material. He is whiskey talking. 
</P>
<P>
 So Jones wanted a former college coaches with twang who haven't worked in five 
years? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not Frank Broyles? Was Darrell Royal busy? 
</P>
<P>
 Why hire the one man who has never coached your offense, never coached in your 
league, rarely even coached players who have been successful in your league? 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry, because he was your freshman football coach at Arkansas? Because he 
talks like you? Because he has less hair than you? 
</P>
<P>
 The smart move would have been to hire defensive coordinator Butch Davis. One 
of Jimmy's guys. Make the players believe that Jerry would have never fired 
Jimmy, that he loved Jimmy's entire system, that he was just trying to survive 
now that Jimmy has abandoned them. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Jerry does the one and only thing that makes players and the public 
believe the worst thing they can possibly believe. 
</P>
<P>
 That Jerry was going to fire Jimmy if he didn't quit first. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer contributed to this notion in Wednesday's news conference when he said 
that Jones had phoned him last week about the job. Jones later disputed that, 
saying he had only phoned him to explain why he had spoken his name in that 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones says he didn't talk about the job with Switzer until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard to tell what to believe. But Wednesday's announcement was not to 
believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Switzer going to draft next month? He hasn't been involved in college 
football since Johnson coached there. 
</P>
<P>
 Who will he sign to replace the Cowboy free agents who will think twice about 
returning to a home that has been ravaged? Does he even know how many teams are 
in the league? 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cowboys have done to themselves off the field what no other NFL team has 
been able to do to them on the field," said agent Leigh Steinberg, who has been 
counseling client Troy Aikman to be a voice of reason in this madness. "Emotion 
has overcome self-interest. They have forgotten very quickly what it is like to 
be 1-15." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, we were saying this about Jones before. Remember when he fired the 
guy with the hat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry has qualities very similar to that other Arkansas comeback kid," 
Steinberg said. "My feeling is that in the long run, this could be a success. 
But in the short run? Well . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 In bars throughout Dallas, whiskey sours are loudly insulting margaritas and 
then claiming, "Aw, that was just Jerry Jones talking."

WANT TO START A NEW FOOTBALL LEAGUE? TAKE HIS EXPERT ADVICE -- AND DON'T 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Isn't it time for someone to start another pro football league? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it has been 20 years since the World Football League experiment, 
and 10 years since the U.S. Football League tried.Both failed. The World League 
of American Football didn't make much of a splash, either, but it was a 
development league for the NFL, not competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Who better to ask about new leagues than Gary Davidson, a founder of the 
American Basketball Assn., World Hockey Assn. and the WFL?  
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's not a good time," he said. "Even if you got financing to start a new 
football league, the numbers would just scare you to death. When we started the 
ABA, the team budgets were $360,000 each, per year. That was for everything -- 
player and administrative salaries, rent, uniforms . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "NFL player salaries have reached the point where I just can't imagine anyone 
willing to match them. What does surprise me today is that no one has tried 
another major soccer league until now. There are plenty of stadiums, and it's a 
sport where you can pick your own season. If you fix the rules so you get more 
scoring, I think soccer would work now." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, president of the U.S. Soccer Federation and the World Cup 
Organizing Committee, has proposed the formation of a major U.S. pro soccer 
league for 1995. EARL GUSTKEY

HIGHLAND'S DAVIS CHANGES DIRECTION, PICKS GEORGE MASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, he's sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pharoah Davis, a standout forward at Highland High, said Wednesday he will 
sign to play college basketball for Coach Paul Westhead at George Mason in 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis made an oral commitment to San Diego State in September, then backed out 
a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think I made the decision a little prematurely," Davis said. "I didn't 
know what I wanted to do at the time. When I went to George Mason, I knew that 
was where I wanted to be. I just got a gut feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The same gut feeling he got at San Diego State? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm positive this time," Davis said. "If I'm not, it's a little late." 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA spring signing period begins April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who averaged 22 points per game for the Bulldogs, said recruiting was 
slow early in the season because most schools assumed he had signed with San 
Diego State. But once word was out that he was still available, he accepted 
trips to Louisiana State, Arizona State and Texas El Paso. He said he also had 
an offer to visit Marquette, but never made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was swayed toward George Mason, a Division I school in Fairfax, Va., 
because of Westhead, who just completed his first season there after coaching 
the Lakers, Loyola Marymount and the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaching staff was the big reason (for choosing George Mason)," Davis 
said. "If you are going to be somewhere for four years, you really don't want 
to go somewhere where you aren't going to be comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Westhead led the Patriots to a 10-17 record this season, following 
back-to-back seven-victory seasons. George Mason's only NCAA tournament 
appearance was in 1989.

RAMS MATCH REDSKINS' DEAL TO WOODS; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM ALSO WILL ATTEMPT TO 
SIGN ATLANTA OFFENSIVE TACKLE MIKE KENN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams tried to keep defensive end Tony Woods from moving to the Washington 
Redskins Wednesday and attempted to convince offensive tackle Mike Kenn to 
leave Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenn, president of the NFL Players Assn., met with team officials at Rams 
Park.The Rams reviewed Kenn's work on videotape, and believe he has the 
pass-blocking skills to start at left tackle and protect his former teammate, 
quarterback Chris Miller, who recently signed with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give it a try, and see if we can sign him," said Jay Zygmunt, 
Ram senior vice president.  
</P>
<P>
 Zygmunt admitted he was skeptical about Kenn's intentions, however. Kenn, 38, 
has played 16 years with the Falcons and has a $1.2 million offer on the table 
to return to Atlanta, although the Falcons have informed him that he must take 
that offer by today or risk it being removed. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kenn leaves Atlanta, the Falcons are expected to try to sign Ram tackle 
Jackie Slater. Slater met with Falcon officials earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very interested," said June Jones, Atlanta coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams moved quickly Wednesday to stop the Redskins from signing Woods, who 
started eight games for the team a year ago. The Redskins offered Woods $1.7 
million for two years, including a $500,000 signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams matched the Redskins' offer and reminded Woods that they were the

 The Rams' offer, however, is structured differently than the Redskins' and 
does not appear as attractive. The Rams did not offer Woods a signing bonus, 
and said instead they would pay him a base salary of $850,000 for each of the 
next two seasons. The money is not guaranteed.

STOCKS PLUNGE AS TRADERS RACE CALENDAR; MARKETS: WITH FIRST-QUARTER ENDING, 
SELLING ACCELERATES. BOND YIELDS MAINTAIN THEIR UPWARD TREND.

 Stocks and bonds suffered another day of big losses, as rally attempts brought 
out more sellers and as the approach of the holiday weekend increased fund 
managers' urgency to trim holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, which opened the day with a 50-point loss, managed to 
rally to nearly even by midday. But in the final hour of trading the selling 
ballooned again, and the Dow closed down 72.27 points at 3,626.75, its lowest 
close since Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on 30-year Treasury bonds zoomed to a 13-month 
high of 7.10% from Tuesday's 7.06%, though shorter-term yields were slightly 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Yields on mortgage-backed bonds also surged, as that sector of the bond market 
became the latest victim of the problems of major "hedge funds," which have 
wracked up huge losses this year on wrong-sided bets in stock, bond and 
currency markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock market traders said Wednesday's losses were the work of portfolio 
managers who have been late selling in this decline, and who want to lighten up 
their positions before the first quarter ends today. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, with most markets closed on Good Friday, many big traders are unwilling 
to carry heavy stock positions over the three-day weekend -- especially with 
the government reporting Friday on March employment. Traders fear that a strong 
March gain in jobs will fuel new inflation fears, driving bond yields higher 
and setting stocks up for another selloff on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is like Wal-Mart's (ad campaign): Watch out, prices are falling," 
joked Len Hefter, Nasdaq trading chief at Jefferies & Co. in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining stocks swamped advancers by about 6 to 1 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume swelled to 390.5 million shares, up from 301.6 million 
on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of buyers are there, but they're in no particular hurry," 
Hefter said, because they know sellers face quarter-end and holiday-related 
pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the list of investment advisers telling clients to be cautious about 
stocks lengthened on Wednesday, raising concerns that this selloff could go on 
for much longer than the bulls expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman Bros.' influential market analyst Elaine Garzarelli, who won a wide 
following after predicting the 1987 stock market crash, lowered her composite 
stock indicator to 47% from 57.5%, a level she said is considered neutral for 
the market. A reading of 30% or under for her index is viewed as a sell signal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are translating that negative talking into negative action and 
doing some selling," said Marshall Acuff, investment strategist at Smith Barney 
Shearson, whose firm told clients to cut back stock positions on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial, transportation and technology stocks continued to lead the market 
lower. Alcoa fell 2 7/8 to 71 3/4, Dupont lost 1 1/4 to 53 1/4, GE plunged 3 
1/2 to 98 3/4, Federal Express dove 1 7/8 to 66 3/4 and Motorola was off 2 1/4 
to 98 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But the selling also widened to include oil, drug and retail stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bulls have argued that this decline will turn out to be nothing more 
than a classic 10% to 15% market correction, the severity of the selling -- and 
the backdrop of rising interest rates and growing political problems in 
Washington -- are boosting fears that a full-fledged bear market decline of 20% 
or more could be brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wednesday's selling, the Dow now is off 8.8% from its Jan. 31 peak. The 
Standard & Poor's 500 index, off 6.93 points to 445.55 on Wednesday, now is 
down 7.6% from its all-time high. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks, this week's big loser, fell 
another 10.38 points to 744.91 Wednesday. It's off 7.3% from its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, traders said selling was less intense than Tuesday's 
session because many participants have already moved to the sidelines ahead of 
Friday's potentially market-moving March employment report. 
</P>
<P>
 But, with many traders absent, the impact of each trade was magnified, making 
the market unusually volatile. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortgage-backed bonds took a dive. A report in the Wall Street Journal on 
Wednesday about a hedge-fund manager who had suffered deep losses in 
mortgage-backed securities unnerved the market, and left traders guessing about 
other hedge funds that might have to dump those bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Market fears "are going to do away with the CMO (collateralized mortgage 
obligation) market in the short term," said Bill Power, portfolio manager at 
PIMCO in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wall Street's weakness also sent stock prices tumbling overseas. Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng index plunged 247.93 points to 9,232.21, while in Tokyo the Nikkei 
average fell 149.83 points to 19,559.91. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index dropped 31 points to 3,092.4, and in Frankfurt 
the DAX index fell 20.82 points to 2,147.53. Mexico City's Bolsa index ended 
down 47.21 points, or 1.9%, at 2,410.38. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold inched up 10 cents to $386.10 on the Comex; silver fell 1.6 cents to 
$5.86. 
</P>
<P>
 * MAIN STORY: A1 Where Are Stocks Heading? 
</P>
<P>
 Will the stock market continue to drop, or is a rebound coming? Here are some 
key things to look for:  
</P>
<P>
 Bullish: What could make the market rebound 
</P>
<P>
 * The U.S. and world economies show continued moderate growth. This would push 
up demand for products and services, boosting corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest rates level off or fall back. Falling rates drove the bull market 
between 1990 and 1993. Many investors would settle for stable rates now. 
</P>
<P>
 * An easing of political tensions. Whitewater, the Mexican assassination, 
confrontations with North Korea have caused investors to worry more about the 
risks of owning stocks. Resolving these issues could calm investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inflation declines. Some key commodity prices have risen strongly in recent 
months, raising fears of shortages. A reversal of commodity prices could ease 
fears that the Federal Reserve will tighten credit further to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearish: What could drive stocks lower 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest rates rise further. Last week's rate rise, to above 7% on the yield 
on 30-year Treasury bonds, was a significant psychological shock to investors. 
Higher long-term yields could inflame investor worries about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Individual investors rush to pull money out of stock and bond mutual funds. 
Inflows into mutual funds were a key boost during the bull market. Now, money 
has begun to trickle out of bond funds and foreign stock funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Further selling by multibillion-dollar "hedge funds." These global 
speculators have been trying to cut their losses on wrong-way bets made earlier 
this year that the dollar would continue rising and interest rates would 
continue falling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock indexes such as the Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500 
continue to fall below major "technical" levels. For many analysts, key 
indexes' fall below 200-day moving averages this week was a bad sign. How the

SURVEY FINDS SHARP RISE IN WORKING POOR; SALARIES: THE NUMBER OF FULL-TIME 
WORKERS WHO EARN LESS THAN A LIVING WAGE ROSE FROM 12% TO 18% IN 13 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The percentage of gainfully employed Americans receiving poverty-level wages 
rose sharply over the last decade, with nearly one in five full-time employees 
now counted among the working poor, according to a study released Wednesday by 
the Commerce Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, titled "The Earnings Ladder," shows that 18% of Americans with 
year-round full-time jobs had earnings of less than $13,091 in 1992. In 1979, 
only 12% of all full-time workers earned comparably low wages. 
</P>
<P>
 A worker trying to support a family on this wage would be living in poverty: 
the official definition of poverty in 1992 was a family of four earning $14,428 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, by the Census Bureau, a division of the Commerce Department, 
paints a disturbing portrait of a U.S. labor market in which rising numbers of 
individuals are working full time but receiving very low wages. Especially for 
younger workers, and for those who didn't go to college, the job market is a 
much more forbidding place than it was in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The forces behind the trend are well known. The nation is moving away from 
higher-paying manufacturing jobs in the auto, steel, chemical and other 
industries and toward lower-paying service jobs in everything from health care 
to retail stores to fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the extraordinary growth in the poorest paid employees as a 
proportion of the labor force is disconcerting, said Martin Regalia, chief 
economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It highlights the need for improved education and training skills," Regalia 
said, referring to the issues raised by President Clinton at the recent jobs 
summit in Detroit. "Change happens all the time, but we are going through a 
particularly heavy dose now." 
</P>
<P>
 At the higher end of the earnings scale, there was no net change over the 13 
years -- despite a massive wave of layoffs, buyouts and retirements that swept 
through the ranks of well-paid white collar workers and managers. 
</P>
<P>
 As those more highly paid jobs disappeared in some companies and industries, 
some other top-level jobs were produced in growing industries, the study 
indicated. As a result, the high-earners' group comprised 10% of all full-time 
workers in 1979 -- the same portion as in 1992. This group was defined as those 
making at least four times the low-wage income, or at least $52,364 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The expanding sectors included financial services, advertising and the legal 
profession, where pay scales are relatively good. However, those increases were 
dwarfed in absolute numbers by the rising number of low-paid jobs for janitors, 
clerks, hospital orderlies, retail salespeople and fast-food restaurant 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad news for workers, and bad for the economy," said Markley Roberts, 
assistant director of economic research for the AFL-CIO. "Who will be able to 
afford to buy what American industry turns out? How do you keep a society from 
getting more and more polarized when the people at the bottom are ending up 
with a smaller and smaller share of the total pie?" 
</P>
<P>
 The movement toward low-wage jobs has hit hard at the younger workers, said 
Jack McNeil, a Census Bureau analyst who prepared the study. Among workers 18 
to 24, about 47% were earning low wages in 1992. Only 23% of that age group 
received a comparably low wage in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 For workers between 25 and 34, the portion earning those wages or less rose 
from 9% in 1979 to 18% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supply of good-paying jobs has declined," said McNeil, referring to the 
elimination of high-wage factory work. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the growth in the labor force caused by the large scale entrance 
of women into the job market has generated more competition for jobs and has 
driven down some wage levels, he said. Less education makes a worker likelier 
to fall into the low-wage group, the report indicated. Among those without a 
high school diploma, 32% earned the lowest wages, compared with just 6% of 
those with a college degree. Earnings and the Work Force

SMOLDERING LEGAL ISSUE; FACING LAWSUITS, EMPLOYERS ARE EMBRACING RESTRICTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 After developing a persistent cough that she blamed on secondhand cigarette 
smoke, Andrea Portenier pleaded with her bosses at an insurance firm to ban 
smoking at their Los Angeles offices. 
</P>
<P>
 But Portenier says the firm's managers dragged their feet and ridiculed her. A 
company lawyer, she says, even asked her doctor if Portenier could solve the 
problem by wearing a mask at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Portenier struck back by suing, relying on a novel legal theory that the 
employer was liable for assault and battery for exposing her to secondhand 
smoke. After she won an early round in the case, the firm agreed this month to 
pay an undisclosed settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing an onslaught of civil lawsuits and workers' compensation claims, 
employers across the country increasingly are supporting proposals by 
regulators and lawmakers to impose new restrictions on smoking in the 
workplace. Largely for the same reasons, many employers have adopted 
anti-smoking rules of their own that go far beyond the requirements of existing 
laws and regulations.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though the biggest smoking lawsuits still are aimed at U.S. tobacco 
companies -- a $5-billion class-action suit filed Wednesday against the 
industry is the most recent example -- more and more employers worry that they 
too could be squeezed by legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a business decision," said Jo-Linda Thompson, general counsel for the 
California Restaurant Assn., which is backing a bill by Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood) to ban smoking in most workplaces. "It's not just one 
lawsuit you might be exposed to, it might be six or seven." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Portenier suit, employers point to cases piling up in workers' 
compensation courts from employees who say they were hurt on the job by 
exposure to secondhand smoke, which has been declared a carcinogen by the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Portenier, who gave up selling insurance to teach health education at a 
community college, said smoke-free workplaces "aren't just good for employees, 
they're also good for the bottom line. . . . It would be great if everybody did 
the right thing for the right reason, but in case not, here (litigation) is 
another reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, when U.S. Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich unveiled his department's 
proposed restrictions on workplace smoking, he touted such economic benefits as 
improved productivity and reduced health care costs, along with the prospect of 
saving lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far at least, given the nation's relatively brief experience with 
workplace smoking bans or restrictions, there is little more than anecdotal 
evidence that such rules actually boost productivity or directly reduce 
employers' health care expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state Assembly, the anti-smoking measure backed by the restaurant 
association has run into serious roadblocks, including opposition from some of 
the association's own members and other employers. Still, a growing number of 
states, communities and companies are taking such steps. 
</P>
<P>
 In California alone, roughly 300 cities have some type of restriction on 
smoking, including Los Angeles' law requiring no-smoking areas in workplaces. 
In addition, a 1991 survey of 833 employers across the country found that 85% 
had imposed some kind of smoking restriction, including 34% with outright bans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know of any company that's backed down once they've gone to a smoking 
ban," said Dale Silverman, executive director of a 3,500-member group of human 
resource specialists in Southern California known as PIRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for example, Merck & Co., the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant that 
banned smoking at its U.S. sites in 1989. Smoking is prohibited anywhere on the 
firm's 465-acre headquarters complex -- even outdoors -- with one exception: an 
area near a shipping dock. 
</P>
<P>
 Before enforcing the policy, Merck, with about 30,000 employees, notified 
workers 16 months in advance and offered free smoking-cessation classes. 
Eighteen months after the ban went into effect, the number of smokers 
companywide dropped 25%, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The costs to my company in lost productivity, days lost to illness and rising 
health care costs due to smoking were no longer acceptable," Merck Chairman P. 
Roy Vagelos, a physician, said in testimony before a congressional subcommittee 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 A Merck study done before the ban showed that lung cancer was the leading 
cause of death for male employees and retirees, and the disease's incidence was 
rising among female workers, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pacificare, a Cypress-based health maintenance organization, smoking has 
been banned inside buildings for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "As an HMO, we believe in wellness and prevention, and all the statistics (on 
smoking) were becoming more alarming," said Wanda Lee, senior vice president of 
human resources. Don Couch, 32, a computer systems analyst who had been smoking 
since age 17, took advantage of free quit-smoking classes shortly after joining 
Pacificare in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot more focused at work because I'm not worried about when I'm going 
to have my next cigarette," Couch said. "I don't have colds as much as I used 
to and I haven't had the flu since I quit smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some smokers say they support workplace tobacco bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mae Sapinoso, a secretary for the Gas Co. who works in the smoke-free First 
Interstate World Center in downtown Los Angeles, said she doesn't mind the 
inconvenience of a long elevator ride from her 50th-floor office to step 
outside for a cigarette. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm at my desk, I feel healthier," said Sapinoso, who was enjoying a 
cigarette in an outdoor courtyard one recent afternoon. "Even though I'm a 
smoker, I don't want to be in a room with a lot of smokers. Before we had a 
smoking room and it smelled in there." Smoking at Work 
</P>
<P>
 More and more companies have banned or placed restrictions on smoking in the 
workplace. This 1992 suevey shows that the larger the organization, the more 
likely it is to have an official smoking policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Company size (number of employees) & Percent with existing smoking policy: 
50-99: 55 100-249: 61 250-749: 66 750+: 74 
</P>
<P>
 About 40% of U.S. worksites offer information or activities to help employees 
quit smoking. Here's a breakdown of the programs: Distribute posters, 
brochures, pamphlets and videos: 91 Group classes, workshops, lectures or 
special events: 56 Individual counseling: 23

GRUMMAN COOL TO NORTHROP'S REVISED BID FOR TAKEOVER; DEFENSE: ITS DIRECTORS 
REJECT INCREASED OFFER, STATING THEY WILL STICK WITH THE SEALED AUCTION. 
DEADLINE IS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Northrop Corp., launching a preemptive strike in hopes of giving itself quick 
victory in the takeover fight for Grumman Corp., Wednesday offered to boost its 
bid to $62 a share from $60 -- provided Grumman accepted within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grumman's directors appeared to reject the new bid, although the company's 
largest shareholder endorsed the higher offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, after the flurry of exchanges between the companies on Wednesday, the 
two-way battle to buy Grumman had not changed much by the end of the day -- 
except for Northrop's indication to boost its price slightly. Yet, the battle 
may only get more complicated today. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's $2.11-billion proposal came on the eve of today's Grumman-imposed 
deadline for Northrop and its rival bidder, Martin Marietta Corp., to make 
their final offers to buy the Bethpage, N.Y.-based defense company in a sealed 
bidding contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles-based Northrop has objected to the sealed auction because its 
existing offer already is $5-a-share higher than Martin Marietta's bid of $55 a 
share, or $1.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop said its brief offer to pay $62 a share was meant to "demonstrate our 
commitment to an open bidding process," but added that if Grumman did not 
embrace the new offer by noon PST today, Northrop would revert to its existing 
bid of $60 a share, or $2.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman Chairman Renso L. Caporali, in a letter to Northrop Chairman Kent 
Kresa, said Grumman's directors elected Wednesday night to stick with the 
sealed auction. Martin Marietta, meanwhile, remained silent about its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumman now will have to see if Northrop and Martin Marietta are willing to 
submit private bids by 2 p.m. PST today, as Grumman requested. But there has 
been widespread speculation that Northrop will ignore the auction and wait to 
see if Martin Marietta makes a counteroffer. There was also speculation that 
Martin Marietta might simply walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street still sees the bidding going higher. Grumman's stock closed at 
$63.875 a share, up 50 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. 
Northrop's stock was unchanged at $40.875 a share, and Martin Marietta slipped 
12.5 cents to $45. 
</P>
<P>
 Caporali did not mention the $62-a-share price specifically in his letter, and 
Grumman officials would not comment. But the letter strongly indicated that 
Grumman would weigh that price only if Northrop submitted it through Grumman's 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the adviser to Grumman's largest stockholder -- a Grumman employee 
trust fund that owns 33% of Grumman -- endorsed Northrop's bid of $62 a share. 
The adviser, Wilbur Ross, a senior managing director of Rothschild Inc., said 
Grumman should get Martin Marietta to at least match that price. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Northrop's bid represented $70 million more for Grumman's 
stockholders, Ross said: "We don't think its appropriate to gamble that away on 
a hope and prayer that Martin Marietta will bid more." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Northrop said, "We're sorry that Grumman's board elected not to 
have an open, public bidding process for their shareholders. We're continuing 
to review our options." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for Grumman, a former maker of Navy fighter jets that now mainly 
builds surveillance gear and other defense electronics, is the current focal 
point of the consolidation in the defense industry that stems from the 
post-Cold War slide in military spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop, maker of the B-2 stealth bomber, is particularly anxious to buy 
Grumman in order to avoid being acquired itself amid an industry rush to 
consolidate. Martin Marietta, one of the nation's biggest defense contractors, 
also has been one its most active buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is widely believed Northrop is going to sit out Grumman's auction 
and wait for Martin Marietta's next step, Northrop's decision to put $62 a 
share on the table, if only briefly, left some analysts wondering about its 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand it," said Cai von Rumohr, an analyst at the securities 
firm Cowen & Co. in Boston. "They had a bid that already was the highest. I 
don't see why they needed to go to $62." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Nisbet, an analyst at the aerospace consulting firm JSA Research Inc. in 
Newport, R.I., said that although Northrop's action seemed intended to get 
Grumman's board to take immediate action, "I think Grumman will let it pass." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the confusion was that Northrop gave Grumman's board a deadline to 
respond to its new offer that's two hours before Grumman's auction deadline 
today. So, even if Grumman's board does indeed snub Northrop's proposal, 
Northrop will still have two hours to submit that bid, or another one, under 
Grumman's sealed bidding procedure.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: PROS AND CONS OF ANONYMOUS CORPORATE E-MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 XYZ Corp.(not its real name) has a problem that's driving top management 
crazy. A rogue piece of software has appeared that lets employees send 
electronic mail messages anonymously. There's been a rash of sexually 
suggestive -- and even obscene -- e-mail sent to several female employees. 
Unpopular managers have received insulting e-mail appraisals of their style and 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 More ominously, several messages have been broadcast detailing serious 
problems with several of XYZ's key projects. These were setbacks that had 
previously been the secret of top management but, thanks to XYZ's global 
network, have now been instantly distributed worldwide to launch hundreds of 
e-mail queries and thousands of water-cooler conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 Like kerosene poured on a fire, this act of e-mail anonymity has ignited 
once-smoldering resentments into openly burning issues. While half the company 
is thrilled that anonymity has caused these problems to surface for 
corporate-wide discussion, the other half is furious that the leakers can't be 
found and punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, XYZ's top management pulled the plug on its global e-mail system, 
rewrote the network software to assure that all messages can be tracked at 
least two ways and issued an edict that absolutely forbids anonymous messages. 
The traffic that now flows on XYZ's network is excruciatingly polite. 
</P>
<P>
 This XYZ Corp. example is hardly fictitious; it's an unhappy composite of 
real-world confrontations that recently occurred in several Fortune 1,000 
companies. More than any other e-mail issue, the anonymity option provokes the 
most heated debate in organizational network design. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to e-mail anonymity strikes at the very heart of values that 
organizations either cherish or try to suppress. Some organizations see 
anonymity as a healthy, essential part of their internal dialogue, a mechanism 
that promotes free and unfettered comment. Others see anonymity as a sleazy 
virtual mask that lets corporate mischief makers and malcontents get away with 
cheap shots at people who have the guts to sign their names to their messages. 
</P>
<P>
 At one giant aerospace manufacturer, for example, managers are positively 
grateful that their brainstorming software encourages anonymous contributions. 
"If we had to attach our names to our suggestions, I think people would be less 
forthcoming," insists one engineer there who, yes, asks not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture of the company, he argues, makes it difficult for younger 
engineers to publicly make comments critical of senior engineering decisions. 
The fact that software anonymity effectively subsidizes the existing culture 
rather than encouraging a more open and honest exchange of ideas is dismissed 
as politically unrealistic. "Have you lost your mind?" the engineer asks. 
</P>
<P>
 The anonymity issue becomes even more intense when one considers the speed at 
which organizations are linking their e-mail networks together in hopes of 
creating "virtual" corporations and accelerating the flow of vital data. 
Companies are hooking up with key customers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose at the customer network, anonymous messages are permitted and even 
encouraged; at the supplier, they're strictly forbidden. When these two 
companies collaborate on a project, whose e-mail protocol should win? 
Ironically, the ability to communicate via e-mail may lead more to a hostile 
clash of values than to the desired goal of better communications. Privacy is 
relative; anonymity is an absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does the Internet, the world's biggest and best e-mail network, handle 
this thorny issue? In fact, it is "illegal" and technically impossible to send 
an Internet message without a "return address," i.e., without some sort of 
identifying header. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Internet has become a hotbed of detailed, intimate and 
absolutely anonymous communications. Indeed, there is a whistle-blowers Usenet 
group on the Internet -- a kind of forum -- as well as a support group for 
victims of sexual abuse. Is it in the best interests of these participants to 
be readily identifiable? These groups depend on anonymous communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Market forces have created innovations for anonymity. Because there is a 
demand for anonymity on the Internet, there is now a supply of anonymity on the 
Internet. Individuals can send their messages to "remailers" that can strip out 
the headers containing the authentic return address. 
</P>
<P>
 These remailers, in turn, can send the messages on to other remailers. In 
other words, Internet remailers can "launder" messages on the road to their 
intended destinations in ways that completely obliterate their origins. 
</P>
<P>
 A company that's on the Internet could use remailers to send e-mail or post 
messages anonymously, but there are no known Fortune 500 companies that provide 
such remailers internally. Mainly they are provided, in the communal spirit of 
the Internet, by individuals who typically charge nothing and purge any trace 
of a message's origin. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the rise of e-mail is forcing companies to decide explicitly what 
kind of values they want their networks to embody. Should employees be allowed 
or encouraged to send anonymous e-mail? Or should it be strictly forbidden? Or 
is there a middle way that creates bulletin boards or other e-mail "Democracy 
Walls" where individuals can safely post their comments? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the answer to these questions, more and more organizations are 
painfully becoming aware that their new networks can raise cultural tensions 
just as easily as they create economic efficiencies.

 Ford, UAW Face Strike Deadline: Union workers at one of two assembly lines at 
Ford Motor Co.'s Ohio Assembly Plant in Avon Lake threatened to strike if no 
new contract agreement was reached by midnight. UAW Local 2000, representing 
1,900 workers on the Mercury Villager-Nissan Quest minivan production line, 
rejected a proposed contract March 14.Workers on the other line, which makes 
the Econoline full-size van, approved a separate contract in voting at the same 
time. As part of the 1988 joint venture with the Japanese auto maker Nissan, 
workers on the Villager-Quest line agreed to use Japanese-style management 
principles, including the "team" concept, in which workers learn how to perform 
several different jobs on the line. But employees have complained of 
insufficient training and say they don't have the time or work force needed to 
do their jobs properly.

 Woolworth Discloses Accounting Irregularities: The New York-based operator of 
specialty and general merchandise store chains said it will restate some 
financial results to correct gross margins and disclosed an investigation into 
possible accounting irregularities. The company said it will publish restated 
figures for its latest fiscal year, which ended Jan. 29, and may have to 
restate results for the prior year as well. While Woolworth said the changes 
for 1993 and possibly for 1992 aren't likely to have an effect on its overall 
annual results for those years, the retailer noted that it wasn't yet able to 
estimate the amounts of the required restatements.

 U.S. Assesses Stiff Tariffs on Japanese Film Company: Fuji Photo Co., accused 
of selling its products at unfairly low prices in the United States, was hit 
with higher-than-expected punitive tariffs. In a preliminary ruling, the 
Commerce Department said it was imposing anti-dumping penalties of 321.23% to 
360.95% against color photographic paper sold in the United States by Fuji.The 
case was just the latest in a series of trade disputes between the United 
States and Japan, but it will be the first in which punitive tariffs actually 
go into effect. Fuji will be required to begin paying higher duties immediately 
on its products shipped into the United States, in the form of either cash or 
bonds posted with the Customs Service.

 Bids for Gulf of Mexico Oil Tracts Rise Sharply: A potential frontier of new 
petroleum development and higher natural gas prices led to a sharp jump in 
bidding for drilling tracts offshore from Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi. 
High bids totaling $277 million were received as the federal government leased 
375 blocks of nine square miles each in the Gulf of Mexico, the Minerals 
Management Service said.Eighty-two companies participated in the sale. That's 
up from last year's $69.1 million in high bids on 201 blocks. Much of the 
increased interest apparently stemmed from a successful well drilled off the 
Louisiana coast last year that showed there is oil and gas below a massive 
layer of salt that lies deep in the earth's crust.

 San Jose-based Pyramid Technology Corp. expects to post a fiscal 
second-quarter loss on a 16% revenue decline, primarily because of lost 
business with traditional clients. . . . Motorola Inc. and International 
Business Machines Corp. said they were shipping the first samples of a smaller, 
faster PowerPC microprocessor, launching still another rival to Intel Corp.'s 
Pentium line. The chips are the first PowerPC 601s to run at a speed of 
100-megahertz. The three earlier versions run at 50, 66 and 80 megahertz.

 Compton's Patent May Conflict With HyperCard: The U.S. Patent Office indicated 
its preliminary rejection of Compton's New Media's controversial multimedia 
patent claim was based on a textbook description of HyperCard, a well-known 
computer program developed well before Compton's filed for its patent in 1987. 
The Tribune Co., parent company of Compton's New Media, said it is considering 
an appeal of the Patent Office's ruling. Tribune Co. and Compton's officials 
declined to comment on the details of the ruling.

Spectrum Information Technologies Inc. said in a news release that Maskaly felt 
that the company needs a new leader with no past ties to the firm, based in 
Manhasset, N.Y. Spectrum gained attention when John Sculley, the former head of 
Apple Computer, took over as chairman and chief executive in October. He quit 
four months later after accusing Spectrum of concealing internal problems.

U.S., RUSSIAN OFFICIALS SIGN 4 AGREEMENTS; AIRCRAFT: COMMERCE SECRETARY WINS 
LIFTING OF NEW AEROSPACE TARIFF, SO SALE OF BOEING 757 JETLINERS CAN GO 
THROUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown signed four U.S.-Russian trade 
agreements here Wednesday and announced that he had rescued a deal to sell 
American aircraft to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of two Boeing 757 jets to Transaero, one of the private airlines 
created with the breakup of the Soviet state airline, Aeroflot, was derailed 
March 15 when the Russian government imposed a 50% tariff on all aerospace 
imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who is leading 28 American chief executives on a six-day trade 
development trip to Moscow, said Russian officials promised to waive the 
retroactive tariff, clearing the way for the planes to be delivered in early 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said that Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin has agreed to 
review other recently imposed taxes and tariffs that have dismayed American 
investors and outraged the fledgling Russian business community. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially affected are Western oil companies, which have sunk millions of 
dollars into joint ventures with Russia only to face oil export surcharges of 
$4 or $5 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this tax has done is make deals, arrangements that were formerly 
economically viable, no longer economically viable," Brown said. "It's the kind 
of action that really has a chilling effect on investment and on trade. There 
has to be some kind of predictability in the tax system." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also said he had told Russian officials frankly that they will have to 
compete with other countries for the American investment dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The challenge for the Russian government is to make it attractive for foreign 
investment here, because oil companies can go elsewhere," said Ray R. Irani, 
the Los Angeles-based president and CEO of Occidental Oil & Gas Corp., which 
has invested about $140 million in two exploration and pumping projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some ministries are more understanding of our problems than others," Irani 
said. He added that Chernomyrdin, a former Soviet oil executive, seemed to be 
interested in more foreign involvement, especially by American companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian policy-makers appear torn between the need to raise revenue fast to 
comply with International Monetary Fund demands that they curb inflation and 
bring state spending under control, and the need to keep taxes low enough to 
stimulate investment in what everyone concedes is a high-risk country. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 45-minute meeting Wednesday with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
Brown said he was "optimistic" about prospects that the $1 billion that 
American companies have invested in Russia can turn into $50 billion if the 
Yeltsin government fosters the proper business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown tried to boost that "comfort level" by saying that Yeltsin -- whose 
health has been the subject of endless speculation, rumor and intrigue -- 
appeared rested, healthy and in good spirits. "I'm not a physician, but he sure 
looked good to me," the secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four trade agreements signed Wednesday include a joint statement on market 
access and two agreements on setting up business centers in six locations in 
Russia to offer advice, communications, translation and other help to American 
businesses that want to set up shop here. 
</P>
<P>
 Also approved was a pact that will make it easier for pharmaceutical companies 
to sell Russian drugs without a lengthy regulatory process, provided the 
products have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that some of the American business executives traveling with him 
had closed deals previously "stuck in the pipeline." They range from a joint 
venture to produce Samsonite and American Tourister luggage at a Russian 
factory to a Westinghouse Electric contract to modernize Russian nuclear power 
plants.

U.S. MOVES TO SIMPLIFY OVERSEAS TECHNOLOGY SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration lifted export restrictions Wednesday on the sale of 
most commercial computer and telecommunications equipment to Russia, Eastern 
Europe and China, closing a chapter in the Cold War and giving U.S. 
manufacturers access to billions of dollars of business a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement, which surprised and delighted industry officials meeting at 
a Washington hotel, coincided with a decision to close down the international 
agency that has controlled exports of Western weapons and weapons-related 
technologies to the former Soviet Bloc for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris-based Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, known 
as Cocom, officially goes out of business today. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials, meeting with European, Japanese and 
Australian counterparts in The Hague, Netherlands, were unable to get agreement 
on creating a successor to Cocom that would control weapons-related exports to 
"countries of concern" -- North Korea, Libya, Iran and Iraq. The new agency 
would also continue to control exports to all nations of the most threatening 
technologies, those dealing with nuclear and chemical weapons, and missile 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiations on a successor agency continue, the Cocom nations promised 
to keep in place current restrictions on exports of products with military 
purposes. They will press for an agreement before year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still live in a world of hazards," said Robert E. Rubin, head of the White 
House National Economic Council, who announced the new policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Underlining the tug and pull of the Administration's export policy, he also 
stressed President Clinton's desire to help U.S. companies compete abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 17 Cocom members will continue cooperating on weapons 
proliferation policy, each country is now free to make its own decision about 
what to export.

NME TO SELL 47 PSYCHIATRIC UNITS TO RIVAL FOR $200 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In a big step toward disposing of its troubled psychiatric care business, 
National Medical Enterprises said Wednesday that it has agreed to sell 47 
hospitals to rival Charter Medical Corp. for $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based hospital operator said it is also discussing with 
"other parties" the sale of most of a dozen other free-standing psychiatric 
facilities.It said it plans to keep five psychiatric clinics that are located 
at its general surgical hospital campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 NME shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $16.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, 
bucking the broad market decline Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past two years, NME has faced a bevy of costly lawsuits from patients, 
insurers and shareholders involving activities at some of its psychiatric 
hospitals. Since September, the company has resolved about two-thirds of more 
than 100 patient lawsuits alleging billing fraud, false imprisonment and 
conspiracy. It also has paid more than $200 million to settle lawsuits filed by 
major insurance companies accusing the company of submitting hundreds of 
millions of dollars in bogus bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company's biggest legal hurdle is the investigation by the Justice 
Department and Department of Health and Human Services into alleged criminal 
conduct at its psychiatric and other hospital operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Jeffrey C. Barbakow said discussions aimed at resolving the criminal 
investigation are continuing with federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter, the Macon, Ga.-based operator of the nation's biggest chain of 
psychiatric hospitals, is buying hospitals in 20 states, mostly in the South 
and Northeast. The sale includes seven California hospitals, including Los 
Altos Hospital in Long Beach, Yorba Hills Hospital in Yorba Linda and New 
Beginnings in Lakewood.

FACTORY ORDERS DECLINE, BUT ANALYSTS SEE A BROAD STRENGTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sharp drop in military and commercial aircraft sales in February caused the 
first decline in orders to U.S. factories since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said, however, that a close look at Wednesday's report from the 
Commerce Department discloses underlying strength in the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders to U.S. factories fell 1% in February, breaking a six-month string of 
advances, the department said. Orders for both durable and non-durable goods 
were a seasonally adjusted $269.9 billion, down from $272.6 billion in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would urge people to focus on the details of this report," said Marilyn 
Schaja, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. in New 
York. Without the highly volatile military and aircraft orders figures, she 
said, "It was the eighth increase over the last nine months." 
</P>
<P>
 Orders for non-defense capital goods, excluding aircraft, rose 4.9% in 
February. These orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand and 
modernize. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists for Merrill Lynch & Co. said they are encouraged that new orders 
for computers and communications equipment, possibly a better indicator of 
manufacturing growth, rebounded in February after a January drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The stormy winter weather in much of the nation also may have caused 
disruptions that held down February orders, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until February, orders had risen every month since last July, when they 
declined 1.9% . 
</P>
<P>
 Inventories in February rose 0.3% to $380 billion, the second straight 
increase and matching the rise in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a turning point," said Michael P. Niemira of Mitsubishi Bank in New York 
City. "Manufacturers have been extremely reluctant to increase inventories. Now 
they seem to be just starting to accept that demand is up and will continue to 
be up." 
</P>
<P>
 The small increases in inventories likely will reinforce economic growth and 
manufacturing employment in coming months, analysts said. The buildup may have 
been caused by weather disruptions, not an underlying drop in demand, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlog of unfilled orders fell 0.3% to $445 billion, the 11th decline in 
the last 12 months. The orders backlog, often seen as a measure of whether 
current facilities and manpower are able to keep up with demand, rose 0.6% in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing has been a mainstay of economic expansion in the last three 
months of 1993. Factory Orders

PEOPLE: DALY TO SHARE TOP WARNER BROS. CORPORATE TITLES WITH SEMEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual move, Warner Bros. Chairman and Chief Executive Robert A. Daly 
announced Wednesday that he will share his corporate titles with division 
President Terry Semel to better reflect the partnership and close relationship 
the two men have enjoyed for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The president's title will no longer be used at the Burbank-based company, the 
studio subsidiary of media and entertainment giant Time Warner Inc. But Daly 
said he is promoting longtime television executive Barry M. Meyer to chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 According to published reports, Semel appeared restless last year and weighed 
an offer to bid for MGM with financier and friend Ronald Perelman. But Semel 
ultimately signed a long-term agreement in late summer, extending his contract 
by more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly noted that the moves were made at his own initiative, and not as part of 
a transition. As often noted, the highly successful Warner operations have 
enjoyed considerable autonomy before and after the 1989 merger with Time Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's gesture was interpreted as unusually gracious by Hollywood standards, 
but characteristically shrewd and reflective of his own job security. In the 
past, the longtime Warner chief has turned down offers to return to New York to 
run a network or to take a corporate job at Time Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Daly, 57, insisted again that he is not about to leave Warner 
Bros. "I love coming to work every day, and what makes it that way for me is 
having Terry here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly became the Warner studio chairman on Jan. 1, 1981, following a 25-year 
career at CBS. Daly attributed Wednesday's promotions in part to his network 
experience. He felt that the late CBS Chairman William S. Paley erred by 
inadequately rewarding former CBS President Frank Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 Semel, 51, has spent most of his career at Warner Bros., except for four years 
at CBS and Walt Disney Co. in the early 1970s. An accountant by training, he 
has served as the studio's chief operating officer since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer, 50, is an attorney who worked for ABC-TV before joining Warner Bros. 
Television in 1971. He was named executive vice president of Warner Bros. Inc. 
in 1984.

write reports."

entering the programs."

</P>
<P>

between."

 Kevin Hammer, 18 
</P>
<P>
 senior, Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really a slow typer, and for me, it's hard to put my thoughts onto the 
screen. But there are so many things you can do -- math, science, English -- it 
really opens up new areas of exploration." 
</P>
<P>
 Letha Pallavathical, 17 
</P>
<P>
 junior, University 
</P>
<P>
 "What bugs me most about a computer is that you need to buy so many add-ons. 
They cost a lot. If you think you've gotten a good deal on a computer, you soon 
find out that you end up paying more because you need to buy things such as 
modems or extra hard-drive memory and, of course, you have to pay hundreds of 
dollars more for the monitor and the printer. What I like best about computers 
is that they make doing reports a lot easier. You don't have to retype or 
rewrite anything; just call it up from memory and change whatever needs 
changing."

 Recycling is taking a beating at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission 
Viejo, with banana peels and Kleenex often in the red-colored recycling bins 
and aluminum cans in trash bins, according to article in the student newspaper, 
the CVHS Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, students are lazy.They don't want to walk a few feet further 
to a recycling bin," one student said. "The way it is now, the janitors spend 
their valuable time playing mommy," another said about the need to pick up 
student messes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Club is urging students to take care of the campus, but it 
may be an uphill battle. "If it wasn't for my throwing trash, (the janitors) 
wouldn't have a job," one student said.

 Do you stare at your computer screen, eyes wide open, to make certain you 
never miss a word as the display moves upward? It's a mistake, says Frank 
Weinstock, a professor of ophthalmology at Northeastern Ohio Universities 
College of Medicine in Canton.Your eyelids work like tiny windshield wipers, 
brushing away irritant particles in the air and moistening the surface of the 
eye. If you don't blink regularly, the result may be itchy, burning eyes and 
vision blurred by dry cornea. Just do what comes naturally, Weinstock advises. 
Blink!

INSIDE LINE: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; WHY JOIN A GANG? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why teens join gangs and what can be done about it was the focus of a recent 
Irvine Youth Action Team newsletter, which is produced by high school students 
under the auspices of the city's community services department. 
</P>
<P>
 Students queried said they thought teens join gangs due to peer pressure, 
because they need close friends and don't always get enough support from their 
families, or to show people they are tough and because gang members support, 
care and love each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas for what should be done about gangs? "A more captivating education that 
will smarten them up. Also more police on the streets," said one teen. 
</P>
<P>
 "When children are young, parents should foster moral values and ethical 
standards in them," said another. Others suggested more after-school jobs, 
closing down gun stores and, finally, on a pessimistic note, "I have absolutely 
no idea."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; AN OPEN LETTER TO PARENTS 
</P>

By Jennifer Beauvais, This letter was written by Jennifer Beauvais, a junior at 
Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana. It first appeared in a school newsletter.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe you've noticed I've been changing lately, not only physically, but 
emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm very moody, sometimes depressed, sometimes angry and sometimes cheerful. 
We argue with each other more and have so much trouble agreeing on anything. 
I'm even more secretive than ever, sometimes concealing the truth from you. But 
trust me when I say that there are reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are happening to me, inside and out, that even I don't understand! My 
emotions, other than existing as confusing, are like an out-of-control roller 
coaster: up and down, topsy-turvy, sometimes fun and sometimes forcing me to 
want to get off. I'm trying to find my identity, who I am as a person. This is 
not to be mistaken as an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyhow, while trying to be myself, when sometimes I don't even know who that 
is, I am constantly being influenced by peer pressure, new fads, drugs and 
society in general. By society, I mean the pressures put on teens by 
advertising agencies, AIDS, pregnancy, gangs and the like. I also worry about 
my physical appearance. Am I pretty enough, thin enough, strong enough, tall 
enough . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the stress of my hectic lifestyle is school. In the social aspect, I 
am trying to make friends and keep them. People of the opposite sex are 
suddenly introduced into the scene. Besides the weirdness of the nervousness 
around them and the fear of acting really stupid, other problems are presented 
after I get to know them -- like whether to remain a virgin. It's a scary 
thought, but it is real! I don't need these bizarre emotions to add to the 
enormous pile I already have. 
</P>
<P>
 High school is a major stress-inducer, and, believe it or not, I feel large 
amounts of stress; most teens do. First, I'm in a new, big school trying to 
meet new friends. Grades are more difficult to keep up, especially with those 
dreaded quarter exams, and even the sports are more competitive than in the 
lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, there is an endless series of long, late nights doing excessive amounts 
of homework. At school, I am expected to know my way around and the rules. No 
more excuses for getting in trouble. And I have to keep my grades up. On top of 
worrying whether I am taking the classes required by colleges, I have to find a 
parking spot -- every day -- that is within a two-mile radius of the school -- 
a feat in itself! 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while all this is happening to me, I am trying to grow up and be 
independent; I'm preparing for my future in the "real world," where parents 
won't make my decisions or do my laundry. I have my fair share of problems, and 
though you say I can come to you about anything, I don't because you get upset 
and angry, and we end up fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 So I either lie or say nothing. I know you want to help me because you love 
me, and it's hard to let go of your baby, but I'm growing up. I'm trying to be 
an adult and will one day, very likely, be in the position you are in now. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as I change and strive to be my own person, please try to understand what 
is going on inside me. Remember this when you see me crying for no apparent 
reason, pounding my pillow in anger or acting unusually happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember this when I argue with you, disagree and try to make my own 
decisions. But, please, also remember that, though I am a bit strange right 
now, I am willing to cooperate.  
</P>
<P>
 Just please love me as I am, for these feelings can make me feel alone, and I 
need that reassurance. Please try to support me in what I do, because I need 
that also. 
</P>
<P>
 I love you, 
</P>

ANN CONWAY: O'DONNELL SAYS SHE'S JUST ONE OF THE GANG 
</P>

<P>
 Witty and self-deprecating, Rosie O'Donnell made a hit with the theater crowd 
when she swept into Diva restaurant in Costa Mesa on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from her performance as Rizzo in "Grease" at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, O'Donnell -- sporting white tennies, slacks and blazer 
-- said she loved her Segerstrom Hall dressing room: "It has a beautiful couch; 
I don't have to put a bedspread on it because it's new ." 
</P>
<P>
 Her favorite moment in the show? "When my solo's over," she said, laughing. 
"If you go to this show expecting to be vocally stimulated, you will. There are 
fabulous musical talents performing in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you won't necessarily be titillated by my vocal aesthetics. I'm just a 
part of an ensemble who is supposed to be funny, and that I'm comfortable 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 The co-star of "Sleepless and Seattle" and the upcoming "The Flintstones" is 
excited about "Grease" opening on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on May 
11. "I can't wait," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The party buzz: the musical's "moon shots." (Yup, one of the Greasers actually 
drops his drawers a few times). 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank goodness it was in profile," said a smiling Susan Strader, who attended 
the performance with her husband, Timothy, and their children, Stephanie, and 
Patrick. 
</P>
<P>
 " I didn't see anything -- just a moon," said Timothy Strader, the center's 
vice chairman of the executive committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ben Harris: "Mooning wasn't a '50s thing. I think it was something out of 
the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris was more concerned about the Greasers' hairstyles. "Where were the 
ducktails?" he wondered. "And those guys would've been laughed out of high 
school in those jeans. They should've been rolled up!" 
</P>
<P>
 Shari Esayian thought the mooning segments were a little racy. " I wouldn't 
have dated that guy in high school," she huffed. "I was a good girl." 
</P>
<P>
 For Susan Wood -- who played Sandy -- the production is about having a blast. 
"Every moment of the show is so much fun," said Wood, who wore a little black 
dress to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 During one musical segment, "Sandy" sits on stage and sways back and forth 
with the cast, swinging her honey blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched a lot of Farrah Fawcett movies to learn how to do that," she said. 
She wasn't kidding. "Farrah knew how to swing her hair and then freeze it. I 
had to learn how to stop my hair once it got going. It was hitting people in 
the face." 
</P>

 Lunch with Jack Jones: Peggy Goldwater Clay (her pop is former Arizona Sen. 
Barry Goldwater) of Newport Beach met with singer Jack Jones over lunch in Palm 
Desert last week to discuss the May 20 benefit for the House Ear Institute 
Children's Center of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones was too busy to come to Orange County, so Goldwater Clay and Gloria 
Osbrink -- president of the institute's Associates support group -- treated him 
to lunch at La Trattoria restaurant at the Hyatt Grand Champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwater Clay is chairing the Le Meridien Newport Beach event, which will 
feature Jones (his hits include "The Impossible Dream," "Wives and Lovers" and 
"Love Boat") and a four-course dinner. Tickets are $125 per person. Call (714) 
644-6390.

AND THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING; O.C. FOOTHILL RESIDENTS WOULD LIKE TO STICK 
AROUND A WHILE. THAT IS, IF THEY CAN AFFORD IT, AND IF THEIR COMMUNITIES RETAIN 
THEIR HOMETOWN FEEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newlyweds Leslie and Peter Nevarez are happy to call Rancho Santa Margarita 
home. Despite long commutes to their jobs, they relish its relative isolation 
and outdoor activities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nevarezes figure they'll be moving out of their condominium near the 
lake in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Married six months, they have begun thinking about starting a family, and the 
1,100-square-foot, two-bedroom condo Peter bought before they were married is 
just too small for their expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't be going far, however. Whenever they move up to a three- or 
four-bedroom house, it will be right there in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very friendly community," said Leslie Nevarez, 26, marketing manager 
for a wholesale tire center in Garden Grove. "We feel very comfortable here, 
and we feel like this would be a safe place for kids to grow up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nevarezes aren't the only southern foothill residents who look to the 
future and see themselves still living in the same communities they now call 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Two in three foothill residents expect to be living there in five years, 
according to The Times Orange County Poll. Reflecting residents' beliefs that 
the area is a good place to raise families, seven in 10 parents plan to stay.  
</P>
<P>
 Alison Rubalcava, 27, is not sure where she and her family will be living when 
husband Steve, a Marine Corps captain, gets out of the service in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that they don't like living in a "terrific neighborhood" in Portola Hills, 
where they moved three years ago. But the mother of a 3-year-old son said their 
two-bedroom townhouse is too small and, because of the cost of moving into a 
larger house, they're thinking of moving to Central or Northern California.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to stay in this area if we could manage to afford to buy a real 
house," she said, "but in this economy it's such a faraway kind of dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs, career and the economy were at the top of the reasons poll respondents 
cited in figuring they will be living elsewhere in five years. They were 
followed by housing costs and the cost of living, and growth and congestion.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the reasons for leaving reflect a concern about the changes the 
whole region is going through at this point," said Times pollster Mark 
Baldassare. "People who move to these remote communities realize that they've 
purchased a house and are settling in a neighborhood, but their livelihood 
still depends on the health of the entire region: A nice house in a nice 
neighborhood in a region whose economy is weak, it's not going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the poll shows that the vast majority of residents in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, Coto de Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and 
Robinson Ranch are just as happy with their communities as the Nevarezes, many 
express concern over whether their area will remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
 As one poll respondent put it: The biggest problem facing his community is 
"keeping it this way." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Growth and traffic are the top two concerns of foothill community residents -- 
a throwback, observes Baldassare, to the county in the 1980s, when Orange 
County Annual Surveys consistently found four in 10 residents countywide 
mentioning growth and traffic as the top issues facing the county. Only 18% in 
the 1993 annual survey mentioned growth and traffic; seven in 10 now name 
crime, jobs and immigration as the biggest problems in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she plans to stay in Rancho Santa Margarita, Leslie Nevarez said 
she's "not really happy" about the Foothill tollway "and the shopping centers 
and the auto mall they're considering putting out here. It's going to turn into 
looking like any other community in Southern California eventually." 
</P>
<P>
 Such fears galvanized many Rancho Santa Margarita residents in January when 
plans were announced for an 11-dealer auto mall to be built on 36 acres in the 
community's 450-acre business park.  
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Co. officials project that the auto mall -- to be built with 
an early California look -- will generate $1.7 million in annual sales tax 
revenue and create 520 jobs at the auto center, with an additional 925 new jobs 
in related businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 But about 2,000 residents have signed a petition protesting the auto mall, 
angrily saying it will bring increased traffic and noise and will ruin their 
panoramic views and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Although growth is considered a big problem in the new foothill communities, 
only 38% feel current local measures are not strict enough. Countywide, 45% 
think growth controls in their areas are not strict enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people," said Baldassare, "they're looking over their shoulders at 
what happened in the rest of Orange County and they're wondering if these new 
communities will follow the same trend: Once-remote areas will become developed 
and overcrowded. For that group of people it seems their next step is out of 
state." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Ranch resident Rene Modino, for example, thinks he and his family may 
be calling Arizona home within the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The move would not only be better for his allergies, he said, but he's tired 
of Orange County's congested freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to leave your house very early to be able to get to work in good 
time," said Modino, 40, adding that he leaves home before 5 a.m. to get to his 
job as a senior mail processor at UCI Medical Center in Orange by 6, and when 
he gets there "the parking is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Favored out-of-state destinations for those who envision packing up and 
leaving within the next five years include Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Montana, 
New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Other poll respondents mentioned Northern California or northern San Diego 
County, while a few were looking to move to the more exclusive foothill 
community of Coto de Caza. Significantly, only one in 600 said "closer to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, according to Baldassare, "what we're seeing in this migration to the 
new foothill communities in Orange County today is the continuing search for 
the California dream: new lands, new housing, a new start on life."  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, "there is a continuing search for the perfect 
suburb, which is close enough to urban areas that you can seek employment, but 
far enough away so that the residents aren't troubled by today's urban ills." 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being at least, he said, "residents seem to feel that the 
expectations and hopes they had have been fulfilled." But, as the poll 
indicates, many fear the problems of the rest of Southern California may catch 
up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santa Margarita resident Leanne Mosher, 30, is generally positive about 
her community but figures her family will be living elsewhere, perhaps Arizona, 
in five years. The reason? 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over whether the foothill communities can keep the "big city" -- and 
its problems -- away. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, she says, she sees more smog on the mountains and more teens hanging 
out in the strip centers than when her family first moved from Seattle in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really stop that, I guess, but I don't like it," Mosher said, 
adding that her worries about crime have intensified since the birth of her son 
two years ago. "You see the kids wearing baggy clothes and ripping around in 
their cars. They're probably not even gang members, but the possibility that 
they could be is pretty scary." 
</P>
<P>
 But don't get her wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like it here -- a lot," she said. "It's open, it's clean and there are so 
many young families." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 SUNDAY: A look at the people who live in Orange County's southern foothills -- 
and why. 
</P>
<P>
 MONDAY: The recession had a crushing impact on residents, who saw their home 
values drop, and on many developers, who had to restructure their plans. 
</P>
<P>
 TUESDAY: Families are flocking to the new suburbs, where parents praise the 
many activities for youngsters. But for the teens, there's not much to do. 
</P>
<P>
 WEDNESDAY: Living so far out means secluded neighborhoods and horrendous 
commutes. Though access is improving, traffic congestion remains a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY: Two-thirds of foothill residents expect to be living in the area when 
1999 rolls around. But what does that future hold? How the Poll Was Done 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Orange County Poll was conducted by Mark Baldassare & Associates. 
The telephone survey of 600 adult residents in Rancho Santa Margarita, Coto de 
Caza, Dove Canyon, Portola Hills, Foothill Ranch and Robinson Ranch was 
conducted Feb. 10-13 on weekday nights and weekend days. A computer-generated 
random sample of telephone numbers was used. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin of error for all respondents is plus or minus 4%. For subgroups, 
the error margin would be larger. THE SOUTHERN FOOTHILLS: Contentment Mixed 
with Concerns 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of residents in Ornage County new suburbs say they expect to be 
living in the same communities five years from now. And those with children at 
home are even more likely to planning to stay. However, they do have concerns. 
Half the residents say that growth, traffic, crime and gangs are the biggest 
problems in the area. 
</P>

SCRABBLE PROS HAVE HER SIMPLY SPELLBOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE SCHLOSBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Schlosberg is a Calabasas 
free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some challenges in life for which you've had years to prepare -- 
swallowing Mom's Passover gefilte fish without actually tasting it comes to 
mind. Then there are those challenges that come out of nowhere and knock you on 
your butt, such as last week when I played Scrabble at the Granada Hills Jewish 
Community Center with my 82-year-old Grandma. 
</P>
<P>
 To be more precise, I spent three humiliating hours with a group of people who 
know the meaning of usque (a Scottish variation of whiskey, in case you were 
wondering). 
</P>
<P>
 They're members of the Dee Mandeson San Fernando Valley Scrabble Club -- 
officially sanctioned by the National Scrabble Assn. as Club No. 69 -- and they 
meet once a week in a classroom at the community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma Ruth hadn't been there in awhile. She'd been busy playing mah-jongg on 
Monday nights and card games every other night with friends in her Sherman Oaks 
apartment building. And she'd been working part time as a messenger, traversing 
the freeways in her Oldsmobile to deliver legal documents to courthouses from 
Lancaster to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Northridge quake changed everything. Grandma's building was condemned, 
she and her friends were scattered in apartments all over the city and after 38 
years, the mah-jongg game was no more. The messenger business has been a little 
slow too. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma, however, isn't one to sit around and sulk, so she decided to try 
Scrabble again. When she invited me to join her, I said, "OK. Sounds like fun. 
Let's grab some dinner first." 
</P>
<P>
 I hadn't played Scrabble in ages, but figured: How tough could it be? I'm a 
writer. I have a decent handle on the English language. It wasn't like we were 
going to the Calculus Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Grandma and I tanked up on corn fritters and chocolate mousse at the Sizzler 
salad bar, then drove to the center. A dozen people showed up, and we were 
paired off for Game 1. My opponent was Susie Page. I knew this because it said 
so in gold letters on her personally engraved Scrabble timer. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie, a 61-year-old Panorama City resident who raises Burmese cats, explained 
the rules: 
</P>
<P>
 Each player gets a total of 25 minutes per game. After you make your move, you 
hit the timer and the clock starts ticking on your opponent. If you exceed the 
25-minute limit, you start losing points. 
</P>
<P>
 We selected our tiles and the game began. 
</P>
<P>
 At first I tried to ignore the timer, but that was impossible. Tick tick tick 
tick tick became TICK TICK TICK TICK TICK, which became TICK! TICK! TICK! TICK! 
TICK! 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Susie was using approximately six seconds per play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're fast," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very fast," she replied. 
</P>
<P>
 I stared at the tiles on my rack, desperately trying to form a word -- any 
word -- but the ticking was making me crazy. My breathing became erratic and 
the letters began to look like Russian. Our game went something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Entasis. 
</P>
<P>
 Hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Zouave. 
</P>
<P>
 Sat. 
</P>
<P>
 Isatine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I knew it, Susie had run out of tiles and beaten me 439-205. I'd used 
up 24 of my 25 minutes. Susie had used up eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Club No. 69, I quickly learned, are people who take their 
Scrabble seriously. They are people who wake up in the middle of the night 
wondering if ocreae is a word. (Indeed, it is.) They are people, most of them 
retired, who play Scrabble on Wednesdays in Eagle Rock and Saturdays in West 
L.A. and fly to Reno for regional tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 They know that cwm is a Welsh word meaning "a deep, steep-walled basin" and 
that brrr is an acceptable spelling of brr . They know that the Scrabble Assn. 
recently sanctioned eight new two-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them is ag ," said club president Deborah Sapot, who has played 
Scrabble since the game was invented in 1954. "It's short for agronomics. But 
you can't pluralize it. You can't make it ags . You have to know those things." 
</P>
<P>
 For Game 2, I was matched against Mollie, whom Grandma had beaten in the first 
game, despite the fact that Mollie plays Scrabble on her home computer every 
day. To my relief, Mollie wasn't the speed demon that Susie was. She was 
beating me quite handily, but I was getting used to the ticking and felt like I 
was getting into the groove of the game. My sense of calm was short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes into the game, I placed down what I thought was the word quiet. 
Immediately, Mollie shouted, "Challenge!" 
</P>
<P>
 My heart pounded. My face turned hot and red. I felt like I'd been arrested. 
But for what? What was my crime? 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, I had inadvertently left out a tile. In all my excitement over putting 
down a five-letter word, I had spelled out qiet . 
</P>
<P>
 ("Challenge" is what you say when you suspect your opponent has tried to get 
away with a bogus word. Some people deliberately play "phonies," as they're 
called, but clearly I'd made an honest mistake. It wasn't as if I were trying 
to pass off qiet as a legitimate word, although, Lord knows, it's probably some 
Irish term "of or pertaining to a genus of mosquito.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Oops," I said innocently. "Let me fix that." 
</P>
<P>
 "You lose a turn," Mollie said. "Those are the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Lest I go home feeling discouraged. Deborah, the club president, went to her 
car and returned with the "Updated Complete Three-Letter Word List," a sheet of 
paper containing the 961 three-letter words authorized by Official Scrabble 
Players Dictionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Study this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At which point, I turned to Grandma and told her to choose a restaurant for 
next week.

SPIRITED AWAY; NATIVE AMERICAN RITUALS ARE TRENDY. BUT IS THIS HOMAGE OR 
ANOTHER RIP-OFF? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HAEDERLE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The people of Cochiti Pueblo have made offerings at secret shrines in the 
quiet mountains near their homes for centuries, playing their part in an 
intricate dance of prayer and ritual that seeks to bring human life into 
harmony with the rhythm of the passing seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, strangers are visiting some of these holy places. 
</P>
<P>
 They may tamper with what they find, or perhaps leave behind crystals, 
feathers and other objects, in an attempt to honor Native American beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The unintended result is that the Cochiti may avoid a shrine that has been 
trespassed for fear their offerings will be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real painful to see people having to deny offering prayers or making 
pilgrimages to these areas because the invasion has desecrated these places," 
laments Regis Pecos, a soft-spoken Cochiti tribal council member. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Cochiti are not alone in their anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, the Lakota, the Hopi, the Cherokee and others are angry 
over what they see as the appropriation of their religious traditions and 
sacred places by non-Indians. They resent having their practices imitated by 
others disenchanted with their own spiritual heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 This perceived theft takes many forms: back-yard sweat lodges and vision 
quests conducted by self-styled shamans; drumming and chanting by men's 
movement followers, and the mass merchandising of books and sacred ceremonial 
objects to New Age adherents attracted by the holistic, Earth-centered 
spirituality of Native American beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly militant objections to such practices call attention to renewed 
spiritual vigor in many Native American communities, but also raise the knotty 
question of whether non-Indians should be exploring these rituals in the first 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 But many non-Indian practitioners, while deploring commercial exploitation of 
Native traditions, vigorously defend their right to study and practice Native 
American spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I heard it, Spirit is transcultural and transracial," says 
Timothy White, editor of Shaman's Drum, a magazine based in Willits, Calif. "My 
experience with Spirit says that Spirit is not something that can be possessed. 
It is not a limited quantity." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many traditions that Native Americans claim as their own, he argues, 
are practiced by tribal people around the world. Variations on the sweat-lodge 
ceremony, for example, occur among the Sami and Finns of Scandinavia, and 
chanting and drumming are universal expressions of human spirituality, White 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The outrage of many Native Americans took shape last fall at a summit of 
Dakota, Lakota and Nakota leaders in the form of a "Declaration of War" against 
"non-Indian 'wanna-bes,' hucksters, cultists, commercial profiteers and 
self-styled 'New Age shamans' " as "exploiters" of Native spirituality. 
</P>
<P>
 The proclamation, later adopted by the mainstream National Congress of 
American Indians, also decried as "sacrilegious" the staging of sun dances by 
-- and for -- non-Indians and selling sacred pipes through the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think all Indian people recognize that the spiritual traditions are the 
core of Indian survival," says John LaVelle, a Santee Dakota tribal member who 
helped draft the declaration. 
</P>
<P>
 LaVelle, executive director of the San Francisco-based Center for the SPIRIT 
(Support and Protection of Indian Religions and Indigenous Traditions), sees 
the practice of Native American spirituality by non-Indians as a part of "a 
process of genocide" under way since the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have white people who want to be Indians. It's forcing an 
accommodation on Indians," he says. "We're being assaulted by people who are so 
lost that they can't see the violation of the healthy boundaries of our culture 
as an assault." 
</P>
<P>
 In LaVelle's eyes, offenders range from non-Indians who pass themselves off as 
Native American holy people, publish books and purport to hold traditional 
ceremonies, to tribal members who charge visitors $50 a head to sing sacred 
songs in hotel ballrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who scoff that the uproar only reflects the opinion of a 
few "activists." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Mails, a Lutheran minister living in Lake Elsinore who has written 
about Native Americans for 30 years, says, "There's a strong difference of 
opinion between Native American peoples as to whether religion or spirituality 
-- a person's relationship with God -- should be shared with others, or whether 
it should be kept to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The really great people, like (medicine men) Black Elk and Fools Crow, feel 
that religious understandings are given by God -- they don't belong to the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Fears that outsiders may steal Native American spirituality are unrealistic, 
Mails says, because non-Indians don't know the necessary language or procedures 
to perform rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average activist doesn't understand this," says Mails, who also has 
written about Hopi religious practices. "If you confront an individual who is 
complaining about this, you find they don't understand a whit." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little question that Native spiritual traditions have been grossly 
commercialized in some quarters, especially since the romanticized portrayal of 
Plains culture in the movie "Dances With Wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the pages of Shaman's Drum carry ads for a portable sweat lodge 
("comes with FREE carrying case and handbook on the history and health benefits 
of Native American Sweat Lodge Ceremonies"), recordings of Lakota sun-dance 
songs ("16 songs with booklet of words in Lakota and English"), and a deck of 
cards that "access the powerful imagery and sacred wisdom of the Inipi -- the 
Lakota sweat lodge ceremony." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy White, editor of Shaman's Drum, concedes that commercialism is a 
problem. He prints a disclaimer that advises readers "to follow, and take 
responsibility for, their own beliefs in such matters." 
</P>
<P>
 He says it's important to distinguish between committed practitioners and 
those looking for a way make a quick buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have sold books for big money and have embellished psychological 
processing with some cultural trappings to make them look like they're 
associated with one cultural tradition," White says. "In my opinion, the truth 
will be borne out, and these shams will be exposed and their success will be 
short-lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who count themselves as serious students of Native spirituality is 
Jim Lundy, an engineer living in Santa Monica, who has participated in more 
than 40 sweat lodges over the past seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy, who is white, says a "sweat" -- where participants gather in a small 
structure to chant or sing while hot rocks superheat the air -- may lead to 
profound emotional and spiritual release. 
</P>
<P>
 Pursuing such practices in a disciplined way is "hard work," Lundy says -- and 
not for spiritual gadflies. "There are a lot of white people who feel these 
religions are chic and cool and something to get involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Another practitioner who has committed himself to Native tradition is Bill 
Stites, owner of a New Age bookstore in Silver City, N.M. Stites belongs to the 
mostly white Peyote Way Church of God, which, like the better-known Native 
American Church, uses peyote for sacramental purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain practices we engage in that are engaged in by Native 
Americans," Stites says. "But we try to follow these practices in our hearts 
without there being a violation of ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Stites agrees that many Native American religious rites should remain private, 
but he thinks it's possible for non-Indians to explore Native traditions in a 
sincere and respectful way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough one, because you don't want to go out and commercialize Native 
American religion," he says. "But there are a lot of people who genuinely go 
out and seek new knowledge. Do you say to them, 'No, you can't do that'?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Giago, editor of Indian Country Today, a national newspaper based in Rapid 
City, S.D., which has covered the wanna-be issue in depth, thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 He notes that Lakota rituals are only meaningful if performed in a particular 
dialect of the Lakota language. They are not accessible to outsiders, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like everything that has become a fad, like Hula Hoops, it passes," says 
Giago, a Lakota Sioux. "Our spirituality has been here since before Christ. 
It'll not only survive, it'll get stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Giago says, many medicine men are closing their ceremonies to 
outsiders, while tribal governments are considering sanctions to prevent 
members from revealing too much to outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Gary Adler Four Star, an Assiniboine spiritual teacher living in 
Claremont, says he tutors non-Indians about Native American values and even 
admits some to sweat lodges, provided they understand their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't discriminate against people participating," he says. "What we tell 
them is, don't attend once and go telling people you know something." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledges some participants ignore such warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are 10,000 books on Indian spirituality, most of them not written by 
Indian people," he says. "All these people attend a ceremony, and then they 
think they know something. You have a lot of people out there that are 
emulating, but don't have the knowledge. A lot of people are fooling with 
things that they don't know about, and that's dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics also contend that the faux Native Americans lack a fundamental 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmer Mesteth, a spiritual leader and instructor at Oglala Lakota College on 
the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota, recalls visiting a Lakota sacred 
site at Bear Butte State Park last Memorial Day at the request of some tribal 
elders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a camp of 200 people there," he says. "The majority of them were 
non-Indians. There was no room for our people to go use that sacred site. Some 
of our own medicine men were sitting with these people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were all these altars all over the place -- just total disrespect for 
our sacred items. It felt like they were toys." 
</P>
<P>
 Poverty on the reservation is partly to blame for some tribal members parting 
with religious secrets, Mesteth says. They realize there's a buck to be turned 
from spiritual enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the disrespect isn't limited to living Native Americans either. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chaco Culture National Historical Park in northwestern New Mexico -- home 
to a large gathering of New Agers during the August, 1987, Harmonic Convergence 
-- visitors tuck letters, crystals and homemade prayer sticks into the 
crumbling walls and kivas of thousand-year-old Anasazi ruins, says Rory 
Gauthier, a National Parks Service ranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, some sprinkle the cremated remains of loved ones amid the ruins of 
communities built by the ancestors of today's Pueblo people. "That's a very big 
problem for us," he says. "Among Native Americans, that's viewed as a horrible 
thing to do. Within their beliefs that's unspeakable." 
</P>
<P>
 Park personnel gather the debris and take it to the state Office of the 
Medical Examiner while fielding complaints from Native American leaders, 
Gauthier says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochiti's Regis Pecos, who is also executive director of the New Mexico Office 
of Indian Affairs, says the Pueblo people adopted secrecy to protect their 
religion during more than 400 years of oppression and missionary activity by 
European settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it's not misunderstood that Indian people are against others seeking a 
sense of spirituality and balance in their lives," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might sound contradictory that if our Indian way is encouraging balance, 
how can an Indian person speak against someone who is trying to attain that 
same balance through the same means? It sounds hypocritical, but there's an 
appropriate way to do it."

CONCERT PRICES TAKEN TO THE LIMIT? DON'T BET ON IT; POP MUSIC: STREISAND EASILY 
GOT $350 FOR TOP SEATS, SO OTHER ACTS MAY UP THEIR TICKETS. STILL, MANY FEAR 
THAT HIGH COSTS WILL ALIENATE FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN and STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Robert Hilburn is 
The Times' pop music critic and Steve Hochman is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concert promoters have seen the future of rock 'n' roll . . . and it's a 
$100-ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Barbra Streisand's fans showed they are willing to pay up to $350 a 
ticket for choice seats, promoters and managers predict a steady escalation in 
ticket prices, which for two years have averaged between $20 and $40 in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Insiders believe that several superstar acts -- especially those with an 
affluent fan base -- could command $250 or more for choice so-called "golden 
circle" seats, especially in Southern California and other "glamour" markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they see acts as reluctant to go much beyond $100 because they don't want 
to be seen as gouging their fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Eagles announced Wednesday that they'll charge $115 for "golden 
circle" seats at their upcoming Southern California shows -- even though 
promoters around the country said the band could safely charge significantly 
more for their much awaited reunion tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles shows will be May 27, 28, 29 and 31 at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre 
and June 3 at the Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion. The $115-, $75- and 
$35-tickets -- which include parking and Ticketmaster service charge -- go on 
sale Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on what promoters have said, I think we could sell out with a $250- or 
$500-top in some markets," said Irving Azoff, the group's manager. "But that's 
not our style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The higher figures would set a (standard) for other shows to move up to after 
us, and I don't want to be responsible for that." 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over ticket prices has been intense for years as pop promoters and 
managers keep seeing higher prices being charged for some sporting, 
Broadway-type and classical events, as well as seeing hot pop tickets resold by 
private brokers and scalpers for 10 or more times their face value. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been saying for years that concert tickets are the most underpriced 
commodity in America," Fred Rosen, president and CEO of Ticketmaster, said 
after the Streisand sales. "Why else would you have such a proliferation of 
brokers and scalpers? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I advocated the 'golden circle' concept in 1985, everyone was skeptical, 
but no longer. I think it's now a reality in the concert business." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron Stone, who manages such acts as Bonnie Raitt and Nirvana, branded the 
expected ticket escalation as "horrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone says his acts have been instrumental in establishing the higher priced 
"golden circle" concept, but as a way to raise funds for various charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really unfair," Stone said of prices. "The problem is that there are 
some people who are willing to pay scalper prices, and now the artists are in 
the same mentality. In reaction to the scalpers, the artists have decided to 
become scalpers themselves. That's really abusing your audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Because prices were set before the last weekend, the prices for most pop shows 
this summer will continue in the $20- to $50-range -- including such acts as 
Natalie Cole, Vince Gill and Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Streisand box-office blitz, however, some acts had been 
testing the market for "golden circle" seats, which generally consist of the 
front 10 to 25 rows. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Stewart has a top price of $100 for his shows Sunday and Tuesday at the 
Anaheim Pond. Traffic, the veteran English band that is also mounting a reunion 
tour this year, is charging $55 for "golden circle" seats for its Blockbuster 
Pavilion stop June 16. Top prices for Frank Sinatra's shows Sept. 23 and 24 at 
the Greek Theatre are $70. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans will clearly pay higher amounts for the right act -- as evidenced by 
reports that the $350- Streisand tickets sold faster than the $250- and 
$50-seats for shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the most ardent fans," Gary Bongiovanni, editor of the concert 
business magazine Pollstar, said of "golden circle" patrons. "Those will be the 
first that sell (at most concerts)." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Erlichman, who represents Streisand, said promoters around the country 
felt that the singer -- who hasn't toured in two decades -- could charge the 
same $1,000-top she charged in Las Vegas recently in their markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all said that as long as they didn't charge more than Vegas, they could 
handle it," he said. "They thought $350 was a slam dunk (in terms of selling 
out) and $250 was too cheap." 
</P>
<P>
 Erlichman said the performer favored $350 maximum over the $1,000 Vegas figure 
to make the shows "more accessible" to her fans. "One of the reasons to do the 
tour is reach as many people as we can," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all acts are likely to try to join the $100-a-ticket club. In many cases, 
the price of tickets is determined by region of the country and style of music. 
Country and alternative rock acts tend to charge less than mainstream pop and 
rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, for instance, Garth Brooks charged $18.75 per ticket in 
Minneapolis and Pearl Jam charged $18 in Chicago, while Sting charged $45 top 
in East Rutherford, N.J., and Rod Stewart charged $75 in Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see a danger in pushing the prices to the limit, pointing out that when 
the "golden circle" prices go up, the remaining seats tend to be increased. For 
instance, the thousands of mid-level Eagles tickets at $75 for the Irvine 
Meadows and Glen Helen shows is far above the average, even when parking and 
service charges are considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "You may see a lot more people having 'golden circle' tickets," says 
Bongiovanni. "But in terms of the whole scale of tickets raised like that, I 
don't think that would be smart. These (Streisand and Eagles) dates are on sale 
largely without competition. As we get into the summer there will be a lot of 
things on sale at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Perloff, president of the San Francisco-based Bill Graham Presents 
promotions firm, warns that promoters and artists who buy into the notion that 
they can charge sky-high prices are not paying attention to lessons offered by 
the most successful acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always use as examples the two most successful touring artists of our time: 
the Grateful Dead and Neil Diamond," says Perloff. "Both have chosen to keep 
their ticket prices down over a long time. And generally speaking, they've 
always had one price for all the seats at a show. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very different artists with very different audiences, but they have 
one thing in common. Everybody gets a bargain and everybody has a great time 
and wants to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 The topic of prices was, naturally, a hot one in the parking lot of the Pond 
as Streisand fans waited to purchase tickets last weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Sherman of Santa Ana and Margret Hershkowitz of Fullerton were upset 
that the best seats were way out of their range. 
</P>
<P>
 "That eliminates a lot of people who helped get her ahead by buying her 
records," said Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Most others, though, accepted the prices as part of the special nature of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Rosenblum of Fullerton said, "She's one of my favorites. I feel this is my 
one and only chance to see her."

PUBLIC TV HEADING TO THE MALLS; TELEVISION: WITH ITS SOON-TO-OPEN STORE OF 
KNOWLEDGE AT GLENDALE GALLERIA, KCET IS SEEKING AN ALTERNATIVE ROUTE FOR 
RAISING NEEDED FUNDS.

 Consider it public television's war of the stores. 
</P>
<P>
 In this corner, on the main floor of Beverly Center, just a book's throw from 
the center elevators, is Learningsmith. In the other corner at Glendale 
Galleria, on the ground level between Lady Foot Locker and the Gap, is Store of 
Knowledge -- the one with the huge see-through globe out front, with KCET in 
big blue letters. 
</P>
<P>
 Store of Knowledge is KCET-TV Channel 28's new 4,500-square-foot venture in 
retail, while Learningsmith, a tad smaller, belongs to Boston's WGBH-TV, home 
of "Frontline" and "Masterpiece Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 So here they are, two major public-TV stations, a bit awkwardly squaring off 
like two supermarkets on facing corners. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why? For William H. Kobin, KCET's president, it's as simple and necessary as 
finding alternative methods of fund-raising when the traditional sources are no 
longer adequate.

 Retail is "an absolute natural" for public TV, Kobin insists. "I don't think 
it's an odd concept at all because our mission is 'lifelong learning.' And 
these stores are dedicated to lifelong learning. When you look through (our 
merchandise) folder, you'll see there are items for absolutely every age, and 
every item in this store is a learning item." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, KCET considers it a no-lose proposition since it can only make money. 
According to Kobin, "not a dollar" of station money is going toward the store. 
Instead, he said, the station is supplying its "good name," plus the ability to 
attract other public stations to similar ventures elsewhere. Like 
Learningsmith, Store of Knowledge is promising to go national. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson-based Lakeshore Learning, a longtime supplier of educational materials 
for schools and youth organizations, is one of KCET's partners in the Store of 
Knowledge's triumvirate. The other is the Los Angeles venture capital firm 
Riordan, Lewis and Haden.  
</P>
<P>
 Kobin and Michael Kaplan, president of the KCET store and chairman of 
Lakeshore Learning Materials, said that Riordan, Lewis and Haden is putting up 
the money -- they decline to say how much -- while Lakeshore Learning is 
providing the merchandise, the warehousing and the computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the official opening of KCET's store is April 7, it may quietly open 
Friday or over the weekend, or early next week, "or, God forbid, April 7," 
quipped Kaplan. 
</P>
<P>
 Store's inventory, designed to attract customers from preschoolers (and their 
parents) to adult computer whizzes, will range from books, games, puzzles, 
public-TV videocassettes and a host of CD-ROMs to cardboard "bug boxes" at 
$12.95, which are said to educate as well as scare those who open them.  
</P>
<P>
 Competition with Learningsmith is inevitable because there will be some 
overlap in both educational and PBS products. The first Learningsmith opened in 
1991 and there are now 15 nationwide; Los Angeles' arrived last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Kobin professes a laid-back view of the competition: "I think the more 
interest there is in items of this kind and the more places there are, the 
better off we'll all do." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Johnson, director of product merchandise at WGBH, said that KCET was 
asked two years ago to join in WGBH's retail venture and receive royalties, but 
declined. "There's a difference between a royalty and an ownership," Kobin 
said, explaining why the Store of Knowledge arrangement is better for KCET. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaplan said new Stores of Knowledge will open this summer at Santa Monica 
Place and at Montclair Plaza in Montclair. Learningsmith will open a new branch 
in Orange County's South Coast Plaza in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy B. Conroy, KCET's senior vice president for marketing and business 
development, said eight more stores are being planned in California and across 
the nation in 1995. He declined to say where, but noted that Channel 28 and its 
partners would share in those profits too, along with other public-TV stations 
in each particular city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Public television has an interesting double-barreled mandate," Kobin said. 
"One is to stay true to the mission, and the other is the need to become 
self-supporting. The standard, the traditional, the classic methods of 
fund-raising are not going to be enough to sustain us for the future. So it's 
absolutely essential we develop new sources of revenue . . . which in other 
words means profit , to stay alive."

 The Committee for an Orange County Arts Council, formed in 1989, officially 
has dissolved and a group of local community, business and arts officials is 
working to establish a permanent countywide arts council, according to 
Fullerton Museum Center director Joe Felz. Officials of the Orange County 
Community Foundation, which helps organize philanthropic efforts, are among 
those involved, Felz said.

SUMMER SEASONS SKEWED TO OLDER POP CONCERTGOERS; AMPHITHEATERS: THE GREEK AND

 Frank Sinatra, Natalie Cole and Raphael are among the wide variety of acts 
coming to Los Angeles as part of the expanded summer schedules of the Greek 
Theatre and the Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Those artists are part of a season skewed toward the older segments of the pop 
audience -- including a Greek appearance by Roger Daltrey singing the music of 
his Who mate Pete Townshend on July 1 to complement the July 13-31 run of "The 
Who's Tommy" Broadway production at the Universal. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole will be at the Greek on Sept. 9, while Sinatra will be there Sept. 23 and 
24. Raphael will be at Universal on May 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Most shows at the Greek are priced from $15 to $35, though the Sinatra 
concerts range from $20 to $70. At the Universal, the general range is $20 to 
$50, with Reba McEntire and John Michael Montgomery's joint appearances 
charging $35 to $75. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Bennett, a veteran who has had surprising MTV success recently, is set 
for the Universal on Sept. 17, as part of a lineup that also includes the 
already announced Traffic reunion shows (June 9, 10, 11, 14) and performances 
by James Taylor (June 21 through 26) and Jackson Browne (date to be announced). 
</P>
<P>
 Country acts due there include McEntire and Montgomery (July 2, 3), Wynonna 
Judd (Sept. 11, 12) and Suzy Bogguss and Chet Atkins (Nov. 5). Shows by new-age 
stars Yanni (May 20, 21) and Kitaro (to be announced) are also planned.  
</P>
<P>
 The Greek schedule also leans toward veteran acts, including from the rock 
world Yes (July 21, 22), a double bill of the Doobie Brothers and Foreigner 
(Aug. 2), Emerson, Lake & Palmer (Aug. 17) and Chicago (Sept. 17, 18). The 
Greek also has a strong country selection, including Alan Jackson (Aug. 3), 
Vince Gill (Sept. 15, 16) and Brooks & Dunn (Oct. 20). 
</P>
<P>
 Each facility is offering special subscription plans, allowing fans to get 
priority seating by ordering for multiple events before tickets go on sale for 
individual shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Starting Sunday, the Greek will have two plans available: the Premiere Club, 
with a choice of any six shows, and Premiere Club Limited, with a choice of any 
four shows. Shows will generally not go on sale through Ticketmaster until six 
to eight weeks before the concert date.  
</P>
<P>
 The Universal's plan also gives subscribers a choice of any six shows, with 
orders accepted starting Sunday. In each case, subscribers will be given 
chances to order for shows added to the schedule before the rest of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shows on the Greek Theatre schedule: 
</P>
<P>
 O'Jays, Whispers and LeVert (April 29), Salt-n-Pepa and R. Kelly (May 4, 5), 
"Reggae Sunsplash '94" (May 27, 28), Bryan Adams (June 2, 3), David Benoit & 
Ross Freeman (June 10), Los Lobos (June 11), Stylistics, Dramatics and 
Chi-Lites (June 18).

FORD'S 'SUMMER' OFFERS EXPANDED SCHEDULE; ARTS: THE SERIES LINEUP INCLUDES 31 
PERFORMANCES OF MUSIC, OPERA, DANCE AND THEATER BY 17 ORGANIZATIONS.

 The 1994 "Summer Nights at the Ford" performance series, running June 18-Sept. 
4, will encompass 31 performances of music, opera, dance and theater by 17 Los 
Angeles County-based arts organizations -- including expanded world arts and 
culture events and a new series of seven children's events, program organizers 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Series officials said that the second annual "Summer Nights" fest, held at the 
outdoor John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Cahuenga Pass near the Hollywood Bowl, 
will also offer additional picnic areas this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The season will open with "Moon Over Madness," by the L.A. Physical Theatre 
project -- a "comic spectacle in the tradition of Cirque du Soleil" directed by 
Stefan Haves, creative consultant on the New York and Los Angeles productions 
of "Fool Moon." The show, performed June 18 and 19, will include silent 
performers, 20-foot puppets and live musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican folkloric dance group Danza Floricanto/USA, which is the oldest 
existing professional Mexican folk dance troupe in Los Angeles and was one of 
last season's most popular events, returns this year, along with Dance 
Kaleidoscope and Huayucaltia. 
</P>
<P>
 New "world" program offerings will include Rum & Humble's "Salsa L.A." (Rum & 
Humble staged the 1993 Los Angeles Festival's popular "Sacred Landmarks" 
concert series); an all-day program of Caribbean music; and "Brazilian Festival 
'94." 
</P>
<P>
 Children's performances -- with tickets priced at $7, rather than the $15-$30 
for other events -- will include introductions to Bach and Mozart by the Los 
Angeles Baroque Orchestra and the Los Angeles Mozart Orchestra; dance 
performances by Dance Kaleidoscope, Lula Washington's Youth Dance Ensemble and 
Jazz Tap Ensemble; Arco Iris, a music troupe from Buenos Aires performing 
traditional music from the Andes; and Craig 'N Company, featuring rock 'n' roll 
by recording artist Craig Taubman and his band. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford series also includes Ken Nordine and Friends with special guest Geggy 
Tah, with Tah delivering "Word Jazz" monologues backed by music; the Long Beach 
Chamber Chorale; the Los Angeles Philharmonic; the Long Beach Opera and Los 
Angeles Modern Dance and Ballet.

 It read, simply: "A loving mother will baby-sit in your T.O. home." 
</P>
<P>
 That was it, except for a phone number. But there seemed to be an urgency in 
the note tacked to the community bulletin board outside Ralphs supermarket on 
East Moorpark Road in Thousand Oaks -- perhaps it was the three other ads, all 
identical to the first, and within several feet of one another on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 A passing glance at the board wouldn't cause one to stop and consider the fate 
of this "loving mother." She fought for attention amid a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the "Lost Grey Schnauzer" named Frea, who disappeared while on a 
visit from Nevada; Ken Gresiak's Crystal Clear Pool & Spa Service, and various 
earthquake repair and inspection operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you know anyone who has a health concern? (High blood pressure, high 
cholesterol, diabetes, asthma, etc?)" The ad said, "50 people are needed 
immediately for a Doctor Recommended Advanced Nutrition program. Satisfaction 
is guaranteed. Call now!" 
</P>
<P>
 A guy named Dinu was trying to sell an '81 Honda Accord with "new tires, 
brakes and drive shaft, rebuilt transmission and radiator." But it did need 
some power steering work. Dinu informed prospective buyers that he "must sell 
immediately, moving out of state." 
</P>
<P>
 "For Sale," called another ad. "Cradle, rocker, play pen, rocker horse, 
umbrella carriage, walker, potty seat and more." Some ads needed little 
explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Community bulletin boards, like bus terminals, are about people: people in 
flux, people seeking change or people just looking to make some money. And 
people reaching out to other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a world in which we have fewer formal places for people to gather, they 
choose informal ways of communication," said Marie Butler, professor of 
sociology at Oxnard College. "Bulletin boards are a way people can communicate 
with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 We spent a week chasing down ads at the bulletin board at Ralphs in Thousand 
Oaks, one of the busier boards in Ventura County. It is not owned by the store, 
but by TV Fanfare Publications, a 42-year-old Valencia-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 TV Fanfare has been in the business of community bulletin boards -- or, as 
folks there refer to them, Market Information Centers, since 1966. The company 
rents the boards to area merchants. "We're at most of the major grocery 
chains," said Tom Tudman, the company's senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very popular with people in the community who are not only looking 
for a place to rent, or selling their refrigerators," said Keith Sonne, TV 
Fanfare vice president, "but also for baby-sitting jobs, lost bikes, all sorts 
of community events where they would otherwise have to take out an ad in the 
paper or clutter up a window." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonne said the company has boards in 42 states. He estimated that upward of 
14,000 people will pass a single grocery store bulletin board each week. 
</P>
<P>
 We were among the throngs passing the bulletin board in Thousand Oaks, hoping 
to get to know some of the people behind the pushpins.

 Gail Hobbs realizes there are plenty of good restaurants in Ventura County. 
And she would like others to take note, too. That's why Hobbs and her husband, 
Don, are compiling recipes from local eateries for a planned countywide 
cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hobbses, who own Gold Coast Press in Ventura, have sent out about 200 
requests for book entries. They've heard back from, among others, the Ojai 
Valley Inn and Wheeler Hot Springs in Ojai, the Pierpont Inn and Nona's 
Courtyard Cafe in Ventura, and The Greek Restaurant in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a variety in this county -- there's a lot of seafood, so many 
Indian restaurants, Mexican restaurants. Anything you want to eat, you can find 
here," said Gail Hobbs. "I've gotten some flat no's but there are some 
high-class restaurants responding." 
</P>
<P>
 Interested chefs who would like to contribute should call 642-6346. Hobbs said 
she is planning for publication in June, just in time for the tourists.

 Pasta Party: The Westlake Village Pastabilities Restaurant is hosting a 
shindig tonight to try out some dishes on the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The entree: grilled salmon with a sauce of wine, capers, olives, and salmon, 
atop a plate of polenta. Farfalle (bow -- tie noodles), spaghetti, calamari, 
and more northern Italian fare will also be served. Cocktails begin at 6:30 
p.m., followed by dinner, live music, and dancing until midnight. (Just call in 
sick tomorrow.) Cost: $35 a person. Phone 379-4901 for reservations. The 
restaurant is at 900 Hampshire Road, Suite X. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicola Rossetto, who is one of the owners, plans to hold more of these parties 
as he tries to size up the taste buds of Ventura County. In May, Rossetto plans 
to add rotating specials to the restaurant's menu. "It will be new Italian 
cuisine and pasta," said the native of Venice, Italy. "Not just the same tomato 
sauce."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LA MIRADA; CITY THEATER PANELISTS TO RECEIVE FREE PASSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 City officials hope to keep a closer eye on the city's Theatre of the 
Performing Arts by giving theater commissioners free passes to events. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's six commissioners will be given two passes each to performances if 
seats are available, City Manager Gary Sloan said. In return, the commissioners 
will be asked to fill out questionnaires evaluating the shows and the 
appearance of the theater, Sloan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to encourage commissioners, who are unpaid volunteers, 
to attend more shows and monitor changes at the theater, said Hal Malkin, a 
commissioner for the past 17 years. Some commissioners "haven't been attending 
even a majority of the events because it was impacting on them financially," 
Malkin said. He said he and his family spent $800 last year on theater tickets, 
which cost up to $30 apiece for Broadway-series shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to offer free passes comes at a time when officials say ticket 
sales have slipped and theater operations are undergoing dramatic change. Jeff 
Brown, the city's theater director, said subscriptions to the theater's 
money-making Broadway series dropped from 9,000 to 8,000 in the past year. At 
most Broadway-series shows, Brown said, only a third of the 1,264 theater seats 
are filled. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, some city officials have objected to the salty language of several 
recent productions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city decided in December to replace the current producers of the Broadway 
series with Cathy Rigby, Olympic gymnast-turned-actress, and her husband, Tom 
McCoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rogers, who has teamed with his father, Herb Rogers, to produce the 
Broadway series since the city bought the theater and renovated it 17 years 
ago, said the city is sending the wrong signal with its decision to give 
theater commissioners free passes. "If they don't buy tickets, and they're the 
theater commissioners, why do they expect anybody else to?" asked Rogers, whose 
last production will be in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the four Broadway productions scheduled each year, the theater 
has children's theater, symphony and community playhouse performances. GREG 
MILLER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; FATE OF NUDE THEATER TO BE DECIDED IN 
APRIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge is expected to decide in April whether a controversial 
establishment that features nude dancers can continue to operate in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have attempted to shut down Body Parts, 12403 E. Carson St., 
for several months. But owner Thomas Shelley obtained a court order in January 
allowing him to remain open pending a court decision. He argued that his 
business is constitutionally protected. U.S. District Judge Richard Gadbois 
heard arguments from both sides this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began in October when Shelley, a former soft-drink 
distributor, applied for permits to remodel a former auto parts store into a 
theater. He amended the store's outdoor sign from "Auto Parts" to "Body Parts." 
But the City Council declared a moratorium on all new adult businesses while 
the city amends its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 7, Shelley defied the moratorium and opened the theater, which has 
live stage shows featuring nude dancers. Five days later, sheriff's deputies 
shut him down for operating without a business license. 
</P>
<P>
 But Body Parts was closed only one day. Shelley immediately filed a lawsuit in 
federal court, alleging that the moratorium violated his First Amendment 
rights. Gadbois agreed and decided that Body Parts could remain open pending 
this week's trial and his ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contends that Body Parts is violating several city regulations, said 
Richard R. Terzian, attorney for Hawaiian Gardens. The city says the 
establishment does not have enough parking, landscaping or a proper masonry 
enclosure for trash dumpsters. Roger Jon Diamond, attorney for Body Parts, said 
Shelley will make the changes, which will cost $15,000 to $20,000, if he is 
allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also attempting to show that Body Parts violates an ordinance 
prohibiting adult businesses within 500 feet of a church. Terzian said Body 
Parts is within 500 feet of a Korean church at 21732 Verne Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond disputed the city's measurements. He also argued that the ordinance 
wouldn't apply to Body Parts even if it were within 500 feet of the church. The 
city has such a ban against adult movie theaters, adult bookstores and massage 
parlors, but Body Parts is exempt because it is live theater, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley has accused the city of unfairly singling out his business for its 
adult nature and contended that the attempts to close it have been 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Terzian denied the charges. "It's like any other business. Whether it's auto 
parts or nude dancing, it has to comply with provisions of the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a group of local residents has picketed Body Parts almost nightly 
in an attempt to discourage customers. About 50 protesters showed up on a 
recent Saturday evening. Some said they believe the theater, which borders a 
commercial area to the south and residences to the north, will bring more crime 
and undermine property values. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond said the city will benefit if Shelley is allowed to keep his business. 
"The majority of Hawaiian Gardens residents believe in freedom of choice for 
consenting adults, and I'm sure in a time of economic depression they want the 
buildings to be rented," he said. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: SOUTH GATE; PROPOSALS SOUGHT FOR ABANDONED FIREHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of fires have been set at Fire Station 52. 
</P>
<P>
 Littered with fallen plaster and empty cans of spray paint, the abandoned 
firehouse near Firestone Avenue and State Street has become a canvas for 
graffiti and an occasional flophouse for transients. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, where fire engines were housed, walls bear burn marks from fires 
touched off by vagrants. About six weeks ago, firefighters were called to douse 
flames in the Station 52 carport, where someone had sought shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after nine years sitting vacant and abused, Station 52 may soon be razed 
or renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 The county closed Fire Station 52 in 1985 after the city refused to pay an 
additional $300,000 in property taxes to the Consolidated Fire Protection 
District. The property was turned over to the city in December, and St. Francis 
Medical Center requested that the city donate it for development as a health 
care clinic.  
</P>
<P>
 It would be less expensive to raze the station and build a clinic than to 
renovate the building, said Bob Walters, St. Francis vice president for 
facilities, after he inspected the building for structural damage. Renovation 
would cost an estimated $4 million, but constructing a new 5,000-square-foot 
clinic at the site would cost about $1 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the building's skeleton appears to be in fairly good shape, the 
station would need to be stripped to its frame, seismically retrofitted and 
treated for asbestos before renovation could begin, Walters said. The property 
will also require an environmental cleanup because of an underground fuel tank 
once used to fill the fire engines. MARY HELEN BERG

ISSUE OF CITY MANAGER DOMINATES NORWALK ELECTION; COUNCIL: MOST CHALLENGERS 
WANT TO FIRE POWERS OR CURTAIL HIS AUTHORITY. BUT TWO INCUMBENTS SUPPORT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL GOTTESMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A record 16 candidates are vying for three seats on the Norwalk City Council, 
but the name discussed most often by office seekers isn't even on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Embattled City Manager Richard Powers has become a focal point in the April 12 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 13 challengers -- as well as a council member who is seeking 
reelection -- favor a shakeup in the city's administration, which they say is 
top-heavy and overpaid. Several challengers contend that the city manager is 
responsible for the city's financial woes, which resulted in an unpopular 
utility users tax two years ago, and has made questionable development 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Several challengers said they would attempt to dismiss the city manager if 
they are elected. Others said they would strip Powers of some of his authority 
and force him to take a pay cut. Powers earns $113,000 a year, which he said is 
comparable to salaries for his position in similar cities. "I am in the middle, 
not at the top," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two incumbents on the ballot -- Robert J. Arthur and Luigi A. Vernola -- 
staunchly defend Powers and his staff, and promise to retain the city manager 
if reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Powers is a capable manager who will help the city, which has a 
population of 94,000, become one of the region's key transportation and 
commercial hubs. Vernola said Powers' critics don't understand the city 
manager's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to have these people sit down and write down on paper what they 
would do to improve things," he said. "I think they would find that Powers is 
doing an excellent job once they really looked into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The three candidates who get the most votes will win seats on the five-member 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernola, who owns an automotive repair shop and towing service, is seeking a 
third term and Arthur, who owns a small production studio, is running for his 
second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The other incumbent on the ballot, Gordon A. Stefenhagen, a property manager, 
is seeking election for the first time. Stefenhagen was appointed to the 
council two years ago when Grace F. Napolitano was elected to the state 
Assembly. He favors reducing the city manager's authority and cutting his 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the challengers who favor firing Powers is Jesse M. Luera, who was 
dismissed by Powers last year as the city's director of social services after 
being accused of sexual harassment. Luera, president of the Norwalk-La Mirada 
Unified school board, has denied the allegations, but a city personnel board 
last month upheld his dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sweet, a former city planning commissioner who was removed by the council 
after clashes with Arthur over development issues, said he would vote to fire 
Powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like his management style and I don't like the money that he makes," 
said Sweet, a real estate broker. "If (Powers) was the CEO of a business, he 
would have been removed a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Other challengers who say they would vote to fire the city manager are Mary 
Jane McIntosh, an advertising representative; Santos Hernandez, a factory 
worker; Ruperto Juarez, a retired factory worker, and Paul Britton, a real 
estate broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Three challengers have criticized the city manager, but said they would prefer 
to reduce his authority and salary rather than fire him. "Right now I feel all 
the power is in (Powers') hands, and I don't like that," said Eleanor 
Zimmerman, a travel agent whose late husband, John, served on the council in 
the 1980s. "I would revert back to the city administrator form of government. 
There is a big land swell among all the challengers that something has got to 
change." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Thurber, a general contractor, and E. Charles Janikowski, an X-ray 
technician, also favor converting the city manager's position to city 
administrator, a position with less authority and lower salary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said some of the criticism may stem from changes that he made shortly 
after arriving in Norwalk six years ago. He said the city at the time was 
running up an annual deficit of $3 million, and various departments were being 
run by maverick administrators who paid no attention to budget constraints.  
</P>
<P>
 Powers said he cut management by 25% and took a 5% reduction in salary in 
1989. "We started holding people accountable, and terminated people who were 
not competent and we made the place efficient," he said. "Maybe that has made 
me unpopular." 
</P>
<P>
 The city now has an assistant city manager and three deputies, but there are 
no department heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's reserves rose to $16 million in 1989, but have since dropped to 
$2.8 million. Powers said the city has dipped into its reserves to offset state 
budget cuts and to buy land. The city spent $5 million, for example, to acquire 
the site for a 24-screen theater complex, restaurants and shops, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over the city manager has overshadowed a controversy over Luera's 
candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two city employees who say Luera sexually harassed them when they worked in 
his department have picketed school board meetings, City Council sessions and 
candidates' forums, urging voters not to vote for Luera. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no respect for women and he is not fit to be a councilman," said Velia 
Vargas, one of those who accused Luera of harassment. Vargas and co-worker 
Peggy Jones have lawsuits pending against Luera and the city on the issue.  
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent development, employee Rachel Pedraza has filed a lawsuit 
alleging that Luera raped her when she worked in his department in 1992. No 
criminal charges have been filed. Pedraza is on medical leave from her job as a 
child development program coordinator. Luera did not return several calls and 
has kept a low profile in the race. He did not appear at a recent candidates' 
forum held by Norwalk Against Graffiti, whose president has endorsed him. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Luera won the endorsement of the International Assn. of 
Machinists and Aerospace Workers, which represents about 120 workers in City 
Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not been found guilty of anything," said union President Bill Clark, 
adding that Luera, a 28-year resident who owns a dry-cleaning business in the 
city, "knows the community very well and supports employee issues." The union 
also endorsed Stefenhagen. 
</P>
<P>
 A few candidates have distanced themselves from the debate over the city 
manager and have emphasized other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Electrical design consultant Nikki Janks wants to spend more money on public 
safety and hire more police officers. Paralegal Miguel (Mike) Lopez said he 
believes there are too many business people on the council.  
</P>
<P>
 Education consultant Danny Lopez advocates more programs for children and 
senior citizens. Philip Troutt, a director of the nonprofit Christian Home 
Educators Assn. in Norwalk, says the city should spend less money on social 
programs and more on such public works efforts as trimming trees and sweeping 
streets.

POLITICAL NOTEBOOK: WINGS OF DEPUTY REGISTRAR CLIPPED OVER FLYERS ON VOTER 
FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Wilma J. Van Beek went door to door in Artesia looking for new voters to 
register, she was shocked at what she found. Voter fraud, she said, was lurking 
behind many doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Van Beek took it upon herself to distribute 2,500 flyers 
reprimanding potential offenders and warning that polls would be monitored for 
illegal voting. She signed the flyer and identified herself as "deputy 
registrar of voters" -- an imposing title actually held by hundreds of 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Van Beek was scolded by the secretary of state and county 
registrar-recorder's office after residents complained that she seemed to be 
singling out potential Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The flyers, which included a Spanish translation, warned that any evidence of 
voter fraud would be turned over to the district attorney. Van Beek wrote that 
she had encountered registered voters who were undocumented immigrants, were 
under-age or using false identities. 
</P>
<P>
 The county registrar of voters reprimanded Van Beek for using the deputy 
registrar title on the flyer without permission. The acting secretary of state, 
Tony Miller, sent a letter demanding that Van Beek "cease and desist 
immediately from any tactic which could be construed to be the intimidation of 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Beek, who has endorsed challengers Tim Kelemen and John Lyon in the April 
12 election for two City Council seats, said she never meant to intimidate 
anyone. She acted merely "to keep people out of trouble," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has given Miller and the district attorney's office names of 
people she says are improperly registered. She also submitted a letter 
describing irregularities she says she encountered while registering voters. 
The district attorney's office declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor James A. Van Horn Jr., who is seeking reelection, said Van Beek's flyer 
was aimed at one of his strongest voting blocs: the city's 6,000 Latinos. "I 
hope it infuriates them more than intimidates them," Van Horn said. 
Councilwoman Mary Alyce Soares is also seeking reelection. 
</P>

 BUSINESS IS BUSINESS: The title business person may seem innocuous, but those 
could become fighting words in the race for the Long Beach mayor's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that candidate Frank Colonna, who owns a real estate brokerage firm, 
believed he would be the only businessman on the ballot. Then candidate ballot 
statements came out last week. Of the six candidates who are considered top 
contenders, four identified themselves as business people, including Colonna. 
The title is important, Colonna said, because recent elections have shown 
voters favor entrepreneurial types over politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The other self-described business people are Beverly O'Neill, former president 
of Long Beach City College, who planned to become a private consultant before 
deciding to run for mayor; Don Westerland, executive director of the nonprofit 
counseling agency Family Service of Long Beach, and Jeffrey A. Kellogg, vice 
mayor and vice president of a commercial real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry that others seemed to be horning in on their territory, Colonna's 
campaign consultants called a news conference to flush out the "lies and 
misrepresentations" of other candidates. Colonna called off the session once he 
heard what his campaign team had planned. "I reeled it back in because I was 
concerned about whether this thing was worthy of attention," Colonna said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters haven't heard the end of this matter, however. Colonna's camp argues 
that the business title should only be used by those who hold a Long Beach 
business license. The business versus non-business issue will be showing up in 
Colonna's direct mail pieces within the next few days, consultant Dan 
Wooldridge said. 
</P>

<P>
 NEW ARRIVAL: She worked 25 years for the city of Santa Fe Springs, but Hazel 
Fields is answering charges that she's a newcomer. Fields, who retired as city 
clerk two years ago, is now one of six candidates vying for two City Council 
seats there.  
</P>
<P>
 At a recent candidate's forum, it was revealed that Fields had left her Orange 
County home and moved to Santa Fe Springs six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Council candidates James W. Hogan Jr., a 34-year-resident, and Hilda Zamora, a 
resident for 19 years, were quick to point out their longevity in the city. 
Others running for council are incumbents Al Fuentes and Ronald S. Kernes, and 
challenger George Minnehan. Organizations representing city workers and 
firefighters have endorsed Fields and Minnehan, a 29-year resident.

report.

AID FOR LATINO AIDS PATIENTS; DOWNEY GROUP TRIES TO OVERCOME CULTURAL BARRIERS 
TO FACING PROBLEM, SEEKING HELP 
</P>

 Ruben Acosta wants local Latinos with HIV to wake up and get help. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latino homosexuals are notoriously unwilling to acknowledge their sexual 
orientation or seek help if they become HIV-positive because of cultural and 
religious traditions, said Acosta, the founder of Action Now, a new 
general-service AIDS organization in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, who is 34 and HIV-positive, speaks from experience. He says he married 
and had two children before he admitted to himself that he is gay. Now he hopes 
he can help "tear down the walls of denial" in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do know someone with AIDS," said Acosta, who was diagnosed with the AIDS 
virus two years ago. "They're your gardener or your child's Sunday school 
teacher or your attendant at Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now, which opened March 1, will provide assistance to people with HIV 
and AIDS, their caretakers and survivors through free counseling, an 
information and referral center, and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta hopes to target the Latino population in 19 Southeast cities, such as 
Maywood and Huntington Park, where more than 92% of residents are Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 By providing counseling for Spanish speakers and support groups for Latinos, 
Action Now and other agencies are "responding to the changing face of AIDS," 
said Dean Lacitra, a spokesman for AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 After whites, Latinos have the highest rate of infection, according to the Los 
Angeles County Department of Health Services. But because of machismo and the 
cultural stigma associated with homosexuality, Acosta said, Latino cases are 
severely underreported. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now may make it easier for Southeast-area residents to come forward and 
get help, Acosta said. The organization attracted about a dozen clients in its 
first two weeks of operation and 250 people to its first major event, a 
candlelight gathering earlier this month. The community's positive response 
reflects the local need for AIDS services, said Enid Awad, executive director 
of the Southern California Rehabilitation Services, a nonprofit umbrella group 
that oversees Action Now and other programs that help people with disabilities 
live independently. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Now clients will be able to tap resources such as job and housing 
placement, transportation and other services that the umbrella group provides, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, an aerospace quality control manager who has become an AIDS activist, 
hopes to make presentations at local schools. "These kids have uncles and moms 
that are dying or have died," Acosta said. "They need to be able to talk about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta is Action Now's only employee, and the organization operates on a 
$24,000 budget provided through Southern California Rehabilitation Services. 
Acosta has planned a Southwestern cook-off fund-raiser for May 13 and hopes to 
organize a hair cut-a-thon to raise money -- and the organization's profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in Bell Gardens are still traveling to Hollywood and Long Beach 
for help, and we want them to know that there is help right here," Acosta said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: PARAMOUNT; 2 SCHOOL OFFICIALS HALT EFFORTS TO RECLAIM JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Paramount school officials who were placed on leave 16 months ago after 
being accused of mismanaging the district's adult-school programs have 
abandoned efforts to get their jobs back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the school board accepted the resignations of Ed Quesada, former 
director of the Paramount Adult Education Center, and Vice Principal Luther 
Martinez during a closed meeting, Supt.Michele Lawrence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quesada and Martinez had been fighting for reinstatement since November, 1992, 
when the district placed them on unpaid leave after state auditors reported 
problems in the adult school's record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men have consistently denied that they mismanaged Paramount's 
adult-school programs and have sued the district for wrongful termination. 
Quesada said he will now focus his efforts on getting a new job, and on his 
lawsuit against the district. The suit seeks unspecified damages, including 
back wages, Quesada said.  
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was not available for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; POLICE CENTER TO OPEN IN WILLMORE SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials will take another step toward decentralizing the Police Department 
on Saturday when they open a storefront police center in the Willmore 
neighborhood on the westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, at 539 W. 9th St., will be staffed by a retired Long Beach police 
officer, a Spanish interpreter and volunteers.Residents will be able to file 
reports there and report suspicious activity.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency has agreed to pay the center's first-year 
lease. After that, neighborhood groups that staff the facility will be expected 
to foot the bill. The city will pay the officer's salary and phone bills, city 
spokeswoman Joan Caterino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's grand opening, scheduled 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday, will feature 
a K-9 police dog demonstration. The center will be open to the public from 2 to 
7 p.m. Wednesdays through Sundays.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WHITTIER; USED BOOKSTORES ENJOY PEACEFUL COEXISTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LePAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rocco Ingala and Luisa Lorona figured Whittier could use another used 
bookstore -- even though there are eight others within a five-minute walk in 
the Uptown area. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the huge discount bookstores that sell everything from A to Z, the 
Uptown-area bookstores specialize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each shop has its own little niche," Ingala said. "We don't look at it as 
competition. We look at all the shops as more of an attraction that will draw 
people into the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Insomnia Bookstore, Gallery, Gifts, which Ingala and Lorona opened late 
last year on Philadelphia Street, features literature and poetry by local 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Valdez Books & Bindery offers the town's largest collection 
of Latino, Western Americana and 19th-Century British literature. Bookland 
carries new books of popular titles, while Anderson's Book Shop has an 
extensive collection of used science fiction and fantasy. Los Tlacuilos 
Bribiescas carries art and literature about indigenous Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookstores, along with new restaurants and a renovated theater, are the 
cornerstone of an aggressive effort to rejuvenate an Uptown area that was hit 
hard by the 1987 Whittier earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Greenleaf Avenue, visitors can stroll at night among trees decked out 
with tiny bright lights. Shoppers can dine on Italian or Japanese cuisine, sip 
exotic blends at one of several new coffeehouses, browse through art galleries 
and flip through an array of new and used books. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of evening shoppers has grown from virtually nil two years ago to 
the point where it is difficult to find parking along Uptown's streets, 
especially on Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Six bookstores were operating at the time of the quake and most were forced to 
close at least temporarily. Five eventually reopened and have been joined by 
four new bookstores in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Insomnia Bookstore, the newest, occupies a building that was rebuilt following 
the 1987 quake. The shelves have been stocked with more than 15,000 titles of 
ethnically diverse literature, poetry, philosophy and religion. But the owners 
hope to keep their roomy store stuffed with an eclectic hodgepodge of local 
writing and artwork, including "chap" books, self-published works by 
little-known Whittierites and other authors. 
</P>
<P>
 One writer, Tanya Hyonhye Ko, a Biola University graduate who immigrated to 
the United States from Korea in 1982, tells of adjusting to U.S. culture while 
retaining her native culture. Her book of poems is entitled "Generation One 
Point Five." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingala hopes the store "will allow me to pay the rent, eat and provide some 
culture to the people of Whittier." He and Lorona also edit "Insomnia," a 
literature and art magazine.

 Several Uptown bookstore owners said their business is somewhat sporadic, but 
profit is not always the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all pretty much about a love of books," said Brad Cormier, owner of The 
Book Stop, a section of bare, concrete floor cordoned off by a row of simple 
wood shelves in the basement below Valdez Books. When business is slow, he 
reads -- two or three books a week -- or writes. He's working on a novel.

 Under Operation Kid Print, children in Bell and Maywood will be safer and more 
savvy, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Kid Print, a free program sponsored by Assemblywoman Martha M. 
Escutia (D-Huntington Park) in cooperation with the Maywood and Bell city 
councils and police departments, will fingerprint up to 20,000 elementary 
school children in the Southeast area, a Maywood Police Department spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 During presentations at local schools next month, police will talk to children 
about safety, avoiding strangers and how to get help. Police also will record 
the physical description, medical information and fingerprints of each child to 
be used in case of disappearance or kidnaping.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL GARDENS; CITY LOANS TO HELP DEFRAY COLLEGE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city-sponsored student loan program should make the dream of higher 
education more attainable to dozens of students annually while building 
community stability and pride, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in April, city residents can apply for no-interest loans through the 
city's Academic Pursuit Program to help defray the cost of tuition, books, room 
and board, transportation and other educational expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, using the interest created by $3 million in city reserves, will 
fund thousands of dollars in loans in exchange for community service work, said 
Karen Nobrega, assistant city manager. About $120,000 in loans should be 
available in the first year of the program, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bell Gardens, where the per capita income is about $5,000, the program 
could mean the difference between a college education and a high school 
diploma, said Mike Padilla, a counselor at Bell Gardens High School. It will 
also give students the opportunity to attend private and out-of-state schools, 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for the program, students must also have a 2.5 grade-point 
average, a good attendance record and proof of acceptance at an accredited 
four-year or junior college. The deadline for applications is May 12.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MONTEBELLO; TIGHTER POLICY SOUGHT ON SCHOOL VISITORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Montebello school officials are proposing to tighten campus security by 
requiring outsiders to get permission from an administrator whenever they visit 
district schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy regulating visitor access to 27 schools in the Montebello 
Unified School District is to be discussed next Thursday at a school board 
meeting. The proposed policy would require all school visitors to sign in at 
the school principal's office. Violators of the policy would be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 Faustino Ledesma, director of pupil and community services, said the policy 
would help school officials maintain greater campus security and prevent 
unauthorized visits.

 A new sheriff's substation has been dedicated in Bellflower as part of the 
city's effort to increase law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight full-time deputies and a special investigator have been assigned to the 
new facility. This more than doubles the number of deputies assigned to the 
city, said Mike Egan, deputy city administrator.  
</P>

 The substation, which opened in November, is the centerpiece of a community 
policing plan, and will be used for neighborhood watch and other community

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNEY; FORCED TRANSFERS FROM GRADE SCHOOL DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Downey school board has given in to parents' demands and backed away from 
a plan to force students to transfer from Maude Price Elementary School to a 
school that is being reopened to relieve crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-to-3 vote earlier this month gives Price students the option of 
remaining there instead of going to Unsworth Elementary School, which is being 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsworth will draw students from three schools: Price, Gallatin and Rio San 
Gabriel. Fourth-graders in Gallatin and Rio San Gabriel also will have the 
option of finishing elementary school at their current campus. Other reassigned 
students from Gallatin and Rio San Gabriel will have no choice. Parents at 
those schools generally did not oppose the transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 residents, mostly Price Elementary parents, attended a board meeting 
to protest the original plan, which mandated all the transfers. The parents 
complained that students walking to school would have to cross busy Lakewood 
Boulevard and walk along congested Telegraph Road. They also said changing 
elementary schools was disruptive.

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK-LA MIRADA; SURPLUS SCHOOLS NEEDED FOR FUTURE, STUDY 
SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District should not sell its six surplus 
campuses because it will have more students than classroom space by the next 
decade, researchers have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The study by Omega Group Inc., predicted that enrollment will surpass 29,000 
in 2003, compared to a current enrollment of about 19,700. However, the report 
states, the district has some time to prepare because enrollment growth should 
be modest for about three years before experiencing a sharp upturn. The 
district operates 16 elementary schools, six middle schools and four high 
schools, which can accommodate a combined total of about 27,600 students.

COVER STORY; MEDIA FOR THE MASSES; PUBLIC-ACCESS TV GIVES EVERYONE A CHANCE TO 
BE A STAR -- IN THEIR OWN UNIVERSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD BLUME, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose Brown inspects vegetables for a living, but frankly, she'd rather host a 
television show. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Swearingen cleans houses, but she'd like to be on video too. 
</P>
<P>
 For these Lakewood residents and dozens of others, such a fantasy is well 
within reach, thanks to public-access television, the low-budget dream factory 
of cable television. After a few hours of free training, anyone in the Long 
Beach area or other parts of Southeast Los Angeles County can have his own 
television show on a cable system's community channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Who cares if even your mother thinks you lack talent? You can still be in 
pictures -- broadcast into the homes of thousands of local cable subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous," said Brown, a food inspector for the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, who plans to produce a talk show. "I can do as much as I want and 
there's no pressure to make money at it. And if people don't like it, they can 
turn me off." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost anything goes on the air. Views from the far left, the far right. 
Fundamentalist Christians, atheists, meditators, amateur music video makers -- 
all get their shot. Along with the free or low-cost training, most area 
residents get free use of late-model video production equipment, limited 
professional assistance and, most important, free air time. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a cornucopia of small-budget or no-budget shows. Air time also 
is available to local government, which has gotten into the act by televising 
city council and planning commission hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are not allowed to pitch products, but otherwise, "as long as it's 
not lewd or obscene and people are willing to produce it, they can," said 
Benjamin Harvey, who oversees video productions for Bellflower. "The cable 
company doesn't really do a whole lot of censoring." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the cable company demand sophisticated technique. Many locally 
produced programs have the look and insight of a home video. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tape kept rolling on one show after a magician skewered his hand with 
scissors. The wound bled during the rest of his routine. The producers of a 
story-telling program for children made the mistake of using young readers who 
could barely read. A "how-to" art demonstration became a "how-not-to" exercise 
when a portrait of a show's host looked nothing like the real thing. The host 
of a medical show got so enthused while talking about heart disease that he 
forgot to let his guest speak. 
</P>
<P>
 The set for the typical public-access talk show is simple -- a few chairs, a 
table or two and a few hand props. The backdrop for many Long Beach talk shows 
is blue because the engineer doesn't have the equipment to light the set in any 
other color. The same four artificial plants get rearranged in different 
patterns from show to show. 
</P>
<P>
 The talk shows rarely have a problem booking guests, who range from musicians 
trying to record their first album to local residents who have lived lives 
worth talking about. Long Beach studio technicians recall one talk show that 
would bring on a political activist who always appeared with a clear plastic 
briefcase handcuffed to his wrist. They don't remember the point the man was 
trying to make. Then there was the theorist who warned that the sitcom "Get 
Smart" and the movie "Star Wars" were elements of a conspiracy to control 
viewers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 For guest and host alike, the shows are often a bully pulpit for ideas, 
fantasies or feelings that usually get little attention, let alone a spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays on Long Beach cable channel 33, you can see "Cambodia Today," which 
informs the large Long Beach Cambodian community about events back home. On 
Mondays, you can catch the latest in senior citizen talent on "Bob's World." 
Thursdays offer "Flights into the Unknown," which makes the case for healing 
with voodoo, using magic wands and reading Tarot cards. Friday is the day for 
"Women's Sports Info," which features video clips of local women's sporting 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Pico Rivera, tune in to the crowning of the town's beauty queen. In 
Lynwood, witness the anti-gang crusade of a mother who lost two sons in 
drive-by shootings. In Artesia, catch up with the latest news from the Azores 
-- in Portuguese. In Hawaiian Gardens, relive a moment of civic pride by 
watching a replay of the appearance of Councilwoman Kathleen Navejas on the 
network talk show, "Donohue." In Lakewood, see a local video version of 
Disney's animated feature, "Beauty and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Most cable companies offer public access as part of their negotiated agreement 
with a city for the right to operate the local cable franchise. In most 
Southeast-area cities, public access was first offered in the early to 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the equipment and professional assistance varies from city to 
city. In some places, the service has never taken off. Montebello, for 
instance, has only one regular local show, a religious program. 
</P>
<P>
 But cities such as Lynwood, Lakewood and Long Beach offer a full schedule of 
programs made by a growing population of producers. Lakewood, in fact, has a 
plethora of community channels, with separate broadcast bands reserved for the 
Long Beach school district, Cal State Long Beach, Cerritos College, local 
churches, the YMCA, city government, a community bulletin board and the city 
recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Lakewood, a quiet bedroom community of 74,000, the path to the airwaves 
begins in a 15-hour production class held on five evenings in the city's 
community television studio. Brown, the food inspector, and 10 other students 
took the March class to learn how to operate cameras, soundboards and editing 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which is offered only at night, was an exercise in stamina for 
Brown, 36, who must rise at 3 a.m. for her job peering into bins of zucchini 
and radicchio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pittsburgh native considers herself a repressed stand-up comic. She was 
pigeonholed by her family as smart and level-headed, not creative or artistic. 
Then, in her 20s, she said, "I blossomed, but by that time I was working for 
the United States Department of Agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Still searching for a creative niche, she glanced through a list of classes 
offered through the city and noticed the video production course.  
</P>
<P>
 To graduate, Brown and her classmates served as the production team for a talk 
show, "Class Act." Brown ran one of the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Another camera was in the hands of Swearingen, 28, who owns a small 
housecleaning business and never pursued her dream of being an actress. She 
wants to be an on-camera narrator for education videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates of the class include Jeremy Turek, 16, a junior at Gahr High School 
in Cerritos. He has been producing shows for four years as part of a 
three-generation family act with his father, Albert, 38, and grandparents Al 
and Mary Turek. 
</P>
<P>
 Al, 72, and Mary, 71, sometimes spend several days a week at the Lakewood 
television studio producing "Swinging Seniors," which showcases their band and 
other musicians, and "Having Fun With a Pencil," a how-to art show. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy has decided he's ready for the big time: a regular network series. With 
friends and family members, he's producing a pilot for a children's adventure 
show set in the year 2055. The teen-age superheroes would use wits and song, 
but no violence, as they travel back in time to retrieve artifacts needed in 
their own futuristic, but strange and barren world. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to bizarre, 2055 has nothing on 1994 and "Flights into the 
Unknown," a show produced for public-access television in Long Beach by Joe 
Hovard, a retired elementary school principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The guests of host Jack P. Wetherell have included a proponent of radionics, a 
form of "positive voodoo." The idea of radionics is to take something from a 
person, such as a lock of hair or a fingernail clipping, and project healing 
energy over the object, Wetherell said. This energy would then benefit the 
person who donated the object. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetherell, 56, earns a living by preventing the buildup of mineral deposits in 
water cooling systems. He once published a technical paper, "Recent 
Developments in the Operation of Industrial Cooling Tower Systems with Zero 
Blowdown." 
</P>
<P>
 But he'd rather talk about his handmade, jewel-encrusted magic wand or his 
Tarot cards illustrated with photographs of chromosomes. He tells listeners how 
he went into hock to convert his home into a giant energy matrix that amplifies 
the positive energy of crystals. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees his entry into cable television as something of a mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Earth is entering a higher vibration," Wetherell said. "It may not 
seem so because of the dark that is coming out. But that dark is just the 
resistance. I want to contribute to an increase in knowledge of the universe to 
the mass consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's guests have included a channeler, an astrologer, a crystal dealer 
and a palm reader. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent taping, Hovard had ample help from volunteer camera operators 
and technicians such as Bob Bush, a retired singer and dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush has his own show but finds time to help other producers. And they assist 
him with "Bob's World," which usually features senior entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Community Television is a little like a social club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atheists work on the shows of the fundamentalists; the fundamentalists 
help with the shows of the atheists," said Lillian Avalos, the director of Long 
Beach Community Television. Every producer has a secret or not-so-secret 
ambition. Several aspire to careers in public or network television. Some want 
to save souls or share vital truths.  
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Benson's show, "The Story Lady," lets her fulfill a simple ambition: 
being a grandma. Her grown daughters have no children, so every Tuesday at 5 
p.m., the Long Beach herbal-remedy saleswoman hypothetically adopts an audience 
of television children.  
</P>
<P>
 She dons an old-fashioned wig and a matronly gown, and when the cameras roll, 
she starts reading children's books. Recordings of classical music play in the 
background.  
</P>
<P>
 The camera work is simple. Sometimes it's on Benson, sometimes on the page of 
the book, sometimes on studio props that accompany the story -- a toy plane, a 
stuffed animal, a Christmas ornament. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson never does more than one take, even when she misreads words. If a story 
is running long, she'll condense it on the fly, improvising her own tale to 
match the pictures on the pages as she turns them rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 She gets most of her props at garage sales and never spends more than $2. Her 
wig cost a buck. She sprayed it with touches of silver. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many viewers are actually watching all of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Wetherell, host of "Flights into the Unknown," concedes: "I don't watch TV at 
all. Once in a while I watch a football game." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have four people who watch my show, maybe seven," said Gloria 
McMillan, who produces a talk show in Long Beach. "There is no way to know." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor do politicians know how many constituents are watching televised city 
council meetings. But many, taking no chances, started paying more attention to 
their clothes and manners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became more conscious of what would look good on cable," Whittier 
Councilman Allan P. Zolnekoff said. "There were recommendations from our city 
staff on what we should wear. Cable exaggerates blues and colors and you have 
to watch out for plaids and checkers, or black-and-white busy patterns that 
make you look like a used-car salesman on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nerve-racking because we weren't just speaking to the five people in 
the audience and the press, but potentially thousands." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the councilman's constituents were not nearly so shy. The public 
hearing portions of meetings began to get longer about the time the video 
cameras arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really weird is that sometimes we'll take a break in the middle of a 
public hearing and when we resume the hearing, there will be more people than 
before waiting to talk," said Whittier councilwoman Helen McKenna-Rahder. "They 
saw us on television and rushed down to the meeting because they wanted to have 
their say." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hawaiian Gardens, a resident walked up to the camera operators before he 
started speaking and ordered them to videotape him only on his good side. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellflower Councilman Ken Cleveland recently proposed pulling the plug on 
televised council meetings until after the April municipal elections. He said 
he was tired of incumbents, their challengers and gadflies who play to the 
camera, make lengthy speeches and drag the council meetings out until 2 a.m. 
Cleveland's motion was voted down.  
</P>
<P>
 Grandstanding for the cameras often backfires, said Whittier's Zolnekoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems to work on TV is to get in and out and make your point. It tends 
to be tedious if a person goes on and on. And if you say something silly, it's 
not only going to be broadcast live, but it's going to be replayed three or 
four times." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in public-access television believe they have an underrated 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent noteworthy episodes of the Long Beach show "Graffiti" featured a 
Holocaust survivor discussing the movie "Schindler's List" and a contingent of 
skinheads talking about their beliefs, said Peter Anninos, a professional 
production assistant who helps produce many Long Beach-based shows. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the treatment of the skinhead issue was more serious than that offered 
by the network talk show "Geraldo," which degenerated into a fistfight 
involving the host, the skinheads and their critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have a lot of good things to say," Anninos said of the 
public-access producers. "They give their time and they give of themselves. And 
they do it with no compensation. Very often, they succeed in providing a 
valuable community service." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Brown, freshly graduated from her production training in Lakewood, 
figures she'll do a talk show that will include everything from movie reviews 
to advice on how to select the best fruits and vegetables.  
</P>
<P>
 But at present, she wouldn't even be able to see her own show. "I don't have 
cable," she said. "I have to run and get it now."

ENTERTAINMENT / RECORD REVIEW; SOMEBODY'S EX AVOIDS GETTING LABELED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 SOMEBODY'S EX 
</P>
<P>
 "Defective" 
</P>
<P>
 (no label)  
</P>
<P>
 This all-female Long Beach band takes pains not to get typecast as the new 
Go-Gos (although it can be effervescently garagey), the new Bangles (although 
it can be sleekly poppy) or the new L7 (although it can get momentarily grungy 
and sometimes likes to talk dirty). 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, while avoiding stylistic labels, Somebody's Ex neglects to 
bring much emotional depth or psychological insight to its work. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of "Defective" is well played and sung. Jill Warren writes the songs and 
has a good ear for mainstream pop melody. She also dabs on some nice guitar 
touches, acoustic as well as electric. Lisa Wright, who shares the lead vocals 
with Warren, has a dusky, full-bodied voice that powers the album's best songs: 
"It's Just the Moon," which echoes the chorus hook of the Rolling Stones' 
"Sway," and the lush "Through My Eyes," which could well have been overblown 
but is handled with admirable restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 While one can appreciate the band's skills, too many songs seem poorly thought 
out and lacking in complexity. A funkified version of Leon Russell's 
oft-covered "Superstar" is tossed off as bland dance-floor fodder. There is a 
coldly dismissive cast to "F. Defective," which dumps on a woman whose habitual 
nonconformity has degenerated into self-destruction. And there is little 
sympathy or understanding at hand in "Juliet," whose protagonist's strait-laced 
upbringing leaves her sexually repressed. The nadir comes with "(Sex) The Way 
it Goes," which tears a page from Erica Jong as it trumpets the frank 
expression of female lust. This sort of bluntly carnal talk is being heralded 
as a sign of new expressive freedom for women rockers (Liz Phair being Exhibit 
A), but I'll take a little indirection and artifice any day, regardless of the 
singer's gender. The great blues singers, for example, always deal in clever 
euphemism, because it is sexier and more fun than the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, the song blithely counsels unfaithfulness ("Forget your 
conscience, singe and burn it away") while offering no more motive for the 
betrayal than a quick assuagement of raging hormones. Maybe Warren just wanted 
to churn out something that would heat up a bar crowd; a songwriter attuned to 
the way sex really goes, with its complexities and high emotional stakes, would 
have intimated the potentially devastating consequences of heeding such a 
blatant come-on. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody's Ex might partly have redeemed the song by book-ending it 
immediately with "Pictures of You and Her," which depicts a woman wrung out by 
her lover's cheating ways. But five songs intervene between the two, so any 
chance for contrast and cross-current is lost. 
</P>
<P>

Beach, or through Somebody's Ex, 203 Argonne Ave., Suite 146, Long Beach, CA

 LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach State baseball team will try to bounce back from a 
disappointing start to its Big West Conference season when it plays host to New 
Mexico State in a three-game series starting tonight at Blair Field in Long 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will play single games at 7:05 tonight and Friday and 1:05 p.m. game 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which is ranked No. 10 in the nation by Collegiate Baseball 
magazine, is 19-7 and 1-2 in Big West play. The 49ers dropped two of three 
games to Nevada in its first conference series, including a 4-1 loss to the 
Wolfpack on Sunday in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers had won the first game of the series, 16-8, behind the batting of 
left fielder Jeff Liefer and shortstop Ryan Miller. They lost the second game, 
13-5. The 13 runs was the most Long Beach has given up this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The top pitcher for the 49ers has been sophomore Scott Rivette, who entered 
the Reno series with a 5-0 record and 1.27 earned-run average. But he gave up 
six earned runs in six innings against Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's offense has been led by designated hitter Jeff Tagliaferri, a 
freshman from Granada Hills Kennedy who is batting .407. Junior third baseman 
Nate Vopata is batting .342 and senior second baseman Eric Martins is at .338. 
</P>
<P>
 After the New Mexico State series, the 49ers will play host to Cal State 
Northridge in a nonconference game at 7:05 p.m. Tuesday at Blair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The struggling Long Beach State women's softball team will play Big West 
opponent San Jose State in a doubleheader at 4 p.m. today at Mayfair Park in 
Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (16-14, 3-5 in the Big West) is ranked No. 5, but lost three of 
four conference games to Hawaii last week and was 3-3 in nonconference games at 
the recent Capital Classic tournament in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman pitcher Amy Miner gave up only four hits in five innings to earn her 
first win, a 3-1 victory over host Sacramento State. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner's workload could increase with the announcement Monday that junior 
pitcher Rae Rice has quit the team for personal reasons. She led the team with 
an 8-3 record and had a 1.65 ERA and four shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach will play a Big West doubleheader against Pacific at 1 p.m. 
Saturday at Mayfair. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After a split of two matches in the Indiana-Purdue-Fort Wayne tournament last 
week, the 13th-ranked Long Beach State men's volleyball team will play host to 
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation rival San Diego State at 7:30 p.m. Friday at 
the Gold Mine gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (11-12) finished third in the tournament by defeating Ball State, 
15-9, 16-14, 10-15, 5-15 and 15-12. The 49ers were sparked by senior outside 
hitter Jonathan Cummings, who finished with 23 kills, 11 digs and two blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers opened the four-team tournament with a loss to Indiana-Purdue-Fort 
Wayne, 15-9, 16-14 and 15-9, despite strong play from Cummings and sophomore 
outside hitter Travis Barr. 
</P>
<P>
 The final home match for Long Beach is April 15 against Brigham Young. 
COMMUNITY COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the Fullerton tournament on Monday, the Long Beach City College 
women's softball team is in the midst of an eight-day break before it plays 
host to Pasadena in a South Coast Conference game at 3 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (31-5 and 6-1 in the South Coast) suffered a 3-1 road loss to 
Pasadena for their only conference setback March 22. Long Beach defeated Rancho 
Santiago, 2-0, in the title game of the Fullerton tournament as pitcher Lisa 
Balbirnie pitched a four-hitter. Another leader for the Vikings has been 
catcher Kim Young. PREPS 
</P>
<P>
 Five Southeast-Long Beach boys basketball players have been named to the 1994 
All-Southern Section Division III and IV basketball teams selected by the 
Amateur Athletic Foundation's All-Southern California Board of Athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the players are in Division IV, including senior forward Jason 
Reynolds and senior guard Albert Juarez from St. Paul. Reynolds, a first-team 
selection, averaged 15 points, and Juarez, a second-team pick, averaged 14 as 
the Swordsmen advanced to the Division IV-AA final and the state playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Tyler Ream of Whittier Christian, who averaged 15 points to 
lead his team to the Olympic League title, also made the Division IV first 
team. Troy Collins of Pius X, a 6-7 forward who is regarded as one of the top 
juniors in Southern California, made the second team. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Southeast-Long Beach player to make the Division III team was senior 
guard Doral Davon of Centennial. Davon, a first-team selection, averaged 16.2 
points to spark Centennial to the Pioneer League title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division I and II all-star teams will be announced Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The list of honors for St. John Bosco High boys' basketball standout Jelani 
Gardner continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner, a 6-foot-6 senior point guard who led the Braves to the Southern 
Section Division II-A championship, has been named to the Parade Magazine 
All-America team. Gardner, who averaged 26 points and 5.5 rebounds, made the 
second team. 
</P>
<P>
 He had already been selected to the 1994 McDonald's All-America basketball 
team and will play in its 17th annual all-star game Sunday at St. John's 
University in New York. Gardner has been recruited by NCAA powers Arkansas, 
UCLA and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Southland player to make the squad was fourth-team selection 
Ricky Price of Gardena Serra, who had played for St. Anthony the previous 
season. MISCELLANY

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY /BENITA'S FRITES: A NEW HOT POTATO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody foresaw the long-range ramifications when NATO, the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, moved its headquarters to Brussels, Belgium, in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 We're not talking military or political consequences. We're talking frites 
(pronounced freets ), or as they are known in this country, French fries. And 
we're talking about right here in Long Beach, where Belgian-style French fries 
are being served at Benita's Frites. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow closely. When NATO made the move, Hughes Aircraft transferred system 
analyst Dan Halliday to the lovely Belgian capital. There, his 8-year-old son, 
Matt, fell in love with the French fries. (They might with more justice be 
called Belgian fries. They originated in Belgium but became known as French 
fries, says Matt, because the potatoes are "Frenched," that is, cut into strips 
lengthwise).  
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, with frites still on his mind, Matt, now 30, opened Benita's 
Frites in Santa Monica. Named after his sister, Benita's was such a success 
that Halliday was able to open a second restaurant last year near the Pine 
Court's movie theaters in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The potatoes are fried twice: once to cook them through, and once again to 
crisp them. Then there is a vast array of dipping sauces, including andalouse 
(mayonnaise with grilled bell peppers, fresh garlic, tomatoes, and a touch of 
sugar), purple mayo (mayonnaise fresh opal basil and garlic) and even a warm 
peanut-based Indonesian satay sauce. The house sauce is a spicy ketchup with 
cayenne, malt vinegar, oregano, garlic and curry powder. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to frites ($1.95), Benita's offers sandwiches from Jody Maroni's 
Sausage Kingdom, the Venice Beach landmark. Two big sellers are the hot Italian 
sausage sandwich and the Yucatan, which is made with duck, chicken, cilantro, 
Serrano chile, and beer ($3.50 each). 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Management of the AMC theater allows moviegoers to bring in their own 
snacks . . . including frites.  
</P>
<P>
 Benita's Frites is at 245 Pine Ave., Long Beach; (310) 437-7329. Open Sunday 
and Monday 11:30 a.m. to 9 p.m., Tuesday through Thursday 11:30 a.m. to 10 
p.m., and Friday and Saturday 11:30 a.m. to midnight. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

FIREARMS: GUN SHOW AT CITY PARK IS PROMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found it shocking and absolutely mind-boggling, while driving along South 
Street, to see a banner promoting a gun show at the Artesia Park (city-owned 
public grounds). 
</P>
<P>
 When crime is so rampant, is it responsible government to issue a permit for 
such an event on the city of Artesia property? Shall this be considered a 
family outing? Shall we bring our children and grandchildren? What is the 
purpose of holding a gun show in a public park where families congregate? 
</P>
<P>
 If the Lions Club wants to sponsor a gun show let them do it wherever they 
meet. I'm not saying gun shows promote crime, but having a gun show in a public 
park, on busy South Street, is giving out the wrong message. As citizens of 
this great country, I feel it is everyone's duty to do all that they can to 
discourage anything and any event that might send a misinterpreted signal to 
the criminally intentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 A far more appropriate event for the citizens of Artesia would be for the city 
and the Lions Club to celebrate the rite of spring.

COMPANIES FIND RENAMING GAME CHANCY, COSTLY; IMAGE: SEVERAL O.C. FIRMS HAVE 
RECENTLY ALTERED THEIR LOGOS OUT OF NECESSITY OR AS A MARKETING STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grey Orange County did it for the same reason that a teen-ager might pierce 
her ear or dye his hair purple: to declare independence from its parent. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeClub did it because it was no longer a club. Fluorocarbon wanted to do it 
to disassociate itself from the pollutant with a similar name. And Carpets R Us 
made the switch after Toys R Us sued for trademark infringement. 
</P>
<P>
 Either out of necessity or as a marketing strategy, a corporation occasionally 
changes its name. Just three months into this year, several Orange County 
businesses have already rewritten their logos. Grey Advertising in Huntington 
Beach has become G2 Advertising. Heavenly Slender Sweets in Anaheim replaced 
the last third of its name with the more general "Food" after expanding its 
line of low-fat snacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And just this morning CMS Enhancements Inc., a computer component distributor 
in Irvine, officially switched its name to AmeriQuest Technologies Inc. -- 
reflecting its plan to conquer its American competitors. When the market 
opened, company shares began trading under a new ticker symbol on the New York 
Stock Exchange -- AQS. 
</P>
<P>
 Name changes can be costly, though. HomeBase Inc. in Irvine said it spent $3.4 
million two years ago to sound more inclusive. "It was quite an investment -- 
changing our signage and everything from the letterhead to business cards," 
said Carol Elfstrom, spokeswoman for the chain of home improvement stores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a change that had to happen, she said. In 1991, HomeClub stopped 
selling discount cards to its members. "It was confusing to customers that we 
called ourselves a club when we had no members," Elfstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The name change itself, however, was equally confusing to customers until they 
got used to it. "We put a lot of effort into promoting our new name," Elfstrom 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the hurdles and expense, name changes should not be executed on a whim, 
said Jack Potter, president of Irvine-based J. Brooks Potter Marketing, which 
specializes in marketing research for companies seeking image enhancement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing a name willy-nilly is dangerous," he said. "Your name is your source 
of identity; it throws people off if you tinker with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a name change cannot be avoided -- such as when Carpets R Us gave 
into the legal demands of Toys R Us and switched its name to Carpets 4 U. The 
Anaheim carpet warehouse had used its original logo for nine years before the 
toy store giant complained in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost maybe 15% of our clientele," said Linda Lamb, vice president of 
Carpets 4 U. "People who can no longer find Carpets R Us in the phone book 
assume we went out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 The change cost the company an additional $10,000 in new signs and stationery. 
And the new name isn't even one Lamb particularly likes, she said: "We just 
wanted something as similar to our old name as possible to make the transition 
easier; but if we were starting from scratch, we wouldn't have chosen 'Carpets 
4 U.' " 
</P>
<P>
 G2 Advertising executives, on the other hand, take delight in the Huntington 
Beach agency's new moniker. Until January, the firm was named after its parent 
-- Grey Advertising in New York City. Let's face it -- Grey Orange County 
sounded funny. What's a grey orange? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the principal reason the local branch renamed itself was "to connote 
independence and modernity," said Ed Hannibal, creative director for G2 
Advertising. Originally, the branch opened here strictly to serve one of Grey's 
biggest clients, Mitsubishi Motor Sales of America in Cypress. The Orange 
County office now plans to expand its client base, so it wanted a name with 
"panache," Hannibal said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fresh beginning, a new face," he said. "It was quite an undertaking to 
get everyone to agree on a name, but we all liked G2" -- inspired by the name 
for U.S. military intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vitro International, which makes solutions to test cosmetics and other 
household products for toxicity, also changed its name to establish a separate 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Until two years ago, the Irvine company was named Ropak Laboratories in honor 
of its major investor and its distributor, Ropak Corp. in Fullerton. But when 
Ropak Lab bought the rights to market its product from Ropak Corp. and went 
public two years ago, the similar names were merely perplexing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropak Corp., which makes shipping materials, is also a publicly held company 
-- creating "confusion in the stock market," said William Curtis, corporate 
secretary for In Vitro. "Also, 'In Vitro' better reflects what the company 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more famous name changes for an Orange County company happened five 
years ago, when Fluorocarbon Inc. -- unrelated to but burdened by negative 
publicity surrounding chlorofluorocarbons, the pollutants threatening the ozone 
layer -- switched to Furon Co. The Laguna Niguel company, which makes 
industrial plastics, launched a worldwide contest in which it offered 100 
shares of stock -- now worth $1,675 -- to the person who hit upon the winning 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 More traditionally, companies use outside marketing firms to help discover the 
perfect new name. The main goal, said Potter, is to come up with something that 
stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 "A name should plug into people's imagination," he said. "It should separate 
you from the pack."

BRIEFCASE: RETAIL AND RESTAURANTS; IF RALPHS REALLY IS FOR SALE, FOOD 4 LESS IS 
READY TO GO SHOPPING

 Rumors persist that Ralphs Grocery Co. is for sale -- and that Food 4 Less in 
La Habra is interested in buying the Compton-based company. But Food 4 Less 
spokesman Darius Anderson said there have been no discussions between the 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we'd be interested," Anderson said. "They're a great company and 
have tremendous management. But we've had no discussions. We don't even know 
that they're for sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate developer Edward J. DeBartolo, who acquired a 60.3% stake in the 
Ralphs Grocery chain since 1992, reportedly is interested in selling his stake. 
DeBartolo of Youngstown, Ohio, and several other investors acquired the chain 
from Ralph's parent company, Federated Department Stores, which filed for 
bankruptcy protection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs was never technically part of the bankruptcy filings, but Ralphs was 
dogged by questions about its financial stability because its parent company 
was troubled. The dark cloud disappeared when DeBartolo's group took control, 
but rumors have been circulating in the grocery industry about a possible sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Food 4 Less, a privately held company, owns the Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva 
chains.

HAPPY CAMPERS GET IN LINE TO BUY NEW HOMES; REAL ESTATE: IS IT STILL A BUYER'S

 In a flashback to the 1980s, when people lined up overnight or even for days 
to bid on scarce new homes going up for sale in Orange County, potential buyers 
are again camping out. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gatherings of homeowner hopefuls during the first quarter were the first 
since 1990, according to the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm in 
Newport Beach. Among Southern California counties, Orange is the only one so 
far in which the phenomenon has reappeared, the consulting firm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This shows there is getting to be some excitement among consumers, and they 
are wanting to get back into the market," said Steve Johnson, a partner with 
the consulting group. "We think they were propelled . . . by an increase in 
mortgage rates, and they want to lock up something now."

lots in Phase 1 sold out in two hours on Jan. 15 after some buyers waited six 
days in campers, said Rick Hernandez, sales agent for the project. The 
development, by Dallas-based builder Centex Homes, quickly sold out its first 
and second phases. Some people arrived several days in advance of sales for the 
third phase, Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the good old days. It's like 1984 all over again," Hernandez said. 
"Everyone is really surprised at first when they see people camping out because 
they still think it's a buyer's market. But one guy waited in his camper 12 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 The project includes one- and two-story homes with four bedrooms. The 
1,937-square-foot houses are priced as low as $235,990 and have an East Coast 
flavor.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've gotten away from the Spanish look," Hernandez said. The new homes are 
"more traditional looking, with brick." 
</P>
<P>
 The Meyers Group also found potential buyers camped out in March at the latest 
phase of six lots at the El Encanto project in Marbrisa, also in San Clemente. 
It, too, is being developed by Centex. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely high interest in certain lots," said Don Mitchell, sales 
representative for Centex. "When we opened our doors on the day of the sale, we 
had five people who had waited all night. It caught us by surprise. I guess it 
signals that our homes are priced right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean-style, four- and five-bedroom houses start as low as 
$276,990. They range in size from 2,519 square feet to 3,286 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are assuming that housing is as low as it's going to go in Orange 
County," Johnson said. "Orange County was starved for an affordable product for 
so long, and that's what people are going for now." 
</P>
<P>
 A luxury condominium project called Altezza in Newport Coast had a lottery on 
March 19 to sell its first phase of 18 units. More than 200 people showed up to 
bid for 18 homes, said Jeff Golden, sales manager for the project, which is 
being built by Taylor-Woodrow Homes California Ltd. of Newport Beach. The 
development is already sold out at prices that go above $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County home sales through mid-March were up 35% from the same quarter 
last year. And inventory -- the number of homes under construction and lots 
being readied for development -- also increased slightly, according to The 
Meyers Group. At least 19 new projects opened during the latest quarter, and 
the majority of existing projects opened new phases, the consulting firm found. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is usually a seasonal uptick in supply during the first quarter," 
Johnson said. "It's the nature of the industry to pre-build in the first 
quarter."

BRIEFLY: INJUNCTION AGAINST DEFUNCT FIRM WON'T AFFECT 2ND COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has determined that an injunction against Turcal Inc., a 
defunct Fountain Valley telemarketing company, does not apply to Resort Condo 
Marketing Inc., lawyers in the case said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge A. Wallace Tashima in Los Angeles clarified in court that 
the La Jolla company is not a defendant in the fraud lawsuit brought against 
Turcal by the Federal Trade Commission, lawyers for the FTC and Resort Condo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue was complicated because Resort Condo was an agent for Turcal in 
1992, and the FTC had sued Turcal as a company doing business under three 
names, including that of Resort Condo Marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Resort Condo is a separate company that is still operating. The FTC closed 
Turcal earlier this month.

BERGEN TO PURCHASE SUPPLIER; TRANSACTION: THE ORANGE-BASED DRUG WHOLESALER 
STILL NEEDS U.S. APPROVAL TO BUY PROVIDER OF HOSPITAL SUPPLIES.

 Bergen Brunswig Corp., the nation's second-largest drug wholesaler, said 
Wednesday that it has signed an agreement to buy a North Carolina provider of 
hospital supplies for about $19 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it expects to close the cash-and-stock deal for Southeastern 
Hospital Supply Corp. in about 30 days.The purchase, however, requires approval 
by federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Dimick, Bergen Brunswig's chief financial officer, said the purchase 
should increase the Orange-based drug supplier's annual revenue by about $100 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen Brunswig had revenue of $6.8 billion in its most recent fiscal year, 
which ended last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Southeastern, founded in 1947, has distribution centers in Fayetteville, 
Greenville, N.C., and Richmond, Va. Its operations would be folded into Bergen 
Brunswig's Durr Medical subsidiary. That subsidiary was formed in September, 
1992, when Bergen Brunswig purchased Durr-Fillauer Medical Inc. in Alabama for 
$470 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed addition to Bergen's Durr Medical subsidiary would broaden the 
subsidiary's presence in the Southeast, one of two U.S. regions where the 
medical industry is growing fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergen Brunswig stock closed Wednesday at $16.125 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange, down 37.5 cents a share from Tuesday.

has struck deals to sell its light wands at shops in Disneyland and Universal 
Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 It took more than a year for the company to sell Disney buyers on the 
relatively inexpensive toys that use a proprietary technology that mimics the 
light-carrying ability of fiber optics. "Part of the problem is that we went 
through three buyers at Disneyland," Shemke said. "The other problem was that 
(as a small company) we weren't timely in responding to some of their 
requests."

BOARD OF TRADE WILL DEAL IN TRASH; ENVIRONMENT: MARKET WILL ADDRESS RECYCLING 
PROBLEMS BY ADDING PLASTIC, GLASS GARBAGE TO ITS LIST OF COMMODITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. KALISH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chicago Board of Trade is out to prove that one person's trash is 
another's gold. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's biggest commodity market -- where wheat, corn, oats and other 
goods are traded daily -- said Wednesday that it will add recyclable plastic 
and glass garbage by late this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is designed to address some profound problems in efforts to recycle 
garbage rather than bury or burn it. For example, many communities have 
abandoned plastic recycling because they can't find enough buyers to make it 
cost-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Chicago Board of Trade's free-market approach, communities, states, 
waste haulers and other trash sellers will be able to enter information about 
their available recyclables into on-line computers. Included could be specifics 
such as trash color and transportation mode used to deliver the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Once or twice a day, potential buyers would be able to use their computers to 
check out what's for sale. These customers range from glass container 
manufacturers to polyester makers who use plastic soda bottles as raw material. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the trading will involve only commonly recycled trash such as soda 
bottles and milk and juice jugs, but it could be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is providing a one-stop shopping opportunity for buyers and sellers to 
communicate, to really get a sense of the breadth and depth of the product," 
said Will Ferretti, director of the New York State office of recycling market 
development and a developer of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange of detailed information on trash could help address some common 
recycling woes. For example, presorted trash could attract buyers who can't mix 
clear and colored glass, or different types of plastic, in making new products 
of recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential benefit under the system is the availability of arbitration 
to enforce contracts between buyer and seller. Ferretti said that buyers of 
recycled materials routinely reject trash they intended to purchase because it 
fails to meet their specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Chicago Board of Trade inspectors will be available to inspect 
goods for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic trading system is a far cry from the raucous floor activity 
that routinely occurs in the trading pits of the Chicago Board of Trade for 
more widely traded commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers of the trash trading system hope to eventually consider 
trading futures contracts on recyclable materials. Like other such contracts, 
trash futures would represent commitments to buy or sell goods at a specific 
point in the future for a predetermined price. That could open the market to 
speculators in waste materials. 
</P>
<P>
 The waste exchange is the latest attempt by the Chicago Board of Trade to turn 
pollution into a commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board ran its second annual auction of rights to pollute the 
environment as part of a sulfur dioxide-reduction program administered by the 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an auction, companies whose plants pollute less than federal standards 
allow can sell their remaining "rights to pollute" to those whose emissions 
exceed the standards.

DO MUTUAL FUND FEES HAVE TO BE SO HIGH? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a time when mutual funds are facing increased scrutiny from many 
directions, there is one longstanding criticism: They cost too much. 
</P>
<P>
 Before even considering this indictment, we can stipulate that the fund 
business is a bona fide success story with a well-designed product and hordes 
of satisfied customers. 
</P>
<P>
 All these positives notwithstanding, the argument persists that fund 
investors, as a group, pay more than they ought to in fees -- sales fees, 
redemption fees, management fees, administrative fees, account fees, 12b-1 
fees, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 As competition intensifies in the industry, with more than 4,500 funds 
currently on the market, most of those fees have remained stubbornly high. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigness, to the tune of better than $2 trillion under management, also has 
failed to deliver on the promise of economies of scale. 
</P>
<P>
 In his book "Bogle on Mutual Funds," John Bogle, chairman of the Vanguard 
Group of Investment Cos., notes that expenses as a percentage of assets at the 
average stock mutual fund more than doubled from 0.7% in 1961 to 1.5% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This increase occurred as stock-fund assets swelled to nearly 20 times their 
former size, from less than $25 billion to more than $460 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the clear financial impact of expenses on mutual fund performance, 
along with the exponential growth of industry assets, we might expect that fund 
expense ratios would have declined over the years," Bogle says. "However, the 
reverse has proved true." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are witnessing," he adds a couple of paragraphs later, "is not only 
the failure of managers to share economies of scale with fund shareholders but 
also their penchant to increase costs to fund investors at an even faster rate 
than fund asset growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the specific case of 12b-1 fees, which are charges deducted from the 
assets of a fund annually to "pay for distribution costs such as advertising or 
for commissions paid to brokers," in the definition of the Investment Company 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, the worst abuses imposed on mutual fund shareholders during 
the last decade have been 12b-1 charges," declares Norman Fosback, editor of a 
group of financial advisory letters, in his book "Mutual Fund Buyer's Guide 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly half of all funds now impose these egregious charges. The total cost 
to all fund shareholders now exceeds $2 billion a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether such fees are "fair" is debatable. More to the point economically, 
fund advisers are able to collect their fees because investors don't object to 
paying them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund groups' own surveys repeatedly show investors are far more concerned with 
investment performance than with how much they are charged in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most expenses are deducted straight from the funds themselves, the 
people who pay them never have to sit down and write a check or count out 
dollars and cents from their pockets. It's a sort of painless extraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, will investors' attitudes toward fees and expenses remain as benign 
when the market climate turns less favorable, making it tougher for funds to 
show generous performance results?

NEW MAGAZINES TARGET TEENS, COLLEGE STUDENTS; PERIODICALS: THEY STILL CARRY THE

 Hot flash! Totally cool new mags. They're, like, for young people -- ya' know 
-- kids, teens and college students. And, big surprise, they tell you how to 
flirt, look absolutely the best and know who's hot and who's not. 
</P>
<P>
 They also take some serious looks at major issues -- really. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like teen-speak? Several new magazines are attempting not only to sound 
and look like today's teens but to address many of the pressing issues young 
adults face. 
</P>
<P>
 Teens have always had their own ways of speaking, dressing and exploring their 
identities. And the more than 28 million Americans 12 to 19 spend nearly $90 
billion a year, thus the large attraction of magazines aimed at that age group. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three new magazines aimed at teens -- Quake, Mouth 2 Mouth and Tell -- have 
joined the increasingly competitive teen magazine market. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen, owned by K-III Communications Corp., leads the female teen magazine 
market with a circulation of about 1.85 million. YM, formerly known as Young 
and Modern, also for girls, has boomed in past years and has a monthly 
circulation of 1.8 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 But publishers believe there are an awful lot of teen readers yet to tap and 
many teen dollars yet to be spent on magazines and the products they advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few, if any, magazines that target teen-age boys, save sports or 
music fan magazines. Sports Illustrated, one of the nation's largest magazines 
in terms of circulation, has a large teen readership. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest teen magazines try to appeal to both boys and girls, almost as a 
way of demystifying gender differences that often make the teen years so 
difficult, publishers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In other differences, some older readers, used to the fashion-oriented 
magazines of their teen years, may be surprised at the frank discussions of 
sexuality and family relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouth 2 Mouth, which previewed in mid-March, is celebrity driven -- calling 
itself "a general-interest magazine for a new generation of teen-agers weaned 
on MTV and careening toward the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Published by Time Inc. Ventures, Mouth 2 Mouth plans to cover sports, fashion, 
technology, blockbuster movies -- all the latest stuff for male and female 
readers, its publishers say. 
</P>
<P>
 While high on the hip scale, Mouth 2 Mouth plans some highbrow stuff, too, 
such as an ideal English class syllabus by Thomas Harris, author of "Silence of 
the Lambs." 
</P>
<P>
 The premiere issue also has a first-person narrative by Amy Fisher, from the 
prison cell where she's serving time for shooting the wife of the man she 
contends was her ex-boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Its second issue is due in August. Each issue sells for $2.50 at newsstands. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake, aimed at 13- to 19-year-olds but which seems to have mid-teen girls in 
mind, is devoted to fashion, trends, entertainment, media and youth style in 
general. 
</P>
<P>
 April's edition probes such issues as what to wear to the prom, how to get 
great legs, the dish on chewing gum and a deep, probing (not!) interview with 
Evan Dando, singer with the band, Lemonheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Published by Cowles Magazines and Welsh Publishing Group, Quake plans to put 
out six magazines a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The April issue sells for $1.95 in the United States, $2.50 in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell, which began as a quarterly last September and hopes eventually to go 
monthly, is aimed at girls but hopes boys, too, will decide to read the 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While it has the line of features on fashion, dating and sexuality, The second 
issue also contains more serious articles on two sons who killed their father 
and on young inner-city actors and the real-life troubles they face. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for possibly the first time in a teen magazine, Tell has an article by an 
overweight teen, who says, "Losing ain't everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Published by Hachette Magazines and NBC television, Tell has a cover price of 
$1.95 and an initial newsstand circulation of 500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The premier issue of Link, for college students, hit campus mailboxes in 
March. It features student news, lifestyle and entertainment in an interactive 
format. Readers can access information through an on-line computer service, the 
publishers say.

NOW'S THE TIME TO LET CDS ROLL WITH MARKET PUNCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 About $100 billion worth of certificates of deposit will mature in April, the 
most popular month for CD investing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is money that has stayed at the bank despite all the calls exhorting it 
to move to higher-yielding bond, stock and mutual fund investing. Perhaps now 
is a good time to just roll it over and keep it there. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some other possibilities for CD savers now making this decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ladder maturities. If we're in for a long, slow move upward in interest 
rates, it's not the time to lock up all of your money. CD savers can minimize 
their interest rate risk by spreading the maturities of their CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 A good plan involves having your money divided among four certificates that 
come due at six-month intervals over a two-year period. If you currently have 
all your money coming due, divide it into four CDs with maturities of six 
months, one year, 18 months and 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as each comes due, roll it over for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cash is no longer trash, says Robert Brown, chief economist of Ferris Baker 
Watts and a bear's bear. What he means is stock and bond returns both are 
likely to come down and interest rates likely to keep moving up. 
</P>
<P>
 If he's right, the best place to keep that money might be in a boring, 
3%-paying (if you're lucky) money market mutual fund or FDIC-insured money 
market deposit account. 
</P>
<P>
 Money there is totally liquid and ready for you to invest longer term when 
conditions warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look long term and dabble in investing. If you still have all of your money 
tied up at the bank, consider putting a toe in mutual fund waters, with funds 
you won't need for five years. Even with experts predicting a riskier market, 
long-term returns in stocks and bonds will always beat the bank. Look for funds 
that have very low betas -- a measure of volatility -- and reinvest all of your 
dividends.  
</P>
<P>
 * Buy Treasury bills. They're super safe, tend to pay a fraction better than 
bank certificates, and pay interest that is free of state and local income 
taxes. Again, watch your maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for stocks that pay you to hold them, but that aren't overly 
interest-rate dependent. That means for the time being avoid the big dividend 
stocks like utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Spitz, portfolio manager for Prudential Securities Equity Income Fund, 
says those companies that do well in the growth part of economic cycles -- such 
as chemicals, insurance, natural gas -- will do well. Pick those that have a 
strong dividend-paying history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for funds in a new category: Ultra-short maturity funds come between 
money market funds and short-term bond funds, according to Lipper Analytical 
Services.

LAGUNA MUSEUM QUIET ON REASONS FOR DESMARAIS FIRING; INSTITUTIONS: OFFICIALS 
DECLINE TO ELABORATE ON AN ACTION THAT SOME IN THE SOUTHLAND ARTS COMMUNITY 
FIND SURPRISING AND DISTURBING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Laguna Art Museum officials declined Wednesday to elaborate on their reasons 
for dismissing director Charles Desmarais, while other members of the 
California arts community continued to express surprise and concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais "helped take a museum that essentially was an adjunct to an art 
colony and gave it national standing and a national reputation," said Andy 
Grundberg, director of the Friends of Photography Ansel Adams Center in San 
Francisco. "I don't know the situation there administratively or in terms of 
management, but I do know as a museum director it's always shocking to see 
something handled publicly in a way that reflects badly both on the institution 
and the people charged with insuring its viability." 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais' dismissal Tuesday came amid calls from board president Teri Kennady 
for "more energy to be put in administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Desmarais responded that he would "dispute any statement that somehow I was 
doing exhibitions and not running the museum. I've never, ever set aside my 
responsibility for (any) aspect of the museum." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, museum staff members said they had been instructed not to 
discuss the subject with the press and therefore could not say whether the 
museum's finances have improved or suffered during Desmarais' tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Desmarais asserted that its deficit had shrunk from $450,000 in 1988 to 
$118,000 this year. (The total operating budget at the end of the last fiscal 
year was $1.7 million, he said.) 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that National Endowment for the Arts grants received under his 
directorship totaled more than $500,000 and that $1.8 million in gifts and 
pledges had been added to the museum's endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennady said Wednesday it's true that Desmarais made financial gains as well 
as artistic ones by bringing in critically acclaimed and popular exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a good job," she said, "but the board just needed some other avenues 
covered . . . which I'd rather not discuss." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really see a great future for the museum, and we want to continue to grow 
and we need to really focus on internal stability of the museum, and how to 
make our plans happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Joan B. Rehnborg, a staunch supporter of Desmarais, has resigned as 
a museum trustee, though it is unclear if her resignation is a result of the 
dismissal. She did not return calls Wednesday, and the museum would not comment 
on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former trustee Mary Newman, whose term expired in September, said she was 
outraged. Describing Desmarais as "an excellent director," she said, "There's 
no excuse for this kind of highhanded, arbitrary" dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is concerned that the sudden nature of the dismissal "will make 
it extremely hard to get another director who will want to take the risk of 
being treated the same way." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stuart Spence, a collector from South Pasadena who serves on the museum's 
advisory board and is a major donor, said: "As Laguna has grown over these five 
years, there has been a feeling that there needs to be much more emphasis on 
the business, the long-range funding. It did seem (Desmarais) was much more 
interested in curating his shows than in raising funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the local arts community, Naida Osline, cultural services 
supervisor for the city of Huntington Beach, characterized Desmarais' departure 
as "a big loss." Under his six years of leadership, she said, the museum had 
become "more energetic and more interesting, and he was more in touch (than his 
predecessors) with the contemporary arts dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 David Emmes, producing artistic director of South Coast Repertory in Costa 
Mesa, said: "Desmarais moved the Laguna Art Museum forward, and under his 
leadership, it seemed to take on a new vitality." Desmarais "was very committed 
to serving" the local scene at large, Emmes added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilene Segalove, a prominent artist from Los Angeles -- whose first solo museum 
exhibition anywhere was curated at the Laguna by Desmarais in 1990 -- praised 
his artistic vision and his ability to relate to artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "He continued to pull out the stops in innovative curating," she said. "And he 
could wear his suit and look very official and go to board meetings -- and then 
hang with the rest of us, which is rare for museum directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no allegiance except to doing real high quality work." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, director Michael Botwinick of the Newport Harbor Art Museum, Orange 
County's other prominent visual arts institution, said that he was "deeply 
surprised by the news" of Desmarais' dismissal and that he thinks Desmarais 
"has done an extraordinary job." Exhibitions staged under Desmarais have 
"brought the museum great steps forward," Botwinick said, measuring the 
museum's growth as extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna board president Kennady agreed that Desmarais "has been a visionary 
director for this museum and has enhanced its reputation tremendously. But this 
is a new time, and he and the museum have different needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Desmarais, the museum mounted several acclaimed exhibits including 
"Kustom Kulture," a car show last summer that was one of the most popular 
exhibits in the institution's 75-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kustom Kulture" and other Laguna exhibits traveled to other museums around 
the country, helping to shape an improved profile for the Laguna museum, which 
only a few years ago had a reputation for far more mainstream exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining the Laguna museum in 1988, Desmarais, a 44-year-old New York 
native, was director of the California Museum of Photography in Riverside for 
seven years. Before that, he was a curator at the Friends of Photography in 
Carmel and director of Chicago's Museum of Contemporary Photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's curator of exhibitions, Susan M. Anderson, has been appointed 
acting director, and a search committee has been formed to replace Desmarais, 
Kennady said.

SOLSONICS ASCEND WITH THE REIGN OF ACID JAZZ; POP MUSIC: THE L.A. GROUP'S 
APPEAL LIES IN A BLEND OF TRADITIONAL AND MODERN STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 According to Jez Colin, there's a revolution under way in jazz and pop music. 
The bassist with the Los Angeles-based Solsonics says that young people are 
getting into acid jazz -- an amalgam of funk, hip-hop and more traditional jazz 
sounds. Colin further thinks that the sub-genre is poised to become a 
legitimate link in the evolutionary chain of jazz, along with bop, cool, swing 
and Dixieland. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a movement going on, whether you call it acid jazz or 
street jazz or soul jazz or hip-hop jazz," the London-bred Colin said in a 
recent phone interview from his home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came back from Virgin Megastore, where we were No. 12 on their 
(in-store sales) chart. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's very cool for me, to be right up there with Soundgarden, Us Three, 
Tori Amos and Crash Test Dummies. Obviously, there's an audience out there 
that's buying this music."  
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member group, which performs tonight at the Coach House, is among a new 
wave of jazz acts that embrace various styles of yesteryear while adding what 
they view as the best elements of modern music. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the title of the L.A.-based group's debut album, "Jazz in the 
Present Tense," something of a misnomer. While rap, hip-hop and reggae are 
integral to the Solsonics' very eclectic sound, the overriding impression it 
creates is of a return to the stylings of such '70s jazz and funk hit-makers as 
Grover Washington, the Average White Band, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and, 
especially, War. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, while sounding fresh and inspired in parts, is also awash with such 
'70s hallmarks as wah-wah guitar rhythms, deep funk grooves and keyboard 
programs that evoke electric piano. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a deliberate attempt at being retro," said Colin, 30. "What we 
have done is deliberately not include any modern keyboard or drum sounds. We 
don't have that slick, produced R & B sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. flavor is definitely there; we're very much influenced by the Latin 
sounds of Los Angeles. War was a fantastic band, which was very much associated 
with L.A. Their sound included soul, R & B and a very heavy Latin influence. So 
yes, there's definitely a War influence on the group." 
</P>
<P>
 The members of the Solsonics are as varied as the music they make. An 
international, interracial and gender group whose ages range from 19 to 31 
years old, they grew up with disparate music1634476130burgeoning, if curiously 
named, acid-jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The group, together for just two years, was signed directly to a major label 
(Chrysalis Records) without first having to pay its dues on an independent 
label -- a fact that Colin is proud of. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, Colin is something of a crusader for the music he believes in, determined 
to expose young people to not only his own group, but the jazz men of years 
gone by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jazz has been around a long time, but what happened in the '70s and '80s is 
that jazz kind of turned into a four-letter word," he said. "One of the reasons 
that happened is because people would influence the production of the music 
purely for the way it sounded. That's the way fusion developed, and it became a 
very self-indulgent form of music. It wasn't very soulful. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this music is doing, and even some hip-hop acts are doing, is bringing 
jazz back to the forefront. It's making jazz a cool thing again, whereas for 
the longest time, jazz had lost it's acceptance with youth. But it's become hip 
to be into jazz again -- that whole sensibility, that whole West Coast-cool 
thing. It's becoming a desirable fashion statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of records by, like Horace Silver, Art Blakey, Herbie Hancock and 
Quincy Jones, have been sampled (on computer by hip-hop acts) over the last few 
years. That exposes it to a younger generation that really hasn't heard it 
before. Things go in cycles, and what I think we're seeing right now is a 
return to good, live music that's organic and can be re-created live, onstage, 
without sequencers or anything like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Colin is also pleased that the Solsonics' efforts have received support from 
some of the groups' heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Herbie Hancock came down and played with the band last New Year's Eve," he 
recalled. "Poncho Sanchez has played with the band. Verdine White from Earth, 
Wind & Fire came down and sat in one time. . . . So nobody's turning their back 
on us." 
</P>

POP BEAT / BUDDY SEIGAL: FINALLY IN THE RIGHT PLACE, THE RIGHT TIME; DR. JOHN, 
WHO ADMITS 'OH MAN, I HAD PROBLEMS,' IS ON A TEAR WITH SUPERB NEW ALBUM 
</P>

 For more than 25 years, he's been the Big Chief of Gris-Gris Gumbo, the High 
Priest of Hoodoo, the Loop Garoo Shaman of New Orleans jazz, blues and fonk . 
He's Mac Rebennack, better known as Dr. John, the Night Tripper, one of the 
finest purveyors of Crescent City music tradition alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The master singer-songwriter-pianist-showman, who performs Friday at the Coach 
House, could and should enjoy a banner year in 1994, with a superb new album 
and a mud-funky autobiography just released, and consecutive Grammy awards for 
his previous two albums. 
</P>
<P>
 A very youthful 52, the good Doctor is on a tear, with the new "Television" 
album and its 1992 predecessor, "Going Back to New Orleans,"among the two 
finest of his long and fruitfulcareer. All the more remarkable given that 
Rebennack admits he was a heavy drug abuser for close to four decades and was 
written off as a washed-up junkie just a few short years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A professional musician since age 15, Rebennack learned his craft at the feet 
of many of New Orleans' legendary masters.  
</P>
<P>
 By the early '60s, Rebennack continued his studio work while developing the 
Dr. John persona, a character that sifted voodoo, Mardi Gras madness and other 
aspects of New Orleans culture together with a psychedelic sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his 1968 debut with "Gris-Gris," Dr. John/Rebennack has recorded more 
than a dozen albums on his own and guested on countless others. His commercial 
success peaked in 1973 with his "In the Right Place" album, which yielded two 
hit singles: "Right Place, Wrong Time" and "Such a Night." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rebennack acknowledges wasting too many subsequent years in a drug-induced 
void. In a recent phone interview, Rebennack asserted that chapter of his life 
is now closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh man, I had problems -- mostly with the drugs," he said in that raspy, 
one-of-a-kind voice. His speech is a curious mix of Creole patois, hepcat jive 
talk and black dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 But if his grammar was often twisted, Rebennack's message came through loud 
and clear. "The most important thing I learned over the years is, hey man, it's 
cool. You can lose sight of anything if your priorities is out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta be in order, all in order, and I was out of order a lot of the 
time. I can accept that now. I messed up. But hey -- today I ain't. Hopefully, 
we can talk to these youngsters and say, 'Hey -- you don't have to be no 
crackhead or dope fiend. You can do this. You are the only one holding it 
together.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a beautiful family that's been real supportive of me no matter what, 
and now I can appreciate it," he said. "That's more important than money or any 
of that other stuff. When you're rippin' and runnin' and dippin' and dodgin', 
you don't get a chance to appreciate what you got." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebennack proved he'd come back all the way with the career reaffirming "Goin' 
Back to New Orleans" album -- the first he had recorded in his hometown, in 
which he's backed by many of his mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lovingly traditional effort that Rebennack has followed with 
"Television" (MCA/GRP), a driving collection of dynamic funk originals and a 
pair of classic covers that plays like the other side of the N'awlins coin. 
</P>
<P>
 "New Orleans music is all about the fonk, and I try to give a little fonk in 
different areas and styles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling "In the Right Place" in its deep grooves, punchy horn charts, layers 
of soulful background vocals and crisp songwriting and production, "Television" 
plays yin to "Goin' Back's" yang, both in capturing Rebennack's essential New 
Orleans vibe and in its overall excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time in a long time that I've been able to do a record I 
wanted to do the way I wanted to do it," he said. "I wanted to make an overall 
picture of what I picture fonk being. I feel real happy with it, doing Sly's 
tune" -- referring to his rendition of Sly & the Family Stone's No. 1 hit from 
1970, "Thank You Falletin Me Be Mice Elf Again" -- "putting it back in the 
game. that's always important to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was real happy to write some tunes -- like that 'Television' song -- 
that speak to me. Most of it's stuff that's fresh in my head. That's what 
music's about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music, man, is like an environmental thing," he continued, "and I've been 
trying to keep the environment around me in a good place, and it's improved the 
way I look at a lot of things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a distorted view of life anyway, full of opinions, but that's OK, 
because some of them is facts. But if you keep good people around you, good 
things happen -- surround yourself with lames, and something lame is gonna 
happen. So I feel real blessed to be around some good cats." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the estimable cast of guests on "Television" are saxophonists David 
(Fathead) Newman and Alvin (Red) Tyler, trumpeter Randy Brecker and, 
interestingly, Red Hot Chili Peppers front man Anthony Kiedis, who performs a 
duet with Rebennack on "Shut D Fonk Up." Rebennack said working with Kiedis was 
one of the highlights of recording the album. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being a fan of the Chili Peppers, Rebennack listens to and 
enjoys a lot of modern artists, and said he draws inspiration from many of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I be hanging out and checking what my kids listen to, and I hear a lot of 
different stuff every day. . . . Gloria Estefan is doing this real Afro-Cuban 
thing; I'm digging Terrence Blanchard's 'Malcolm X' thing. There's so much out 
there that's happening that's real hip. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But you also gotta tip your hat to the cats that set things up," he added. 
"Like in jazz, maybe it's Bird and Diz and maybe it's the Trane," referring to 
Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and John Coltrane. "In another area, maybe 
cats'll tip to Jimi Hendrix. You gotta go back in the game and look where 
everything came from, 'cause it's an ongoing process." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Going back many years himself, Rebennack's recently released autobiography, 
"Under a Hoodoo Moon" (St. Martin's Press), is a fascinating and gritty account 
of a lifetime in the music biz. A first-person narrative relayed in Rebennack's 
colorful speech pattern and slang, he credits ghostwriter Jack Rummel for the 
book's authentic flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out of rehab and the psych ward and started talking to him about four 
years ago," he recalled. "He talked to me and various other cats, and while we 
ran our mouths, he taped everything. He was able to keep the New Orleans-ese 
and musician-ese intact." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his key goals in doing the book, he said "was hoping that somebody else 
might learn from my mistakes, like, 'You ain't got to do it this stupid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rebennack now seems determined to make up for some of his misspent past. 
Emerging from the dark years, he's found a new chance -- and new acceptance of 
his work in the process. Redemption never sounded so sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the cats told me -- I don't remember which one -- 'The reason we doing 
all right is just the fact that we survived,' " he said. "And that's the 
truth."

 Professor Longhair, pianist: "I think every one of us -- whether it was Huey 
Smith, Allen Toussaint, James Booker or me -- every piano player had his own 
version of playing Professor Longhair. That's how much he meant to all the 
cats. We all owe a deeper debt to his style of playing than to anyone else. The 
calypso, the mambo, the rhumba, the New Orleans fonk parade rhythms and 
everything else, he opened that door more than anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Allen, saxophonist; played on Fats Domino's records and numerous other R&B 
hits of the '50s: "If Lee had money for every hit record he played a sax solo 
on, he'd be a multibillionaire. And I really believe that a lot of those 
records would not have been hits had it not been for Lee Allen's solos." 
</P>
<P>
 Earl King, guitarist: "Earl, even though he started off as a Guitar Slim 
clone, became a writer of songs that had a tremendous impact of a lot of things 
that happened. I think a lot of the Motown records that came out had a lot of 
Earl King-isms in 'em; James Brown records that came out had Earl King-isms in 
'em. As a writer, as a guitar player, as a soul unique and off-the-wall, a lot 
of things came out of what he contributed, and what he still contributes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huey (Piano) Smith: "To me, Huey was the essential down-home songwriter, piano 
player and a guy that could put a vocal group together to make a special kind 
of show. I think Huey (Piano) Smith and the Clowns might have opened the door 
for the Coasters, the Cadillacs and a lot of groups at that time, as far as 
being funny. I look at him akin to Chuck Berry, but this thing was always 
straight-up, down-home New Orleans fonk." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Barker, banjo player and guitarist; died this month: "Here's a man that 
schooled almost all of the young brass band players and kids coming up in a 
major way. He gave all he had to the thing. Him always being there for the 
young cats and old-timers alike made him real, real, special." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Toussaint, composer/producer of "Mother-in-Law," "Workin' in a Coal 
Mine" and dozens of other hits: "Allen is the one cat that kept the recording 
scene alive in New Orleans as a writer, as a producer and as a musician. He 
started the New Orleans production thing and opened a lot of doors for the Lee 
Dorseys, the Irma Thomases, the Benny Spellmans, the Ernie K-Does, the Jessie 
Hills. I don't think a lot of those records would have made it had it not been 
for Allen's kindness and his expertise."

PLANNERS TAKING A FAMILIAR PATH; DEVELOPMENT: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA'S TOWN 
CENTER, A 'CONCENTRATED VERSION' OF THE COMMUNITY, WILL BE COMPLETED IN PHASES 
THROUGH THE YEAR 2000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California was starting to look good from the coffee shop where Cezar 
Griu, a Romanian immigrant, was sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Griu, 33, sipped from his plastic foam cup, then grinned and waved at a 
familiar face in the newly built Plaza Antonio retail center. In other places, 
Californians seem cold, nobody smiles much, he remarked, "but here, it feels 
more like home in Romania, where neighbors are all your friends." 
</P>
<P>
 A modest collection of Early California-style courtyards, shops and 
restaurants, Plaza Antonio is only the first glimpse of the community's future 
town center. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita Co. planners say Town Center -- a roughly pie-shaped 250-acre 
plot -- will be completed in phases through the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Just call it Hometown, U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerstones of urban life will be represented -- school, library, 
shopping, affordable housing, entertainment, parks -- and all will be woven 
together by two main walking paths. 
</P>
<P>
 Its heart and soul will be Central Plaza, a small amphitheater and park 
complex near the middle of the main pedestrian promenade. Here is where the 
road will be blocked off for street fairs, art festivals and "all types of 
community events," said Donald E. Moe, company senior vice president. "It will 
be somewhat European-style, people walking around, sitting at outside tables. 
Many special events will take place." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza Antonio is ready to anchor one end of Town Center's "Main Street," 
officially named El Paseo. Currently under construction is a Target discount 
department store that will anchor the other end of El Paseo. 
</P>
<P>
 Also finished in Town Center is a high-tech middle school and the first 50 
housing units of 2,500 planned in the center. Work is underway on a 
16,500-square-foot library and a health club. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a hometown atmosphere by revitalizing an existing town center or 
building one from the ground up is hard, urban planners say. Locating open 
space in crowded Southern California isn't easy, and neither is finding 
construction funds in an economically depressed state. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to develop a unified concept such as Town Center is made possible 
because the entire 5,000-acre community is owned by the O'Neill/Moiso family 
and their development firm, the Santa Margarita Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Company planners had a blank canvas in front of them when they sat down to map 
out the community in 1983 with the help of county officials. The first plans 
were drawn up in a rather non-traditional manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with county planners in a South County park, "after about 10 beers, we 
threw some butcher paper on a picnic table and asked them what they wanted to 
see on the land," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 What developed was the working concept of Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Town Center is a very concentrated version of what we are doing with the 
whole community," said Steven Kellenberg, a design consultant hired by the 
Santa Margarita Co. "We don't just want this to be a town, we want it to be a 
hometown. Town Center might be the most important part."  
</P>
<P>
 Balancing the growth of Town Center businesses with the number of residents 
that must exist to support commerce is one of the biggest challenges facing 
company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 With a current population of nearly 21,000, Rancho Santa Margarita is growing 
but remains somewhat isolated in its location beneath the Saddleback Mountains 
east of San Juan Capistrano and Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make sure we're big enough to support our businesses economically, 
but small enough so that people still know each other," Moe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushing his infant daughter in a stroller near the plaza's bell tower, Jim 
Irons, 38, said he can't wait to see the project finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be everything I've missed about my hometown since I moved to 
California," said Irons, who moved from a Philadelphia suburb to Orange County 
five years ago. "When this Town Center is done, everything will be here -- 
schools, shopping, restaurants. I can see myself not getting in a car for a 
month."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS & VIEWS; TERMINAL TEENS; YOU KNOW THAT OLD JOKE ABOUT

WHOLE NEW WAY TO TAP THE INFORMATION HIGHWAY FROM HOME.

Westminster High School and a frequent computer user. He is on Chips+ as Richie

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the growing number of computers and the services they provide, teens are 
finding new ways to "talk." They are getting together with people they've never 
met to instantly trade information and find out what's going on from Arizona to 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Communicating by modem -- transmitting messages and other information over 
phone lines from one computer to another -- gets you an acknowledgment and a 
reply in a single step. Among computer users, the postal mail system is 
referred to as "snail mail." Electronic mail, or E-mail, is instantaneous.  
</P>
<P>
 If your computer has a modem, you can "talk" with other computer users and, 
with a few keystrokes, tap into large data bases for up-to-date information. 
You can also send your own work to another computer instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four major commercial on-line services: America Online, CompuServe, 
GEnie and Prodigy. These and other services specialize in certain features, 
such as electronic bulletin boards, interactive games, news reports, magazine 
articles, stock quotes and more. ImagiNation, for example, is a commercial 
service featuring on-line, multiplayer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to these and other services costs money -- to subscribe and in monthly 
connection fees. But they open doors to new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 These new worlds are represented through bulletin boards, and teens are making 
use of a wide variety of them. There are thousands of bulletin boards providing 
millions of files for downloading and conferences -- or forums -- on various 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 It's estimated that half the homes in the United States have a computer. About 
4.5 million subscribers are connected to commercial services, and 4 million to 
8 million computer users dial up local, non-commercial bulletin board systems 
-- or BBSs. About one in 10 of those users is a teen-ager, according to 
Boardwatch magazine, a national publication for BBS users. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a computer but not a modem, now is the time to get one: Prices 
have dropped unbelievably, so that a top-of-the-line modem is about $100 at 
outlets such as Fry's and Micro Center. Be sure to get one with a speed of 
14,400 or greater, because that is becoming the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you connect it to your computer, you can dial out and get in touch not 
only with information, but with other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how some of the systems work: Prodigy 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy has a reputation for being user friendly and offers a selection of 
information features such as News, Weather and Encyclopedia. It emphasizes user 
communication through message topics and offers file downloading services 
through a feature called Ziffnet. The main bulletin board is sub-divided into 
several smaller ones including Teen, Arts, TV, Music and Video Games. 
</P>
<P>
 These mini-bulletin boards have their own sections, subjects and bulletins. 
For example, to get to the College topics, you would first go to the Teen 
Bulletin Board and then choose the topic "College." You would then see the 
bulletins relating to college such as "HARVARD IS EASY." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, you could go to the TV section and message some personalities, 
including Patrick Stewart and Jay Leno, because the stars frequently answer 
mail there. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy also has a private mailing system, in which you could send E-mail 
directly to the person's "mailbox."  
</P>
<P>
 The company offers a Value Plan for $14.95 per month, which includes 30 
personal private messages, all the basic services and two hours of Plus 
features. The Plus features include using the bulletin boards. If you exceed 
the allotted use, you'll be charged $3.60 per hour. The person who will be 
responsible for paying the bill must be over 18. To join, call (800) 776-3449. 
ImagiNation 
</P>
<P>
 ImagiNation, formerly The Sierra Network, by Sierra On-Line, is one of my 
favorites. It has a user base of 40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 You can chat real-time with other users as opposed to leaving mail. It's also 
one of the most intuitive, because you can actually see the other person's 
portrait (and design your own). 
</P>
<P>
 ImagiNation is mainly game-oriented, and it does games well. You can invite 
someone to Mini Golf and take turns as if you were playing on the green. You 
can play Red Baron, a flight simulator, and shoot down the other person in a 
dogfight. You can have others join you in the dungeons of a role-playing game. 
Of course, there are chess, checkers and your standard card games. 
</P>
<P>
 ImagiNation is a great way to make friends because of the graphically fun 
setup. After inviting someone you don't know to a friendly game of checkers, 
chances are that you'll discuss something in common and will soon be friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course that someone may be many states away, but not to worry, it's a local 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 The start-up kit is $5.95; the monthly charge in $9.95. For use over five 
hours, the cost is $3.50 per hour. To join, call (800) 462-4461. (You can also 
get access to ImagiNation through a Prodigy service called Gamepoint, which 
costs $3.60 per hour or a monthly rate of $22.95.) GEnie 
</P>
<P>
 The General Electric Network for Information Exchange Service is more for the 
person who wants access to vast databases of information. 
</P>
<P>
 GEnie offers full text from more than 900 publications, including newspapers 
and periodicals. It is not for the casual user because of the high cost of 
searching for information through the databases. GEnie carries many forums, but 
its mail service, GE Mail, is difficult to master.  
</P>
<P>
 If you have to do research and want 400,000 people to discuss it with, then 
GEnie is worth the cost. The monthly charge is $8.95. Usage over four hours 
incurs an additional charge, which varies with the time of connection. Internet 
</P>
<P>
 If you're interested in a more global experience, then Internet is for you. It 
is a loose connection of computers at thousands of sites around the world where 
users can share information and files. It is like a really big network without 
a central authority. Originally intended for research and academic communities, 
people now join the Internet to search for data and meet other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does it contain current usable information, but it also has 
discussion groups and can reach many universities. It also has Usenet News, the 
equivalent of bulletin boards. The problem is that thousands of messages are 
posted every day, and it's tough to just keep up. The Internet is a global 
network that gives E-mail connections all over the world.  
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, GEnie, Delphi and America Online all offer Internet access. The 
cheapest rate for Internet access is at $2 an hour plus a $3 monthly surcharge 
by Delphi. 
</P>
<P>
 To join America Online, call (800) 827-6364. 
</P>
<P>
 To join CompuServe, call (800) 848-8199. 
</P>
<P>
 To join Delphi, call (800) 695-4005. Chips+ 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer, you can access friends and communicate locally. One of the 
largest bulletin board systems in the Orange County area is the Chips+ 
Connection. This BBS has several lines to dial in on. It carries more then 600 
conferences on topics from Art to Virtual Reality; there is even one on Pets. 
</P>
<P>
 One to check out would be Teen Issues -- conference No. 671 -- which is 
reserved for teens to chat about anything and everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the local BBSs are not as big as the commercial services, they can 
still "echo" mail back and forth, so eventually you can reach someone as far as 
the conference goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local BBSs are free, thanks to the contributions of users and the efforts 
of the BBS system operator. Eventually local BBSs will offer Internet access, 
opening up a whole new avenue. You can reach CHIPS+ at (714) 556-3208 by modem. 
</P>
<P>
 So . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Communicating by modem is entertaining and fun. Sometimes it's an easier place 
to chat than finding words to say over the phone. It's a great place to make 
new friends who share some of the same interests you do. If you're really 
lucky, you might even meet that special someone and fall in love at first byte 
:-).

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: OH, TO BE A MEDFLY ON THE WALL WHEN THOSE CALLERS SWARM 
THE FEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE FLY: For a homeowner, they're almost as bad as termites. Mediterranean 
fruit flies recently were spotted by Lawndale residents, who then swarmed 
federal officials with questions: Will I have to worry about malathion spraying 
in the coming weeks? Do I need to destroy the apricots in my back yard? Will I 
start finding maggots in my apples?  
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, the feds were releasing the flies -- and they make no secret 
of it.  
</P>
<P>
 Every week, 430 million sterile male Medflies are released throughout the Los 
Angeles Basin in an effort to eradicate the crop-destroying bugs, said Larry 
Hawkins, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. But because the 
department releases so many flies, it doesn't notify residents beforehand, 
Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department asks alarmed callers a series of questions to determine whether 
the insect is sterile or fertile.  
</P>
<P>
 "In most cases, it's one of ours," Hawkins said. So far, no fertile flies have 
been found in the South Bay this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Sterilized flies, which pose no danger to fruit, help cut down the Medfly 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see a sterile fly try and lay some eggs," Hawkins said. "It would 
defy the laws of biology as we know it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 SNAKE SITE: Flies may not be a problem in the South Bay, but snakes are. 
</P>
<P>
 Palos Verdes Peninsula residents have been warned to look out for rattlesnakes 
after several were seen recently by Southern California Edison crews working in 
Rolling Hills. City officials say warm weather is to blame for the early 
appearance of the snakes, which usually are seen only during summer. The snakes 
are brown with a diamond-shaped pattern on their backs, a small triangular head 
and, of course, a rattling tail. They average 3 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who see a rattlesnake should leave it alone or contact authorities 
if it needs to be removed, Rolling Hills City Clerk Craig Nealis said. People 
should call 911 if someone is bitten. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't step on one," said Bob Ballenger, executive assistant with the Los 
Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control. "Generally speaking, 
their bites are not fatal to adults, but they are very painful." 
</P>
<P>

 AD ALARM: It sounds ominous: A McDonnell Douglas Corp. advertisement in 
Saturday's Times advised residents who live near its Torrance-area plant and 
three others in Southern California that they are exposed to substances known 
to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harm. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not a startling revelation. The defense and aerospace giant has been 
running the ad every three months for three years to comply with Proposition 
65, which requires firms to publicly disclose harmful chemical emissions. The 
company gets about 20 to 30 letters each time it runs the ad, said spokesman 
David Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay plant, at Normandie Avenue and 190th Street, emits chrome used 
in the metal plating of aircraft parts, he said. Not for much longer, though. 
The plant is due to close by the end of the year and will become a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 WHEELS OF FORTUNE: Just think of it: "El Segundo, Toy Capital of the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The city once was best known for its aerospace firms, but lately toy-making 
giant Mattel has put it on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 The company was the only South Bay firm included in Fortune 500's list of the 
nation's largest industrial companies, due to be published in April. Home to 
Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel ranked 174th, with $2.7 billion in sales, up from 
230th last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mattel should do even better once it completes its merger with Kransco, a 
San Francisco company that makes the Hula Hoop and Frisbee. The acquisition, 
announced this week, is expected to put Mattel ahead of Hasbro as the largest 
U.S. toy maker (Hasbro placed 169th with $2.75 billion in sales). 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, an El Segundo-based aerospace company made it to the top 50. 
But Rockwell International, which ranked 45th this year, moved its corporate 
offices to Seal Beach. QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants first-class services . . . They want the city to look like 
Disneyland. But the federal government is not giving any money to the states, 
the states aren't giving any money to the counties and the counties aren't 
giving any money to the cities."

INSTRUMENT DESIGNER FINE-TUNES TALENTS TO MAKE BEAUTIFUL MUSIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance resident Antonio Rizzo, who once made instruments for spacecraft, has 
turned his talent to making instruments for classical musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo started making violins after he retired from his job as a mechanical and 
design engineer at TRW six years ago.One of his first customers was classical 
musician Troy Googins, whose uncle worked with Rizzo at TRW. Googins bought two 
of Rizzo's hand-crafted violins while visiting Torrance from his home in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo will hear one of his instruments played when Googins performs in a 
benefit concert in Torrance on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rizzo has made 19 instruments, including cellos and violas, and is building 
five more. They sell for $1,000 to $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had made a classical guitar before retiring, but I am kind of self-taught," 
Rizzo said. In recent years his violins have won prizes for tone and clarity 
from the national Violin Makers' Assn. based in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Googins, born in the United States to a Japanese mother and German father, has 
lived in Japan for seven years and is a member of the Orchestra Ensemble 
Kanazawa. On Friday, he will perform in a duo called "Rayon de Soleil." 
</P>
<P>
 The other half of Rayon De Soleil is pianist Akiko Inoue, who has played since 
she was 3. Inoue studied in Germany and Italy before returning to Japan, where 
she performs solo recitals and chamber concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will feature works by Mozart, Beethoven and Prokofiev. The single 
performance will be at 8 p.m. in the James R. Armstrong Theatre, 3330 Civic 
Center Drive. Tickets are $8 to $12. Information: (310) 781-7171. 
</P>
<P>
 The musicians will donate half of the proceeds from the concert to earthquake 
victims. MARY GUTHRIE

 After the Northridge earthquake turned the soil under a King Harbor Marina 
parking lot to car-swallowing, goopy muck, some Redondo Beach residents gazed 
across Harbor Drive at the Southern California Edison electrical generating 
plant and wondered if a bigger earthquake might cause the plant to collapse -- 
with catastrophic results for surrounding residents and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This week a delegation of Edison representatives appeared before the city 
Environmental and Public Utilities Commission to provide information on 
earthquake risk assessment at the generating plant. The Edison representatives' 
conclusion: 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 Probably. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a worst-case scenario . . . we believe any problems would be confined to 
the plant itself and not pose a danger to the community," generating station 
manager Jerry Berquist told the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A major concern centers on "liquefaction," the phenomenon in which loose, wet 
soil can suddenly turn into a jelly-like substance when subjected to the 
violent shaking of an earthquake. In the Jan. 17 quake, Redondo Beach, although 
28 miles from the epicenter, suffered at least $2.5 million in damage at King 
Harbor Marina when a parking lot built on a sandy spit collapsed, and about a 
dozen parked cars sank six feet into a mucky chasm. The collapse was attributed 
to liquefaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Ostrom, an Edison engineer and earthquake specialist, told the 
commission that while the plant rests atop soil that could be subject to 
liquefaction, it is supported by pilings driven 30 to 50 feet into the ground, 
below the potential liquefaction area. By contrast, the earthquake-damaged 
marina area was slabs of asphalt and concrete supported only by the underlying 
soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrom said before the meeting that he was not aware of any liquefaction under 
the plant as a result of the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plants have been exposed to earthquakes in the past," Ostrom told the 
commission. "They've been exposed to liquefaction. So far there has been no 
consequence of liquefaction. . . . Certainly there has been no danger to people 
outside the facility." 
</P>
<P>
 Ostrom added that generating plants "are known for being low-risk facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone was convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Tom O'Leary, who makes no secret of his opposition to having the 
power plant in Redondo Beach, earthquakes or no earthquakes, said the Edison 
representatives were basing their assurances on faulty assumptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened up to now has no bearing on what could happen in the 
future," O'Leary said. "We have facing us the danger of stronger earthquakes."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison representatives said the nearest known major fault line, the 
Newport-Inglewood Fault, lies about 2.5 miles away, O'Leary said the Northridge 
earthquake showed earthquakes can occur in areas where scientists never 
expected them. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary and other commission members wanted to know what would happen if a 
huge earthquake, say an 8.0, occurred near the plant. Would natural gas or 
electrical fires erupt? Underground ammonia tanks burst? Power lines collapse? 
</P>
<P>
 Liquefaction could occur under the plant with a nearby 7.5 quake, the Edison 
representatives said, and there could be fires and pipe ruptures. But again, 
Berquist insisted, any danger would be confined to the plant site. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cal Ed guys' presentation was incomplete and unconvincing," O'Leary said 
after the meeting. "All they said was, 'As far as we can tell, everything will 
be all right.' "  
</P>
<P>
 "A power plant is a very dangerous industrial application," said Redondo Beach 
resident John Dancy, a retired aerospace engineer who attended the meeting. 
"You got the feeling (from the Edison presentation) that everything is flying 
on automatic pilot, that they just hope and pray nothing will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Leary said an informal group of citizens intends to analyze the Edison 
presentation and may have more questions.

TRAINING PUPPIES FOR A CAREER OF AIDING OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With tails held high, the puppies in kelly-green jackets lunge at one another 
to sniff, wag and wrestle, dragging their handlers along. 
</P>
<P>
 As they wait for a bus, they jump and pant and tug at their leashes like any 
eager adolescent, but these are not just everyday hounds. Dodger, Limbo and 
Trotter may be young, even in dog years, but they are already in training to be 
guide dogs for blind people. 
</P>
<P>
 Their handlers are members of the South Bay puppy raisers' group that met last 
week on a Torrance street corner to give their dogs a chance to get used to 
buses. The dogs practiced getting on and off a bus lent to the group by 
Torrance Transit, and learned to lie down at their masters' feet. But mainly 
they learned not to be afraid of things rolling under the seats, the hissing of 
the doors or the smells of previous riders. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year Guide Dogs for the Blind, a private, nonprofit corporation, places 
about 600 German shepherd, and golden and Labrador retriever puppies in homes 
across the country to be nurtured and begin training.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers receive the puppies when they are 8 weeks old and return them when 
they are a year to 18 months old to the Guide Dogs center in the Northern 
California town of San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 15 South Bay puppy raisers is Betsy Topper, who works with Limbo, a 
10-month-old cream-colored golden retriever. On a recent outing to the local 
farmers' market, Limbo sniffed around, getting distracted by food on the ground 
when he was supposed to be heeling and watching where he was walking, Topper 
said. She kept working with him until he settled down.  
</P>
<P>
 She has no trouble getting Limbo into grocery stores. In her neighborhood, 
store employees were already used to guide dogs because customer Mary Alice 
Smith shops there regularly with the help of Jikaiah, a 3-year-old black 
Labrador. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has used five guide dogs in the 23 years since she lost her sight 
because of glaucoma.  
</P>
<P>
 Her previous dog was a "conservative, Republican gentleman," she said. But 
Jikaiah is a "teen-ager in a dog suit." 
</P>
<P>
 But she trusts him completely. "You wouldn't leave your house if you didn't 
trust your dog," she said. Smith credits the puppy raisers with making the 
difference in a guide dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who raised him -- that's the important part," Smith said. "It's 
like a child's first few years." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15% of the puppy raisers are adults, but most of them, like Lisa 
Alvarez, 13, and her sister Talia, 11, come from 4-H clubs. Lisa is raising a 
golden retriever and Talia has a German shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa decided she wanted to raise one of the dogs after she saw a puppy at the 
beach wearing the trademark green jacket that reads, "Guide Dog in Training," 
said the girls' mother, Joanie Alvarez. Lisa and Talia took classes to learn 
how to care for the puppies.  
</P>
<P>
 The children's creativity helps in raising the dogs, Joanie Alvarez said. 
Showing the animals a windup toy, for example, helps them get over their fear 
of strange things. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 4-H club member, Marie Ellis, 13, is raising her second dog. Keith, 
her first puppy, is in training in San Rafael. Filbert, her current puppy, is a 
little more tentative than Keith, she said, but raising the second dog seems 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better when you have some more experience," Marie said. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay puppy raisers and their dogs get together twice a month. Usually 
one meeting is devoted to obedience training and talking about dog raising. The 
other is an outing. Once they went to the airport and walked around on a jet. 
Another day they visited Santa Monica Pier. At Christmas, they go to a mall and 
get their pictures taken with Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 The touring helps the dogs build confidence toward the day when a human will 
rely on their help to navigate in all kinds of places. 
</P>
<P>
 Guide Dogs pays for the dogs' shots and veterinary costs, but officials 
estimate that it costs the volunteer family $300 to $500 for food and 
incidentals. The cost of breeding, raising and training the dogs, training the 
blind person, and then maintaining the dog during its lifetime is about 
$34,000. The blind person is not charged for the dog or services. 
</P>
<P>
 When dogs return to the Guide Dog center, they receive about five months of 
intensive training before being matched with a blind person. Then the two of 
them spend four weeks training together. 
</P>
<P>
 The puppy raiser is invited to the graduation to meet the dog's new master.  
</P>
<P>
 Topper's first puppy, Bounder, graduated and is working as a guide dog. But 
recently Topper had to return to the center to pick up Snyder, the second guide 
dog she raised: Snyder was disqualified because of repeated ear infections. 
</P>
<P>
 As happy as she was to see him again, Topper had mixed feelings about taking 
him back. "We work so hard at it -- we really want them to graduate."

SUIT FILED OVER SADDLE CLUB'S DISPOSAL OF HORSE MANURE; LAND USE: THE FORMER 
OWNER OF A 28-ACRE PARCEL IN ROLLING HILLS ESTATES WANTS THE CLUB TO REMOVE THE 
WASTE. THE PROPERTY NOW BELONGS TO A NATURE PRESERVE.

<P>
 Horse manure studded with barbed wire was dumped on a neighbor's property in 
Rolling Hills Estates over a span of several years and accumulated into a 
50-foot-tall pile, according to a suit filed in Torrance Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chandler Land Trust is asking the court to force the Empty Saddle Club to 
remove the waste, which it says rests on land the trust recently sold for a 
nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the club disposed of manure in a small canyon on its property. In 
early 1990, the manure spontaneously exploded, prompting the club to smother 
the manure with dirt to avoid further fires. 
</P>
<P>
 All the activity alerted the owners of the trust, which had land on Buckskin 
Lane adjacent to saddle club property. Since the suit was filed, the trust sold 
its 28-acre parcel of open land to the Palos Verdes Peninsula Land Conservancy 
and the city of Rolling Hills Estates for use as a nature preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial photographs showed that the saddle club had filled its canyon and built 
stables on the new ground, and had continued to dump waste on the Chandler 
parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 "They filled the canyon in on their property and when they got to the end, 
they didn't stop. They just kept on coming," said John Robertson Jr., one of 
the heirs to the Chandler trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson and city officials said a series of negotiations took place in an 
attempt to get the property cleaned up.  
</P>
<P>
 When no agreement could be reached, the Chandler trustee, Farmers and 
Merchants Trust Company of Long Beach, sued the club. The case is expected to 
go to trial June 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the club and its attorney, Robert Luty, declined to comment on the 
case.  
</P>
<P>
 The trustee's attorney, Herb Young, said a lawsuit was a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pending for a couple of years. We've asked them to remove the 
debris and manure which is on the boundary. They've refused," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've refused access to their property so we can do soil borings and 
measure the depth of this manure and debris and the extent to which it would 
have to be removed. The Empty Saddle Club has basically stonewalled about doing 
anything about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills Estates Mayor Barbara Rauch said the city wants to remain a 
neutral mediator and does not want to see the club, a nonprofit group that has 
operated in the area for 50 years, hurt. But the city wants the matter 
resolved, since it is now part owner of the land preserve.

DONATED TIME LETS LIBRARY ADD A DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrons of the Lomita Library were up in arms about cutbacks. Now, some of 
them are getting down to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program started this month, six volunteers are working regular 
schedules to perform some of the library's most basic tasks. The Lomita branch 
is the first county-run library to try the program, which has allowed it to 
stay open three days a week instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting books back on the shelves may not seem like a big deal," said Linda 
Shimane, library manager in Lomita. "But having volunteers do some of this work 
has allowed us to add an extra day of service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteers, most of them retired, shelve books, organize magazine racks 
and examine materials for damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county has long used volunteers for such duties, library 
officials said the Lomita program is the first in which volunteers follow a 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers donating their time must sign an agreement committing them to a fixed 
number of hours, generally four or five a week. In addition, city officials 
must agree to recruit enough volunteers to keep the library open for a third 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big responsibility to recruit people to work on a regular basis," said 
Sandra Reuben, the county's head librarian. "It can be hard to find someone 
who's willing to put in the time every week." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, Reuben said, the county pays for the extra time spent by 
librarians and other workers on the third day the library is open. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne and Bellflower have expressed interest in bringing the 
program to their cities, Reuben said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, budget problems may bring an end to the program before many libraries 
have a chance to adopt it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, county officials said they may temporarily close up to 49 of the 
county's 87 libraries because of a potential $9-million shortfall. The closures 
could come as early as July. Small libraries, such as the branch in Lomita, 
will probably be the first victims, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lomita is borderline because of its location and its size," Reuben said. 
"It's not nearly as large as the library in Carson, which is about six miles 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to talk about what will happen in July," said volunteer Kathe 
Hull, a homemaker. "This program has been going wonderfully. It's been a real 
boon to this community to have the library open an extra day. But it will go 
for nothing if the library closes." 
</P>
<P>
 The fear that Lomita might lose its library has prompted some council members 
and candidates in April's election to suggest buying it from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some have said such proposals overlook the advantages of belonging to 
a county system that gives them access to more than 5 million books. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the real bonus to the way it is now with the county system," Mayor 
Charles Belba said. "We haven't done a study on taking over the library. When 
it gets down to hard-core discussion, we have to look at where the money would 
come from." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plan to save the library is tied to the city's movement to secede from 
the Los Angeles Unified School District. If the city forms its own school 
district, it might be able to pay for an independent library with education 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "But those are a lot of ifs, " said Barbara Learnard, vice president of the 
Friends of Lomita Library.

TOPICS; BUSINESS: SOFTWARE FIRM FILES LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Torrance-based software publisher Image Smith Inc. has filed suit against two 
former senior executives, claiming they took the company's trade secrets and 
sabotaged licensing agreements to boost the fortunes of their own software 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Image Smith says James R. Myrick, former vice president of 
marketing, and John D. Myrick, former vice president of operations, left in 
November and used confidential technical and marketing data at their new 
software company, Big Top Productions, in San Francisco.The suit, filed in San 
Francisco Superior Court last week, seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Van Cleef, a spokeswoman for Big Top, said the Myrick brothers "disagree 
with the whole content of the suit and are prepared to fight it." She declined 
to comment further. The brothers are still Image Smith shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Image Smith, which publishes educational software including Yearn 2 Learn, has 
been trying to line up agreements to license cartoon characters for its 
products. The company alleges that the Myricks persuaded Determined 
Productions, owners of the Felix the Cat character, to try to cancel a 
licensing agreement with Image Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 In another instance, the suit claims the Myricks prompted Sanrio Inc. to break 
off negotiations with Image Smith to license the cartoon figure Hello Kitty. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also says Image Smith lost out on potential sales because the Myricks 
delayed the release of a Peanuts version of Yearn 2 Learn past the December 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We regret being forced to file the lawsuit, and we had hoped to be able to 
resolve the issues without litigation," said Dominique Claessens, a spokeswoman 
for Image Smith. TED JOHNSON

for the park at a meeting tonight.  
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairman Frank O'Brien said the report details what needs to be done to 
improve and preserve the park and will be presented to dozens of officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly wide-ranging document, including history (and) detailed 
discussion of areas in the park," O'Brien said. "It's also a set of proposals 
with budgets -- short-, medium-, and long-term." 
</P>
<P>
 The 230-acre park contains recreational facilities, including a golf course, 
and the largest freshwater wetland and riparian woodland in Los Angeles County.

TOPICS / HISTORY; GARDENA'S HOMAGE TO STRAWBERRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a developer of Strawberry Square shopping center, Bruce Kaji was naturally 
interested in the city's special relationship with the strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 Delving into historical files, Kaji learned that the strawberry played a 
significant role in Gardena's roots. Strawberry farmers prospered in the area 
during the early 1900s, shipping their red, juicy wares daily to Los Angeles 
during berry season by Pacific Electric red cars, according to historical 
records and photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The area where Strawberry Square now stands was referred to as "Strawberry 
Park" before Gardena incorporated in 1930, and residents held two-day 
strawberry festivals complete with a parade, Kaji said. The strawberry flower 
was named the city's official flower. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, strawberry production died out, probably due to the lack of crop 
rotation, according to a historical report drafted by the city in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 To educate the public about this part of Gardena's agrarian history, Kaji and 
his development partners have produced a display at their shopping center at 
1000 Rosecrans Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaji had historical photographs that depict the area and the strawberry 
farmers transferred onto large tiles that were embedded into the external walls 
of Strawberry Square. The developers plan to unveil the 14 photo tiles at a 
ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaji culled the photographs from the city, the Gardena Valley Chamber of 
Commerce and Sumitomo Bank. The photographs show area streets and strawberry 
fields in the early 1900s and include pictures of circa-1917 Strawberry 
Festival parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic artist Jerry Matsukuma transferred the photographs onto 1 1/2-foot by 
2-foot tiles. Matsukuma, who created a similar photo tile display at Japanese 
Village Plaza in Little Tokyo, said putting the photos on tile involves 
shooting the photograph through a special screen to produce a film positive, 
and glazing and burnishing the tile to form a smooth surface that will allow a 
photograph to be printed on it. The photo tile is then heated in a kiln at 
2,350 degrees to lock in the image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided it would be fun to show the square had a history in the city," Kaji 
said of the project, which cost $30,000. "And tiles are more permanent than 
regular photographs." IRIS YOKOI

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents on Catalina Island are fighting a Long Beach Unified School District 
policy that will require elementary and middle school students to wear uniforms 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On the mainland, administrators hope the policy will help curb gang problems 
by limiting gang attire.But the 610-student Avalon schools, isolated from the 
rest of the district, do not have the same difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a lot of the problems that the mainland schools have," said 
travel agency owner Mike Lavelle, who has three children in school. He and 
other parents have launched a petition drive expressing dismay at the 
districtwide policy, which on Avalon will also include high school students 
because its campus is combined with other grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I object to the dictatorial way in which Long Beach Unified decided to 
administer this thing," Lavelle said. Uniforms "are a decision that should be 
left to the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 School safety, however, is not the only intent of the policy, said Avalon 
Principal Mark Ur. 
</P>
<P>
 With uniforms, students "are not teased or forced into competing buying 
stylish brands," he said. "It gives students more self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that uniforms might instill more of a work ethic because "it 
gives (students) the feeling that they are putting on their work clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 A school committee will establish guidelines for the new uniforms, which might 
include an iron-on patch with the school's emblem, Ur said. 
</P>
<P>
 A town hall meeting is planned on April 19 to discuss the policy. TED JOHNSON

COVER STORY; THE YEAR OF THE DOLLAR; ACROSS THE SOUTH BAY, CANDIDATES WILL 
BICKER ABOUT USUAL ELECTION DAY ISSUES. BUT UNDERLYING IT ALL IS A CASH CRUNCH 
THAT THREATENS THE GOOD LIFE. 
</P>

Scott Sandell, and community correspondents James Benning, Mary Guthrie, Susan 
Woodward and Iris Yokoi. It was written by Johnson.

<P>
 In Lomita, the city may take over the county-owned library. Manhattan Beach 
may have to pay the county to provide lifeguard service. The tiny city of 
Avalon may have to find its own paramedic service because county service has 
gone up to $25,000 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the South Bay, cities are strapped for money. And in the nine cities 
holding elections April 12, the cash crunch is one of the top issues. The 
candidates may bicker among themselves about building permits and unkempt 
sidewalks, but they have a common target when it comes to their city's recent 
bare-bones budgets: federal, state and county governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants first-class services . . . they want the city to look like 
Disneyland," said outgoing Avalon Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith. "But the federal 
government is not giving any money to the states, the states aren't giving any 
money to the counties and the counties aren't giving any money to the cities." 
</P>
<P>
 And city governments, many candidates say, are stuck with the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a legitimate complaint," said Fernando J. Guerra, political science 
professor at Loyola Marymount University. "These cities don't have the ability 
to raise money like other levels of government." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the races are dominated only by worries over fiscal red ink. As 
the South Bay's population becomes ever more diverse, racial tensions have come 
to the fore in the Carson and Gardena elections. In both cities, some groups 
say city government does not represent all major ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials tackle these weighty issues, trends show that only about 
one-third of the registered voters have been going to the polls in many of 
these cities' recent municipal elections. AVALON 
</P>
<P>
 Tourists see only Catalina Island's quaint life of hotels, glass-bottom-boat 
tours and mom-and-pop restaurants. Behind it all is the often raucous world of 
Avalon city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Four candidates are on the ballot in the mayoral race to succeed Smith, who 
decided not to seek reelection: Avalon Casino Director Billy Delbert, 47; City 
Councilwoman Barbara J. Doutt, 46; Councilman Ralph J. Morrow Jr., 56, and 
businessman George Scott, who declined to give his age. Accountant David J. 
Keith, 38, is running as a write-in candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, seven candidates are running for two open spots on the City 
Council: businessman Dan O'Connor, 45; businessman and taxi driver Duane Stout, 
48; journalist Norma Carlyon, 55; retail store owner Norbert Reyes, 22; 
business owner Scott Nelson, 40; businessman Tim Winslow, 53; and public 
utility manager Keith LeFever, 47. Incumbent Hal Host decided not to seek 
another term, and Doutt is giving up her seat to seek the mayor's post. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the candidates say that the City Council has approved too much 
development without consulting the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decisions are being made that the people in the community don't understand," 
Stout said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many mainland cities, Avalon is strapped for funds. The County Department 
of Beaches and Harbors told the city that it would continue to provide 
paramedic service to the island in the 1994-95 fiscal year for $25,000 a month. 
The city already is paying $520,000 this fiscal year to subsidize the island's 
only hospital, which has 12 beds, after a private operator declined to renew 
its contract. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for the added costs, some candidates say the City Council can do 
more to increase sales-tax revenue generated by hotels and other tourist 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the high cost of medical services, city officials have placed three 
advisory measures on the ballot that ask voters if they want to keep the 
hospital open, if the hospital should be converted to an outpatient clinic with 
an emergency room, and if the city should provide paramedic service. CARSON 
</P>
<P>
 The city's first directly elected mayor may not have any greater power than 
other council members, but the campaign has been energized after a break-in at 
a candidate's election headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 James Peoples, 60, a retired economist and business executive, said the 
burglary at his offices was politically motivated. His opponent, business 
consultant Michael I. Mitoma, 50, now the city's appointed mayor, says that he 
knows "absolutely nothing about the break-in." 
</P>
<P>
 The race for a single City Council seat is a little more sedate. Incumbent 
Lorelie S. Olaes, 31, a former scholarship administrator at UCLA, will face 
bookkeeper Coni Hathaway, 53; clerical worker Gayle L. Konig, 42, and financial 
analyst Keith McDonald, 30, son of former Councilwoman Juanita M. McDonald. 
Olaes was elected last year to complete the unexpired term of the elder 
McDonald, who was elected to the state Assembly in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates have spent much of their time pledging to bring more jobs to the 
city and combat crime, but the city's racial diversity has underscored some of 
the campaigns. According to the 1990 U.S. Census, the city's population is 
almost equally divided among African Americans, Asian and Pacific Islanders, 
Latinos and whites. 
</P>
<P>
 When Olaes, a Filipina, replaced McDonald, it left the council with no African 
American member for the first time in the city's 25-year history. When the 
grass-roots organization United Voice endorsed Peoples, Keith McDonald and City 
Treasurer candidate Phyllis Y. Tucker this year, Mitoma charged that the group 
based its selection on race.  
</P>
<P>
 "They selected a black slate . . . That is not healthy," Mitoma said. "The 
message is that if you are black you should only vote for a black person . . . 
I'm very concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 But the three candidates deny that they are running as a ticket. Rather, they 
hope that the endorsement will result in more African American representation 
in the city's elected offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The current elected officials "do not reflect the cultural and geographical 
diversity of our city," Peoples said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the race for city clerk, incumbent Helen Kawagoe, 67, faces Samson C. 
Labasan, 63, a retired Gardena employee. City Treasurer Mary Louise Custer is 
running against businessman Cenon Nunag, 65, and Tucker, a certified public 
accountant. EL SEGUNDO 
</P>
<P>
 In a city hit hard by the decline in the aerospace industry, the six 
candidates running for two council seats vow to fill empty buildings and help 
struggling retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But they do not agree on whether the city should grant incentives to rebuild 
its economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the City Council voted to give a tax break to Summerfield 
Suites, a hotel chain that plans to build in the city. Incumbents Alan West, 
65, a retired auto shop owner, and J.B. Wise, 49, an electrical contractor, 
supported the plan. Their challengers in the race -- retired civil engineer 
Gerhardt Van Drie, 68; U.S. Census surveyor Jane Waag Friedkin; retired Chevron 
worker Thomas Dickten, 54, and legislative analyst Liam B. Weston -- opposed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we've got a chance to get some growth, we've got to do it," Wise said. "In 
the 1990s, there's no major business movement without some city involvement." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Drie said that the council should have allowed Summerfield to only 
postpone paying taxes. Other candidates said it was not the council's place to 
grant a tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government can't create jobs," Dickten said. "They have to be created in 
the private sector." GARDENA 
</P>
<P>
 Three longtime City Council veterans are seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In his bid for a seventh term, Mayor Donald L. Dear will face aerospace worker 
Rafael Garcia, 45, and insurance-benefits executive Philip Johnson, 33. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for two City Council seats, Steven Bradford, 34, a recycling 
director for the Los Angeles Conservation Corps, will challenge Mas Fukai, 67, 
who has been on the council 20 years, and Gwen Duffy, 71, a councilwoman for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a challenger in this city, you're considered a criminal," Bradford 
said. "Gardena has to be open . . . to all its citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford has long criticized city leaders for neglecting crime and gang 
problems in the predominantly black and Latino neighborhoods of north Gardena. 
</P>
<P>
 The police administration, he said, needs to be overhauled to provide better 
deployment of officers in the city's northern neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who lives in the Holly Park neighborhood in north Gardena, said that 
police officers should be assigned to specific neighborhoods to improve 
relationships with residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents call their challengers' charges groundless. Fukai said he often 
meets with north Gardena citizens groups, including the Holly Park Homeowners 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to criticize, criticize (us) for something we don't do . . . 
and tell us how to do it, because we're not mind readers," Fukai said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign, Garcia has targeted another area he says the city neglects: 
streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're filthy," he said. His proposal is to plant more trees and to 
steam-clean sidewalks. To pay for it, residents could be charged a small tax, 
he said. LAWNDALE 
</P>
<P>
 The names on the ballot will be the fewest in years: Only three candidates are 
running for two council seats, and Mayor Harold E. Hofmann has only a write-in 
candidate opposing his bid for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 In the council race, incumbent Larry Rudolph, 56, will face refinery 
shift-coordinator Bruce R. McKee, 45, and retired office manager Virginia M. 
Rhodes, 58. Both challengers serve on the Planning Commission. In the city 
clerk's race, electronics technician Uffe Moller, 51, will challenge incumbent 
Neil Roth, 51, an aerospace production control coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials say that potential candidates may have considered running, 
but decided not to because the faltering economy has them spending more time at 
their own jobs and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession also has made the job tougher for current council members. City 
officials projected a $645,000 shortfall in this fiscal year because of 
lower-than-expected income from sales taxes, permits and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates back a plan to use city reserve funds for loans to 
attract small businesses. That would eventually expand the city's tax base, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, McKee supports a tax on residents' utility bills. Rhodes backs 
a special assessment fee that would pay for specific projects, such as street 
improvements and the upkeep of public parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "A utility tax is probably more equal because everybody pays that," McKee 
said. "An assessment district, however, would affect only property owners in 
one area." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rhodes said the utility tax will be another burden on low-income families. 
Rudolph, an estimator for an engineering firm, said he is undecided on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann, 61, a self-employed contractor, sees a compromise: a combination of a 
utility tax and an assessment district.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pro Tem Nancy Marthens, 50, declared her candidacy for mayor this week 
as a write-in. She said the city should not institute a utility tax or 
assessment districts if it can raise revenue through the formation of its own 
water company. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also will vote on a measure that would prohibit the city's 
redevelopment agency from acquiring residential properties by eminent domain if 
it does not get the consent of the property owner. LOMITA 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has little control over the county-run library or Lomita's 
schools, but some candidates say the city should intervene on both fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Robert Hargrave, 56, Peter J. Rossick, 70, and Chuck Taylor, 58, 
will compete with manufacturing executive David Albert, 40, property manager 
Lawson Pedigo, 58, and aerospace contract manager Ben Traina, 40. The 
candidates are running for three at-large seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the county-run library had to cut its hours, and library officials 
worry that further county cuts will force the branch to close after June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedigo proposed that the city take over management of the library and apply 
for grants from the county to fund its operation. Traina said he would use city 
money, if available, to fund the library and might consider designating a city 
employee to work there part time. Rossick and Hargrave said they would support 
a city-run or city-funded library district, if money can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Albert pledged to "raise hell" with county officials in an effort to keep the 
library open, but said the city cannot afford to operate the branch itself. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the candidates support a petition drive to secede from the Los Angeles 
Unified School District and form an independent Lomita district or merge with a 
nearby district, such as Torrance Unified. Such a move could also save the 
library, Taylor said. State education money could be used to operate a city-run 
library as part of the district, he said. MANHATTAN BEACH 
</P>
<P>
 When the county cut funding for the Manhattan Heights Library, it closed. More 
recently, the City Council balked at a county request for more money for 
lifeguard and beach grooming services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county is playing lifeguard chicken with us," said lawyer James A. 
Shalvoy, 42, one of four candidates seeking two council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 He is running against incumbent Connie Sieber, 50, a flight attendant; retired 
businessman Jack Cunningham, 72, and lawyer Joan Jones, 38. Councilman Dan 
Stern decided not to seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalvoy and Sieber also say the city needs more police officers. Their 
proposals come in the wake of the Dec. 27 slaying of Manhattan Beach Police 
Officer Martin Ganz, who was shot during a routine traffic stop. PALOS VERDES 
ESTATES 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Michael Moody and Rosemary Humphrey are running as a team with 
attorney William A. Finer in their bid for three City Council seats. 
Councilwoman Ruth Gralow decided not to seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 To the trio, it's a race with few issues. To the only other candidate, 
businessman Massoud JavaDiZadeh, 46, they're dead wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 With Palos Verdes Estates' tight budget, he says the city could save money by 
forming a police department with the three other peninsula cities. The city has 
its own Police Department, and the rest of the peninsula contracts with the Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents are satisfied with the way things work, and do not want to 
do anything to jeopardize that, Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People work extremely hard to keep the calmness of this city," he said. "I 
can guarantee you that underneath, it's like an ant hill of activity to keep it 
that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody, 63, Finer, 51, and Humphrey, who declined to give her age, say 
JavaDiZadeh has an ax to grind over a recent dispute with city officials. In 
1992, he planted five magnolia trees and placed boulders on the public right of 
way in front of his Via Visalia home without City Council approval. JavaDiZadeh 
said he applied for a permit, and when the city didn't act on his request after 
four months, he went ahead with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is still unresolved, but JavaDiZadeh said his campaign has nothing 
to do with spite. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates "basically want to support the status quo -- don't rock 
the boat, don't step on anyone's toes and just let things happen," JavaDiZadeh 
said. "When you do that, you create a bureaucracy, and that's exactly what 
we've got." ROLLING HILLS 
</P>
<P>
 Most campaigns in this city center on keeping its quasi-rural atmosphere. 
Nothing more, nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
 So the big concern this year is that county cuts will threaten the city's 
lifestyle. With no business tax revenue, the city depends on a portion of the 
county's property tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing OK now, but we don't know for how long," said Councilwoman 
Gordana Swanson, who declined to give her age. Along with Swanson, who is 
seeking reelection, candidates for three council seats are incumbent Jody 
Murdock, who declined to give her age; venture capital investor B. Allen Lay, 
59, and businessman Frank Hill, 58. Councilwoman Ginny Leeuwenburgh is not 
running. Election Indifference In most of the South Bay cities holding 
municipal elections on April 12, fewer than one-third of all registered voters 
have cast ballots in recent races. Only the smallest cities, such as Avalon and 
Rolling Hills, have high turnout rates. 06,22,12,09,09,09,09 1990 1986 1988

CITY HALL ; LAWNDALE; PLAN TO BAR CITY HALL NEPOTISM 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lawndale City Council will consider a proposal to prevent nepotism among 
city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed law, the city could not hire the spouses, family members, 
in-laws or any other person related by blood or marriage to an elected or 
appointed official.The ordinance also would apply to relatives of department 
heads and the city manager. Current employees would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has scheduled a vote on the proposal at its meeting April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Norm Lagerquist, who conceived the measure, said the city has had a 
history of nepotism. However, Lagerquist could not cite a clear-cut example of 
favoritism in hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard claims, but I couldn't attest to it from firsthand," Lagerquist 
said. "There have been some questionable hirings, which I think disrupt City 
Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members, though supporting the proposal, said they are not aware 
of a problem. "I don't know where the need is," Mayor Harold E. Hofmann said. 
"I haven't seen nepotism around here myself. But maybe this will prove to be a 
bit of foresight." SCOTT SANDELL

 The City Council instructed City Manager James H. Mitsch on Monday night to 
present a budgeting plan by April 11.

 The city has been operating without a budget since July, more than nine months 
into the fiscal year. Earlier this month, the council changed the budget cycle 
from one year to two.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED AT JOSIE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gardena residents who date back to the early '60s may remember cars crowding 
Normandie Avenue on Sunday mornings so the drivers -- bringing their own pots 
-- could stock up on menudo from Josie's Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie's is closed on Sundays now, and owner Josephine Alcaraz has retired. 
Otherwise, little has changed at this still-busy take-out place. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie's is still a treat for students of Peary Junior High School, as it was 
in the late '60s, when a student would occasionally sneak off campus at 
lunchtime, buy some 49 chicken tacos and sell them to classmates for 75. When 
the feared boys' vice principal found out, the student was given a choice: five 
swats or two days' suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 After careful consideration, I took the swats. What a stupid choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular item at Josie's is still chicken tacos (now with one of 
Josie's rather unusual prices, $1.12) -- a mixture of thigh and breast meat 
with lettuce and tomato in a lightly fried corn tortilla. A few bites and it's 
gone. But they're tasty, and I always order one for tradition's sake. You can 
also get tacos filled with carnitas ($1.40) or shredded beef ($1.17). 
</P>
<P>
 The two other big sellers are the tamales ($1.36), the masa filled with large 
chunks of beef, and the fix tamales ($1.99), which add a topping of thick 
gravy, Cheddar cheese and tortilla chips. 
</P>
<P>
 The most expensive dish is steak picado ($4.25), a thin steak smothered in 
onions, bell peppers, tomatoes, garlic and a red chile sauce. It is served with 
rice and beans. A good pick is the wet burrito with carne asada ($3.61), where 
grilled beef with onions and tomatoes is wrapped with a tortilla and covered 
with melted cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie's Place is not on the cutting edge of Mexican cuisine. The only things 
that have changed on the menu in 30 years (not counting the disappearance of 
menudo) are the prices. But thanks to its reliability -- and the nearby junior 
high -- Josie's will probably be around another 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Josie's Place is at 16616 Normandie Ave., Gardena. (310) 323-3113. Open Monday 
from 10:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Tuesday through Saturday from 10:30 a.m. to 7 
p.m.. Closed Sunday. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

 BETTER THAN EVER 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo High softball team breezed through Ocean League play with a 13-1 
record last season to win its first league title in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks could be better this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Redondo, which won the Watts Summer Games title in June, is 9-2 and off to a 
4-0 start in Ocean League play. The Sea Hawks won their seventh in a row, 
defeating host Mira Costa, 5-1, in an Ocean league game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have high expectations last year because nobody knew about us," 
Redondo Coach Paul Collette said. "But this year there is a lot of pressure 
because everybody is gunning for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Kerry Martin, the Ocean League's most valuable player, has shown no 
letdown from a freshman season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section Division III second-team selection has given up only one 
earned run and four walks in 64 innings and has an earned-run average of 0.11. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who is also batting .393, pitched a one-hitter in a 1-0 victory over 
Culver City in a battle for the Ocean League lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The sophomore has used a loss to eventual semifinalist North Torrance in the 
first round of the playoffs as motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there has been a lot of pressure on us, but our team is focused on 
going farther in the playoffs than we ever have before," Martin said. "I've 
just had to keep mentally tough and tried to remain confident that we can do 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks have been winning with more than pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Redondo had only three home runs. Thus far, the Sea Hawks have 
hit 10 and have a team-batting average of .337. 
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Mandy Chavez leads the way with three home runs and .538 
average and first baseman Andrea Miller (.343) has hit two. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, Miller and Martin, along with catcher Jennifer Rios (.344), third 
baseman Leanna Evans (.321) and center fielder Suzanne McReynolds are among six 
returning all-league players for Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Hawks have also received a boost from junior center fielder Selena 
Fine, a transfer from Kennedy High in La Palma who is batting .382 and has 
seven stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year's team is much stronger," Collette said. "We were a little 
starry-eyed and I think they realize they could do a lot better than last year. 
The whole experience has made us a better team." HOMECOMING 
</P>
<P>
 As an assistant baseball coach at Cal State Northridge in 1991, Jody Robinson 
helped the Matadors reach the Western Regional championship game in their first 
season of competition in Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, now the coach at Loyola Marymount, apparently has learned well from 
his season under Northridge Coach Bill Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions hit three home runs and had eight extra-base hits in a 13-7 
nonconference road victory over Northridge on Tuesday. It was Robinson's first 
victory in six games against Kernen. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Jesse Ibarra held Northridge to two hits over the final four innings. 
Ibarra gave the Lions a 9-5 lead with his 11th home run and had three runs 
batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman shortstop Mike Mirrizi had four hits, including a double, to extend 
his hitting streak to 15 games, and Mike Seal drove in four runs for Loyola 
(14-18). BROTHER ACT 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Robert Harris has helped the Cal State Dominguez Hills baseball team 
soar to No. 2 in the NCAA Division II rankings -- the Toros' highest ranking 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother David Harris, a senior pitcher for Florida Southern, has done one 
better, leading the Moccasins (31-2) to the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Harris was the Division II leader in strikeouts last season. Earlier 
this season against Assumption College, he struck out 19 to come within two of 
the Division II record. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Harris isn't doing badly himself. The junior transfer from Odessa 
(Tex.) Junior College is batting .279 and has driven in 13 runs in 29 games for 
Dominguez Hills (20-9). 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Espinoza leads the team with a .379 average. Chris Miller and Ray Judy 
are batting .370 and .341 and share the team lead for steals with five. Jose 
Lara (.338), Eric Martin (.319) and Carlos Olmos (.313) are also batting above. 
300. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior right-handers Aaron Charlton (2-2) and Bert Horn (5-1) have formed the 
nucleus of the Dominguez Hills pitching staff. Charlton leads the team with 42 
strikeouts and two shutouts and Horn has pitched a team-high three complete 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros dropped to fourth in the Division II rankings this week after losing 
two of three games to Cal State Los Angeles on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Tripp had two singles and drove in three runs in a 10-3 victory over 
Concordia on Tuesday. Judy, Martin and Robert Harris also had two hits each to 
lead an 11-hit attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros overcame a 3-1 deficit with six runs in the fifth inning. Junior 
left-hander Scott Veeder earned the victory to improve to 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills plays a three-game nonconference series against Cal State 
Stanislaus beginning Friday. NO HARD FEELINGS 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Bakersfield became the first team to repeat as Division II 
basketball champion in 25 years Saturday, defeating Southern Indiana, 92-86, in 
Springfield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai knows something Southern Indiana 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros defeated Bakersfield, 65-63, in February. Last season, when the 
Roadrunners (27-6) finished 33-0, Dominguez Hills lost by two and by four 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills (16-11) finished fourth in the California Collegiate Athletic 
Assn. and did not receive a postseason berth. Which, by the way, doesn't bother 
Yanai at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "They carried the flag for the CCAA and I applaud them," Yanai said. "It just 
goes to show the strength of our conference and that there are national-caliber 
teams in the West and we can play with them." TRADING PLACES 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gilmore, the sports information director at Cal State Dominguez Hills 
since 1989, has resigned to become sports information director at California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. rival Cal State Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 An active member of the College Sports Information Directors of America, 
Gilmore, 29, is a member of the organization's board of directors and serves on 
its GTE Academic All-America Committee. KIRBY LEE

PEOPLE: AT 75, SHE'S RUNNING ON POSITIVE ENERGY 
</P>

<P>
 Sarah London passed by her toppled bookshelf for weeks on the way out of her 
mobile home for her daily run, but she didn't pick it up. The 75-year-old was 
afraid that cleaning up damage from the Northridge earthquake might injure her 
and ruin her intensive training. 
</P>
<P>
 "I waited until after the marathon," the Carson resident said.  
</P>
<P>
 She finished the Los Angeles Marathon earlier this month in six hours, 44 
minutes and 28 seconds, and it wasn't her first. Last year, London ran in the 
L.A. marathon, as well as those in Honolulu and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After this year's marathon, she finally picked up the bookcase and her books 
and knickknacks. It was a good thing she waited, she said, because she strained 
her back slightly setting things right.  
</P>
<P>
 London has covered a lot of ground in the past few years, but she came late to 
long-distance running. She played basketball and volleyball in high school but 
didn't start running until she was 57. She and her husband got interested in 
the sport at the prompting of a neighbor and ran 5K and 10K races together.  
</P>
<P>
 Her husband had a heart attack while running seven years ago, and he died four 
years ago. But London kept running. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991 she joined a group that trains together in Santa Monica called the 
Leggers. Her first marathon was in Long Beach in 1992. She finished the race in 
six hours, 31 minutes and 44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tani Leung, 40, who credits London with getting her started running three 
years ago, said London told her that to stay alive, she has to stay positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Sarah goes out with a feeling that she's going to finish," Leung 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 London describes herself as the kind of person who skips the parts of the 
newspaper that have bad news. She likes the company of younger people because, 
she said, their conversation is more interesting.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you start talking to people my age they start telling you about their 
ailments," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 And she runs because it makes her feel good. She gets restless if she doesn't 
run or walk first thing in the morning, and she enjoys the endorphins that keep 
her feeling good the rest of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Leung left the Leggers and joined the closer Gardena Reebok Runners. 
Coach Dan Ashimine encourages London to keep putting in her miles and she 
regularly logs 40 miles a week around Carson and on the bike path at Redondo 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashimine doesn't think anyone's too old to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question in my mind that you can start exercising at any time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 London said she's not sure she'll do any more marathons, but Leung is trying 
to persuade London to do the Bay to Breakers Run in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 While running this year's Los Angeles Marathon, London noticed that some 
people weren't doing too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a lot of young people along the way with their shoes off, bandaging 
their feet," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 When she finished she was tired, but not exhausted. She said she tries not to 
think about the length of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think of 26 miles -- that's a long ways to go. I'm looking toward 
seven miles. Then I start thinking of 14 miles. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 During the race, other runners often match her pace for a bit, resulting in a 
breathy chat. "I kind of enjoy myself when a young fellow will say, 'You're 
doing good; how old are you?' " she said. "I enjoy that -- I'm not offended."  
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't claim to have any great secrets of running. Before a race she has 
coffee and a Power Bar for breakfast, then another Power Bar and water during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 During the rest of the time, London said she eats lots of pasta, fruits and 
vegetables, and avoids fatty and fried foods. But she has a taste for prime 
rib, and eats some sort of meat two or three times a week "to keep my strength 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 "My appetite is very good," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Ohio native, London came to California with her husband more than 30 years 
ago. She has two daughters in Ohio but plans to stay in Carson as long as she 
can take care of herself. That way she can keep running. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do here, I can do year-round," London said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family is proud of her but doesn't really understand why she runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think it's too much. They can't conceive that anyone would do that but a 
crazy person. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're interested but they're not about to go out and do it," London said.

 Hockey -- A story on March 12 about an on-ice meeting in 1978 between Wayne 
Gretzky and Gordie Howe described how Gretzky stole the puck from Howe and Howe 
later hit Gretzky with his stick and said, "Don't ever embarrass me on the 
ice." This sequence of events was told by Gretzky at a news conference. Howe 
denies making the statement.

EDUCATION: MATH SKILLS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have seen the recent results of the CLAS (California Learning Assessment 
Scores) for the Los Angeles and suburban area fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade 
students. Something is indeed amiss in California!  
</P>
<P>
 As professor emeritus of mathematics and computer science in the Los Angeles 
Community College District, I have noted with alarm, over the past 25 years, 
the great decline in the understanding of BASICS (that means decimals, 
fractions, percentages and applications) of arithmetic! 
</P>
<P>
 The results of the CLAS show that in the Palos Verdes Unified School District, 
70% are classified as being 1, 2, or 3 (the three lowest levels) of 
understanding at fourth grade; 59% being in 1, 2, or 3 at eighth grade; 67% at 
10th grade. The Los Angeles schools recorded: 97% being in the three lowest 
levels at fourth grade; 96% at eighth grade and 96% at 10th grade. Torrance 
schools recorded: 88%, 86% and 84%. 
</P>
<P>
 This is indeed shocking. We are living in an age where it is even more 
necessary than ever that our students have an understanding of the basics of 
mathematics. 
</P>
<P>
 I taught remedial mathematics to adults in California community colleges for 
over 24 years. My students varied in age from 18 to 65. I remember the 
students, many having come up through the Los Angeles educational system, 
having such difficulty doing some math problems, for example: 4 + 5 X 6 (The 
answer is 34. The multiplication must be done first.) 
</P>
<P>
 I would think, surely, these students have had third-, fourth-, fifth- and 
sixth-grade arithmetic, which includes decimals and fractions. Yet, they 
struggled and repeated these same elementary school topics in a final attempt 
to learn the concepts. Are the present fourth-, eighth- and 10th-grade students 
going to be repeating the mistakes of the previous generation? 
</P>
<P>
 After many years of working with students, I observed that the young students, 
especially, would excel in mathematics, once the methods were presented in a 
logical manner. Not only must these methods be presented correctly, but the 
instructor should have the confidence and understanding to do the presenting. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were the parent of a fourth-, eighth- or 10th-grader, I would take a very 
close look at the textbooks the children were using to see if I, as an adult, 
could follow the reasoning. I would visit the math teachers (especially at the 
lower grades) to make sure that the teachers were comfortable with their 
knowledge of the subject and competent in teaching the basics of math. (Some 
teachers today were my students of 10 to 20 years ago; others were students of 
the "new math"). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is the time to look at alternatives in the field of education. 
Perhaps there are valid reasons why we had a "voucher initiative" on the ballot 
in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This country cannot maintain its technological greatness if we keep on turning 
out students who lack the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic!
