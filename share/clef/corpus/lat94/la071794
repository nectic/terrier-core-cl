ANARCHIST WITH AN ATTITUDE; THE GRANDDADDY OF MONKEYWRENCHING WANTED TO BE 
TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY THE LITERARY ESTABLISHMENT HE SCORNED.; EPITAPH FOR A DESERT 
ANARCHIST: THE LIFE AND LEGACY OF EDWARD ABBEY, BY JAMES BISHOP JR. (ATHENEUM: 
$22; 254 PP.)

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I first looked at "Epitaph for a Desert Anarchist," I was suspicious. Who 
the hell is James Bishop, Jr. and what has he written about Cactus Ed, author 
of several books that have inspired defenders of wilderness? We Friends of Ed 
(FOE's) are protective and (let's admit it) clannish. I know of four old Abbey 
pals who are completing books about him. But I didn't know this James Bishop 
Jr. -- who admits in his prologue that he "never knew (Abbey) personally." How 
could a stranger accurately write about Abbey's legacy? 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, he is a former reporter for Newsweek. A journalist! Abbey wrote in 
"Abbey's Road," "I too have been mistaken for a member of that squalid 
profession, journalism. . . . I am not and never will be a goddamned two-bit 
sycophantic journalist for Christ's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Bishop. Two strikes against him and I haven't even started to read his 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I read it and found that "The Life and Legacy of a Desert Anarchist" is 
that rare book, true to its title and honest in its intent and execution. 
Bishop tells us that it is "neither a definitive biography nor an academic 
study" but is "my attempt to record the impact of (Abbey's) work on our times 
and on his admirers who, like him, like all of us, are struggling to exist in a 
shrinking natural world." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is also a good comeuppance to the FOE. It reminds me that a person, 
to know Abbey, did not have to share cigars and a jug of wine around a 
campfire, float a desert river together or creep around after dark in shared 
conspiracy. I first knew Ed Abbey 10 years before I met him. In 1971, a pretty 
bartender in Albuquerque lent me a well-thumbed paperback of "Desert 
Solitaire," a celebration of the desert and a forceful indictment of industrial 
tourism. I fell in love -- with both the writer of the book and the bartender 
(different kinds of love). Bishop recounts a similar experience with "Desert 
Solitaire" (minus the bartender). 
</P>
<P>
 To get at Abbey's legacy, Bishop considers reactions from two sources -- 
literary critics and Abbey readers. While Abbey's books were frequently praised 
by reviewers, Bishop concentrates on the critics. I find they fall into two 
camps: the Manhattan-centric literary elite who dismissed Abbey as a failed 
novelist or as a mere nature writer, and the Whine and PC Set who felt he 
embarrassed environmentalists and social justice activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop brilliantly dismisses Abbey's literary critics as coming from "European 
standards." Touche, as Europeans would say. 
</P>
<P>
 But reading negative review after negative review, I am struck by the 
nastiness in so many of them. Bishop doesn't specifically analyze the reason 
for the venom, but he touches on one reason -- many people wanted Abbey to be 
what they wanted him to be, and were disappointed that he wouldn't be that 
person. (If he had let them make him be what they wanted him to be, he really 
wouldn't have been what they wanted him to be!) Bishop also lets real people, 
people with river silt between their toes, speak about the influence Abbey had 
on them, how his essays and novels inspired "several generations of citizens . 
. . to fight against the national passion of growth for growth's sake." This, 
of course, is his legacy. And this -- that he wasn't just someone who strung 
pretty words together -- may be why academic snobs and the literary elite 
vilified him. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing, though. Abbey wanted his writing to be taken seriously as 
literature. Part of him chafed at being a hero and an inspiration to wilderness 
defenders. Bishop quotes him just before his death: "I never wanted to be 
anything but a writer, period. An author. A creator of fiction and essays." 
Rebels want to be taken seriously by that which they rebel against. So, even Ed 
Abbey might not fully agree with what Bishop says about his legacy, or with 
what I say about what Bishop says. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ticklish eddy lines around one of Abbey's books -- "Desert 
Solitaire." ("Good god. Did she really read all my other books? It's not my 
favorite," he huffs after being told by a fan that "Desert Solitaire" was her 
favorite book.) Here I put myself in peril. I will forever be nervous when a 
turkey vulture flies overhead. I'm sorry, Ed, but "Desert Solitaire" was your 
best book, your most important book. It awakened me to a life of defense of the 
wild, it spoke to a place in my soul that I thought was so hidden that no one 
would ever be able to intrude there. And I am not alone. Not by a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 And so we come to Abbey's message. It comes in four parts, and Bishop treats 
them all, even if he does not specifically identify them as four legs to a 
platform. Anarchism. Biocentrism. Koyaanisqatsi. Individual Action. 
</P>
<P>
 Two chapters of the book are given to Abbey's youth in the Pennsylvania hills 
and his college education. Bishop uses this biography to trace the development 
of Abbey's anarchist thought (Abbey wrote his master's thesis in philosophy at 
the the University of New Mexico on anarchism and violence), and shows that 
what separates Abbey's brand of anarchism from all others is wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's theme, however, is not just the individual against the crushing state; 
wilderness is not just a refuge for the political outlaw. In the mainstream, 
there was Abbey, declaring where he stood: "All creatures have equal rights, so 
if diversity is to be preserved, the anthropocentric, or man-centered, order of 
things must shift to a more biocentric view." Bishop also writes that "Abbey 
depicted (the Southwest) not as virgin country ripe with industrial potential, 
but as a holy place to be defended, where all living creatures, including 
scorpions, vultures and lions, are vested with equal rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop generally resists emphasizing anarchism over wilderness as Abbey's 
overarching message, but misinterprets Abbey when he says that Abbey's concern 
was "for human nature," not "to save the planet," which would ultimately 
"replenish itself." In truth, Abbey deeply feared what we were doing to the 
diversity of life that exists now. When he wrote that we could not extinguish 
all life on Earth, he was correct, but he was trying, as he did in so many 
places, to laugh at our arrogance, not to diminish the importance of today's 
beautiful living Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The third part of Abbey's message is Koyaanisqatsi -- the Hopi term meaning 
"world out of balance." Bishop tells us that "this young prophet (Abbey in the 
1950s) anticipated whole movements in American society that didn't become 
evident until the 1960s and '70s -- most of them dramatizing life out of 
balance. . . ." Of course, Koyaanisqatsi leads to collapse of the industrial 
state, the basis for Abbey's novel "Good News." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the fourth part of Abbey's message that Bishop finds is his true legacy: 
"The machine may seem omnipotent, but it is not. Human bodies and human wit, 
active here, there, everywhere, united in purpose, independent in action, can 
still face that machine and stop it and take it apart and reassemble it -- if 
we wish -- on lines entirely new." So Abbey wrote and believed, and inspired 
others to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is it that Edward Paul Abbey became a cult hero without wanting to be one? 
Why is it that all the pretty nature writers will be forgotten and Abbey will 
live forever in the hearts and souls and minds and actions of lovers of freedom 
and wilderness? 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop quotes David Quammen in Outside magazine: "A man wrote a book ("Desert 
Solitaire"), and lives were changed. That doesn't happen often." 
</P>
<P>
 And Bishop writes: "On many occasions, Abbey said that one brave deed was 
worth a thousand books." He then quotes me at Abbey's memorial service: "He was 
disparaging his own contribution. Every book of Ed Abbey's, every essay, every 
story has launched a thousand brave deeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bishop may have shaken hands with Ed Abbey only once, but he knew him and 
knows his legacy. A Better Explanation 
</P>
<P>
 What is worse, political correctitude or equal opportunity offensiveness? 
Here, as a reminder that no hero is a saint, is an excerpt from "Confessions of 
a Barbarian: Selections From the Journals of Edward Abbey, 1951-1989," with 
original drawings by Edward Abbey , edited and with an introduction by David 
Petersen (to be published by Little Brown in November). This is the last entry, 
dated Feb. 2, 1989. Abbey died on March 14, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Why book reviewers hate my books: 
</P>
<P>
 Because the books are really no good? Perhaps. But I think I've got a better 
explanation. Almost all reviewers, these days, are members of and adherents to 
some anxious particular sect or faction. I.e., they are lesbians or New-Agers 
or fem-libbers or (even worse) male fem-libbers or technophiles or self-hating 
white liberals or right-wing conservatives or Growth maniacs or Negroes or 
female Negroes or Third-World lesbian militant Negro poetesses or closet 
Marxists (Marxoids) or futurologists or academical specialists or Chicano 
ideologues or ballerinas or Kowboy Kultists or Kerouac Kultists or Henry James 
Minimalist Perfectionists or one-tenth Chippewa "Native American" Indians or at 
very least all-inclusive Official Chickens -- Correct-Thinking Liberals etc. 
etc. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, any member of any one of those majority minorities is going to find 
for certain a few remarks in any of my books that will offend/enrage "s/he" to 
the marrow, leading invariably in turn, on the part of such sectarian book 
reviewers, to a denunciation not merely of the offending passage, but of the 
entire book , and not merely of the book, but of the author too.

THE NIKE EQUATION; JUST DO IT: THE NIKE SPIRIT IN THE CORPORATE WORLD, BY 
DONALD KATZ (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 352 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joel Drucker, Joel Drucker has been an editor with City Sports and a 
consumer marketing consultant with such public relations firms as 
Burson-Marsteller and Edelman Worldwide. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Successfully marketing consumer products is a three-sided equation: the right 
product in the right place at the right time. Over the last 20 years, few 
corporations can match the track record of Nike. Titling his book with the very 
three words Nike has spent millions spreading, Donald Katz has written "a 
description of the company on the move through 17 months of glory and panic and 
fervid economic activity -- between the Summer Olympics of 1992 and the 
beginning of 1994." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-word message most closely associated with Nike is "Just Do It," a 
tagline not too subtly linking good old American pragmatism with sexual 
innuendo and exemplary decisiveness. In an era when just doing anything is 
fraught with physical, emotional and social complications, along comes Nike -- 
they took the name of the Greek goddess of victory -- with a call to action, 
turning what were once functional sneakers into cultural statements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike so many other businesses in which sporting metaphors have become a 
part of the everyday managerial vocabulary -- 'quarterbacking a committee' and 
the like," writes Katz, "Nike is a gigantic, multifaceted sports metaphor." 
</P>
<P>
 Granted access to the inner circle of Phil Knight, Nike's elusive CEO and 
founder, Katz sets out to explain that metaphor. He digs deep, with ample 
material from past and present Nike employees in advertising, sales, product 
development and more. Nike, once perceived as "the 'Saturday Night Live' of the 
Fortune 500," is positively described as "something of a model of the global, 
postindustrial enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 A principle component is an irreverent corporate culture that attempts to 
bring "Just Do It" to life by synthesizing baby-boomer individualism with the 
pursuit of profit. In the clumsy style that marks much of this book, Katz 
writes that Nike was launched by "a generation composed of citizens often 
frustrated in their more cooperative liberatory efforts before self-discovery 
appeared to loom just a few miles down the road." The duty-bound corporation of 
the '50s has given way to the mission-driven, allegedly flattened hierarchy of 
the '90s. Start the revolution. Never mind that Phil Knight is a Stanford MBA 
who spent a good deal of the '60s working at the Price Waterhouse accounting 
firm. Never mind the incomprehensible "matrix" Nike substitutes for coherent 
organization. "The entrepreneurial spirit of the early dream was carefully 
protected, sanctified," Katz writes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most prominent element in Nike's success are the athletes, those 
billboard-gobbling, TV-hogging, larger-than-life heroes like Michael Jordan, Bo 
Jackson and Andre Agassi. "The athlete," Katz quotes Knight, "remains our 
reason for being." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Nike's success is vivid proof of Madison Avenue's powers, Katz 
points out Knight's belief that advertising is "phony." Cherishing athletes and 
"authenticity," Knight likens Nike to "an experience company," in the process 
coming off as woefully deluded about his company's social value. 
</P>
<P>
 Piercing through Knight's naive beliefs, Katz adroitly notes that no more than 
40% of Nike shoe buyers wear the shoes for their intended sport. Various 
sections explain the development of shoes and campaigns for Air Jordan, 
cross-training ("Bo Knows"), tennis and other product lines. Even if they don't 
play sports much, Nike buyers do enjoy relationships with the products, 
particularly through television, where new ads "were treated like new plays or 
books." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the hype about Knight as a visionary and "the most powerful man in 
sports," little in this book shows him as anything more than an introverted 
fellow and astute marketer who wisely read the tea leaves of the 
fitness-as-fashion boom. While Katz is adequate at sharing anecdotes about 
Knight's penchant for driving fast and zest for winning tennis matches, a major 
frustration of this book is his inability to take a stand and try to assess 
Knight as anything more than secretive, shy and a bit fatalistic. In his 
preface, Katz praises Knight for always returning his calls and opening Nike's 
doors to him. There is a great sense throughout this book that the author has 
been seduced by a Byzantine subject versed enough in contemporary public 
relations to know that the appearance of openness is likely the best defense 
against rigorous inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often, this book takes on a rambling quality that leaves little 
indication of a particular plot, the emotional needs of its characters or the 
broad issues governing Nike through the period of investigation. The chapters, 
organized strictly by chronological locale, ("Barcekibam August 1992," "Kansas 
City, June 1993"), do little to advance the alleged story of these tumultuous 
17 months. They read more like discrete articles than pieces of a larger whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The chilling tale of a teen-ager so addicted to Nikes that he owns 40 pairs 
poses a great case study opportunity. Katz's structure is labyrinthine. 
Awkwardly preceded by several tantalizing generalizations, it's then nicely 
detailed with quotes from the boy and the imagined thoughts of Knight. Pages 
later, after attempting to unify such disparate topics as Nike's retailers, how 
they order products and the urban crime fallout of Nike's popularity, Katz's 
wordy explanation comes off as both poorly developed and faintly apologetic: 
</P>
<P>
 "As sickeningly absurd as a killing over a pair of shoes or a leather jacket 
or a gold chain clearly was, certain members of a culture of constant 
acquisition that had, by and large, bypassed the absurdity and larger moral 
implications of stealing and killing over objects as apparently essential as 
cars were outraged when violence was done in the name of something as silly as 
a pair of shoes. Journalists and other assessors of an American public 
descended from a tradition of a great deal of stealing and killing over horses 
were suddenly stunned when poor people stole shoes or spent too much money on 
Nikes and Reeboks when, as one group of critics put it in 1990, they ought to 
be buying themselves books." 
</P>
<P>
 No question, there's a story within Nike. It's a story that could explain 
America's love of sports as a symbol for youthful vanity, fitness, wealth and 
mobility. But this execution is poorly organized, the concrete examples too far 
removed from the thematic generalizations, the motives of personalities buried 
under quick quotes and rapid transitions, the conflicts scarcely articulated 
and followed through. 
</P>
<P>
 Core questions regarding Nike's "spirit in the corporate world" remain 
unanswered. How does that spirit manifest itself in other corporations? Do 
other business leaders think Nike's success can continue? Regarding those 
transitory athletes: What to make of Michael Jordan now that he's retired? What 
did Bo know? And when did he know it? We await a clearer set of answers.

THE HEART OF MADNESS; HEADHUNTER, BY TIMOTHY FINDLEY (CROWN PUBLISHERS: $22.00; 
440 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Rechy, John Rechy's first novel, City of Night, was reissued in 
hardback in May by Book of the Month Club. He has just completed his 11th 
novel, Our Lady of Babylon. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This exceptional novel opens with a smashing paragraph that elevates a 
reader's expectations: 
</P>
<P>
 "On a winter's day, while a blizzard raged through the streets of Toronto, 
Lilah Kemp inadvertently set Kurtz free from Page 92 of 'Heart of Darkness.' 
Horror-stricken, she tried to force him back between the covers. The escape 
took place at the Metropolitan Toronto Reference Library, where Lilah Kemp sat 
reading beside the rock pool. She had not even said come forth, but there Kurtz 
stood before her, framed by the woven jungle of cotton trees and vines that 
passed for botanic atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Lilah is a schizophrenic, an outpatient in a psychiatric treatment center. She 
roams Toronto while pushing a baby carriage containing a copy of "Wuthering 
Heights." From childhood she has been able to conjure up characters from her 
favorite books. Now she believes she has unleashed the evil Kurtz of Joseph 
Conrad's famous novella onto the streets of Toronto, but Kurtz is not a figment 
of Lilah's imagination. He's the chief of Toronto's Parkin Institute of 
Psychiatry. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of Lilah as substitute Marlow (the pursuer of Conrad's Kurtz) 
tracking down a sinister psychiatrist is exciting indeed. Alas, Timothy 
Findley, celebrated Canadian author, opts for more literal parallels with 
Conrad's novella. Another psychiatrist -- named Marlow! -- arrives at the 
center, a forced development that Findley tries to shrug off: "It's just sort 
of crazy -- the kind of coincidence that happens once in a lifetime." Perhaps 
because of their allegorical function, neither Kurtz nor Marlow is as engaging 
as Lilah -- she is crafty, wickedly likable, expertly drawn but finally not 
involved as fully as anticipated in bringing Kurtz out of his new station of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Findley intends to locate a contemporary heart of darkness: "If there are new 
forms of human beings, then it follows there must be new forms of madness." In 
place of the river up which Conrad's Marlow trails his Kurtz, Findley 
substitutes the convoluted corridors of psychiatric power ruled, godlike, by a 
modern Kurtz. Findley's Marlow discovers that Kurtz is condoning behavioral 
experiments in the control of the young. Kurtz is aware of, and even visits, 
the Club of Men, a group of wealthy Canadians who perpetrate increasing 
debaucheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Another horror is loose in the city. As deadly as AIDS, a new illness, 
"sturnusemia," is being suspiciously attributed by the government to starlings. 
D-squads are annihilating birds and wasting the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these grim developments, it's surprising that Findley manages terrific 
satire along the way: Gallery-opening art-chat becomes uproarious during the 
unveiling of deranged paintings of mutilation. A "fable" within the novel 
purports to reveal how Jean-Paul Sartre really died. At a formal dinner, Sartre 
expounds: "We pay attention to one another in accordance with our functions in 
one another's lives. . . . I desire wine -- I call the waiter. . . . And once 
my glass is filled, then -- poof! -- he is gone. The waiter no longer exists." 
The waiter opens fire and -- poof -- kills Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. 
Findley makes a hilarious, satirically illuminating commentary on 
existentialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout, impeccable sentences and sophisticated insights delight. At the 
art opening, Kurtz muses: "Nearly everyone in the room . . . has violence 
somewhere in the family background -- the violence always on an operatic scale 
-- Verdi, not Puccini. Never Wagner. Tasteful -- but full-blown; a generation 
of weddings sung by tenors and sopranos -- with all the dark basses and 
contraltos waiting in the wings . . . La Forza del destino." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of this novel's commercial success in Canada may result from its Canadian 
readers' familiarity with Toronto society. The uninitiated reader may find the 
book too long and become frustrated by its extended descriptions of city 
landscapes, its vast cast of glamorously named characters (Fabiana, Julian 
Slade), each of whom, major and minor, carries loads of unneeded background. 
There's too much fussy action: Cigarettes are lit and snuffed, olives 
recurrently fished out of martinis. 
</P>
<P>
 Literary allusions abound, some surely meaningful mainly to the author, others 
amusing: Emma Berry conducts romantic liaisons in her moving limousine; and 
Lilah names the invisible baby in her carriage Linton. 
</P>
<P>
 Findley does not finally fulfill his own high ambitions: "Every Kurtz must 
have his Marlow, and Marlow will always come back to take Kurtz home. . . . 
With every journey up the river, we discover that Kurtz has penetrated just a 
little farther . . . through darker mysteries." 
</P>
<P>
 What Findley locates is more a unique perversion than the universal evil he 
has promised to explore, mysteries "darker" than Conrad's. The depravity here 
is too specific to stand as metaphor for the mysteries posed by real, 
near-ungraspable horrors that have occurred since the original Kurtz appeared: 
the Holocaust, the slaughter at My Lai, the lingering indifference to AIDS -- 
much more brutal than the sturnusemia Findley imagines -- the emergence of 
"ethnic cleansing," the hundreds of acts of daily brutalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking why Marlow always appears in order to pursue Kurtz, Findley proposes: " 
. . . because he is beholden to Kurtz for having provided him, after darkness, 
with a way to find new light." Findley does not contribute such "new light" of 
possible redemption. The relative hopefulness of his ending seems imposed. 
Despite the fact that his novel succeeds only partially, Findley deserves high 
praise for his daring to explore grand themes, and to do so in fine, literate 
writing.

FOR DEAR LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While reading about Dr. Eva Carrizales' plight ("By a Doctor's Hand," by Barry 
Siegel, June 12), I felt like cradling her in my arms, much as she did that 
doomed child. This tragedy is a sterling example of why criminal law and 
medicine should rarely intersect. When we bestow on a person the license to 
make daily life and death decisions, which has to be the most difficult job 
conceived, then that person must also be given greater latitude in making those 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 A key mistake was that despite a peer review finding that the baby's care was 
not "below standards," the district attorney went ahead with a grand jury 
proceeding. Allowing laymen to define criminal conduct begs for a poor result. 
I wish this story were required reading for every district attorney. Maybe 
then, people such as Dr. Carrizales would feel less threatened for trying to 
save lives and actualize compassion.

 As an oncology and home-health RN, I've taken care of many terminally ill 
patients. As doctors and nurses, it is our job to make these patients as 
comfortable as possible, not speed them on their way. Although I believe in 
euthanasia, it is not legal in this country. No matter how compassionate Dr. 
Carrizales may be, she crossed the line.

 Every medical examiner, coroner and district attorney should be ordered to 
read "By a Doctor's Hand." All that was needed at any one stage of that tragedy 
was for a single bureaucrat to say, "The buck stops here." But at every stage, 
the bureaucrats instead bowed to the fear of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 The work of Dr. Carrizales is important in a society that must come to grips 
with the rationing of health care. We are all very reasonable in our discussion 
of such matters, until we have to make a decision. I grieve for Dr. Carrizales, 
who is a victim of cowardice.

 No one likes to see people suffer, be they babies or adults. Doctors should 
allow people to end their lives and die with dignity. This decision should not 
be viewed as giving those in the health-care profession the right to end any 
life. Rather, it supports the view that doctors should respect the dignity of 
patients and not use life-support systems to keep people alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The courage that Dr. Carrizales has shown to let the baby die with dignity 
should be supported. Perhaps there will come a time in the near future when 
doctors will be able to make these decisions based on compassion rather than 
the law.

<P>
 We treat a dying animal in the road with more respect and dignity than most 
terminal patients. Doctors are terrified of making the decisions that Eva 
Carrizales did, and when they do make them it is probably from the safety of 
their car phones. They do everything they can to remove themselves from the 
emotional reality of death. When was the last time a doctor held a dying infant 
in his or her arms in an attempt to help ease the pain and suffering of their 
final hours? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the baby could have lived for another few days. But it's not about 
quantity of life, it's about quality. A good deal of our medical crisis is 
precipitated by the "life at any cost" attitude of medical training. Until we 
have more doctors like Carrizales who are willing to make the really tough 
decisions, we will never be a "civilized" society.

</P>
<P>
 Here was a human being with no quality of life and with death imminent. So why 
the persecution of the kind and compassionate Dr. Carrizales? Because she 
committed the sin of taking a defenseless human being out of the medical 
system, where the hospital and all its ancillary services could have had a 
financial bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to die is one each human being should have. The only people fighting 
this issue are, in the main, those who stand to gain financially by "attending" 
to those who have no chance of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 These people want to dictate to you and your loved ones just how you can die, 
even though it may mean more pain and suffering for you.

<P>
 Siegel asks us whether a "dignified, peaceful death" is better than 
"prolonged, gasping agony." Dignified for whom? The baby? The doctor? How dare 
the author project his opinions on the baby's struggle for life. I could easily 
claim that the baby strived for life with vigor, perseverance and dignity, but 
his tiny chance was stripped away by the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Christian nation, it is our duty to uphold the idea that all life is 
sacred, and that we are to preserve life to the very last second. The courts 
did just that. While the doctors waffled, the grand jury -- the average 
citizenry -- upheld the law. 
</P>
<P>
 RAUL E. ACOSTA 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills 
</P>
<P>
 As a registered nurse, I feel compelled to respond to "By a Doctor's Hand." 
The implication running through the saga is that Carrizales was brought down by 
nurses who were overly emotional, ignorant of the physiological stages of death 
and unable to maintain a professional relationship with Dr. Carrizales because 
of personality conflicts. That is ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Nurses' own licenses are at risk. They cannot follow doctors' orders blindly 
or observe doctors' actions uncritically. The ethical, moral and legal 
obligation to protect the patient runs to medicine and nursing. 
</P>
<P>
 And to imply that neonatal intensive-care nurses, who witness tragedy daily, 
do not understand the physiological stages of death is nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to indicate that the incident would have gone unreported if Dr. 
Carrizales had been more of a buddy to the nurses is insulting. It is not 
necessary to like a doctor to respect his or her work. The nurses were simply 
complying with hospital policy and the law when they reported Dr. Carrizales. 
Anything less and they could have been defending their licenses.

COVER STORY: DRIVE-IN REDUX 
</P>

<P>
 Daddy-O! 
</P>
<P>
 The 1950s are back and in color! And we're not talking the '50s of Mom, apple 
pie, Eisenhower, Ozzie and Harriet, Pat Boone and Patti Page. We're talking the 
decade of rebels without causes, cool cats, down and dirty rock 'n' roll, hot 
rods, motorcycle gangs, raging hormones, push-up bras, poodle skirts, 
cigarettes and, especially, drive-in movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, drive-ins are nearly as extinct as the T-Rex. But 40 years ago, 
drive-ins were teen-age passion pits. Every weekend, teens would flock to 
drive-ins, not only to neck, but also to watch such low-budget flicks as 
"Roadracers," "Runaway Daughters" and "Rock All Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of these quickie, black-and-white C pix were usually made by producers 
Sam Arkoff and James Nicholson's American International Pictures, which was 
founded in 1954. AIP was the training ground for such directors as Martin 
Scorsese and John Milius and actors Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and Richard 
Pryor. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to "Rebel Highway," Showtime's new original film series, 10 movie 
directors -- Joe Dante, Robert Rodriguez, Allan Arkush, Ralph Bakshi, Uli Edel, 
William Friedkin, Jonathan Kaplan, John McNaughton, John Milius and Mary 
Lambert -- have gotten a chance to make their own '50s AIP flick. 
</P>
<P>
 And they had to make their films on an AIP schedule -- in just 12 days on a 
shoestring budget of $1.3 million. Directors got to pick the title of their 
choice from AIP's library and were given creative control and final cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rebel Highway" roars onto the small screen Friday with Robert Rodriguez's 
("El Mariachi") hot-rod adventure "Roadracers." The series will present a new 
movie every Friday. On Aug. 9, A&M Records will release the "Rebel Highway" 
series soundtrack, "Fast Track to Nowhere," featuring such artists as the 
Neville Brothers and Los Lobos performing songs from that era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Making the movies was a lot of fun," says producer Debra Hill ("Attack of the 
50 Ft. Woman"). "Really, to do a body of work with these directors would have 
taken me a decade. So this is great." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also been nonstop insanity. The productions shoot in and around Los 
Angeles and at a small sound stage in North Hollywood. "We shoot 12 days, are 
down for three days and then we start again," says producer Lou Arkoff, son of 
Sam Arkoff. "We have made 10 movies from October to July." 
</P>
<P>
 Arkoff, a frequent visitor to the sets of the original films as a youngster, 
came up with the idea of the "Rebel Highway" series. "What would happen if you 
remade 'Rebel Without a Cause' today, still set in the '50s but with '90s 
sensibilities? The answer is it would be more lurid. It would be sexier. Sal 
Mineo's character would have dealt with his homosexual problems. Natalie Wood 
would have been bedded down by James Dean. That's what an honest movie would 
have been in the '50s. But these movies were being made in the film code of the 
'50s". 
</P>
<P>
 The producers wanted directors who "feel the teen Angst ," Arkoff says. "You 
want to know something? I don't care if you are 20, 40 or 60 years old, we all 
develop certain ways of dealing with our emotions in our teen years. The way I 
deal with my father is something I developed in these anxious teen-age years. 
The way I deal with certain emotions is the way I dealt with them when I was 
14. We take those Angst years with us." 
</P>
<P>
 As teen-agers, he adds, "we learn a sense of independence. It's when we grew 
up. It's when our hormones are first let loose. We can all remember the unhappy 
times and the happy times. Those qualities are what we wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The first entry, "Roadracers," follows the adventures of cool, greasy-haired 
Dude (David Arquette), who wants to be a rock singer, and his sultry girlfriend 
Donna (Salma Hayek). The highlight of the film is a rumble on roller skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, 24, came to fame last year with his acclaimed debut film "El 
Mariachi," which he wrote, shot, sound-recorded, edited and directed for an 
astonishing $7,000. As far as he is concerned, "Roadracers" was a lavish 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shot this one 'Mariachi' style," he says. "The crew couldn't believe it. 
We averaged about 50 setups a day. One day we got, like, 78 setups in 12 hours. 
I grabbed the camera and started shooting the shots I needed. Fortunately, I 
can operate the camera so they couldn't tell me to slow down." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors, he says, also enjoyed the hectic pace. "They were always on the 
set. They didn't need 20 takes to warm up to get into character because they 
were always into character on the first take." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the film is heavy on action, Rodriguez storyboarded all those scenes 
to save time on the set. "We had 12 days and a million bucks. I thought it was 
all the money in the world," he recalls. "I wrote all of these big action 
scenes. I had all my actors on roller skates." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roadracers" is not based on the original film. Like many of the filmmakers, 
Rodriguez simply used the title. "They didn't let me see it because it was so 
bad. It was like a father and son racing team and they don't get along." 
</P>
<P>
 The original director of the Showtime project dropped out of the project and 
the producers called Rodriguez in December to ask him if he wanted to do the 
film, he says. "They said, 'Could you write a script in 10 days?' We got to to 
start shooting in January.' I thought this would be cool. It's a hot-rod flick, 
you have to write it in 10 days, otherwise you are thinking too much. When you 
see it, you can tell exactly what it is -- fast cars, rock 'n' roll. I set it 
all to music. I wanted to make a rockabilly opera, just nonstop music from 
beginning to end." 
</P>
<P>
 John Milius, who directed "Motorcycle Gang," made his directorial debut with 
the acclaimed 1973 AIP flick "Dillinger." Milius chose "Motorcycle Gang" 
because, he says, simply, "Why not? I never saw it. I just took a story that 
was kind of endemic to the period. What happened in those movies is that they 
always had a family crossing the desert and the family is beset by giant ants, 
cannibals or a hot rod or motorcycle gang. So in this one I have a 
dysfunctional family beset by a motorcycle gang." 
</P>
<P>
 Milius ("The Wind and the Lion," "Conan the Barbarian") describes making the 
movie as "guerrilla filmmaking." Unlike Rodriguez, he didn't preplan. "'You 
preplan, the plans will go awry. You have to learn to fall back to other 
positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before filming was to begin, the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake 
interrupted shooting plans. "We couldn't get to any of the locations since mine 
was by far, location-wise and production-wise, the most ambitious of all of 
them because it all takes place out-of-doors and in the desert. We couldn't get 
to any of those places, so we had to find alternate ways of doing it. I thought 
it was very challenging and I enjoyed the challenge a great deal." 
</P>
<P>
 But would he do it again? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," says Milius with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Dante, who directed "Runaway Daughters," ran into difficulty shooting a 
period piece in Los Angeles, though he was able to find a great drive-in in 
Azusa in the San Gabriel Valley. "There's not enough (of old L.A.) left with 
the earthquakes and everything. When you go to buildings, there are 
handicapped-access ramps and satellite dishes and parking meters from the wrong 
period. It was really a challenge on a budget like this to make a 
period-looking show that didn't have all the wrong things in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 Dante also ran into a problems with the vintage cars. "The cars very seldom 
would run so you would spend a lot of time kick-starting the motorcycle when 
you should actually be shooting something." 
</P>
<P>
 Dante ("Gremlins," "Innerspace, "The Howling,") was excited with the prospect 
of making a film in 12 days. "I've done features which have lasted two years 
from the time they started writing the script until the time the picture was 
released. My first picture ("Hollywood Boulevard") was made in 10 days. I sort 
of wanted to see if I could still do it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Dante came aboard the "Rebel Highway" project, the list of titles 
to choose from was pretty picked over. "Runaway Daughters" was the only AIP 
film he hadn't seen. "It's kind of obscure," Dante says. "When I looked at it I 
could see why. It's a 90-minute movie and it took them 70 minutes to run away." 
</P>
<P>
 Dante's "Runaway Daughters" follows the adventures of a young girl (Holly 
Fields) who thinks she is pregnant. When she tries to seek help from her high 
school boyfriend (Chris Young), he leaves town to join the Navy. She then sets 
out across the country with her two best friends (Julie Bowen, Jenny Lewis) to 
find him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the only intentional comedy in the bunch," Dante says. "It's 
probably more like the original than a lot of the other films. It is basically 
the same setup, the girls have the same problem and then they run away." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Corman, who directed numerous AIP films, and Sam Arkoff have cameos in 
"Runaway Daughters." "They must have been thrilled," Dante says. "They did it 
for scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Milius, Ralph Bakshi, who directed "Cool and the Crazy," is another AIP 
veteran. Arkoff produced Bakshi's 1973 animated film "Heavy Traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 The original "Cool and the Crazy" dealt with drugs being introduced in a 
Kansas City high school. Bakshi's version chronicles young marriages gone sour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The '50s are my whole life," Bakshi says, laughing. " Everything is '50s with 
me. In the '50s, kids got married very young. So, that's what the story's 
really about -- the fatality of getting married at 18 and 19 and being a 
working father at 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakshi's vision of the '50s is one of empty streets and luncheonettes. "The 
'50s, in certain parts of the country, were underpopulated. You didn't have as 
many cars and people as you would imagine." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there was so little pre-production time, Bakshi flew out from New York 
on his own time and money to scout locations. "'You'd be surprised how fast you 
can shoot a movie. Laurel and Hardy did it. All of those silent film guys, they 
started in the business shooting that way and made great films." 
</P>
<P>
 And coming off the 1992 live-action animated fiasco "Cool World," which was 
produced by Paramount, Bakshi was happy not to be involved in a big-budget 
feature. "I waited two days for them to light a scene" in "Cool World," he 
says. "I wanted to jump off a cliff." 
</P>
<P>
 Doing "Cool and the Crazy" reminded him of how he made his early animated 
films, "Fritz the Cat" and "Heavy Traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have the money Disney had," he says, "but what we had was the 
passion to do something."LAT

 Claudia Puig's piece on the success of KLAX-FM ("Buenos Diiiiiias, Los 
Annnnngeles!" June 12) missed one important point: the radio station's 
crossover appeal to non-Latinos. True, we listen to the station to practice our 
Spanish and learn more about the Latino culture, but it's the banda beat that 
really makes us tune in. What a great way to wake up for the morning commute!

IN A MANNER OF SPEAKING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to point out that not one of the so-called British hooligan slang 
expressions in the L.A. Speak of June 12 (by Jill Stewart, Palm Latitudes) has 
anything at all to do with hooligans. As someone well-versed in soccer as a 
player and spectator, I can state that I have never heard of fans referred to 
as "firms," and that "ground, pitch and terraces" and "man of the match" are 
not slang terms but perfectly correct descriptive nouns. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart also advises us that supporters may respond with the exclamation 
"bollocks" when someone misses a goal. Remotely possible, but highly unlikely, 
as that is the slang word for "testicles." 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 I take umbrage with Stewart's "British hooligan slang," which she reports is 
coming to the Rose Bowl via the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the British are not coming; they lost. But the Irish are coming, and 
the fact that they'll use the term "bollocks" does not qualify them as 
hooligans or Brits. Furthermore, I am not a hooligan, even though as a child 
growing up in Dublin I attended thousands of soccer games, as did my Da, my 
uncle and the local parish priest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bollocks," which derives from the male genitalia, isn't strictly soccer talk. 
It has everyday usage in Ireland and Britain, with three different spellings 
and connotations: 
</P>
<P>
 Bollix -- Said to a friend who let you down. 
</P>
<P>
 Bollox -- Failure to get something right. 
</P>
<P>
 Bollocks -- The original and most brutal term. An Irish glossary once referred 
to Oliver Cromwell as a "dirty old English Bollocks."

FACTS WE CAN NEVER UN-KNOW; THE EVOLUTION OF RACISM; HUMAN DIFFERENCES AND THE 
USE AND ABUSE OF SCIENCE BY PAT SHIPMAN (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $23; 318 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Matt Ridley, Matt Ridley's book The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of 
Human Nature, was recently published by Macmillan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose, implausibly, that Charles Darwin had never lived and nobody else had 
made his discoveries. Suppose that throughout the past century and a half we 
had remained ignorant of evolution, natural selection and the common descent of 
human beings and apes. Is it conceivable that the forced sterilization of 
36,000 Americans in the name of racism and the discrimination toward and 
oppression of black people in South Africa and elsewhere might not have 
happened? 
</P>
<P>
 "What if?" history is rarely illuminating, but in this case it is pertinent 
because some of the most murderous racists of our century explicitly appealed 
to scientific authority for their actions. Hitler's "Mein Kampf" in places 
paraphrases and plagiarizes the work of the biologist Ernst Haeckel, the man 
who championed Darwin in Germany and enjoyed great success as a popularizer of 
his own somewhat mystical and racist version of evolutionary theory. Nor, to 
quote Pat Shipman, was Nazi thinking "simply foisted on innocent and reluctant 
scientists by evil politicians." Most German scientists were enthusiastic 
eugenicists long before the Nazis came to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery that evolution works by the selective survival of superior 
strains in competition with each other had direct, vast and terrible political 
implications. It cannot claim to be free of responsibility for the political 
abuse of those implications. And yet it is also a truth. Like nuclear fission, 
natural selection and genetic variation are powerful but morally neutral facts 
that we can never un-know. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was precisely to un-know these facts that became the fashion in the 
late 1940s. Pat Shipman's book, after exploring the way racism and eugenics 
drew on far-from-innocent biology in the 1920s and 1930s, then investigates how 
liberal political assumptions drove biology into a bizarre attempt to deny 
genetic differences among people after World War II. Beginning with the vicious 
arguments over UNESCO's Statement on Race, in which the anthropologist Ashley 
Montagu argued that race is "not so much a biological phenomenon as a social 
myth" (why can't it be both?), this trend continued with the brutal ostracizing 
of the distinguished, if old-fashioned, anthropologist Carleton Coon in the 
1960s for writing a book that investigated the biology, rather than the 
sociology, of race. 
</P>
<P>
 Coon's book sounds not just insensitive, but wrong as well, to my ears. But 
Shipman defends his right to be wrong; his motives were plainly above reproach. 
This leads into some difficult territory. In May 1962, for example, Coon 
refused to allow the American Assn. of Physical Anthropologists, of which he 
was president, to vote on a resolution that all races were of equal 
intelligence -- not because he believed it was untrue, but because nobody knew 
if it was true or not and, in Shipman's paraphrase of his view, "The truth was 
the truth and would remain so, silly resolutions notwithstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking will not make scientific truths more congenial to political 
virtue. Eugenics works -- dog breeding proves it. In the 1920s there was 
nothing logically wrong with the idea that sterilizing the mentally retarded 
would (eventually and partially) reduce the rate of mental retardation, 
although there was a lot that was morally wrong with it. There is nothing 
logically wrong with the idea that human races differ genetically from one 
another -- they do. It is racism, not race, that is wrong; eugenics, not 
genetic differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipman is uncompromising in her criticism of those who would prefer not to 
know what genetic differences among human groups are: "Rather than face the 
monster, we have played instead at politicizing first evolutionary theory and 
then genetics. . . . We have fought each other . . . instead of fighting 
ignorance. In so doing we have given hate-mongers time to feed the monster. It 
has swelled on a steady diet of racial divisiveness, lies and half truths until 
it is strong enough now to destroy us all." 
</P>
<P>
 A physical anthropologist herself, Shipman has written a courageous, 
thought-provoking and elegant book. To tell the stories of both prewar eugenics 
and the postwar taboo on letting the insights of genetics and evolution into 
the study of humanity, she examines the lives of participants in the debate, 
starting with Charles Darwin himself. Extraordinary figures come alive, such as 
Rudolf Virchow, the formidable and brilliant mentor and opponent of Haeckel, 
and Ashley Montagu, the humble London Jew who renamed himself first as a 
British aristocrat and then as an American academic. It is a successful formula 
for such a book, and brings the dilemmas of politicized science naturally to 
the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipman ends her book with the story of legal scholar David Wasserman's 
innocent attempt in 1992 to hold a conference to discuss the legal implications 
of impending discoveries about the genetic basis of criminality: an admirable 
attempt to address a thorny issue before it arose. The conference was ambushed 
by political activists who saw it as part of a sinister campaign within the 
Bush Administration to justify the forced sedation or sterilization of black 
youths. They argued that, however innocent Wasserman's intentions might be, he 
could not discuss the genetics of criminality without meaning the racial 
aspects of criminality, and that scientists must bear responsibility for the 
abuse of such discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet here, for the first time, Shipman's touch fails her. For, in making the 
argument that "ignorance is never a solution," she misses a chance to go even 
further, and take up the arguments of Wasserman's critics. Those who belong to 
races that have been subject to racism have a justifiable complaint to make 
against evolutionary biology, in my view. Evolutionary biologists have studied 
race, which is not a human failing, but they have not studied racism, which is. 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings are plainly equipped with an instinct to fear, dislike, denigrate 
and be violent toward people who appear to be from other tribes, bands or 
out-groups. Latent racism (rendered patent by certain external circumstances) 
is therefore part of our nature, just as it is part of chimpanzee nature. To 
argue thus does not for a moment justify prejudice, any more than arguing that 
homicidal behavior in certain circumstances is part of human nature justifies 
murder. To design social brakes upon racism, as upon murder, we need to 
understand better what triggers the expression of the instinct. That requires 
biology as well as sociology. Let racists, for a change, be the laboratory 
rats.

ON THE TOWN: ART FOR ARTIST'S SAKE; WALTER TOOK HIS PAINTING SERIOUSLY, WHICH 
IS WHY SUCCESS CAUGHT HIM BY SURPRISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, Walter was the best young artist any of us knew, a painter of 
heroic canvases, the in-house guru to a group that used to hang out at a grimy 
former industrial complex deep Downtown that had become something of a cool, 
zillion-artist commune. 
</P>
<P>
 They were all young then, young enough to write manifestoes, naive enough to 
think they might rescue art from the commercial decadence into which they 
believed it had fallen, ambitious enough to organize sizable art exhibitions in 
unconventional spots. His friends would stay up until dawn sometimes, drinking 
plain-wrap tequila, arguing about Baudrillard or Chris Burden on a rooftop 
overlooking the L.A. River, occasionally stumbling into the sort of aesthetic 
fistfights that are not believed to happen in Los Angeles. A surprising number 
of people painted more or less the way Walter told them they should paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody made big art then, but Walter made the biggest -- giant, multi-part 
things tinted with more than a hint of social realism, and it always felt like 
a privilege to be invited to see his latest work-in-progress. Though you 
sometimes got the feeling that the paintings functioned best as an illustration 
of the aesthetic theory Walter was flirting with at the moment, the paintings 
were often astonishingly good. He refused to play the art game -- send out 
packages of slides, schmooze, invite influential people to his loft. He was 
sometimes prouder of who hadn't seen his work -- almost everybody outside the 
Downtown art scene, actually -- than of who had. 
</P>
<P>
 As years passed, others in his circle became successful, often working in the 
styles they had developed on Walter's roof, but Walter did not. He changed his 
ideas about art every few months, and his works-in-progress were often 
abandoned. (Many of them were wonderful paintings too, like the super-scale 
picture of a businessman at a shabby bus station that had something of the 
formal complexity of Velasquez.) Sometimes he'd overpaint the works to conform 
to his new theories, often until they were hopelessly muddled. He'd actually 
destroy paintings when they didn't meet his impossible standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how good a painter someone might be, the burning of one's work 
is generally incompatible with making a living. For a while, Walter had the 
ultimate Postmodern gig, as something of an art forger for the movies. Art 
directors called him up when they needed, say, a roomful of O'Keefes, and 
Walter would do them, not copies of existing paintings but new O'Keefes -- 
flowers, skulls and ocher adobe landscapes that sometimes looked better than 
the real ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Forgery was sort of the same aesthetic strategy that artists like Mark Kostabi 
were making a mint pursuing at the time, but when Walter finished his ersatz 
Paul Klees, he'd start right in on paintings of arrival, or departure, or 
whatever he'd declared was the only possible art for the times. Meanwhile, the 
Downtown art scene all but vanished, galleries closed by the score, and half a 
dozen artistic movements passed him by. Walter, who everybody suspected still 
believed in the romantic myth that the greatest artists were always ignored 
until it was too late, was a purist in a fairly impure time. 
</P>
<P>
 I lost track of Walter a few years ago, though I'd occasionally hear of 
another six-foot canvas he'd destroyed, a disbanded trio he'd played drums in. 
The group of artists clustered around him had scattered, mostly to suburbia and 
New York. Walter stayed put. He still lives near the Los Angeles River, if a 
couple of miles south, and he is still searching for the magic brushstroke, the 
style that will put him up there with Courbet. He is as obscure as ever, and as 
pure. When I ran into him at a French dip place Downtown a while ago, I was 
surprised to hear that he'd had a show of his work in Canada, and was due to 
have another in a couple of weeks. He was excited that a suite of his pictures 
was actually good enough to display. I suppose sometimes it's nice to have 
somebody actually see your art, even if it is Canadians.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Kevin Thomas

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early 1980s Chicago's finest were found to be riddled with corruption 
in a headline-making police scandal that began with a murder cover-up and 
stretched from cops on the beat to downtown magistrates to the door of the 
police chief himself. The gripping, two-part, four-hour 1992 Deadly Matrimony 
(NBC Sunday at 9 p.m., concluding Monday at 9 p.m.) peels off the layers of 
venality that poisoned Chicago's South Side until a dogged police sergeant 
named Jack Reed (Brian Dennehy) uncovered enough evidence to throw the bums in 
jail. Central to the case is the soured fairy-tale marriage of a powerful 
attorney (Treat Williams). 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Parker's intense, fictionalized Mississippi Burning (ABC Sunday at 9 
p.m.) emphasizes the clash between two very different FBI agents (Willem Dafoe, 
Gene Hackman) investigating the 1964 deaths of three civil rights workers at 
the expense of the heroic struggle for justice and equality waged by blacks 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 David S. Ward's 1991 King Ralph (KTTV Monday at 8 p.m.) is about a lovable 
boor at a royal tea party, but there's no real boorishness in it, little 
royalty and not much love either. Playing like a shameless commercial venture 
gone expensively sour, it's an empty, puffed-up blob of a comedy in which John 
Goodman plays a Vegas cocktail lounge pianist elevated to the throne of England 
when a photographic accident wipes out the Royal Family. Unfortunately, Peter 
O'Toole and John Hurt are trashed along with Goodman. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-energy futuristic 1987 sci-fi thriller about murderous TV game shows, 
The Running Man (CBS Tuesday at 9 p.m.) has a comic-book savagery that 
sometimes undercuts its own ideas about the brutalizing aspects of the mass 
media. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as a cop turned fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Teen Wolf (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.) of the film's title is Michael J. Fox, 
who plays a werewolf. It's a monstrously forced and unfunny comedy of 
modern-day lycanthropy, blood, basketball and babes: a Rod Daniel-directed 
fiasco that mysteriously caught on in 1985, a bad year for movies. 
</P>
<P>
 American Ninja 2: The Confrontation (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) is cursed with a 
story involving two American soldiers (Michael Dudikoff, Steve James) 
transferred to a tropical isle in the clutches of a megalomaniacal drug czar; 
it is all so preposterous that nothing short of mutiny could make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of director Don Siegel and Clint Eastwood is potent enough 
that the 1971 Dirty Harry (KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m.) has become a classic 
example of the kind of rabble-rousing film you ought to hate but find hard to 
resist. Eastwood's Harry is that scrappy San Francisco cop not about to take 
the law into his own hands in order to try to nab a Zodiac-like killer. 
</P>
<P>
 KCET's Saturday night Southern-drama double feature is Fred Zinnemann's 
acclaimed 1952 film of Carson McCuller's The Member of the Wedding (at 9 p.m.), 
with Ethel Waters, Julie Harris and Brandon De Wilde, and The Fugitive Kind, 
Sidney Lumet's uneven 1959 film of Tennessee Williams' "Orpheus Descending," 
starring Marlon Brando, Anna Magnani and Joanne Woodward (at 10:30 p.m.).

CHANNELING SIMPSON HEARING

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks a lot to KCOP-TV Channel 13 for being the only local station that does 
not interrupt normal programming to broadcast every last detail of the O.J. 
Simpson saga. Do we really need to see the exact same broadcast on all seven 
stations? What kind of public service is that? We need choices.

 (DI & I) by Peter Lefcourt. (Random House: $20; 300 pp.) Picture Princess 
Diana in a yellow tract house in Rancho Cucamonga, mousy-brown hair in a bun, 
eating homemade cookies in the kitchen while Princes William and Henry, crew 
cut, shoot hoops in the driveway.Tonight there's PTA and league bowling with 
Leonard -- Leonard Schecter, the screenwriter who brought her here. Picture 
Princess Di, happy as a hog. 
</P>
<P>
 This is sublime summer reading; a never-never love story, semi-plausible 
adventure and hymn to the humdrum, spiked with devastating shots at the Royal 
Family. (Di and Fergie call them "the Germans": "It's all that intermarriage in 
the 19th Century. They talk about fertilizer and castrating horses at tea.") 
They will not be amused. You will. Tracked by a heat-seeking ex-wife, Leonard, 
signed for a miniseries on Di, flees to London to absorb "verisimilitude." He 
meets Di at a reception. They click. What does he do, she asks. He's writing an 
epic poem about her, he lies. She wants a peek. He labors all night, foals "The 
Dianiad" (not bad). They meet clandestinely for tea. She confides that she's 
"desperately unhappy": Life with Charles is "sitting at his feet in rapture as 
he drones on about organic rutabagas. . . . I would start yawning after a 
while. That was my crime. I yawned." They love, they thrive. They get caught, 
and so will you.

 THE DAY ELVIS MET NIXON by Egil "Bud" Krogh (Pejama Press: $18.95; 61 pp.) 
You've seen the postcard, the T-shirt, the kitchen magnet. Now comes the book, 
chronicling the fateful half-hour Oval Office summit between the King and the 
Prez in 1970. According to author Egil "Bud" Krogh, a Watergate hand who served 
4 months and 17 days in federal prison for his role in the Ellsberg break-in, 
Elvis Presley showed Richard Nixon photos of wife Priscilla and daughter Lisa 
Marie, police badges he had collected across the nation and the cuff links on 
his shirt. The President, for his part, handed out tie clasps and possibly -- 
Krogh isn't sure -- golf balls, cuff links and pins. Nixon also directed White 
House photographer Ollie Atkins to memorialize the scene, and discussed the 
nation's drug problem with his guest. "Just be sure you keep your credibility," 
the President advised the King shortly before the session broke up. Krogh's 
brightly illustrated account is a rather thorough presentation. Indeed, the 
book takes just as long to pore through as the meeting itself took. By 
reprinting the 10 frames shot by Atkins, Krogh also demonstrates that pictures 
are often worth at least a thousand words. Of particular note are the awkward 
look on Nixon's face as Elvis showed him his gewgaws and the spare look of 
Nixon's Oval Office. His bookshelves, rather than containing books, were 
repositories for at least seven life-size models of birds. Krogh says in his 
introduction: "I don't claim that all direct quotes represent exactly what was 
said in the meeting or at other times during the day.But I'm comfortable that 
the words I've quoted are pretty close." One other thing: The book contains a 
copy of an April 14, 1994, letter from Nixon himself, congratulating Krogh on 
its publication and adding that he was "greatly impressed by Elvis' sincerity." 
Four days later, Nixon suffered the stroke that led to his death. Coincidence?

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE MUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Greg Spring 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, soppy verse about riding the range, sleeping under the stars and 
cooking over a campfire has been a strictly male pastime. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Wronsky and Molly Bendall are the authors of "Calamity and Belle," 
perhaps the world's only collection of cowgirl verse. The two poets and 
university instructors were discussing the cowboy poetry craze and, figuring 
they could do better, "Calamity" Wronsky wrote a brief cow girl poem and sent 
it to "Belle" Bendall, who responded with a short ode that included the lament, 
"I'm armed/with a pearl-handled pistol/but not your love." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just something we were doing to amuse ourselves," says Wronsky, who 
teaches writing at Loyola Marymount University. "It was a big hoot. I thought 
we'd get tired of it and stop, but we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Their inside joke soon became a collection of some 60 pieces, enough for a 
book. Publishing house Gibbs Smith agreed, and "Calamity and Belle" hit the 
stores late last year. It was successful enough that a sequel is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The Old West "is not just the province of men," says Bendall, a USC English 
instructor. "Women are discovering it's their mythology too." Greg Spring

PALM LATITUDES: PLAYTHINGS; HOT WHEELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Colby

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, the Schwinn Bicycle Co. caught the imagination of American 
youth with the Sting-Ray -- a style revolution on wheels with a banana seat, 
sissy bar and ape-hanger handlebars. Sales dwindled in the '70s and Schwinn 
stopped producing the bikes in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few years, the Sting-Ray has once again become a hot item at 
flea markets, garage sales and on the streets of Southern California. Their 
buyers -- mostly Latinos, but increasingly other ethnic groups, too -- trick 
the bikes up to create their own two-wheeled lowrider fantasies, complete with 
chrome plating, fancy paint jobs and whitewall tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Blake, owner of Dennison Cyclery in East L.A., says, "Their older 
brothers have lowrider cars, and they can't have a car, so they say, 'Hey, I'll 
have a bike instead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Tula, 14, of Bassett, started building his lowrider bicycle about three 
years ago. His prize-winning bike looks like a '50s chopper with gold-plated 
handlebars, tall sissy bar, customized frame and murals of the  
</P>
<P>
 Mexican flag and an Aztec Indian. "I got the idea from my dad's Harley," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank's father, Paul Tula, 37, says he encourages the hobby because it keeps 
his son off the streets, teaches him responsibility and gives him something to 
be proud of. Father and son work on the bike together, and weekend exhibitions 
are a family affair. Frank earns money to pay for the bike by working at his 
father's battery shop after school.  
</P>
<P>
 Lowrider magazine editors noticed the trend at auto shows a few years ago, 
when they saw customized lowrider bicycles on display alongside the lowrider 
cars. The magazine started publishing photos of the bikes and in December 
launched a separate publication called Lowrider Bicycle, which sold out its 
first run of 60,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 What started in East L.A. appears to be spreading. Lowrider bikes are now 
being seen at car shows in Florida, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Sacramento, Hawaii 
and Tokyo. European MTV was on location at a recent lowrider show at Garfield 
High School. And a Dana Point surfer came into Dennison's looking for a "cool" 
lowrider bike the other day. Shop owner Blake says, "We're getting calls from 
Iowa." Anne Colby

 WHEN CHINA RULED THE SEAS: The Treasure Fleet of the Dragon Throne, 1403-1433 
by Louise Levathes. (Simon & Schuster: $23; 256 pp.) Off the coast of what is 
now Kenya, tribesmen watched dumbstruck as dozens of ships, scores of them, a 
city of ships, appeared over the horizon, ships 400 feet long with sails of red 
silk, with serpents' eyes painted on their prows, with thunderous drums, with 
hundreds of horses aboard, and 28,000 men and treasures not yet dreamed of in 
Africa. The year was 1418. Columbus would not be born for 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
 It could have been a turning point in history, should have been. The Middle 
Kingdom was preeminent, as well, in science, mathematics, medicine, art, 
commerce, technology, while Europe was just stumbling out of the Middle Ages, a 
raggedly clutch of states ignored by the lordly Chinese as good for only wine 
and wool. What wealth existed beyond China was to be found in India, Malaya, 
the Persian Gulf. All deferred to China; all paid tribute. There was no limit 
to China's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 And then it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Levathes, probing and synthesizing contemporary Ming Dynasty accounts, writes 
an absorbing adventure story of which the West remains largely ignorant. Her 
history revolves about Zhu Di, one of China's rare megalomaniacal emperors 
(self-styled "Lord of the Realm of the Face of the Earth"), and his brilliant, 
steadfast lieutenant, Zheng He, a Muslim, a eunuch and commander of the fabled 
Treasure Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the enterprise stop abruptly after 30 years? Levathes tells it best, 
but blame -- or credit -- the post-Zhu-Di Confucians, who insisted, quaintly, 
that the welfare of the people was more important than profit, that maintaining 
garrisons halfway around the word was foolish. Writes Levathes: "It would take 
European colonial powers another 400 years to reach the same conclusion."

 THE I HATE MADONNA HANDBOOK by Ilene Rosenzweig. (Thomas Dunne/St. Martin's: 
$12.95; 128 pp., paper) Wit eludes her. So does humor, running the gamut from 
bras to brass.Sensual? In 32 years of sweaty moil, Madonna has yet to achieve 
what Gypsy Rose Lee could do in two minutes -- with a glove. She can't sing ("a 
sheep in pain," in the enlightened estimation of critic Dennis Hunt). She can't 
dance. She's mean, says author Ilene Rosenzweig, self-absorbed and greedy and 
manipulative and vicious, "a small person with big armpits." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenzweig was a fan, she confesses, but now she has put away childish things. 
Almost. She can't resist this spiteful little book, part catharsis, part 
capitalization. No dummy, Rosenzweig knows the book, raps and all, will be 
bought by Madonna acolytes, and she has pitched it to their level, writing from 
the prone position. There is a chapter on the people Madonna has trampled, and 
how; one called "25 Lowlights in a Career of Amazing Disgrace"; a paper doll 
with cut-out clothes; a pop quiz; a board game whose object is to land on a 
space where you're least likely to encounter Madonna (Prague, Sean Penn's pad), 
that sort of thing. In short, a book as sophomoric as its subject. Jejune is 
busting out all over.

 THE SECRET LIFE OF THE SEINE by Mort Rosenblum. (Addison-Wesley: $12; 290 pp.) 
The title is arbitrary. It could have been "The Secret Life of Mort Rosenblum's 
Houseboat" -- its valves, its neighbors, its overhauls, its disappearing cat, 
its encounters with mind-blowing flotsam, its expense.In the main, though, it's 
about the Seine, hardly the world's most alluring river but one of its best 
loved. Rosenblum is a lover, the latest of a long line of lovers from the 
ancient Romans, who worshiped at her source, through Monet ("The Impressionists 
revered light, and she personified it"), to the clochards -- the bums -- who 
sleep under her bridges: "We feel more at home here. One's dreams have more 
distinction." 
</P>
<P>
 So forgive the author his highly personal take, generous and quirky. Rather, 
applaud it. The Seine itself is a highly personal river, generous, too, in its 
way, and very, very quirky. Wail with Rosenblum as he blots up the river's 
unspeakable filth. (Elsewhere, one asks a fisherman how they're biting. Here, 
it's "Are you going to eat that? " Smile with him (a lot, in this book) at the 
Abbey of St. Wandrille, still functioning after 12 centuries, whose monks wear 
beepers under their cassocks; at the mysterious Seine-side address where "Hugo 
took a few hits" but "Balzac didn't inhale." 
</P>
<P>
 But never, never commiserate with Rosenblum, a correspondent for the AP and 
former editor of the Paris Trib, when he tells you how tough and expensive it 
is to live on a houseboat in the Seine. It's a ruse. He's got it made, and he's 
made us all wildly jealous. Next time you're in Paris, drop in on him. Serve 
him right for spilling the beans.

 Monsieur Hire (Bravo Monday at 6 p.m.) is the underrated 1989 film that stars 
Michel Blanc as a mysterious bachelor-voyeur and Sandrine Bonnaire as the 
sensual young woman upon whom he preys. They are luminous enough to warrant a 
watch, but this film is not in the same league with the Claude Chabrol films it 
recalls.

 Re Tom Shales' commentary "Slamming the Door on 'Today' " (TV Times, July 3). 
Absolutely right on! "The Today Show's" "window on the world" seems as though 
Paddy Chayefsky's "Network" has been reincarnated as a television series.

 WHAT IS TOLD by Askold Melynczuk. (Faber and Faber: $21.95; 216 pp.) Keep 
alive the old tales, says Zenon Zabobon. They are "truer than the stories in 
the papers."Not everyone agrees. When historian Zabobon is jailed once again 
for defending the Ukranian ethos, this time against the Germans, wife Natalka, 
a pragmatic peasant, attacks his library with a pair of scissors, snipping the 
pages "into a pile of dead worms." Books can't stop bullets, she says. Nor can 
bullets stop the Zabobons, not all of them. Descendants of nutty old King Toor, 
the clan flees Ukraine's latest predators, winding up, of all places, in New 
Jersey (someone has told them it's the Garden State). There they bicker, 
palaver, plot, resist Americanization and retell the tales of Toor, who talked 
with trees and routed the Tartars while the queen sheared the vegetable lamb 
she'd grown from seed. Wistful and idiosyncratic, "What Is Told" is a narrative 
of defiance, resignation, perseverance. Askold Melynczuk in his fine first 
novel taps into the Ukranian psyche with the fatalistic, almost existential 
humor only the frequently occupied can -- and must -- summon, especially in 
America, "where freedom was nearly as threatening as its opposite."

 "Ruff, Ruff, Ruff! Ruff Ruff!" 
</P>
<P>
 What's that, girl? You're going to be featured in a Nickelodeon marathon? And 
in a Paramount movie opening Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 Good girl! Good girl!

 Somehow, that brilliant canine Lassie always managed to communicate her 
message -- however complicated -- with the many owners she had in the 20 years 
she was on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Nickelodeon honors the popular collie by featuring her in five 
classic episodes. The lineup includes two "lost" episodes that haven't aired on 
Nick yet, including a show from the 1960 season, where Lassie and Timmy (Jon 
Provost), one of her earliest owners, are exposed to radioactive chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the many changes in Lassie's masters, the show remained popular for 
two decades, and spawned a sequel series, as well as an animated series. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't mind those changes," Diane Robina of Nickelodeon's acquisitions 
department says, "because Lassie was the running theme, Lassie was always 
saving the day; the foundation of the story was always there. The ones that 
work best are the ones with Lassie and Jeff (her first owner) or Timmy." 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Lassie' is the ultimate wholesome programming," Robina observes. "It's a 
simple story about a boy and his dog, their connection and that friendship that 
they have." 
</P>
<P>
 The show has special meaning to children, she says. "Kids connect to the show, 
they love the animals, and parents like their kids to watch it and can share in 
it. It could be a nostalgia thing for parents, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lassie" originally aired on CBS from 1954 through 1971 and then for three 
seasons in syndication; Nickelodeon owns all of these shows. An animated 
series, "Lassie's Rescue Rangers" ran on CBS from 1973 to 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Now seen on the Family Channel, "The New Lassie" was syndicated from 1989 
through 1991 and featured an adult Jon Provost, who was Timmy in the original 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Lassie" marathon airs Sunday from 8:30 p.m. to 11 p.m. on Nickelodeon. 
"Lassie" airs weekdays at 1:30 p.m. on Nickelodeon. "The New Lassie" airs 
weekdays at 6:30 p.m. on the Family Channel. For ages 6 and up. More Family

featured Sunday is "Doug and the Little Liar" in which Doug is convinced that 
Skeeter's new girlfriend, Loretta, is a liar, and Skeeter is blindly being 
taken for a ride. For ages 3 to 10.

FOCUS; THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH?; HBO FILM ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MAN 
WHO MADE A 'SUPER GUN' POSES QUESTIONS OF REAL INTRIGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Who shot Gerald Bull twice in the head outside his Brussels apartment on the 
morning of March 22, 1990? Why was the portly 62-year-old Canadian arms 
designer assassinated? Were the governments of the United States, Great 
Britain, Iraq, Iran, Israel or South Africa responsible? 
</P>
<P>
 Bull was in the process of building a "super gun" for Saddam Hussein on the 
eve of the Iraqi dictator's invasion of Kuwait. The murder precipitated the 
biggest political scandal Britain has seen in years. The extent of U.S. 
involvement, if any, in Bull's operation has not yet been disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 HBO's thriller "Doomsday Gun," which airs Saturday, addresses this labyrinth 
of questions. Frank Langella stars as the mysterious weapons innovator; Alan 
Arkin, James Fox and Kevin Spacey co-star. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information in the public record, the script is outrageous enough for 
Langella to say, " 'Doomsday Gun' reaffirms what a pawn I am in my government. 
... Americans are amazingly unsophisticated about this. ... I think this movie 
will shock a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his suite at the Athenaeum Hotel following a day of filming at 
Twickenham Studios, Langella talks with grim fascination about the man he 
plays. In 1972, Gerald Bull was granted American citizenship by a special act 
of Congress because of his work for NASA. He later designed weapons systems for 
China, Israel and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bull's real interest was in developing the world's biggest weapon -- a 
super gun with a barrel the length of two football fields, capable of firing a 
shell the size of a telephone booth 500 miles. At the height of the Iran-Iraq 
War, he found a patron in Hussein. Bull was so consumed by the scientific 
challenge that he ignored the international arms embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "To other people, Bull was a devil," Langella says. "To me, he was a 
compulsive, megalomaniacal, blinkered genius. When you're playing someone, you 
can't step outside and morally judge them. Bull's drive was to create the 
greatest weapon, and he paid for it with his life." 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the role, Langella met with Bull's second-in-command, 
Christopher Cowley, a consultant on the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris and I talked for five hours. I pumped him about what Bull was like, how 
he felt about things. I had to find a way not to judge the man. I have little 
kids, and this gun will kill kids." 
</P>
<P>
 On another production day, Fox stands alone, feeding the ducks, at the edge of 
the Serpentine, a lake in the middle of Hyde Park. An innocent Sunday outing, 
except that Fox's character, a British intelligence agent, was about to 
rendezvous with a CIA contact (Spacey). The topic of conversation: what Bull 
has been up to lately. 
</P>
<P>
 To subvert the arms embargo, Bull had arranged to have different components of 
the super gun made throughout Europe. They would then be assembled on-site in 
Iraq. He ordered the gun barrel from a British manufacturer, describing it as 
an oil pipe. After Bull's death, British customs impounded the huge metal 
cylinders, identifying them as gun barrels en route to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting brouhaha, which became part of a government investigation known 
as the Scott Inquiry in Britain, is just now concluding. British producer 
Michael Deakin says, "Publicly, Britain's policy was not to provide arms to 
Iraq. But we were doing it, as indeed were the Americans. Bull knew it was 
illegal, and the British knew it was illegal, but we could keep an eye on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, customs was uninfluenced by the government. When they seized those 
great, huge tubes and said they were gun barrels, the prime minister's press 
secretary had an off-the-record briefing saying customs have gone mad. Customs 
got enraged and said the government was lying and waved around copies of Bull's 
book. Some very senior customs person blew the whistle, but who told customs? 
In the film, Kevin Spacey does, but in reality nobody knows. Maybe it was the 
Mossad," Israel's foreign intelligence agency. 
</P>
<P>
 So who shot Bull? 
</P>
<P>
 "We could make five different movies with five different reasons," director 
Robert Young adds. "Bull knew a lot about a lot of people, and he had reason to 
be worried. He was constantly going to MI6 (Britain's intelligence service), 
the CIA and Mossad, telling them what he was doing. He was helping Iraq with 
their Scud missiles -- a dangerous pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 "To pursue his dream, he was feeding the jackals. Who was providing and using 
end-user certificates? Bull could blow the whistle. The easiest thing to do was 
to kill him. I don't know who did it. I change my opinion from day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bull was killed because he was naive," Fox says. 'He didn't realize he knew 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we began, mine was the standard view -- the Mossad," producer Deakin 
says about who killed Bull. "Now, everybody thinks it was the British. Bull 
knew so much about what the Scott Inquiry was inquiring into.' 
</P>
<P>
 The Scott Inquiry actually borrowed HBO's super gun model for one of its 
hearings, and was aware of the full-scale replica that HBO built in the Spanish 
desert out of fiberglass, cardboard and sewage pipes. "I had this fantasy that 
Israel would see it on their satellite and take it out," Deakin says. That 
didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doomsday Gun" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

PALM LATITUDES: MELTING POT; EMPIRE OF THE SONG

 Of the seemingly ubiquitous bands of Andean musicians roving through Southern 
California, at least one is trying to do more than play a few tunes and make a 
few bucks: Llaqtaymanta, a street band from Ecuador, is reviving memories of an 
ancient past. The musicians roam the continents playing the songs of 
Tahuantinsuyu, the Inca Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incas still exist," says musician/manager Jaime Farinango. "We maintain our 
identity, our culture and tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer for the past three years, the band has broadcast a message 
of brotherhood and peace on sidewalks, at festivals, parties and weddings. With 
the sampona, charango and guitar, they resurrect Incan tunes as well as 
melodies of their own composition. In winter, however, they put away their 
instruments to sell bundles of wool sweaters woven and knitted by the women of 
their towns. The money they earn funds their crusade to showcase their Incan 
heritage throughout the Americas, Europe and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to rescue our culture. Through our music we try to show people 
that our culture is very much alive and is prosperous," says Alonso Ruiz, who 
plays wind instruments like the sampona, a pan flute made of sugar cane and 
bamboo that originated in Bolivia. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Spanish, Quechua and Aymara lyrics don't make the greatest 
sing-alongs, crowds circle Llaqtaymanta, clapping, cheering and often buying 
CDs and tapes. "People here approach us and congratulate us because they've 
never heard anything like it. They say they're sick of rock 'n' roll," says 
Farinango. 
</P>
<P>
 William Farinango, Jaime's 19-year-old brother, says children dance and reach 
for the instruments he plays, such as the charango, a 10-stringed ukulele 
look-alike made of armadillo shell or wood. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of Llaqtaymanta plan to stay in Southern California for another 
year or so. They can't linger too long, however, for there's an empire to 
rebuild. Karla Perez Villalta

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; SOUNDING RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Janet Kinosian

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My silent treatments started four years ago. Stressed out, worn out and wigged 
out, I wanted out -- of town, that is. But I was in no shape to make travel 
plans, so a friend of mine took one look at me and, over my feeble 
protestations, signed me up for a retreat in Palos Verdes shepherded by a 
Benedictine monk. A silent retreat. No talking allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 I had never meditated in my life, nor have I ever been accused of harboring 
even the vaguest New Age tendencies. The possibility of my remaining silent for 
more than 10 minutes was a remote one. But my friend insisted and, besides, she 
was going, so I figured if things got too painful we could sneak in a 
conversation or two. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, there were moments when water torture or self-flagellation would 
have seemed more pleasant, but I quickly discovered something amazing: Once the 
burden of speech is lifted, so go all the social obligations and deliberations 
that clutter up your mind and time. Suddenly, I didn't have to decide or 
discuss a damn thing. All I had to do was show up and shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 Relieved of the usual distractions and endless, crucial daily chitchat, the 
mind and spirit can pay attention instead to thinking and reflecting in an 
internal workout called "meditative listening." It's amazing what you can hear 
when you stop talking  
</P>
<P>
 We were pretty much on our own. Some read, some slept; I prayed and attended 
lectures on spirituality given by the monk. He invited questions, but I had 
turned purist and couldn't think of anything worth breaking my silence to say. 
</P>
<P>
 By weekend's end, I left reluctantly, arriving home so deeply refreshed I knew 
I had hit pay dirt. Since then, I've done my silent treatments in the 
California desert; in an old mansion in Montecito; in a cubicle in Big Sur, 
where monks serve your meals to you, prison-like, through a vestibule door; in 
a castle nunnery in France. I look to them as my yearly safety valve. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, I'm not the only one anxious for silence. There are now several 
books that list retreats all over the country for the increasing numbers of 
"silent disciplined." And the last time I visited the Montecito retreat, nuns 
informed me that I should call May 1 at 9 a.m. sharp for a summer slot: So 
great is the stampede for silence that by 11 a.m. the entire summer is booked. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing thing, silence. A sound you rarely hear. Janet Kinosian

OH, FOR A SHELTERED LIFE; HOUSE RULES, BY HEATHER LEWIS (DOUBLEDAY: $21.95; 321 
PP.)

<P>
 This novel is hard to read and hard to put down. It's about ugly things, and 
it feels weighed down, leaden, hopeless -- rightly so, because its narrator 
lives in a world where hope has never been discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen-year-old Lee has been kicked out of boarding school for doing drugs, 
and for the first chapter or so we're tricked into thinking hers is the normal 
panic of a kid who doesn't want to face her parents. She's already made plans, 
she tells them when she calls home; she'll stay with Silas and work for him at 
the stable, as she has since she was 8 years old. She cons a friend out of her 
Visa card, sells her remaining dope and flies -- molested en route by a 
traveling businessman -- to Florida, where Silas has taken his horses on the 
show circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee loves the horses, and she's a good rider, so there's no problem getting 
her old job back -- riding for Silas and for the Cheslers, a staid, old-money 
family. But when she gets involved with Tory, a champion rider with a bad 
reputation, we begin to realize that something other than the usual adolescent 
rebellion is going on. The attraction between Tory and Lee is real, but the sex 
is rough. But Lee doesn't resist; in fact, the moments when Tory treats her 
tenderly are when she withdraws. Bit by bit, we learn that the only tenderness 
Lee has experienced is from her father, who, with her mother's collusion, has 
sexually abused her since she was a small girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Tory has strange, dark ties to her employers, Carl and Linda Rusker. When Lee 
begins riding for them, she finds that Carl uses brutal methods to train his 
horses, and Linda eases their resulting pain with narcotics. Lee slips into an 
affair with Linda, who's even more sadistic than Tory, and she discovers that 
Linda sedates her riders with the same drugs she uses on the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds ugly? You're right -- it is. But it rings true. We begin to understand 
why Lee lets people do what they will to her as we learn more about what her 
own father has done to her all her life. There's never been a safe haven for 
this child. The book is a stunning portrait of a young woman who's been 
stripped of any sense of personal power. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee moves almost woodenly from bedroom to show ring, from the back seat of a 
car to her next fix, without any need to reign in her emotions -- her feelings 
are buried so deep we suspect she might never find them. On top of all this, 
she suffers the normal anxieties of a teen-ager -- fear of looking stupid, fear 
of doing or saying the wrong thing. Above all, she's looking for someone to 
love her. But she can't open up to anyone. She even rejects Silas, the only 
person with a healthy desire to help her -- she doesn't trust him, because she 
believes his kindness will leave her at his mercy. In her experience, trust has 
always victimized her. 
</P>
<P>
 Only during competition, on the back of a horse, does Lee have any sense of 
control. What's interesting is that, with horses, she knows when to let them 
have their way and when to rein them in. And when it comes to animals, Lee 
recognizes abuse. Toward the end of the book, as she watches what Carl and 
Linda do to their horses and sees what they've done to Tory, she begins to make 
connections to what they're doing to her. She dimly senses that there may be 
alternatives. But with no idea of what her choices may be, she's got a long way 
to go; it's hard to see how she can ever work her way out. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty with this book is the play-by-play description of sexual 
violence. In encounter after encounter, people are hurting each other -- mostly 
they're hurting Lee -- and we feel every blow. I wanted to skip a lot of it. 
But this meticulous reportage leads us to understand that Lee herself is 
immersed in details, and there's no way she can lift her head to see a bigger 
picture. Too, we can't help being a little titillated when we read the 
particulars of sexual encounters; and the shame we feel at our reaction gives 
us a tiny taste of Lee's complicated and overwhelming shame. 
</P>
<P>
 At times the narrator over-explains, spelling out her assessments of 
motivations and influences, and we wonder how a girl of that age can recognize 
what's going on. But that's part of victimhood, too; a person living under 
chronic abuse learns to be always alert -- to avert the coming blow, to defuse 
situations that can explode and, most useful of all, to take her awareness, her 
mind and self, right out of her predicament: to see it from a distance and 
remain, in some hidden inmost part, untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure I'd recommend this book; I know I don't want to read it again. It 
can't have been an easy book to write. I hope the author's next novel will have 
more pleasure and less pain to report.

HOUSE OF HORRORS; THE MUSEUM OF LOVE, BY STEVE WEINER (THE OVERLOOK PRESS: 
$21.95; 214 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Clark, Tom Clark is the author of The Exile of Celine (Random House). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his fiction debut, Steve Weiner bypasses naturalism in favor of a 
hyperactive surrealism, by turns gruesome and lyrical, ecstatic and grotesque. 
</P>
<P>
 A picaresque noir tale of religious mania and obsessional quest, "The Museum 
of Love" presents in lieu of conventional story line a mosaic of hallucinatory 
fragments, with only the most tenuous grounding in everyday, familiar 
"reality." The deranged young protagonist's erratic journey across North 
America, although nominally taking place in the mid-'50s (there are fleeting 
references to Eisenhower's presidency and the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu is 
actually filtered through a very contemporary consciousness, schooled in the 
labyrinth of deconstruction. Weiner's prose techniques echo not only the 
delirious raw immediacy of the novels of Celine, Burroughs and Genet, but the 
cinematic disjunctions of Kronenberg and Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking any true narrative structure, the book is loosely organized around a 
series of epiphanous, fetishistic exhibits or displays, significant stations in 
the hero's strange pilgrimage of self-discovery: the so-called "museums" he 
comes across in his cross-country odyssey. Each "museum" showcases a theme: 
"Orphans," "Love," "Religion," "Suicide," "Death." (Weiner's "museum"-displays 
variously recall the Parisian 19th-Century closed arcades, with their revolving 
"panoramas," which so fascinated culture-critic Walter Benjamin, and the 
haunting surrealistic box constructions of artist Joseph Cornell.) 
</P>
<P>
 In a run-down back street of Chicago, for instance, where in a late stage of 
his wanderings he winds up a derelict, Weiner's protagonist/narrator visits 
"the museum of love," a collection of phantasmagoric, diorama-like spectacles 
mounted in a former Christian Science church: 
</P>
<P>
 "In a six-foot-high diorama Indian women wild-riced. The moon was bright, 
silver crossed by flying silhouettes. Owls, badgers and muskrats peered from 
bracken. A moose foraged in shallows. A bigger moose with antlers mounted the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the second diorama a midnight hawk flew through the north woods. Below 
were a winding river, moonlit lakes, a tavern. I put a nickel in the slot. A 
chrome ball rolled down a forest road and dropped through a hole, came out 
below, rolled between miniature pine trees and dropped into a darker hole, 
which triggered a light in the tavern: plump and pink, a woman knelt on 
pillows." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously Weiner is not without expressive resources as a writer. He is 
especially adept at turning up the dark secrets hidden in the somber Upper 
Great Lakes landscape, which provides the setting of his early chapters. In 
these he demonstrates a gift for evoking place and mood in lurid, surreal 
tones, dusting the rough substantives of his tale with macabre lights and hues. 
The atmosphere of dream and distortion thus created is enhanced by the novel's 
brisk, staccato pacing, as Weiner moves his narrative forward with an 
unsettling stop-and-go progress. That jerky pace mimes the disturbed -- and 
disturbing -- disjunctive mental processes of his protagonist, a French 
Canadian youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean-Michel is a young fellow with more than his share of problems. He is 
haunted by terrible hallucinations, morbid dreams of corruption and decay. And 
little wonder, for he suffers multiple impediments, from a speech defect and a 
stunted leg to a particularly horrifying family life. Indeed, the repulsive 
tale of serial necrophilia with which the novel opens (and which sets its tone) 
-- a homicidal farmer "disassembles" and grotesquely reconstructs the exhumed 
bodies of women -- is told by Jean-Michel's father, a crude, brutish and 
oppressive Canuck prison guard from whom our hero spends much of the book on 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ed Gien had dug up women from the Lutheran cemetery, brushed them with resin 
and beeswax, and dressed them in his dead mother's shawls. He made ashtrays of 
their joints and lampshades and upholstery of their skin. Vises held rotted 
women's limbs in steel ball-and-socket armatures. Hip, breast, hair and thigh 
twirled over our heads from black fishing wire. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Woman,' my father whistled. 'Disassembled.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To get through "The Museum of Love" one will need a strong stomach, not only 
to digest the recurrent, vivid and graphic shock-imagery of bodily function and 
disfunction, mutilation, flesh-pulverization and flying blood and guts, but to 
handle the novel's heavy-duty philosophical and psychological menu. There is 
much heady riffing on themes of anti-Colonialism and sexual ambiguity, a major 
dollop of Catholic guilt-complex served up in the form of the narrator's 
relentless fixation on physical degeneration, and above all a hyper-insistent 
preoccupation with the topic of deconstruction. More dismembered bodies, 
chopped, diced and splattered, litter the random trail of Jean-Michel's travels 
than Jeffrey Dahmer could shake a fork at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lives are incoherent," Jean-Michel's father declares on his death bed. 
That's certainly the singular message this promising but problematic novel 
projects. For all its energy, "The Museum of Love" is cheerless. Then again, 
perhaps, in the cafe nihilism ambience of the mid-'90s, a bland acceptance of 
the senselessness of existence has become aesthetically de rigeur. Have we 
Twin-Peaked ourselves into a frazzle of hallucinated ennui, our tolerance of 
the insanity of postmodern life so total as to render incoherence chic?

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: AN OCEAN RAN THROUGH HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN ZIMMERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Daaaaaaaddddd!!!!!! I hooked myself!!!!!" The panicked cry echoed off the 
nearby cliffs and sent me racing into the surf to my 6-year-old son Jeffrey, 
who had managed to impale himself during his fishing debut. I gently pulled the 
hook out, a few tears were shed and he rebounded quickly and popped back into 
the surf trailing his line behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 This adventure was prompted by "The Kids Book of Fishing and Tackle Box" by 
writer-illustrator Michael J. Rosen (Workman Publishing: $12.95), a nifty 
little kit complete with three hooks and sinkers, 30 feet of monofilament line, 
one weight and one bobber in a small plastic tackle box as well as an 
introductory book about the sport. The kit is adequate for first-timers but the 
real treasure is the slim paperback -- a well-written and well-illustrated 
guide that packs an incredible amount of information into its 96 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't take my word for it -- I'm not a fan. An avid fly fisherman perused 
the book and called it "excellent, a very nice job, particularly in the chapter 
sidebars." He also praised the book's ecological focus and fish-friendly 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 As to why I needed a book for something as "simple" as fishing, trust me -- 
this is a complicated, arcane world. Studying the cabala is a walk in the park 
compared to walking into a tackle shop and asking "What do I need to take my 
son fishing?," especially if you don't know the difference between a spinner 
and a spoon, a perch and a bluegill. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I had ruled out the lakes in the area as being too far away, I offered 
Jeffrey a choice of the ocean or a trout pond in Agoura. I explained to him 
that at the for-profit trout pond we'd have to kill the fish and remove it 
while at the beach we could release it and send it on its way. This started a 
philosophical debate that lasted into the night -- Jeffrey didn't want to kill 
any fish but also didn't want to be near any place where he "might catch a 
shark and get pulled in." 
</P>
<P>
 After ruling out some not-so-obvious options ("Can we put the fish on ice and 
freeze him and release him in Colorado?"), we finally agreed to try the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 We got up bright and late the next day (hey, I couldn't miss "Garfield and 
Friends") and headed out to the wilds of Palos Verdes Estates -- which turned 
out to be exactly six miles further than those lakes I had rejected -- where my 
friend Lauren and her son Michael lived. They had volunteered to be our guides. 
Michael, age 6, was a seasoned veteran -- the kid has an expert side-arm 
casting technique and carries a serious Daiwa rod and reel. Jeffrey had to make 
do with a fig-tree branch I had pruned a few weeks earlier. (I know, I know -- 
he can tell his therapist 40 years from now about how I traumatized him. Oh, 
the shame of it all.) 
</P>
<P>
 We headed for Flat Rock beach, which turned out to be too tough a cliff-side 
descent for two worried parents. We then drove over to the Rolling Hills 
Preparatory School and hiked down the asphalt trail to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting up on the rocks, we encountered our first problem: Jeffrey discovered 
hundreds of tiny crabs that hide in the tide pools . . . and decided they were 
going to eat him. Michael set up a few yards away and cast off; Jeffrey calmed 
down and got into it after I gently reassured him ("Kid, if you think I drove 
700 miles to come here and not fish, you are sadly mistaken!"). And promptly 
hooked a rock. And lost sinker No. 1 and hook No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 And also decided that this was pretty neat after all! 
</P>
<P>
 We moved off the rocks to try beach-casting and the kids had a lot of fun 
playing around, tossing wet-sand balls and so on as well as fishing. There was 
that one Kodak moment of panic when Jeffrey hooked himself but when it came 
time to go, I had to drag him out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Final tally for the two fishermen: Two rocks caught. One pair of swim trunks 
caught. One leg caught. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad news: I suspect Jeffrey might be harboring the Eternal Optimist Fishing 
Gene (he didn't get it from my side of the family). When we returned home that 
afternoon, he excitedly told his mother, "I just can't believe I caught two 
things! Two!" 
</P>
<P>
 A budding compleat angler is gaining on you, Izaak Walton.

 THE GIFT by Danielle Steel (Delacorte: $15). There are two surprises here; a 
simultaneous Spanish translation ("El Regalo," issued in paperback, $9.95) and 
a more Nineties theme.The venerable love triangle remains at the heart; but it 
involves the Whittakers, their son Tommy and his pregnant friend Maribeth. 
(Also available on audio cassette.) 
</P>
<P>
 THE FLOATING CITY by Eric Lustbader (Pocket: $22). A sequel to "The Kaisho" 
and clearly a set-up for the next book. Prepare yourself for our hero's 
mysterious "tanjian eye" and his friend's prosthetic hand (with retractable 
claws) in Lustbader's latest Asian thriller. (Also available on audio 
cassette.) 
</P>
<P>
 INTENT TO HARM by Stan Washburn (Pocket: $22). Detailed police procedural 
about a serial killer terrorizing a college town hones in on the painstaking 
work it sometimes takes for the police to get their man -- sometimes only to 
watch him slip away. It takes one to know one; the author was a former Berkeley 
Police reservist. E.W. Alexander

 MEMPHIS AFTERNOONS by James Conaway (Avon: $10; 211 pp.). The author of "Napa" 
traces the threads of the disparate families united by his parent's marriage in 
this fond memoir.Although both clans include numerous eccentrics in the great 
Southern tradition, Conaway's most distinguished ancestor was J. P. Alley, an 
editorial cartoonist honored for his criticism of the Ku Klux Klan during the 
early 1920s. Conaway uses his skills as a novelist to evoke a nostalgic vision 
of the South, where ice cubes tinkle in pitchers on shaded porches, although 
the reader is left with the feeling that the author is both recalling his past 
and attempting to exorcise it.

 TWO OLD WOMEN: An Alaska Legend of Betrayal, Courage and Survival by Velma 
Wallis, illustrated by Jim Grant (HarperPerennial: $9; 140 pp.) . Wallis based 
this brief novel on an Athabascan legend from the Fort Yukon region of Alaska. 
Starvation forces a migratory tribe to abandon two quarrelsome old women, who 
must put aside their complaining to survive the Arctic winter. Knowledge 
accumulated over their long lives enables the women to assemble a cache of food 
that later saves the tribe. This concise lesson in mutual dependence shows that 
to endure, humans need company, as well as food.

 FAMILY VALUES: A Lesbian Mother's Fight for Her Son by Phyllis Burke (Vintage: 
$11; 233 pp.) . As Burke prepared to adopt her lover's baby as a "second 
mother," she found herself taking an increasingly active role in the battle for 
both women's and gay and lesbian rights. Her politicization crystallized around 
the filming of "Basic Instinct" in San Francisco and the increasing use of 
"family values" in the anti-gay rhetoric of the religious right. Burke's simple 
thesis, that a family is defined by love and nurturing, rather than blood ties, 
challenges the ideologues who seek to legislate their religious beliefs, 
trampling the rights of others in the process.

 PARADISE OF THE BLIND by Duong Thu Huong translated from the Vietnamese by 
Phan Huy Duong & Nina McPherson (Penguin: $9.95; 270 pp.). The first novel by a 
Vietnamese women writer, "Paradise" depicts the human price of war and 
ideological excess. As she grows up, Hang, the narrator, watches her mother and 
aunt cope with the exigencies of life under a Marxist dictatorship. Hang's 
mother sacrifices her own happiness for her feckless brother, a minor Party 
functionary, as corrupt as any petty bureaucrat in a previous regime. Vilified 
during an ill-conceived land-reform campaign, Hang's aunt labors to restore her 
former position, then flaunts her success before the neighbors who betrayed 
her. Banned in Vietnam, Duong's grim portrait of the dehumanization of her 
country caused her to be expelled from the Communist Party and imprisoned for 
seven months.

 ACROSS THE TOP OF THE WORLD: To the North Pole by Sled, Balloon, Airplane and 
Nuclear Ice Breaker by David E. Fisher (Delta: $11.95; 305 pp., illustrated). 
In 1991, Fisher sailed to the North Pole on the Sovetskiy Soyuz, a nuclear ice 
breaker designed to serve as a luxury liner although most of its promised 
amenities proved illusory.His account of the hard-drinking, often comic boreal 
voyage provides an agreeable sugar coating for an overview of the attempts to 
reach that dubious landmark. Most of the narrative focuses on the conflicting 
claims of Frederick Cook and Robert Peary, neither of whom actually reached the 
North Pole -- despite the honors Peary received. The Pole itself proves 
anticlimactic: It's just a bitterly cold chunk of floating ice.

 Living in the Pico Boulevard storefront where he made his large metal 
sculptures had put the squeeze on a Los Angeles artist and his museum-curator 
wife. So after 13 increasingly cramped years in the city, they set out in 
search of more space and wound up in Malibu, where they've built a dream house 
in the hills -- a 7,400-square-foot home-studio-gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 With a "pre-engineered manufactured building system" (steel beams and 
galvanized steel sheeting intended for small warehouses and factories), the 
owners and architect Bradly Fenton of Fenton Architecture in Van Nuys were able 
to carve out soaring spaces while economizing on construction. "It arrived on 
the site in a series of boxes, all pre-drilled and cut, and then we put it 
together like a giant Erector set," Fenton says. "It has immense potential for 
creating a structure that is flexible. You can slip any number of forms into it 
and change anything at will. When I find a piece of land like this, I'm going 
to build one for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The building, now weathered to a rich patina, looks like part of a vast 
agricultural enterprise, its huge barn doors waiting to be thrown open to the 
surrounding countryside. Actually, the upper level holds the studio, gallery 
and living areas; below are bedrooms, a drawing room and home office. All 
spaces are sparsely furnished but filled with light. Floors and windowsills of 
vertical-grain Douglas fir and countertops of black granite evoke an aesthetic 
that the owners attribute to their love of Japan and its culture. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping everything simple, the owners have domesticated the industrial, 
creating a place that guides the eye in understanding both materials and 
structure. Each door and wall, for instance, is defined so that it can be 
appreciated as part of a whole or on its own. Says the artist: "I like 
revealing the nature of how things are made, both in my work and in 
architecture." AARON BETSKY

 Everyone has their moment in the sun. So now that the World Cup has arrived, 
maybe my time has come. At last. You see, I have a hobby. Some call it an 
obsession. Wherever I am, wherever I travel, I go off in search of soccer 
goals. I look for two poles, a crossbar, a net, a line traversing the goal 
mouth. Invariably I find them, for I have an instinctive sense for where in 
town they are hidden. Then I take out my camera, focus and shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 I have soccer goals set in the pastoral Tuscan hills. I have others in 
Bolivia's vast southwestern desert. One between bomb craters two miles north of 
the old DMZ dividing North and South Vietnam. One in Plains, Ga., of Jimmy 
Carter fame. I have goals crowded with Guatemalan pigs, Panamanian horses, Thai 
cows. Goals in the Brazilian jungle, in the African jungle, in the urban jungle 
called New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one cares. People take my collection of more than 300 photographs 
begrudgingly, scan them and go on with their lives. My grandfather has said, 
and I quote: "That is the stupidest hobby I've ever heard of." This spoken by 
the same man who refers to himself as a comiconomenclaturist, a collector of 
amusing names like Faith Popcorn, the Brazilian Pafia Pifia Pefia Pofia Pufia 
Da Costa, Odious Champagne or the door-to-door firewood salesman Marmalade P. 
Vestibule from Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 When I showed my mother my latest addition, she said: "A soccer field is a 
soccer field, it seems to me." But she's wrong. Certain nuances make each one 
unique: the backdrop, for example, the materials, the varying states of 
disrepair, the feel of the field or simply the fact that they are there, 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in Italy playing soccer, as all children there do, and I've played 
on most of the fields I've shot. My favorite goal is the one in the shade of an 
enormous South African baobab I came across while driving along the Botswana 
border in 1990. There's something haunting about the red earth, the 
extraordinary vastness of South Africa's veld and sky, the goal's humility and 
loneliness beneath that tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, finally, soccer permeates American airwaves, newspapers, conversation. 
Twenty-four teams have been reduced to two, and 51 matches have boiled down to 
one. The victors' time has come. Perhaps mine has, too. CLAUDIO DECHIARA

P IS FORPERFETTO; ALSO FOR PARMESAN, PASTA AND, IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, 
POSTO

 Scene: The kitchen of a big old apartment in Milan. It's a reunion of sorts, 
with at least 10 people gathered around the scarred table and more on the way. 
Much laughter, many toasts. Nobody is paying much attention to what's going on 
in the kitchen until Paola announces it's time to put on the pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, four of the men jump up to supervise the cooking of the pasta. 
This is a serious business. They watch the pot carefully. They test from time 
to time, snatching a piece from the boiling water, blowing on it vigorously. As 
the pasta approaches al dente , that delightfully firm-tender state when it is 
considered perfectly cooked, the men increase their vigilance. Anxiously 
hovering over the pot, they debate whether the penne need a few seconds more. 
Finally, they agree: Perfetto. Perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 One doesn't have to travel to Italy to find pasta prepared with such regard. 
Not when there is Posto in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Italian alphabet, P stands for prosciutto, parmigiano and pancetta. 
Most of all, it stands for pasta in all its myriad forms and shapes. Whether it 
is pasta asciutta , dried pasta, or egg-enriched fresh dough cut into ribbons 
or folded over a savory stuffing, pasta anchors every meal in every season.  
</P>
<P>
 And here in Los Angeles, P also stands for Posto, the third of Piero 
Selvaggio's Italian restaurants (following Valentino in Santa Monica and Primi 
in Rancho Park), a plain white room with pleated canvas blinds. The chef, 
Luciano Pellegrini, comes from Bergamo in northern Italy and is a man you can 
trust with pasta. 
</P>
<P>
 This was brought home to me when I took a bite of the black agnolotti offered 
as a special one night. Squid ink stained the fresh dough dark. The texture was 
sublime, silken and lithe. The circlets of dough held just a dab of filling, a 
beautiful mix of sea bass and shrimp. And the sauce, a discrete veil of white 
wine and butter, allowed the qualities of the pasta to shine through. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a definite art to making pasta like this. What's surprising is how 
few restaurants seem to understand it. First, the pasta has to be of good 
quality and cooked correctly. Homemade almost always seems to sound better than 
dried pasta, but in most places, pasta asciutta would be a much better choice. 
The fresh fettuccine or ravioli often turns out to be thick and leathery, 
overdone or undercooked, and overwhelmed with so much sauce, the dish threatens 
to turn into a soup. If the sauce lists more ingredients than you can count on 
one hand -- watch out. 
</P>
<P>
 At Posto, Pellegrini gets fresh and dried pasta absolutely right. He turns out 
a classically simple rigatoni with tomato and basil or linguine with fresh 
clams. But the best pasta dishes I've had were part of the day's specials or 
tasting menu. (He'll also do a special pasta menu, if you like.) I've had a 
truly wonderful pennette set amid squid ink and tossed with cubes of branzino 
(striped bass), fresh tomato and capers. Mezzalune , little half-moons of 
pasta, were stuffed with pencil-thin asparagus and napped in sage butter and a 
graceful tomato sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Handmade garganelli , a traditional pasta from the Emilia Romagna region made 
by rolling a square of fresh pasta dough over a ridged wooden comb, were topped 
with soft nuggets of goat-milk ricotta and wisps of broccoli florets. 
</P>
<P>
 All the appetizers beguile with their simplicity. Frico , lacy curls of 
Parmesan, are impressive with a glass of bone-dry Dosage Zero spumanti from Ca' 
del Bosco ($38). Prosciutto is the superb raw-cured ham from Parma, subtly 
sweet and salty, cut so thin you could read the pages of the Milan daily 
Corriere della Sera through it. A warm salad of white beans and shrimp on a bed 
of peppery arugula is another fine starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Posto excels at the kind of rustic main courses you might find in the Italian 
countryside: rabbit roasted with potatoes and rosemary (offered as a special or 
on request), a grilled butter flied chicken or mixed grilled sausages and 
lighter dishes like poached sea bass with olives, capers and leeks. But the 
roast pork loin wrapped in pancetta and served with a peperoncino -spiked 
balsamic-vinegar sauce remains my favorite secondi . Only a too-salty entree of 
quail in white wine and sun-dried tomatoes really failed. 
</P>
<P>
 While not as extensive as the famous wine list at Valentino, Posto's offers 
some unusual picks from Italian winemakers, such as the 1991 Nebbiolo d'Alba 
($28) from Domenico Clerico and the 1989 Refosco from Giovanni Dri in Friuli 
($33). 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, try a refreshing semifreddo version of Sicilian cassata , with a 
frozen heart of pureed berries and cream, or the croccante semifreddo , a 
frozen ice cream cake laced with caramelized almonds and hazelnuts. 
</P>
<P>
 P also stands for piacere -- for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>

STAGE WATCH: FUTURE OF MID-SIZED THEATERS IS THE TALK OF THE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was probably the largest gathering ever assembled for talk about L.A. 
theater. At least that's what some of the participants said at the "Inventing 
the Future" conference on mid-sized theaters at UCLA last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 No one took an exact head count. Admission was free, so there was no formal 
registration process. The best guess of the sponsors -- the Audrey 
Skirball-Kenis Theatre and the S. Mark Taper Foundation -- was that as many as 
1,100 people attended at least some part of the three-day event. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference director Roberta Levitow defined a mid-sized theater as one with 
between 100 and 499 seats, where enough tickets can be sold to ensure that the 
artists are properly paid, complete with health plan. Most theater in Los 
Angeles County occurs in the multitudes of sub-100-seat theaters -- where 
professional actors seldom are paid much more than carfare. At the other 
extreme are the seven or eight local venues of at least 700 seats, where 
production costs often are prohibitive. The conference was designed to suggest 
ways to fill in the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 A rare and palpable sense of a theater community struggling to define itself 
existed at the conference. But in the keynote address to the wrap-up session on 
Sunday, director Oskar Eustis -- who recently left a high-level job at the Mark 
Taper Forum to run Trinity Repertory Company in Rhode Island -- cautioned that 
"theater prospers not because it's a professional community first -- although 
that helps -- but because it is representing and helping to create a community 
among its audience." 
</P>
<P>
 In a later interview, Eustis remarked that paying artists is not, by itself, 
"a compelling reason to have a mid-sized theater. The reason the paycheck is 
missing is because we're not attracting enough people to pay for it. The 
theaters that work do so because they create an audience that demands they 
continue to exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Eustis told the conference that he abandoned the mid-sized arena a few years 
ago in order to work "at a theater with a fountain in front of it," the Taper, 
which he described as a theater initially "designed to foster local pride among 
the most highly educated and self-conscious members of the local ruling class. 
The Taper struggles to expand that mandate, often successfully, but it is a 
struggle, because that's not why (it was) put there on that plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, "a war is going in" in the American theater, Eustis said, between 
"people who feel a politically correct agenda is being forced down their 
throats and others who feel we've barely begun to scratch the surface of a true 
empowerment and a true multiculturalism." 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about the big picture. The conference stirred up plenty of concrete 
ideas about nurturing mid-sized theater. 
</P>
<P>
 County arts director Laura Zucker proposed that theater companies book 
themselves into a circuit of existing mid-sized facilities around the edges of 
the county. Playwright/TV producer Jose Rivera suggested a 1% sales tax on 
movie tickets, to be used for low-interest loans to theater companies. A 
representative of Steven Spielberg's production company urged theaters to make 
$50,000 requests of movie companies for specific projects, such as new 
marquees, valet parking or the development of cafes near theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Michael Peretzian said that a theater-bred "godfather" from the movie 
industry should cajole the Hollywood powers into giving more money to the arena 
where Hollywood talent is often trained or spotted -- L.A. theater. He 
nominated Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Lurking around the edges of the conference -- but never addressed as the 
subject of a panel session -- was the issue of whether union contracts are an 
obstacle to development of mid-sized theaters. Some producers and actors raised 
the subject in post-panel sessions and hallway chitchat, but union 
representatives who sat at tables during the lunch hours denied the contention 
and also complained that hardly anyone came up to ask them about the contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the quotable quotes from the weekend: 
</P>
<P>
 * "L.A. is the Bermuda Triangle of American acting" -- critic Michael 
Feingold, referring to the stage actors who make movies or TV and abandon the 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Despite the dingbat financial structure," the late Los Angeles Theatre 
Center company was "in so many respects perfect for this community. It created 
an incredible tolerance for what might be bright and right about someone else's 
aesthetic . . . I can't think of another city where the audience has a more 
open attitude toward playful experimentation" -- director David Schweizer. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Make sure you get to the hairdressers, who talk a lot" -- Maurine Knighton, 
managing director of Penumbra, a Minnesota theater, discussing marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 * LATC "can be the hub of one of the greatest theater companies the 21st 
Century will ever see" -- Will & Co. artistic director Colin Cox, who regularly 
produces at LATC. 
</P>
<P>
 * "We use instruments from a proctologist to look at your organization" -- 
Kelly Russell of the grant-giving Flintridge Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 * And finally, from Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers executive 
director David Rosenak: "How many directors does it take to change a light 
bulb?" 
</P>
<P>
 Director: "Does it have to be a light bulb?" 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright: "What makes you think it needs changing?"*

ON THE RECORD: SANDERLING'S DARK TAKE ON SIBELIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We never got quite enough of Kurt Sanderling in Los Angeles. And certainly 
some of the slo-mo interpretations of his last stints with the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic failed to tell the story of this justly revered musician. 
</P>
<P>
 The comprehensive story of the conductor, now past 80 and no longer traveling 
far or frequently from his Berlin home, is contained in a set of the seven 
Sibelius Symphonies recorded with his Berlin Symphony during the 1970s (Berlin 
Classics 2059, 4 CDs, mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
 These are deep, dark, monumentally authoritative readings. They are also 
remarkably un-idiosyncratic. This is slow conducting of the Klemperer sort: The 
rhythmic spine is so firm, the architecture so clearly delineated, that only 
the clock, not the senses, tells us how much time has elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, it is in the most probing of the symphonies, the mysterious 
Fourth, the radiant Fifth and otherworldly Seventh, that Sanderling and his 
responsive players reach their peak and challenge or surpass the worthiest 
recorded competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The lean-toned strings and brass of the (erstwhile-East) Berlin Symphony are 
perfectly suited to Sanderling's reflective manner. A more lush ensemble tone 
might have resulted in ponderousness. The filler material is enticing, too, 
notably a juggernaut-ominous "En Saga" that is a masterpiece of suspense and 
sustained musical flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone wishing to understand why Paavo Berglund is held in such high regard as 
a Sibelian in his native Finland need go no further than EMI's reissue of his 
1987 recording of the magnificently lowering "Tapiola." 
</P>
<P>
 The Helsinki Philharmonic, not normally world-beaters, here play like inspired 
demons, the cries of the solo winds ripping through the virtually vibratoless 
strings, while the conductor masterfully negotiates the score's tricky balances 
and rhythmic shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 A hypnotic reading, then, of Sibelius' last and arguably finest symphonic 
poem, and one that carries a nifty bonus: the four "Lemminkainen Legends" in 
solid performances by Eugene Ormandy and the Philadelphia Orchestra in one of 
their last recorded collaborations (EMI 65176, mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Sibelius' final works, written in 1924 -- between the Seventh 
Symphony and "Tapiola" -- is his incidental music to Shakespeare's "The 
Tempest," some of it familiar through the composer's own concert suite. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonders of the complete, hourlong score were not generally revealed until 
last year, with its first recording, from the enterprising Lahti Symphony under 
conductor Osmo Vanska (BIS 581). 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, after nearly three-quarters of a century of neglect, the first 
recording is followed within a matter of months by a second, this time from the 
Finnish Radio Symphony under Jukka-Pekka Saraste (Ondine 813). 
</P>
<P>
 For those who care, the language of this new recording is that of the 
production's original Danish (don't ask), while BIS' is in Finnish. The 
differences between the two recordings might seem trivial. Both do the music 
justice, and then some. 
</P>
<P>
 Ondine's vocal soloists include the Finnish all-stars -- mezzo Monica Groop 
and tenor Jorma Silvasti -- both of whom will make their presences felt in Los 
Angeles next season, and baritone Jorma Hynninen. And they deliver handsomely 
-- but no better than BIS' accomplished, non-stellar lineup. And, more 
important, the Ondine recording lacks the spatial sense conveyed by BIS' 
production, whose adherence to the letter of the score's indication of the 
placement of voices and solo instruments around, behind and above the stage 
greatly enhances the "magical" aspects of the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, "The Tempest" is ideal listening for the home, where the brief, 
glistening wisps of instrumental fantasy, interspersed among the big numbers, 
achieve the impact that would be denied them in the illusion-shattering reaches 
of the concert hall.

 Once artists have firmly established a style, they often have difficulty going 
beyond it into fresh turf. Horace Silver and David Sanborn are two such 
musicians but, as shown by the albums that kick off this set of new releases, 
they keep making solid recordings. DAVID SANBORN; "Hearsay"; Elektra ; * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz fans have all but gotten on their knees and begged Sanborn -- never less 
than a compelling and sassy blues-R&B soloist since his arrival with Paul 
Butterfield's band in the late '60s -- to stretch and take on more challenging 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, he does it -- sort of. "Savanna" is a back-beat cousin of Miles Davis' 
"So What" and Sanborn glides, his trademark sound -- a squished, compressed 
tone that comes across both agonized and exhilarated -- stating chattering, 
muscular lines, and full, brazen sweeps. Then there's "Jaws," which has the 
same sharp bite that marked many of the trumpeter's latter-day funk stuff, and 
"The Long Goodbye," which sways between a heartfelt ballad and a searing-toned 
barn burner. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tunes, such as Marvin Gaye's "Got to Give It Up," don't quite have that 
head-turner snap to make them memorable. Throughout, though, bassist Marcus 
Miller, Sanborn's producer for years, provides the saxophonist with an ocean of 
supporting sounds, from Rickey Peterson's oozing organ whammy and Don Alias' 
simmering conga slaps to Miller's own powerful, surging bass lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended), four stars (excellent). ZAN STEWART

 AL JARREAU 
</P>
<P>
 "Tenderly" 
</P>
<P>
 Reprise  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau on recordings and Jarreau in performance have always been two distinct 
experiences. Producer Marcus Miller has finally solved the problem by capturing 
much of the singer's high-voltage stage spontaneity on this in-studio live 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau's most appealing quality is his capacity to find utterly unique 
interpretations in well-known material -- in this case, a funk-rocking reading 
of "Summertime"; personalized, even quirky renderings of "Your Song" and "Try a 
Little Tenderness," and a new slant on "My Favorite Things" (in a duet with 
opera singer Kathleen Battle). 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau may not fit the traditional mold, but his persistent musical probing 
and unerring sense of swing represent a fascinating model of contemporary jazz 
vocalizing.

 * * * 1/2 Vanessa Rubin, "I'm Glad There Is You," Novus. Subtitled "A Tribute 
to Carmen McRae," this is a stylish, well-programmed set in which -- though 
Rubin makes no attempt to imitate her idol -- there is a slight resemblance in 
tone and phrasing.With material such as Charlie Parker's "Yardbird Suite," Thad 
Jones' "A Child Is Born" and Kurt Weill's "Speak Low," and with numerous guest 
soloists -- Kenny Burrell, Grover Washington, Frank Foster -- Rubin has a 
fail-safe project here.

 * * * Turtle Island String Quartet, "Who Do We Think We Are?," Windham 
Hill.Continuing to blend the best of two worlds, the TISQ here brings together 
its own daringly different interpretations of works by Parker, Monk, Victor 
Feldman and McCoy Tyner, along with a couple of in-house originals. The 
furthest-out cut is an experimental treatment of Jimi Hendrix's "Gypsy Eyes." 
Tyner's "Blues on the Corner" is the strongest jazz track and "You've Changed," 
with an expendable vocal by Vicki Randle, the weakest. David Balakrishnan, as 
always, was a key figure in the writing of a generally inspiring set.

 This masterful collection, recorded in Rio in 1977, brings together the 
timeless beauty of Vaughan's sound with some of the most durable writers and 
musicians in the Brazilian pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 Milton Nascimento plays and joins voices with her on three tunes; the Caymmis, 
father Dorival and son Dori, are similarly represented in original works; and 
Antonio Carlos Jobim plays piano on his own "Triste" and "Someone to Light Up 
My Life," the latter with lyrics by Gene Lees. 
</P>
<P>
 Edson Federico's orchestrations and the rhythm backing (usually drums and two 
percussionists) contribute to the beauty and authenticity of these modern 
classics, taped at the high point of Vaughan's magnificent career. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Dorival's Portuguese verse on "Roses and Roses," the vocals are in 
English (but Vaughan did allow herself a couple of brief scat interludes).

 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars

MIXED MEDIA: CRANBERRIES' SASS: WINNING LIVE VIDEO; ***; THE CRANBERRIES, "THE

<P>
 Because this Irish band has sold more than 1 million albums without checking 
in with a high-profile U.S. tour, this 65-minute video gives most pop fans 
their first chance to see how the quartet handles itself live. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the band, led by singer Dolores O'Riordan, as seductive and smart as 
suggested by the best moments of that debut album -- "Everybody Else Is Doing 
It, So Why Can't We?" -- or is it a one-hit wonder? 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the group's performance, which was taped in January in London and 
includes seven songs not on the album, the Cranberries are indeed a promising 
young band. The quartet balances the accessibility and craft of such 
radio-friendly singles as "Linger" and "Dream" with a budding vision and 
passion that give the depth required for longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Riordan's vocals, frequently brightened by an aggressive Celtic coloring, 
move between sweet innocence and alarming intensity as she explores various 
emotional contours of contemporary relationships. 
</P>

POP EYE: ANOTHER GNR BREAKUP? YAWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guns or Roses? 
</P>
<P>
 Reports are that the volatile rock band Guns N' Roses has divided into two 
feuding camps, with singer Axl Rose and guitarist Slash at war.  
</P>
<P>
 The band has "broken up" regularly since it emerged in the late '80s as the 
world's most celebrated hard-rock group. Remember when GNR opened for the 
Rolling Stones at the Coliseum and broke up one night . . . only to reunite the 
next? 
</P>
<P>
 This time it could be for real, though. 
</P>
<P>
 GNR guitarist Gilby Clarke recently told Kerrang! magazine in England that he 
was angered when Rose rejected demos for new songs for a GNR album, and that he 
and Slash have started a new band, SVO Snakepit, also featuring Guns drummer 
Matt Sorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, other sources insist that Rose and GNR bassist Duff McKagan are 
preparing their own new project. 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen Records executive Tom Zutaut, who oversees GNR's work for the company, 
denies that the group has broken up, though he confesses to uncertainty as to 
exactly who is in the band right now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those stories go round and round constantly," he says of reports that Clarke 
has been fired. "I don't think we'll really know who's (in the band) until they 
start recording. . . . I've learned with Guns N' Roses since 1986 that you 
never really know what's going to come out until it's finished." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the band's management also dismisses the breakup reports and 
says that GNR, though officially on hiatus at the moment, is starting 
pre-production work for its next album. He does confirm that Slash is beginning 
work on a solo album with Clarke participating. Zutaut says that GNR, or some 
part thereof, was supposed to start work on a new album this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But will anyone care when (or if) it is finished? 
</P>
<P>
 "When Guns first came out it was fresh and exciting," says Bryan Schock, 
program director of L.A. hard-rock radio station KNAC-FM. "But now Alice in 
Chains, Soundgarden, Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam are the exciting things. 
If Guns N' Roses puts together a solid record with an hour's worth of great 
material, sure, there's gonna be interest. But if they don't, this could be 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 If those sentiments are widespread, it signals a tremendous fall from favor 
for a band that once seemed on its way to becoming the top attraction in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, many observers feel, is that rock fans have tired of Rose's 
antics. He started a riot by diving into the crowd after a photographer and 
then walking off stage during a 1991 St. Louis concert. During a 1992 tour with 
Metallica, he was booed several times after either launching into some tirade 
or angrily storming off the stage before the show was over.  
</P>
<P>
 And the antipathy has grown as lawsuits have been filed by his former wife 
Erin Everly and former girlfriend Stephanie Seymour alleging that Rose 
physically and mentally abused them. Those tales are recounted in the current 
People magazine cover story. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of Rose as a spoiled rock-star crybaby doesn't wash in an age when 
the new heroes are such earnest if tortured figures as Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder 
and the late Kurt Cobain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guns N' Roses alienated enough people that no one cares anymore," says a 
concert promoter who asked not to be named. "You've got to pay a lot more dues 
than Axl has before you can do stuff like he does. He ain't Keith Richards."

POP MUSIC CHARTS: SOUNDTRACK SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though "The Lion King" soundtrack continues to rule The Times' Southern 
California pop album chart, a soundtrack from another hot movie is poised to 
take over. On the heels of a strong opening week in theaters, the "Forrest 
Gump" soundtrack entered the chart at No. 11. Unless this Tom Hanks movie tails 
off drastically at the box office, the album should shoot into the Top Five 
next week. Warren G.'s "Regulate. . .G-Funk Era" remains hot, topping both the 
Southern California and national rap charts and hanging in third locally among 
all albums. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,42,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last Week 1

RECORD RACK: FIRING OFF AN ERRATIC BLAST OF 'BUCKSHOT'; * 1/2; BRANFORD 
MARSALIS AND DJ PREMIER, "BUCKSHOT LEFONQUE" ( COLUMBIA ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This project was trumpeted as the ultimate jazz and hip-hop merger, with tenor 
sax player Branford Marsalis writing, producing, arranging and playing in a 
collaboration with producer-rapper DJ Premier of Gang Starr. 
</P>
<P>
 But they really went astray. 
</P>
<P>
 Using assorted, little-known vocalists, they branch in too many directions -- 
also melding jazz with R&B, rock, reggae and funk. They even include some limp, 
schmaltzy R&B ballads. Quincy Jones did this kind of album much better back in 
the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 You get the feeling that Marsalis and DJ Premier feel that adding jazz touches 
to anything automatically elevates it. But most of this album is pretty 
mundane, with the experiments hardly scratching the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 If Marsalis and Premier had stuck with rap, they might have created a knockout 
jazz-rap album. An indication of what they can do is the hard-driving "No Pain, 
No Gain." Featuring a raging rap by Uptown, it's one of the year's best rap 
singles. There are two other exceptional tracks: one jazz-rap and the other 
poet Maya Angelou's recitation of "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" over a 
jazzy track. 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't even any top-notch Marsalis solos on the album. The "Tonight 
Show" bandleader plays throughout on the funk and hip-hop-inflected 
instrumental tracks, but he's mostly in his Kenny G mode -- serving up lame 
lite jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2; SIR MIX-A-LOT, "CHIEF BOOT KNOCKA" ( AMERICAN/RHYME CARTEL 
)

 Sir Mix-a-Lot is the rare rap artist whose style is so distinctive that even a 
hip-hop dabbler can name that rapper within a couple of notes. Whether it's his 
semi-singing rap delivery or his trademark lashing beats, he put Seattle on the 
rap map with his distinguished sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Mix -- who wrote, mixed, arranged, engineered and produced -- has created an 
album that incorporates more '70s funk than his three earlier efforts. 
Compliments of Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and a Bootsy Collins sample, 
"Sleepin' Wit My Fonk" includes one of the year's heaviest, grooviest bass 
lines. Best known for his big booty opus "Baby Got Back," Mix maintains his 
love of the female anatomy -- always more schoolboy horny than offensive -- on 
the title song. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in case you thought he was only a "posterior" man, Sir Mix-a-Lot details 
his love of ample chests on "Let It Bounce" and "DBL the Pleasure/Put 'Em on 
Da" -- a nasty party song that includes a rousing, lewd chant. Unfortunately, 
though, "DBL the Pleasure" sounds a bit too much like a forced sequel to "Baby 
Got Back." 
</P>

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 *** Various artists, "DGC Rarities Vol. 1," DGC/Geffen. Is a previously 
unreleased Nirvana demo worth even the budget price of this collection? When 
that track is "Pay to Play," a 1990 punk-fury explosion that evolved into "Stay 
Away," the answer is yes.But wait, there's more: Hole's intriguing, U.K.-only 
single "Beautiful Son" and lesser but still worth-collecting efforts from Beck, 
Sonic Youth and Counting Crows make this 14-track anthology a good value.

Colonials for an L.A. band -- what with Angela McCluskey's throaty Scotswoman 
vocals, and a violin-dominated, Celtic-friendly sound that's warm even by 
coffeehouse standards -- if you weren't tipped ahead of time.This largely 
acoustic debut is invitingly human music, no less so for being a little

(who headline a benefit concert Thursday at the Palace) are too rockin' and 
pop-savvy to make a bad album, but after 11 years as a recording band, it's

effort by smart-pop's perpetual B students.

 ** Harry Connick Jr., "She," Columbia. You've got to admire Connick for 
venturing beyond his usual romantic, pre-1955, big-band material to co-write 
and sing a robust, New Orleans-style mix of jazz, funk and rock.But his smooth, 
Sinatra-like voice clashes with this funky sound, and the songs have a rough, 
grating, experimental feel, as if they need much more polishing. Not for real 
Connick fans.

 Courtney Love made a surprise appearance at the end of a Lemonheads concert 
recently in New York, playing two of her songs in her first performance since 
the April suicide of husband Kurt Cobain and the recent death of her bandmate 
Kristen Pfaff. Love did a solo version of "Doll Parts" and, with head 'Head 
Evan Dando sitting in on drums, "Miss World," changing the last line to "I am 
the one who's asking, 'Why do you have to die?' " . . .

 With more than 40 tracks recorded, Eazy-E is planning to release two CDs 
simultaneously in September, titled "Str.8 Off the Streetz of 
(Expletive)Compton Vol. 1" and "Vol. 2." And there are almost as many guest 
producers and performers as songs, including Guns N' Roses' Slash, Naughty by 
Nature and Eazy's former N.W.A. mate Yella. Another N.W.A. veteran, Dr. Dre, is 
represented as producer of an old track Eazy pulled from the vaults for these 
collections. . . .

 The Stone Roses' long-awaited second album -- five years after its debut and 
three since the Manchester band was freed by a U.K. court from its Silvertone 
contract and allowed to sign with Geffen -- is in the final mixing stages, with 
an early '95 release planned. . . .

 AS THE CROWE FLIES: For many '60s aficionados, the party scene in Russ Meyer's 
"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls" is the quintessential portrayal of the era's 
drug-addled decadence. 
</P>
<P>
 How will a re-creation of that play in the post-"Just Say No" '90s? The Black 
Crowes are planning to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 With that scene in mind, the Georgia band recently held a party -- with all 
the psychedelic accessories -- at the San Fernando Valley recording studio 
where it was finishing its upcoming album. Singer Chris Robinson readily 
admitted that many of the participants were, how shall we put it, chemically 
enhanced. 
</P>
<P>
 Video cameras were there to capture the whole bacchanal, and the band plans to 
include scenes in a long-form home video that will come out sometime after the 
album is released in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of their lives," says Crowes manager Pete Angelus about the drug 
references. "The reality of the situation is the Crowes have always chosen to 
be honest about it, before people jumped on the pro-marijuana bandwagon." 
</P>
<P>
 How will Warner Bros., the band's distributor, feel about releasing this 
video? A spokesman at the company says that there's no way to know until they 
see the footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have some things to say about it," says Angelus. "But I don't 
intend to listen and I don't think the band does either. If someone at Warner 
Bros. (didn't want to release the tape) I would guess we'd have a substantial 
fight on our hands." Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: Someone must have slipped up in the editing room while 
working the new Rolling Stones TV ad for Budweiser, which is sponsoring its 
upcoming tour. All the concert shots in the spot are from the 1989 "Steel 
Wheels" tour, and in one of them -- if you look very hard -- there is bassist 
Bill Wyman . . . who quit the band last year and won't be on the road this 
time.*

 BEACH BOY: In an unusual move, one of the music business's hottest young 
executives is getting off the corporate fast track. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Guerinot, vice president and general manager of A&M Records, was 
reportedly offered the presidency of Columbia Records recently.Not only did he 
turn down that plum job, but he also decided to resign from A&M as well. He 
will turn his attention to his "side" career managing Social Distortion and one 
of the most-touted bands in Southern California, Offspring. Guerinot won't 
confirm the Columbia offer, but he tells Pop Eye that, at 35, he re-evaluated 
his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be involved with cutting-edge technologies and I want to be 
integrally involved with a handful of artists' careers rather than running a 
big company," he says, adding that both the bands he manages are from 
Huntington Beach, an area he abandoned for his Hollywood career. "And I want to 
live at the beach again." 
</P>
<P>
 Guerinot doesn't rule out returning to the corporate ladder some day -- he'll 
continue to work as a consultant to A&M for the next year. But he's convinced 
that in the music world, smaller will become better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now in the business of digital information," he says. "And the smaller, 
more entrepreneurial companies are going to be more poised to deal with that 
than the big companies." Steve Hochman

 RAVE THREAT: British musicians are mobilizing to fight the Criminal Justice 
Bill, a sweeping proposal that looks virtually certain to pass into law later 
this year. The measure would, among other things, effectively outlaw "rave" 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the provisions of the bill is a clause banning unlicensed gatherings of 
more than 10 people at which music "wholly or predominantly characterized by 
repetitive beats" is played. The bill also proposes a severe clampdown on 
"squatting" (taking up residence in an unoccupied building) and gives police 
officers the right to stop and search anyone within five miles of any event 
deemed to be a possible source of disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent among the musicians opposing the effort is the politically active 
folk-rock band the Levellers, whose album "The Levellers" topped the British 
charts last year. The group has sponsored billboards and handbill 
advertisements drawing attention to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Levellers singer Mark Chadwick comments, "It's going to affect everyone in 
this country who doesn't live in either rented or mortgaged accommodations, and 
who does anything other than go to the pub for recreation. If you fall out of 
those categories, then you could potentially be deemed a criminal." Dave 
Jennings, from London

CRITICS PICKS: 'HERO'

 This 1992 movie is something of a mess but still offers more than many tidier 
pictures. Haphazard and erratic, "Hero's" core is nevertheless so shrewdly 
cynical about public heroism and the cult of celebrity that it is impossible 
not to be at least sporadically amused and entertained.Directed unevenly by 
Stephen Frears and written by "Unforgiven" screenwriter David Webb Peoples 
(from a story by producer Laura Ziskin, Alvin Sargent and Peoples), "Hero" asks 
whether heroism is truly selfless or rather an act of stupidity. Dustin Hoffman 
(pictured) stars as a curmudgeonly, anti-social weasel who nevertheless winds 
up bringing about the rescue of 54 people in a plane crash only to vanish 
immediately afterward. Among the rescued is your usual hard-charging TV 
reporter (Geena Davis), who knows that the disappearing hero could be the story 
of a lifetime. But then a handsome guy (Andy Garcia) shows up to claim the 
laurel wreath (Cinemax Monday at 6 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 This atypical 1992 film biography of the Teamsters' Jimmy Hoffa is a very 
impressive piece of work in a number of ways. Dark, sinister and brooding, it 
uses the convincing acting of Jack Nicholson (pictured) in the title role, 
Stephen H. Burum's panoramic cinematography and Danny DeVito's polished, 
energetic direction (he also stars as a Hoffa ally) to create a stark, brassy 
epic of union history. But " Hoffa" turns out to be as misdirected as it is 
passionate, a take-it-or-leave-it biography that disdains all the conventions 
of the form (Cinemax Monday at 10 p.m.). Kenneth Turan

 Writer-director Paul Schrader comes close to transcendence in his 1992 
thriller with theological underpinnings, a meditative saga of a drug runner's 
inevitable collision with fate.Like almost all of Schrader's work, it dives 
into dangerous waters. It has an almost cruelly ambitious subject: the collapse 
of the 1970s and '80s high-style drug culture, as distilled into one man's 
frenzied pilgrimage. Willem Dafoe stars as a Manhattan cocaine deliveryman and 
Susan Sarandon is his sexy drug mama boss (TMC Tuesday at 1:30 a.m.). Michael

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; LIFE'S A BIG BEACH FOR PAMELA ANDERSON OF 'BAYWATCH' 
FAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a coastal dreamland of sunny skies and clear-blue water, bathing-suit clad 
beauties -- male and female -- cavort on the sand and save victims from the 
nasty surf. But even in this paradise of beautiful people, a lot of eyes alight 
on "Baywatch's" blond Canadian, Pamela Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is, of course, this big gorgeous attraction," acknowledges co-producer 
Craig Kwasizur. "She's the girl next door, with beauty and innocence. Really, 
the Beach Boys' song ('California Girls') says it all about Pamela." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Kwasizur wryly notes: "She sure brings a good male presence to the 
show." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who sets hearts aflutter in the 110 countries where the show is seen 
remains decidedly single, despite tabloid rumors to the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Argh!" Anderson declares from a hotel room in San Diego, where she's shooting 
the "Mike Hammer" CBS television movie "Deader Than Ever" with Rob Estes. "All 
that 'Bad Girl of "Baywatch" ' stuff! I don't have a boyfriend," she says 
emphatically. "The most important person in my life right now is Star," her 
golden retriever. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Star share a Malibu beach house, from which Anderson says she has to 
be dragged out by friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real stay-at-home," she insists, pointing out that being on a 
high-profile show doesn't make for much of a social life. "My girlfriends who 
aren't actresses date way more than I do," she says, adding that what she 
really wants is to get married and have a family. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, she has a lot on her mind. "I'm very much into meditation and 
mythology. I write fairy tales and poetry. I have a lot of fantasy in my head 
and it's important to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mystical musings -- and those of her "Baywatch" character, C.J. -- aren't 
the result of any California New Age. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about C.J.'s flower-child ways? "They got that from me," she says. 
"My incense and candles and meditating are from my grandfather, who was from 
Finland." Even though he died when she was 11, she still practices his 
teachings, including self-healing, and she religiously keeps a dream diary. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Comox, British Columbia, Anderson treaded a short path to Hollywood. 
After her image was projected on a giant scoreboard screen at a Canadian 
football game in 1989, she became a spokesmodel for a beer company. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up was the first of her four Playboy covers, which took her to L.A. Her 
mother initially encouraged her to pose. "She said, 'Do it. It's compliment!' " 
Anderson recalls. "Playboy is such a professional organization. You don't feel 
like you're naked. You just feel like you're taking beautiful artistic photos. 
I'd done lots of swimsuit modeling and it's not that much different." 
</P>
<P>
 Modeling led to ABC's "Home Improvement," where she was the "Tool Time" girl. 
But after the hectic '92-'93 season of doing both shows, she decided to focus 
on "Baywatch," which shoots one show in four days. "We have two units going 
simultaneously," explains Anderson, who's now beginning her third season with 
"Baywatch." "We're always working." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's managed to squeeze in two movies into her busy schedule, "Good Cop, 
Bad Cop," which was shot in spring '93, and "Snapdragon," which was shot in 
winter '93 and airs on USA Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer, she ventured to Tahiti to host the syndicated "Eden 
Quest," where she swam with sharks. "There was all kinds of great animal life, 
but one person got his nipple bit off by a fish who thought it was food, so I 
didn't go into the water after that!" 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, however, she hopped right back into "Baywatch's" eternal 
California surf, where an international audience is anxiously waiting for her 
to emerge during the show's fifth season this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baywatch" airs Mondays at 8 p.m. and Saturdays at 10 p.m. on KCOP. 
"Snapdragon" airs Friday at 9 p.m. on USA Network.

PROFILE; THE OUTER BANKS; QUIRKY COMIC FINDS A BACHELOR PAD ON PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 PBS does have a wild and crazy side. Though best known for its high-brow 
documentaries, British dramatic series, nature shows and arts programming, PBS 
did introduce American audiences to the zany British comedy series "Monty 
Python's Flying Circus." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS' latest find: Steven Banks, a lanky baby boomer with a quirky sense of 
humor. A man prone to breaking into imitations of Rex Harrison, Bob Dylan and 
Katharine Hepburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Public Television, we believe there's no arena of the human experience 
which isn't appropriate or right," says Jennifer Lawson, executive vice 
president of national programming. "Humor has been a part of Public Television. 
We want to be open to innovative and creative talents from this country." 
</P>
<P>
 PBS thinks it's found one such "innovative and creative talent" in "The Steven 
Banks Show," premiering Sunday on KCET. Banks plays a 30ish bachelor named 
Steven Banks who lives in a horribly cluttered apartment where he constantly 
procrastinates. A fan of the Beatles, Bob Dylan and the Monkees, Steven loves 
to sing and play the piano, guitar and drums. And, of course, there's the 
previously mentioned imitating of celebrity icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Parente and Michael Kostroff play six recurring characters; Monkee 
Peter Tork, Bill Mummy ("Lost in Space"), Louis Nye and Penn & Teller are among 
the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Steven Banks Show" is based on Banks' popular Los Angeles and San 
Francisco one-man show, "Steven Banks' Home Entertainment Center." In 1989, 
Showtime aired "Entertainment Center," which was taped live in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Steven is an unusual talent," Lawson says. "He is a performance 
artist in many ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Because his show is on PBS, Banks says, TV stations have the option to air the 
series at different days and times. "It's on after 'Masterpiece Theatre' in Los 
Angeles," explains Banks, who comes across as a friendly and funny guy over 
lunch at an Italian restaurant in Glendale. "In Salt Lake City, it's on 12:30 
Saturday nights. Orlando, Florida, is not running it. The state of Iowa is not 
running it. But that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The show is Banks' second attempt to translate his sense of humor to series 
TV. In the late '80s, several producers courted him. "Norman Lear wanted to do 
something. Brandon Tartikoff, Grant Tinker, Allan Burns, ABC. We ended up at 
Disney." (Tartikoff is now executive producer of the PBS series.) 
</P>
<P>
 Banks, now 38, shot a pilot at Disney, but it never sold. "It didn't work 
out," he says. "I learned a lot. Some things worked and some things didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 The PBS series deals with subjects that interest Banks. In the first episode, 
"Rock 'n' Roll Auction," Steven buys John Lennon's guitar at an auction only to 
discover he bought Julian Lennon's guitar case. "I collect stuff. I love rock 
'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't want his series to be a carbon copy of "Home Entertainment Center." 
"It's sort of based on me and what I'm really like, and a lot of it's totally 
made up. The neat thing was to go into different areas and not just make it 
about procrastinating all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things within the show that are very different, just 
having two other actors play all the other parts. There's so much music and 
it's live music, which I think is very obvious. I said (to the producers), 
'This has got to sound like a guy who is in his apartment playing his guitar 
and singing. It can't sound at all clean.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale native, who plays drums, piano and guitar, became interested in 
acting in 1962 when he saw Robert Preston in the movie version of the musical 
"The Music Man." 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned the whole record and pantomimed it," he recalls with a warm smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks went to Los Angeles City College for one year as a film major and 
attended the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Clown College in Florida in 
1975. "Then I did a lot of Equity Waiver dives around L.A. I also toured junior 
high and high school assemblies. That's a whole other story. That will be a 
miniseries. I was sort of a '70s and '80s version of Victor Borge. I played a 
lot of different instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven Banks' Home Entertainment Center" was an instant hit when it premiered 
eight years ago at Hollywood's 40-plus seat Chamber Theatre. "Entertainment 
Center," he says, was actually built around the set. "They had a set from a 
show that had opened and closed in, like, two weeks. It was a very 
realistic-type of Sam Shepard kitchen set." 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Entertainment Center" was taped in front of a live audience, the 
series' 13 episodes were shown to audiences after they were completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't do it (in front of an audience) because it took so long to shoot 
each show because we had to do complete makeup and costume changes with the two 
other actors. It takes a long time to make them good and realistic. We were 
shooting two shows a week. I still can't believe we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of each episode, viewers will be offered the opportunity to 
purchase the video of that show. Fans also will be able to buy the CD or 
cassette of the original songs Banks performs on the series. "I'm more excited 
about that than having a TV show named after me," Banks says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Steven Banks Show" premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on KCET; it also airs 
Mondays at 9 on KPBS.

RETRO; A DAY OF LAUGHTER; AMC DEVOTES AN ENTIRE SUNDAY TO LAUREL AND HARDY 
SLAPSTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his book "Filmgoer's Companion," movie historian Leslie Halliwell proclaims 
that Laurel and Hardy are "the screen's finest comedy team." 
</P>
<P>
 Few would refute Halliwell. Comedy teams have come and gone, but Stan Laurel 
and Oliver Hardy have withstood the test of time. Like Charlie Chaplin, Buster 
Keaton and Harold Lloyd, their antic exploits are as fresh and funny now as 
they were 60 years ago. Cable's American Movie Classics devotes an entire 
Sunday to the duo with its "Laurel and Hardy Laugh-a-thon," featuring 44 Laurel 
and Hardy shorts and feature-length comedies. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Laurel and Hardy had appeared in films for more than a decade before 
producer Hal Roach teamed them up for the 1926 short film "Slipping Wives." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1892, Oliver Hardy began acting in film as far back as 1913. He even 
played the Tin Man in the 1924 silent version of "The Wizard of Oz." Stan 
Laurel was born in England in 1890. Fred Karno's troupe of entertainers brought 
him to America -- in the early 1900s Chaplin came to the United States with 
Karno's company -- and he began doing short films in 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither found real success until "Slipping Wives." The duo were 
extraordinary visual comedians, masters of slapstick. And their bizarre 
appearance, complete with baggy pants and bowler hats, always got a chuckle. 
Fans loved to watch the rotund Hardy as he would slowly go into an angry rage 
when the inept Laurel would make a mistake. And audiences loved the skinny, 
sad-faced Laurel's whimperings when Hardy would scold him. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they became famous in silent films, the two managed the transformation 
to sound films with great ease. One of the main reasons was because they kept 
their dialogue to a minimum. But a lot of their dialogue has found its way into 
pop culture: 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's another fine mess you've gotten me into it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you do something to help me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Their 1931 short film, "Music Box," received an Oscar for best short subject 
(comedy), and Laurel also received a special Oscar in 1960 for his "creative 
pioneering in the field of cinema comedy." It was Laurel who devised the team's 
sight gags and directed many of their films. Hardy passed away in 1957, Laurel 
in 1965. 
</P>

RESTAURANT NEWS: BLUES FOUNDATION ROOM REQUIRES LOTS OF GREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want a table in the House of Blues' private Foundation Room, where Ken Frank 
is cooking his fabulous French food? Easy enough: You just need to be a member 
of the House of Blues Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, one of the West Hollywood club's "phone ambassadors" stammeringly 
quoted us a $4,500 membership fee. This week, they're positive: A table in the 
70-seat Foundation Room requires an initial fee of $1,000, plus a monthly 
minimum tab of $200. On top of that, they're asking for a "voluntary" 
contribution to the foundation's ambitious program, which supports arts and 
music education for inner-city youth. Simply writing a check is not enough: It 
gets more even more complicated. Your application has to be approved by the 
board of directors. According to a spokeswoman for Isaac Tigrett's $9-million 
music club and restaurant on the Sunset Strip, 500 sponsorship forms are 
currently being mailed out, and they are in no hurry to fill the slots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't have the whole world up there," says a House of Blues spokeswoman. 
"It isn't a room for Madonna to hang out in. If Madonna wants to be a sponsor 
and we have a space and she is going to contribute to the program, then great." 
</P>
<P>
 Tigrett, co-founder of the Hard Rock Cafe, opened the three House of Blues 
venues (the others are in Cambridge, Mass., and New Orleans) on the advice of 
his Indian swami, Sai Baba. The blues clubs' trademarked slogan -- courtesy of 
the Blues Brothers -- is "We're on a Mission From God." According to the 
spokeswoman, Tigrett is so dedicated that he gets up at 6 a.m. daily to pray. 
His beliefs enter into the way he runs his business, too. "Last Saturday, he 
gathered 350 of us to talk about community and diversity," she gushes. "He told 
us it will make us a better person to treat everybody equal." 
</P>
<P>
 So if you don't receive a sponsorship application form in the mail in the next 
few weeks, don't feel bad. It's not as if you aren't equal, it's just that you 
didn't qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 PUBLIC EYE: Ever since Mezzaluna opened, owner Karim Souki has been trying to 
promote the Brentwood branch of the New York-based mini-chain. Now business is 
suddenly booming and he's even had offers to open more pizza and pasta spots. 
But at the moment, the restaurateur couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 Mezzaluna, you'll recall, is where Ronald Goldman waited tables until his 
murder and where Nicole Brown Simpson, a regular customer, ate her last meal -- 
rigatoni melanzane . 
</P>
<P>
 "We are still in the middle of a tragedy and the impact that it has had on a 
couple of weeks of business seems very insignificant in comparison," says 
Souki. "Brentwood in general is busier. There are a lot more people walking 
around town. They go by O.J.'s house and step over the yellow tape, they go to 
Nicole's apartment, and they are coming here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just extremely sad for all the families: the Browns and the Goldmans." 
</P>
<P>
 PATRIOT GAMES: The peripatetic Elka Gilmore, who cooked at the former 
Camelions in Santa Monica, Tumbleweed in Beverly Hills, Checkers downtown and 
Palette in West Hollywood, left L.A. two years ago for San Francisco. First, 
she opened Elka, a seafood restaurant in the Miyako Hotel in Japantown. And 
she's made such an impression in such a short time that, "around San Francisco 
today," explains a recent press release, "she is known simply as 'Elka."' 
</P>
<P>
 Now the one-named wonder chef has become patriotic. When Elka mailed out 
invitations to the opening of her new French restaurant Liberte, she pleaded, 
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free. . 
. . "  
</P>
<P>
 OPENINGS: A Fatburger stand has opened in West Hollywood and 20 more will open 
throughout the state. The burger chain, founded in 1952 by Mrs. Lovie Yancey of 
Los Angeles, plans to double its size by 1995. . . . Steven Lau has opened 
Fortune Inn in Glendale featuring Mandarin cuisine under $10. . . . Critixx, a 
European tapas-style restaurant by the owners of Roxxi in Pasadena, is slated 
to open Friday. Original tapas creations include sherry marinated salmon, 
roasted eggplant and garlic, and prosciutto with grissini. *

KEARNS' MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a person who has spent one-third of my 32 years living with asymptomatic 
HIV infection, I applaud Michael Kearns' life-affirming message 
("HIV-Positivist," by Jan Breslauer,July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us living with AIDS, there is no doubt of its gruesome and 
devastating nature; however, there are many on both sides of this issue who are 
too comfortable depicting people with HIV or AIDS as weak, helpless victims. We 
all too rarely get the opportunity to see those who are strong, healthy and 
hard-working in the face of rampant fear and homophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 When the cure finally comes, the true heroes of this tale will not be the 
scientists, researchers and doctors but rather those, like Kearns, who refused 
to compromise their lives under the pressure of those who just want us to be 
quiet and die because they are afraid to speak out and live. 
</P>

<P>
 Having had many friends and two lovers die from AIDS during the last 10 years, 
I feel compassion for Michael Kearns as an HIV-positive and admiration for him 
as an activist. His essays for the gay press are thought-provoking and 
insightful. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he is delusional if he thinks that his "Camille" failed to attract 
the audience expected because it was a play about death. What gay play is not 
about death? Many of them do very well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is more likely that Kearns' "Camille" failed to attract audiences because, 
despite kind notices, word got out that it was a heavy-handed production of a 
dated play, poorly performed by a pre-professional cast. Kearns, still a 
handsome man, makes an awkward and grotesque Camille, and no one involved 
seemed to know what to do with the script -- camp it up or milk the metaphor. 
Whatever magic Charles Ludlam worked on his acclaimed New York production was 
not passed down to Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Michael, it's your fault, not ours. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 It was with much interest that I read your interview with Michael Kearns. As a 
licensed clinical social worker with many years of experience, I am quite 
familiar with "the system" of foster parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the values and depth of caring that Kearns lives by are the virtues 
that we must pass on to future generations. Increasingly, these values must be 
reflected in our social institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 While in charge of a specialized foster care program in the mid-1980s, I found 
that this was not always the case. Again, I witnessed the reality that the 
"traditional," two-parent family could be devoid of offering the love and 
protection that foster children so desperately need. 
</P>
<P>
 Kearns reminds us that the importance of responsible and caring parenting 
transcends one's sexual orientation.

BOWLING FOR DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The account of how programs for the Hollywood Bowl are put together was of 
interest to me, despite the fact that my family and I have pretty much given up 
on attending events there ("Puzzling Out Summer at the Bowl," by Diane 
Haithman, July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Why is this so? In the realm of classical music, the Bowl seems to want to 
include itself in the category of music festivals, when the truth is that it is 
really nothing more than a glorified municipal band shell for pops concerts.The 
"1812 Overture" accompanied by fireworks (and light planes and helicopters) is 
hardly groundbreaking programming. Music is so overamplified one might as well 
stay home and listen to a good CD. 
</P>
<P>
 As for other musical types, including jazz, which might not suffer too much by 
overamplification, the audiences around us during our last few ventures to the 
Bowl were so rowdy and rude that we left in disgust. They seem to think the 
Bowl is just a large jazz club where talking (loudly) is OK, along with smoking 
(tobacco and other products).

SIGN OF THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Weird Androgynous Sign" is too long, and "TAFKAP" sounds like an obscure 
military procurement program (Letters, July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, both are unnecessary. As any student of hieroglyphics knows, the 
symbol by which that silly Minneapolis-based publicity scarfer wants to be 
known is pronounced "Doofus." 
</P>
<P>
 Can we all shut up and go home now?

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: WHERE TO FIND GOOD CREDIT ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I want to learn more about improving my credit. What should I do? -- A.M.B 
. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Among the best sources of information about credit rebuilding and 
responsible spending and budgeting is the Consumer Credit Counseling Service. 
For the nearest office, call (800) 388-2227. Another source of thorough 
information is "Money Troubles: Legal Strategies to Cope With Your Debts," by 
Robin Leonard. This book, published by Nolo Press in Berkeley, is available at 
public libraries, at book stores for $24.95, or through Nolo Press at (800) 
992-6656. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am going to lend my son $45,000. I want to charge the lowest rate I can 
without triggering a gift tax or other tax consequences. How much interest must 
I charge him to satisfy the Internal Revenue Service? -- E.S.S . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The answer depends on two critical factors: the interest rate you charge 
your son and whether he receives interest income on any of his own investments. 
If he does get interest income from investments, your loan would have to carry 
an interest rate equal to or greater than the "applicable federal rate" for 
family loans for you to avoid both gift-tax and income-tax consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you charge less than the applicable federal rate -- an amount that 
floats with the market and is set every six months -- the forgone interest 
would be considered a gift from you and deducted from your lifetime gift limit 
of $600,000. You would also be required to claim as your income the amount of 
interest your son receives on his investments. 
</P>
<P>
 If your son receives no interest income from investments, you may lend him up 
to $100,000 and charge less than the applicable federal rate (or even no 
interest at all) with no gift-tax or income-tax consequences.  
</P>
<P>
 Q. I would like the address for the local chapter of the American Association 
of Individual Investors. -- J.R.G . 
</P>
<P>
 A. The association, whose aim is to help individuals learn how to invest in 
the stock market, has three chapters in Southern California. Los Angeles area 
residents should contact David Wright, 3420 Ocean Park Blvd., Suite 3060, Santa 
Monica, 90405. In Orange County, contact Wayne Johnson, 24271 Sunnybrook 
Circle, El Toro, 92630. In San Diego County, contact Paul Speckman, P.O. Box 
232821, Encinitas, 92023. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am retiring from the federal government at the end of this month. I have 
been told that because my Social Security benefits will be subject to the 
so-called "government pension offset," it is likely that any benefits I would 
be entitled to receive will be negated by the offset. 
</P>
<P>
 That all makes sense to me. My question is whether my wife, who is not 
entitled to any Social Security on her own account, will be eligible to draw 
spousal benefits through me even though I am subject to the offset. What do 
your experts say? -- L.J.K . 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your wife will be eligible to claim spousal benefits on your account 
regardless of whether you actually collect any yourself. Remember that 
technically you are eligible to receive benefits and that the offset is the 
only reason you won't. 
</P>
<P>
 Your wife's eligibility for her share of spousal benefits is not affected by 
the formula that eliminates benefit payments to you. 
</P>
<P>
 If your wife begins taking benefits at age 62, she will receive 37.5% of what 
you were eligible to claim at age 65. If she waits until she turns 65, she 
could draw the full 50% spousal benefits. As a widow, she would be entitled to 
full widow's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, Social Security rules apply equally to men and women. A man can 
apply for spousal benefits on his wife's account under the same set of rules 
women do on their husbands' accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Because readers so often ask about Social Security, we have prepared a special 
pamphlet to address some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 To order one, send a check payable to the Los Angeles Times for $4.33 (tax and 
postage included) and mail it to Times on Demand Publications, P.O. Box 60395, 
Los Angeles, CA 90060. Please allow up to eight weeks for delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 (A similar pamphlet on 401(k) plans may be ordered from the same address for 
$5.41.) 
</P>
<P>
 Q. My revocable trust is the beneficiary of my individual retirement account. 
I understand that any distributions from the IRA are subject to income taxes, 
but is the IRA subject to estate taxes upon my death? -- M.A.C  
</P>
<P>
 A. The value of an IRA or any pension plan is included in one's estate for the 
purposes of computing applicable estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, should your estate be left to your spouse, the unlimited marital 
deduction -- which allows spouses to leave their estate to each other untaxed 
-- would apply and no estate taxes would be levied. Of course, any withdrawals 
a spouse makes from an IRA are still subject to ordinary income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Should you leave your IRA to anyone but your spouse, it will be subject to 
estate taxes. However, the beneficiary is entitled to an itemized deduction on 
his or her income taxes for the estate tax amount paid on any withdrawal from 
the inherited IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tax specialists recommend that an IRA be left to an individual rather 
than to a trust because individuals are afforded more latitude in handling the 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the rules governing withdrawals are more lenient for individuals 
(and more lenient still for spouses) than for trusts.  
</P>
<P>
 However, this matter is complicated and can depend on several factors unique 
to each taxpayer. You would be wise to consult with a trusted professional 
before proceeding.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHEN THE PERFECT PREGNANCY GOES HAYWIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We're a nation geared to happy endings. Work leads to security. Love leads to 
happiness. And healthy pregnancies lead to healthy babies. 
</P>
<P>
 But what happens when things don't work out that way? 
</P>
<P>
 What happens when a perfect pregnancy goes haywire, when a baby's heart 
inexplicably stops and instead of a cradle at the end of the ride home, there 
is only a casket? 
</P>
<P>
 And what happens after the shock wears off and the isolation and self-doubt 
set in? 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, the worst happened to Shari Davis and her husband, Michael 
Dubin. The couple arrived at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center as Davis was well into 
labor with their second son, Daniel. Davis donned a gown, then climbed onto an 
exam table as a nurse attempted to gauge the baby's heart rate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thought she was finding a heartbeat, but it was mine," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a resident who said, 'Let's just get the ultrasound hooked up.' 
When they did that, it was quite clear that the heart wasn't beating and the 
baby wasn't moving. No one would say anything. Finally, I said, 'Are you 
telling me my baby is dead?' And after a very long pause, someone said, 'Yes.' 
Michael held my hand very tightly and just cried with me." 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes later, Daniel was born, silent and perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 As she held her baby, Davis said, "I just kept screaming, 'My baby is perfect! 
He's perfect!' I just couldn't grasp that a baby could be perfect and still 
die." 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three months later, Wendy Kilbourne Read, 30, went into labor with 
her second child, a daughter. In a routine exam with her obstetrician to 
determine how far she had dilated, the doctor was smiling and laughing as he 
looked for the baby's heartbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, his smile evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the matter?" Read asked. "You're scaring me." 
</P>
<P>
 "Get dressed," he told her urgently. "We're going to the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that day, as she and her husband, James, wept, Willa was delivered by 
Cesarean section at Cedars-Sinai. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the most unbelievably painful thing to hold your dead baby and see this 
perfect child," Read said. "Our daughter looked so beautiful, so peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When a baby dies, families are consumed by shock, grief and, very often, an 
overwhelming sense of loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted so desperately to talk to someone who was a good mother, a careful 
person," Read said. "Someone who had gone through what I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Flax, a hospital social worker, put Read and Davis in touch after Read's 
milk came in and she remembered that Davis had found a folk remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Wendy I put raw green cabbage leaves in my bra," Davis said. "It was 
soothing and my milk went away in a day. Also, it was comic relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Finding someone who shared her deepest wound, Read said, was invaluable: "I 
feel that Shari saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Read -- and their husbands -- have also found solace in the company 
of others who have lost babies at birth. They attend monthly meetings of a 
hospital-based support group facilitated by Flax and Sharron LeBo, a 
Cedars-Sinai delivery nurse who lost a baby in 1975 and was so angry at the 
insensitivity displayed by her doctors and nurses that she resolved to find 
ways to ease the trauma for her own patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we have worked through our grief," Davis said, "one thing that affects us 
is that none of us had any idea that our child could die, that stillbirth is a 
possibility in today's age of medical technology." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not as incredibly uncommon as everybody thinks it is," LeBo said. "It 
is one of those tragedies in life people don't dwell on and talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Stillbirth is a tragically common occurrence," said Dr. Richard Pauli, 
director of a program at the University of Wisconsin in Madison that has 
developed a protocol for hospitals to follow in the event of stillbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillbirth is defined as the death of a fetus any time after 20 weeks of 
gestation. Before 20 weeks, the loss is considered a miscarriage. In this 
country, about 1%, or one of every 100 to 115 deliveries past 20 weeks, ends in 
stillbirth. The incidence of stillbirth in fetuses who reach full term is 
significantly less than 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine Reiser, associate director of the Wisconsin program, said her group 
has been able to identify a cause of death in about 40% of the 1,200 stillborn 
babies it has studied. Dr. Cynthia Curry, a medical geneticist at Valley 
Children's Hospital in Fresno, said she has been able to discover a cause of 
death in about 70% of the 500 babies she has studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Causes of death are complicated and varied. They can include genetic defects, 
congenital anomalies, bacterial infections and placental abnormalities, but 
there is no simple catchall to describe the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are multiple causes of death in stillborn infants," Reiser said, "but 
not one that you can point to as the most frequent or common." 
</P>
<P>
 How seemingly perfect babies die is still something of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is more we don't know than we know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pauli, the umbilical cord is often inappropriately blamed for the 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pressed to find some explanation for a baby's death, medical personnel often 
are tempted to attribute death to the most obvious feature at hand -- a 
twisted, knotted, short, long or constricted umbilical cord," he wrote in a 
recent newsletter. "Only about one in every 40 stillbirths arises because of 
cord (problems)." 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths of Daniel Dubin and Willa Read, their mothers said, were attributed 
to probable umbilical cord problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that, both women went through a period of blaming themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe there wasn't something I hadn't done to cause it," Davis 
said. "I was one of those people who didn't let pregnancy stand in my way. And 
after my baby died, I thought, how could I be so cavalier? 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point, Wendy said, 'I must have been able to do something to get that 
cord off Willa's neck. If only I had stood on my head, maybe I could have 
prevented this.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I laughed, because I had stood on my head when I was playing with my son, 
Noah. And I thought that's what caused it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To listen to mothers and fathers who have lost babies at or before birth is to 
confront an implacable kind of grief. They grieve for the end of their dreams 
and futures. They grieve for what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 Their stories can make your heart hurt, but they tell them hopefully -- that 
doctors and nurses become better at handling tragedy in the delivery room, that 
the rest of us understand it can happen to the most vigilant parents, and that 
such losses are not felt less keenly because the child has not yet lived.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did all the right things," said Judy Leib, who lost her daughter in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "The perception is, it's done when you leave the hospital," said her husband, 
Daniel. "But the reality is, it's the loss of a child, and no one understands 
that." They regret not being encouraged to hold and name their baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "You feel like a freak," said Barbara O'Donnell, who was seven months pregnant 
with Brendan when his heart inexplicably stopped. "You're not the only one out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like you're cruising on the freeway and a truck slams into your from out 
of nowhere," said Mitch Pindus, whose wife, Polina, underwent a harrowing 
delivery in January before losing their daughter, Rochelle, 12 hours after 
birth. "They don't tell you about this in LaMaze." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they all wished that someone -- their doctors, their childbirth 
instructors -- had told them that perfect pregnancies don't always produce 
perfect babies. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have altered their fates. 
</P>
<P>
 But they might not have felt so alone.

 "Head and Shoulders" by Rose-Marie Turk (June 30) gives the readers the 
opinions of an assortment of styling professionals on the on-air appearance of 
many of the local TV newscasters. While the story was interesting, does the 
average viewer care what the news reader is wearing as long as it does not 
distract from the content of the news? 
</P>
<P>
 More distracting than the clothes these people are wearing are the inane 
remarks some of them far too frequently toss in, such as, "Thank you Fred, that 
was a good story," a comment that should be made in off-air time. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole idea of a news team with an anchor and a passel of anchorettes 
would, if we were not so used to it, seem rather silly, certainly to anyone who 
has watched a BBC news broadcast in which a conservatively dressed news reader 
simply reads the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that only one local station try such a format. The job could be done by 
any one of the hundreds of able would-be actors or actresses who abound in 
Hollywood.

 Living here in tinsel town, I keep forgetting that what's on the outside 
carries more weight than what a person thinks or says.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, if TV news anchors look stylish and up to date, they must know just 
what they are talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city as diverse and interesting as Los Angeles, I bet you could find 
something actually newsworthy to write about, rather than the length of a 
person's hair or the size of a lapel.

WHERE'S THE TRUST IN O'BRIEN'S POOL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike O'Brien may be an Olympic gold medalist in swimming, but his teaching 
method is out of the Dark Ages ("It's Sink or Swim -- for Dad Too," July 6). 
</P>
<P>
 I taught swimming at Boy Scout camps for a number of years.We used a gradual 
method that coaxed the most timid child, some of whom were afraid to even stick 
a toe in. First the toes. Then wading, then blowing bubbles. Finally holding 
the breath and putting one's face in the water.  
</P>
<P>
 "How many fingers am I showing?" I'd ask, and they'd hold their breath, bob 
under and proudly tell me. Later, they grasped their knees to their chests, and 
floated. Then the prone or "Dead Man's" float. And when they eventually 
combined the float with a kick and arm stroke, they were delighted to discover 
that they were swimming. Every step was gradual. And every step was dependent 
on gaining the child's trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Mike O'Brien gain trust when he let the first child sink, then "pulled her 
out, kicking and screaming, gasping and coughing"? 
</P>
<P>
 And a question for the author: What kind of a parent would allow his or her 
child to be so frightened?

WHY BOTHER ASKING SUMMER FLINGEE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps therapist Pat Allen should examine the consistency of her advice 
regarding "safe" summer flings ("All Hot and Bothered," July 6).  
</P>
<P>
 First she counsels, "Just remember that you can't trust people," then, defying 
all logic, goes on to advise that you should ask the potential flingee: "Is 
this summer fling going to be monogamous for the next few weeks or months?" 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't trust people, of what possible use is asking them such a 
question? Are we supposed to believe they will be forthcoming with a candid 
response, such as "No, I'm only having a little fun with you tonight. . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 The pertinent question is one you should ask yourself: "If I knew this person 
was HIV positive, would I still have 'safe' sex with him or her?" If the answer 
is no, then it would seem the only true safety you will find is in refraining 
from such encounters altogether.

WHERE'S THE VIRTUE IN HYPOCRISY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading "Putting Us Back on the Path to Virtue" (June 23), I nominate 
William Bennett for a Pulitzer Prize in hypocrisy.  
</P>
<P>
 This man was part of the Reagan-Bush mob that gave us such social atrocities 
as Wall Street bandit Ivan Boesky with his "greed is good" mantra; Charles 
Keating and other S&L gangsters; Pentagon hacks who OKd $400 toilet seats; the 
Panama "incursion" that killed hundreds of innocent people just to get former 
CIA sweetheart Manuel Noriega; world-class liar and Senate wanna-be, Ollie 
North, and much, much more. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh Mr. Bennett, peddler of virtue, why didn't you speak out in the 1980s when 
these atrocities were unfolding?

 I regularly took part in a Lawyer in the Classroom program, speaking to 
classes in grades 8 through 12 until a couple of years ago. I found the 
children interested only in learning how to assert their rights, with no 
concern for their responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 This comports with the growing attitude of many parents who will fight school 
administration to gain acceptance of their child's "rights," as in dress codes 
or discipline, but who refrain from supporting school rules.  
</P>
<P>
 Children who get their way through parental intervention quickly lose regard 
for rules. If the school rules are to be ignored because Johnny or Susie simply 
does not like them, how far a leap is it to ignore other of society's rules?

 It's Paris in Pasadena this summer for the Metropolitan Associates' Summer 
Film Festival. That's the group whose members throw a blanket on the lawn and 
bring picnics, sweaters and insect repellent to watch the films roll at 
sundown.  
</P>
<P>
 They've gone Paris mad -- to view "The Rage of Paris," "Moulin Rouge," "Is 
Paris Burning?" and "An American in Paris." Chairman Sandy Huntley and his 
devotees have already picnicked at the home of Anne and Earl Snodgrass. On July 
23 they do the lawns of Joan and Jim Caillouette; on Aug. 6, hosts are Kittie 
and Bill Ballard, and on Aug. 20, Mary Kay and Boyd Hight. 
</P>
<P>
 In on the fun are Alice and Joe Coulombe (when he's not in San Francisco), 
Carol and Warner Henry, and Peggy and Jim Class. But, it's fun with a purpose. 
Profits will pay for buses to carry Pasadena schoolchildren to the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion next spring for matinees of "Porgy and Bess."

than one gram of fat per slice is from Gratis, the fat-conscious restaurant on 
San Vicente Boulevard in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 We're told trend-setting and fat-vigilant Westsiders have bought tons of the 
desserts for their birthday parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The pastry chef will personalize your message and add a few unfatty roses. 
While the cake just might make a dent in your guests' waistlines, it will 
definitely make a dent in your wallet at $30.

 Well, you can always stick a candle in a half grapefruit.

 House of Humility: As recently reported here, House of Blues was named best 
L.A. club, courtesy of the first annual "Heroes of the Night" awards chosen by 
a panel of industry executives and West Coast music journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 We're now here to tell you that the 3-month-old club, while honored at the 
recognition, graciously declines. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blues spokesperson told us that owner Isaac Tigrett "is a disciple of Sai 
Baba and is very into being kind to everybody and treating everybody with 
respect and equality." 
</P>
<P>
 He was really excited about winning but felt other clubs on the circuit were 
more deserving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so new. We're not there yet."

WESTSIDE WATCH: EXOTIC GUESTS ENSURE WILD TIME AT RODEO DRIVE EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a wild party, Beverly Hills-style. Some guests were dripping with 
jewels. Others were clad in exotic fur coats -- ones they were born with. They 
were animals. 
</P>
<P>
 A chimpanzee, a baby elephant and a zebra topped the guest list at the "Jewels 
of Africa" fund-raiser, held at Two Rodeo, a well-ventilated (thankfully) 
open-air mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit was hosted by actress Ali MacGraw and Tiffany & Co. to draw 
attention to the plight of the imperiled black rhino and to raise funds for the 
Mkomazi Game Reserve in East Africa. Proceeds were $40,000, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sights included fashion models dressed in haute couture, their necks 
adorned not by feather boas but by real pythons. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's connection? Some of its gems were mined in Africa, a store executive 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being seated at a table piled with boxes of ground rhino horn and 
other examples of poaching and the grisly trade in products made from 
endangered wildlife, a pair of U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service agents said they 
were happy to be invited to the $150-a-ticket gala.

 GOOOOAALL!: No one will be happier with the results of today's World Cup final 
than Santa Monica resident Berdetta Dakin, who doesn't give a hoot about the 
chances of Italy or Brazil, but just will be glad that the games are finally 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awful! I'm fed up with it," said Dakin, who lives in an apartment house 
next to 14 Below, a bar that was the scene of a high-spirited, drum-beating 
celebration after Brazil's 1-0 elimination of Sweden on Wednesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "There must have been 100 (fans of Brazil) fighting and spitting out 
four-letter words in the parking lot last night," she complained the next day. 
"They're very rude." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Sievers, manager of 14 Below, said he tried to do what he could to keep 
down the noise. He planned to post warning notices by the exit in time for the 
final match, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can't control everybody's behavior after they leave," he said. "That's 
part of living next door to a bar."

 CHANGE AT THE CHAMBER: Beverly Hills Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice 
President Bill Boyd will be leaving to head Mediascope, a nonprofit group that 
works with the film, television and music industries to encourage milder 
depictions of violence in the entertainment media. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd, who has led the chamber for the last four years, was named executive 
director of Mediascope effective July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been known to make quips about Beverly Hills in the past, but no more, 
because there's nothing funny about my new turf," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said he will continue to work with the 1,130-member Beverly Hills chamber 
as a consultant and will help in the search for his replacement in the 
$60,000-a-year post. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1992, Studio City-based Mediascope has a $1.6-million annual 
operating budget funded primarily through grants, including money from the 
Carnegie Corp. and the California Wellness Foundation.

ANALYSIS; HOW A GOOD IDEA BECAME A POLITICAL HOT POTATO; SANTA MONICA OFFICIALS 
AGREE THAT A HOUSING COMPLEX FOR AIDS PATIENTS IS WORTHWHILE. BUT SOME THINK 
THE APPROVAL PROCESS AMOUNTED TO AN ABUSE OF POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HILL-HOLTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It turned out, as had been long-predicted, to be a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 So no one was surprised when the Santa Monica City Council voted 5 to 2 
Tuesday night to lease city-owned oceanfront property to a nonprofit social 
service group for an affordable-housing complex for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-congratulation that followed was also not unexpected. There, too, the 
council members -- all of them elected with help from the city's powerful 
rent-control political machine -- did not disappoint, patting themselves on the 
back for their foresight, compassion, generosity and political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex will include 25 apartments for people who have been infected with 
the virus that causes AIDS and need affordable accommodations, counseling and 
other support services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be proud to put this in this location," said Councilman Ken Genser. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but some are wondering: Can they be proud of how they did it? 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Judy Abdo says yes. "This has gone through all the process it needs to 
go through," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But others, among them council members Robert T. Holbrook and Asha Greenberg, 
plus the president of the local Chamber of Commerce, call the matter at least 
an abuse of process and perhaps an abuse of power. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a prime example of people of a certain political persuasion being 
sanctimonious and engaging in politics under the guise of making a decision," 
chamber President Graham Pope said in an interview. "The decision had already 
been preordained. . . .The process was circumvented." 
</P>
<P>
 It must be said that Holbrook, Greenberg and nearly all others who opposed the 
site on Ocean Avenue, adjacent to the municipal pier, favor the housing project 
itself. They want to consider putting it at another city-owned property where 
it would cost less. 
</P>
<P>
 But some believe homophobia is at the root of the opposition. "It's AIDS 
prejudice," said Abby Arnold of Santa Monica AIDS Project, a city-funded social 
service agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of back-room politics and countercharges of homophobia. How did what 
everyone agrees is a laudable concept by a well-respected nonprofit group 
affiliated with the Episcopal Diocese disintegrate into this? It's Santa Monica 
politics at its most malevolent. 
</P>
<P>
 The group that wants to build the housing is called Project New Hope, which 
does job retraining and provides affordable housing for those who have the 
Human Immunodeficiency Virus, which causes AIDS. Before applying for federal 
funding, Project New Hope affiliated itself with Santa Monica AIDS Project, an 
agency run by Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold is a close friend of the mayor and other council supporters of the 
housing project, spawning charges of cronyism. Abdo also was on the board of 
Arnold's agency, which is how the mayor knew about the proposal from its 
inception in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Abdo quit the board last year when the council adopted a conflict-of-interest 
law. It was passed because council members other than Abdo said it was wrong to 
be on an agency board and then vote to give city money to the same group. 
</P>
<P>
 Further evidence of cronyism, critics charge, is that Project New Hope hired 
Planning Commission President Ralph Mechur -- another political ally of the 
council majority -- as its architect, thus further ensuring the success of the 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechur, who has designed other affordable-housing projects, said the charges 
are ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no truth whatsoever to charges that Project New Hope is trying to get 
a project approved behind the scenes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold also denied using her contacts to muscle the project through the city 
government. "I wish I had that much personal power," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdo also denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the project are unconvinced, saying project sponsors all along 
insisted on the plum location because, as Greenberg put it, "they knew they had 
friends in high places." 
</P>
<P>
 When city officials later suggested another piece of city-owned property, 
Project New Hope rejected it as not good enough because it was near a bus yard, 
not at the shore. They said their funding agency, the Department of Housing and 
Urban Development, rejected the site too, for a similar reason, and they would 
lose their grant if they didn't get the Ocean Avenue location. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear if that was an off-the-cuff opinion by HUD or an edict. At 
Tuesday's hearing, Holbrook demanded to see HUD's letter rejecting the other 
site. None was forthcoming, because, as was later admitted, none exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Arnold and others say it was the city staff that first suggested the 
oceanfront site -- among others -- in letters to HUD. Abdo said a letter that 
she sent, drafted by a staff member in 1993, included the Ocean Avenue address. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, City Manager John Jalili emphasized that a mention of a location 
in a letter to get funding is a million miles from a commitment to it. 
</P>
<P>
 When word leaked out that the project was being pushed, Greenberg accused the 
others of having a "ghost" council that did things among themselves then 
presented them in public as a fait accompli.  
</P>
<P>
 She was assured by the city manager in January that no decisions had been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold said she did not present Project New Hope to Greenberg or others 
because members of the housing staff had asked her to wait until the time was 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not up to us to decide at what point the staff gives information 
to the council," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Greenberg's complaint, the project was not publicly discussed for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Rosenstein put it on the agenda this spring, saying the rumor mill 
was churning and it was time to find out its status. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no public hearing at that time, but soon thereafter Arnold went out 
to sell the idea to the project neighbors. Opinions had, by then, hardened. 
</P>
<P>
 At an emotional public hearing, speakers questioned the fiscal prudence of 
turning over to a nonprofit organization a $1.5-million property that could be 
a revenue-producing site. After all, the city had just raised fees on various 
services to balance the budget; a year ago, parking ticket fines were more than 
doubled.

$1 MILLION IN STOLEN GOODS SEIZED; CRIME: OFFICERS ARREST BEVERLY HILLS MAN AND 
RECOVER PROPERTY HE APPARENTLY INTENDED TO USE FOR CONSTRUCTION AND DECORATION 
OF HIS BEL-AIR HILLSIDE MANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officers have arrested a Beverly Hills resident and recovered more than $1 
million worth of stolen property apparently intended for construction and 
decoration of his hillside mansion in Bel-Air, a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 items, ranging from a 19th-Century oil painting to hundreds of 
marble floor tiles, were seized June 29 from Wayne Robert Reiner's Beverly 
Hills apartment and his uncompleted three-story Bel-Air home, the spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiner, 40, who told police he is an accountant, has been charged with four 
counts each of burglary and possession of stolen property, but detectives said 
they expect additional counts to be added. Reiner, who is free on $30,000 bail, 
could not be reached for comment late last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they were alerted to the alleged burglary spree -- the largest in 
recent memory in Beverly Hills -- when a real estate broker reported seeing a 
man inside a vacant house on Alpine Drive on June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigating detectives, who had been to the house to look into an earlier 
burglary, realized that a set of cedar wine racks that they noted there before 
was missing, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also signs that the intruder had been interrupted in the process of 
removing a wine cellar air conditioner from its fittings. 
</P>
<P>
 The intruder had gotten away in a truck parked outside, but the broker wrote 
down the license number and registration records led detectives to Reiner's 
address on Glenroy Place in Bel-Air, where they spotted suspiciously similar 
wine racks lying on the driveway, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with search warrants, they then uncovered two separate troves of stolen 
goods at the 20,000-square-foot mansion and at Reiner's apartment, said the 
spokesman, Beverly Hills Police Lt. Frank Salcido. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the stolen equipment, including commercial-grade ovens and light 
fixtures, had been installed in the house, from which much of the construction 
material also appears to have been stolen, Salcido said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police now have the seized property piled high inside a police 
department garage: at least 10 television sets, including three large-screen 
models, videocassette recorders, antique tables and chairs, dozens of bronze 
and ivory statues, stereo equipment, computers and a set of tagged luggage that 
appeared to belong to Dionne Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
 The more mundane booty includes a top-of-the line refrigerator-freezer 
combination, six pool pumps, sinks, toilets, shower fixtures, and half a dozen 
home security systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The number and sheer size of some of the items required 10 officers to work 
about 30 hours each removing the property to police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the items have already been identified by the owners, including a Los 
Angeles antique dealer who recognized about $93,000 worth of stolen pieces, but 
the bulk of the property is awaiting identification at a viewing scheduled for 
Tuesday, Salcido said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrest, detectives have cleared eight burglaries of vacant homes or 
houses under construction in Beverly Hills, he said.

BRIEFLY; YOUTH: POST-FOSTER CARE CENTER TO OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Westchester House, a residence and counseling center for youths who have 
outgrown the foster care system, will celebrate its opening on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The institution will provide shelter for up to 18 months, a $175 monthly food 
stipend -- $225 for teen mothers -- training in job search techniques and 
access to social workers for counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in a Westchester apartment complex, the facility was established to help 
18-year-olds make an easier move into independent adult life. The building was 
purchased and renovated with $250,000 in federal funds through the Los Angeles 
County Community Development Commission.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The twang of steel guitars and the thump of cowboy boots filled the air as 
couples competed Wednesday in the regional finals of a country-Western dancing 
competition at a Santa Monica nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina del Rey residents Armando Arbaca and Christine Iannone scored highest 
of all local couples but were edged from first place by Ronnie DeBennadetta and 
Carrie Dawn Hoover of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners received $1,500 and will compete for the $10,000 prize in the 
national finals of the Marlboro Dance Showdown, to be held Dec. 7 in Arlington, 
Tex. Iannone and Arbaca got $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition at the Denim & Diamonds nightclub included the traditional 
two-step, the country-Western swing and a line dance called the "tush-push." 
Competitors were judged on precision, accuracy of dance step, showmanship and 
sportsmanship.

TOPICS; RESEARCH; BEWITCHED BY ANTHROPOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within a month of her arrival in Cameroon in the spring of 1992, Leslie 
Horton, a physician and anthropologist, witnessed a dramatic episode that 
changed the course of her research -- and her life. 
</P>
<P>
 While doing field work in a small village, accusations of witchcraft among 
young community members caused great upheaval in the town. 
</P>
<P>
 For Horton, the result was a dissertation in anthropology at UCLA, to be 
completed in September, titled " 'Eating Hearts': Witchcraft as Soul Murder." 
Horton's work explores the growing belief in witchcraft in a small town, a 
trend increasingly common throughout sub-Sahara Africa. Many scholars who have 
studied the region believe the practice is a response to the corrosive effects 
of modern development. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, a 41-year-old Venice resident, views anthropology from a unique 
vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from UCLA Medical School in 1985 and spending several years 
in Los Angeles treating the homeless and mentally ill, she launched herself 
into anthropological field work and the pursuit of a doctorate as a way to gain 
a deeper knowledge of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 She was recently named outstanding graduate student by UCLA's Alumni Assn. for 
her research in cultural psychiatry, and hopes to become a professor of 
anthropology while continuing her medical work. 
</P>
<P>
 The two fields complement each other, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural understanding makes me a better doctor," she said. "I want to 
practice holistic medicine, where cultural, emotional and social factors are 
considered as well as biological and physical ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton's experience in Cameroon helped her conceive that goal. She originally 
visited the country to study the child-rearing practices of a small community. 
But within a few weeks of her arrival, the village erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy, a smart and popular figure in the town, died from an 
illness despite treatments at the mission hospital. A village woman who was 
secretive and whose family had clashed with the boy's family was accused by 
teen-agers of being a witch and blamed for the boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said the woman denied the accusation and survived a potion that her 
accusers believed was fatal to witches. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, backed by the village elders, then drew up lists of suspected 
witches. Huts were burned and demolished. Pigs were slaughtered. (Many believe 
witches can transform themselves into pigs.) And suspected witches and their 
families were driven out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic forces provided a backdrop for the destruction. The town's palm oil 
mill, a major supplier of jobs, had recently failed, leaving many villagers 
disappointed and angry. Adding fuel to the fire were British Broadcasting Corp. 
reports of the Los Angeles riots, which many teen-agers in the village 
interpreted as a worldwide call for youth rebellion against injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton believes that the introduction of a modern economic system has 
destabilized traditional communities by loosening the authority of village 
elders in favor of other newly rich community members. In addition, she says, 
anxiety has increased as large factories have been introduced into the local 
economy, in which failures can produce chronic unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton explained that during such times, witchcraft is often blamed for any 
misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witchcraft is a common legacy of humankind throughout various historical 
periods," Horton said. "It often occurs during periods of deprivation, 
emptiness and loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton likens the rise of witchcraft in sub-Sahara Africa to what she believes 
is an increased use of scapegoats in economically troubled California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at how we view illegal immigrants," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Horton was in the village, she served the medical needs of the community 
and was greeted warmly, even while the burning and looting took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning, Horton has won accolades for her scholarship. She was awarded 
UCLA's Hayman Endowment Fellowship, which was established this year to support 
research into the psychoanalytic aspects of ethnic conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing a brilliant analysis," said Allen Johnson, a supervising 
professor of anthropology at UCLA. "In Cameroon she was plunged into a moment 
of enormous drama and as an anthropologist was lucky to be in the right place 
at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton believes she's on the correct path. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to be a professor and a practicing physician, looking at the 
meaning of illness. It's a four-dimensional way of practicing medicine," she 
said.

<P>
 French designer Yves Saint Laurent is displaying a newly created Peace Dress 
at his Beverly Hills boutique on Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The white silk satin dress, decorated with white silk doves trimmed in black, 
was inspired by the "International Peace Book," a coffee-table volume of 
messages from world political, religious and cultural leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be on view Monday through July 25, then auctioned in New York later 
this year, with proceeds going to UNESCO, the United Nations Educational,

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST LOS ANGELES; FREEWAY PLAQUE HONORS AIDS VICTIMS

 Councilwoman Ruth Galanter unveiled a bronze plaque Thursday that will be 
mounted alongside a freeway mural created as a tribute to people living with 
the virus that causes AIDS and to those who have died from the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-by-34-inch plaque contains the names of donors -- or their loved ones 
who have died of AIDS -- who contributed $1,296 for a square yard of the mural, 
"Unto Ye Heavenly Garden of Knowledge," by West Hollywood artist Russell 
Carlton.It will be installed next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony culminated eight months of work by the 32-year-old artist to 
paint the 195-by-13-foot mural, located on a retaining wall of the westbound 
Santa Monica (10) Freeway between National Boulevard and Overland Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was developed as a fund-raiser for SEARCH Alliance, a Los 
Angeles-based AIDS research organization. Approximately $60,000 in 
contributions were received. Contributors were also able to sponsor a square 
inch of the mural for $1 or a square foot for $144.  
</P>
<P>
 Forty volunteers, including some high school students, helped paint the mural, 
which contains images of angels, lilies, birds, an embryo and symbols of 
scientific research. It is flanked on each side by painted red ribbons 
symbolizing the fight against AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said she hopes that, as motorists drive by the plaque and mural, they 
will be reminded that AIDS is a communitywide issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us have an obligation to the families, lovers and children to those 
affected by AIDS," Galanter said. DONNA BIRCH

 That loud noise you may have heard this morning wasn't a replay of the 
Normandy invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the roar of hundreds of motorcyclists who were scheduled to rev up at 
two Westside locations for the third annual Beach Ride benefit to raise money 
for the Exceptional Children's Fund, which helps developmentally disabled 
children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "I warned all my neighbors that it's going to be very noisy on Sunday 
morning," said Marty Harrison, owner of Marty's Custom Motor Cycles in Culver 
City, who expected 40 bikers to gather in the early morning hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bartels' Harley-Davidson on Lincoln Boulevard in Marina del Rey, some 500 
owners of Harleys and other makes are expected, including TV actors Dean Cain 
of "Superman" and Daphne Zuniga of "Melrose Place." 
</P>
<P>
 The mass ride, beginning from 15 points throughout Southern California, will 
wind its way up Pacific Coast Highway and along the Ventura Freeway to San 
Buenaventura State Beach in Ventura.  
</P>
<P>
 The event, at $25 per person, is scheduled to continue throughout the day with 
a barbecue, music and a Mr./Mrs. Beach Ride Contest. LORENZA MUNOZ

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; UNEQUAL STACKS; PRIVATE FUNDING HELPED BRENTWOOD BUILD A 
NEW LIBRARY. OTHER FACILITIES, PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT DEPEND ON DWINDLING L.A. 
COUNTY RESOURCES, HAVE NOT BEEN SO FORTUNATE. 
</P>

 The people of Brentwood have written their own happy ending to a long saga 
over the local public library. As it happens, most of the writing came in the 
form of signatures on personal checks. 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, the ribbon will be cut on the $2.4-million, 10,400-square-foot 
Donald Bruce Kaufman Brentwood branch of the Los Angeles Public Library. After 
an 11-year struggle, residents of the affluent community have achieved victory 
in an era of financial hardship for many local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood residents, or at least 1,950 of them, paid for almost all of their 
new library -- and not just through taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed a library and we got a library," said Brentwood philanthropist 
Glorya Kaufman, who led the fund-raising campaign by writing the biggest checks 
-- totaling well over $1 million. Her generosity inspired the Board of Library 
Commissioners to name the edifice after her late husband. "I think it's 
wonderful when people get together and do things like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Westside communities are as fortunate as Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 In Marina del Rey, for instance, nothing will happen at the local library 
today -- or tomorrow or the next day either. That's because the Marina library 
can afford to open only on Wednesdays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Malibu library, patrons have become fed up as waiting lists for 
bestsellers have ballooned to several hundred names because the library has had 
no money for new books in over a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Oh, well, I guess I'll go out and buy it,' " said Malibu 
librarian Elaine Adler. "And then I say, 'Great. After you finish reading it, 
would you mind donating it to us?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the feast-or-famine world of community libraries, where a branch's 
quality, and perhaps its existence, can depend more on what system it belongs 
to and how much private support it garners than on how badly the community 
might need its services. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live within the Los Angeles city limits enjoy a library system 
that, one way or another, has been finding enough cash of late to improve or 
rebuild buildings, buy materials and fill long-vacant positions. People who 
live in nearby cities or unincorporated areas, meanwhile, are stuck with a 
county library system that can barely afford to stay open, let alone buy new 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics sketch part of the story: The city library system, which has 64 
branches, has an operating budget of $36.7 million this year, an increase of 
almost 7% over last year. The county system, meanwhile, with 87 branches, has 
an operating budget of $47.6 million, down 26% from the $64.5 million of the 
previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Library experts say the result is more than some inconvenienced book-lovers. 
Because children using local libraries to prepare homework assignments become 
exposed to literature there, library financial problems could affect the 
literacy of future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not able to go out into the schools like we used to and blow our own 
horn and get kids to read," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood branch at 11820 San Vicente Blvd. is just one of 25 Los Angeles 
city library branches undergoing major rebuilding or renovation projects, in 
most cases thanks to a $53.4-million bond issue passed by voters in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers have begun reinforcing and expanding the John C. Fremont branch at 
6121 Melrose Ave. in Hollywood. Contracting bids are being taken on a new, 
10,500-square-foot Robertson branch, between Beverly Hills and Palms, due to 
replace the old building at 1719 S. Robertson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Venice, construction is about half-finished on a new branch at 501 S. 
Venice Blvd. The 64-year-old former building at 610 California Ave. was deemed 
too small and not up to seismic codes. (Old branches designated as historically 
important will be repaired and put to some other community use. Such aged 
buildings are often unsuitable for library use, city officials say, because of 
unusually strict seismic codes for libraries partly as a result of concerns 
that stacks might fall during a quake.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although city libraries are holding their own, if not thriving, the 87 Los 
Angeles County Library branches are languishing, victims of an $11-million 
library department budget shortfall that shows no signs of abating. County 
officials say they may have to close as many as half of the branches in the 
system unless they can raise enough money by next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein and others traced the county libraries' immediate problems to 1993, when 
Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature shifted $2.2 billion of property tax 
revenue to schools to balance the state budget. Since the Los Angeles County 
system relies heavily on property taxes, it lost $29.4 million in operating 
revenue overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, county libraries have recently laid off 370 full- and part-time 
workers, cut service hours by 65% and halted all purchases of new books, 
magazines and tapes. On the Westside, branches in Culver City, Malibu, Marina 
del Rey and West Hollywood are still reeling from the changes -- and hoping the 
future doesn't bring worse news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost unbelievable that you have to think about the library remaining 
open in this day and age," said Greg Wenger, president of the Marina 
Foundation, a nonprofit residents' group in Marina del Rey. With the Marina 
library open just two days a week, Wenger said, many residents have resorted to 
treating a local bookstore as a de facto library, browsing through books and 
magazines there for hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Hollywood, "you go into the library now and it looks naked," said 
activist Roslyn Krause, who has complained to that community's City Council 
about the local county library branch. "It's so disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
 The deeper problem for the county, however, lies in the complicated history of 
state finance since the 1978 passage of Proposition 13, the property tax relief 
initiative, said UCLA economics professor Werner Z. Hirsch. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first few years following passage, Sacramento lawmakers reassured 
county governments that the state would pick up the funding slack for expensive 
mandates such as health and welfare, Hirsch said. But as state monies dried up 
during the recession, more and more mandates were passed back to the counties. 
As a result, overwhelmed counties have been forced to put libraries on the back 
burner, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 County library officials are now hoping for relief in the form of a bill 
sponsored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) that would allow public 
libraries to form special assessment districts to raise operating funds (a 
similar bill was vetoed last year by the governor). Meanwhile, libraries have 
mounted ambitious private fund-raising efforts to keep branches open. Groups 
that support libraries have been holding book sales. Volunteers are working for 
little else than the pleasure of being near books. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood faces no such problem. In fact, its construction project was 
completed far ahead of the other city branches slated for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood residents decided over a decade ago that their 3,500-square-foot 
branch was too small and should be enlarged or rebuilt -- if not with city 
funds, then with their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Kaufman, who was inspired to build the library after the 1983 death of 
her husband in a plane crash. Donald Bruce Kaufman was an avid reader who built 
a construction firm into an international company, the Westwood-based Kaufman & 
Broad Home Corp. Brentwood residents embarked on an 11-year odyssey to raise 
money and gain city approval for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman said the private effort was necessary -- at least before the 1989 bond 
issue virtually guaranteed branch library reconstruction -- because the 
community was far too wealthy to qualify for a library grant from any 
government agency. No bond money was used for the Brentwood branch because by 
then hundreds of thousands of dollars had already been secured from private 
sources, plus another $350,000 from the city's General Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never on the list to get a new library," Kaufman said during an 
interview at her hilltop estate in Mandeville Canyon. "The poorer sections feel 
their community needs a library, and we would never have gotten a bond." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert G. Reagan, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Public Library, agreed that 
a lot of government grants for libraries in disadvantaged areas "require an 
economic level certainly lower than that in Brentwood." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman and other Brentwood donors believed that the city should contribute at 
least nominally to the project. So in 1988 -- after the proposed branch had 
already been pledged more than $600,000 from Kaufman alone -- the Los Angeles 
City Council ponied up its $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This news did not sit well with other communities, which were making do with 
old or temporary library buildings. Activists complained that Brentwood was 
receiving preferential treatment because of its rich citizens, a perception 
that lingers to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The distribution of advantages in Los Angeles follows very closely the 
neighborhoods of big campaign contributors," contended Jeb Brighouse, a 
community activist in the Echo Park neighborhood. The Echo Park branch library 
has been housed in temporary quarters since the 1971 Sylmar earthquake. "Money 
talks. Brentwood talks, and Echo Park is silent."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city has just finished taking bids for a new Echo Park branch, but no 
ground has been broken, Reagan said, adding that it typically takes seven years 
to build a new library -- from securing financing to the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very often there is a perceived disparity among communities (for public work 
projects), but I can say, in the library department, that is really not true," 
said Fontayne Holmes, assistant director of branches for the Los Angeles Public 
Library. "There is equitable distribution of library funds throughout the city. 
Brentwood receives the same funds as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "First you feed your child, then you feed your neighbor's child," Kaufman 
said. "Rich people pay taxes too. Those taxes pay for bonds, and those bonds 
pay for facilities elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the attention of Kaufman and her fellow donors is now focused on the 
public building they financed with relatively little city help. The new 
Brentwood branch, a modern, white stucco building with a handsome dome 
skylight, will include a bookstore, a children's area, a balcony reading 
lounge, a meeting room and computer terminals. There will be shelving for 
33,000 volumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really planning on a small expansion (at first)," said Helen 
Stevenson, president of the Friends of the Brentwood Branch Library. "We never 
dreamed we'd be this fortunate." Library Projects

FOR SENIORS; LINDA FELDMAN; FOR HERTA WARE, ACTING IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's a sprite, a petite package of a woman with rosy cheeks and smart, 
pale-green eyes. Only her snow-white hair and her admission that she's 77 give 
away her calendar age because Herta Ware can, like any effective actress, 
persuade you that she's ageless. 
</P>
<P>
 But to understand her is to look at the company she keeps. Ware is the 
matriarch of an acting family whose members perform at and operate the Will 
Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Her four children -- three from her marriage to Will Geer -- and nine 
grandchildren are very much her inspiration and triumph, she says.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the most fortunate woman in the world to see my children all the time and 
watch them develop beauty and grace," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Born into a family of musicians in Wilmington, Del., Ware said she always knew 
she wanted to be an actress and remembers that her mother had no choice but to 
"send me to New York at the age of 17 because she knew there was no stopping 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 She met Will Geer, who was 17 years her senior, shortly after her arrival, 
fell in love and married him four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 They spent their early years together on a farm in Upstate New York, where two 
children were born. 
</P>
<P>
 When Geer won a role in a film titled "Fight for Life," they moved to 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 The Botanicum began in the early 1950s as a haven for performers, musicians 
and artists. It was not unusual to see Pete Seeger, Arlo Guthrie, Della Reese 
and Burl Ives in concert.  
</P>
<P>
 When the marriage was over in 1955, they remained friends, Ware said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Geer died in 1978, the family formed a repertory theater and created 
educational programs that have evolved into the Academy of the Classics. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Ware plays one of the witches in "Macbeth," directed by her 
daughter Ellen Geer. 
</P>
<P>
 She received the Ace Award for best supporting actress last year for her role 
in "Crazy in Love," a TNT movie special.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've only just learned to trust my instincts," she said. "I've learned that 
it's never too late and that ultimately a person can go back to what they 
wanted to do in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Will Geer Botanicum Summer Repertory Season will feature Shakespeare's "A 
Midsummer Night's Dream" and Tennessee Williams' "The Glass Menagerie."

SAY HOWDY TO TWO VERY DIFFERENT RANCHES, DUDE; A TRADITION-FILLED WYOMING 
SPREAD, OR A MONTANA PLACE WITH HOT TUB AND HAUTE CUISINE . YOUR DRAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Never mind the roaming buffalo, or those deer and antelope at play. Out in the 
wide open Western spaces these days, the plains are crawling with dude ranch 
proprietors, each determined to give a vast and disparate American public the 
ranch vacation of its dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Horses and family-friendliness are the obvious recurrent themes, and everyone 
seems to be basking in the cinematic afterglow of "City Slickers" and its 
sequel. But the ranch vacation now comes in more varieties than Disney has 
Dalmatians, and quasi-cowboys can pay $80 a day, or $150, or $250, depending on 
one's choice of meals, lodgings and surrounding luxuries. At the offices of the 
national Dude Ranchers' Assn., where membership grew from 35 to 69 ranches in 
the first six decades after the group's founding in 1926, the files now show 
more than 110 members. And that figure excludes many ranch operations that 
offer rural retreats, horseback riding and cabin living, but shrink from the 
word "dude." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, early this summer, as the rivers surged with runoff and the wind 
riffled through the amber waves of all that stuff out there that leaves thistle 
in your socks, I boarded a plane, hopped the Rockies and went looking for the 
edges of the ever-expanding universe of the ranch vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 My mission was to sample the extremes -- the most old-fashioned and newfangled 
ranches I could find. I found the old-fashioned ranch in Wolf, Wyo.; the 
newfangled one in Big Sky, Mont. Their features ran from coal heating to Kohler 
plumbing, from Jif in a jar to escargots , from a rumbling 1928 Ford Model A on 
a dusty path to lounging llamas on grassy knolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Eatons' Ranch may be the oldest dude ranch in America -- 19th-Century record 
books aren't clear -- and its keepers put on no airs. The property lies about a 
half-hour northwest of Sheridan, Wyo., cradled by the Bighorn Mountains, 
bisected by Wolf Creek, trodden each summer by the hoofs of about 200 horses. 
There are other hoof prints too -- mostly from roving deer and about 200 cows, 
whose offspring are usually packed off for plumping after they've reached 
yearling status. 
</P>
<P>
 But the point of Eatons' is horses. Each year on Memorial Day weekend, the 
ranch wranglers, sometimes assisted by ambitious dudes, spend three days 
driving the animals up from their winter home at the Eaton family's Echeta 
ranch, 100 miles to the east. The drive climaxes with a traffic-interrupting, 
police-escorted passage down Fifth Street through downtown Sheridan 
(population: 14,000) and ends at the Eatons' 7,000-acre spread. Near the end of 
September, the spectacle is repeated in reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Eatons' Ranch was founded by three Eaton brothers in 1879 on 
homesteaded land near Medora, N.D. From the beginning they entertained friends 
and acquaintances from the East, and in 1882 they accepted their first payment 
from one. They used the term "dude" to describe that guest and rusticating 
visitors like him, and may have been the first to do so. In 1904, the Eatons 
moved to Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch remains a family operation -- almost everyone with any authority 
carries the name of Eaton or Ferguson -- and you eat when the family says. 
During the summer high season, there are two strict dinner seating times: 
6-6:10 p.m. and 6:50-7 p.m. No one, the ranch schedule warns, will be admitted 
between 6:10 and 6:50. 
</P>
<P>
 You also eat where the family says (in an assigned seat with five assigned 
table mates) and you eat what the family says. Usually it's healthy helpings of 
American grub, family style, around a centerpiece of ketchup bottles and peanut 
butter jars. Capacity is 125 dudes, and adults generally pay $900 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 As you get ready to eat breakfast each day -- for that meal, you have from 
6:30 to 8:45 a.m. -- a few wranglers are driving the horses across Wolf Creek, 
up a dusty road and into the ranch's main corral, from which they are summoned 
for saddling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tradition is very big. The old photos and stuffed animals in the public rooms 
hint of summers past, as do the high wooden beams of Howard Hall, where there's 
a dance with a country-Western band once a week. Even the swimming pool would 
qualify as an antique, by California standards: It's about 60 years old, 70 
feet long and fed by filtered and heated creek water. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch's 54 cabins (one, two and three bedrooms) are fascinating, if not 
fancy. Lockless doors. Heating by propane gas, steam and coal stove, depending 
on the cabin and its vintage. The thermostat in my cabin controlled the 
temperature in several others. In another cabin, the summer's first occupant 
found a strong scent of skunk and what appeared to be a wasp's nest under the 
porch eaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get excited if there's a new bedspread in your place . . . but you don't 
want things to change," said Eileen Kidder of Cudahy, Wis., a repeat visitor 
for 14 years, as she led me on a tour. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ranch's biggest selling points is freedom. Once a dude (at Eatons', 
everyone uses that word without hesitation) has demonstrated his or her 
horsemanship, wranglers will set him or her free to ride unescorted, galloping 
on the flats, climbing the mountain slopes, loping up to the viewpoint on 
Rattlesnake Ridge, maybe even accompanying children or other less experienced 
riders. Most ranches don't dare let any guests go anywhere on horseback without 
a wrangler on hand, and members of the Eaton family say that one lawsuit, even 
if failed, could end their tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 But then again, maybe not. Sometimes, it seems that it would take more than 
mere legal action to dislodge a long-standing habit at Eatons'. Consider, for 
instance, the napkin rings and the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Every dude gets a brightly painted napkin ring with his or her name on it. At 
the end of every meal, dudes are supposed to stuff their napkins back into the 
rings and leave them on the table. Forget, and their waitress ties your napkin 
to the back of your chair, and you are singled out for gleeful public derision. 
I couldn't find anyone who remembered why this goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front step of most cabins stands an ice box -- not a refrigerator, but 
a box with a door into which a block of ice is placed each morning. The man who 
places the ice there is Franklin Whitham, who is known only as "Sudsy" (he 
started 30 years ago as a dishwasher). He makes the deliveries in the ranch's 
black 1928 Model A, with ice tongs at hand and a mixed-breed dog named Lady 
panting in his lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do the cabins need ice? Because the proprietors prefer to serve only 
overnight guests in the dining room, they can't get a liquor license. (They 
also feel strongly about preserving a family-friendly atmosphere.) But many 
guests do want a little beer or wine after a day on the trail, so they buy some 
in town and bring it back to the ranch. To keep it cool and at hand, they use 
the ice, and make Sudsy indispensable. Was Prohibition something like this? 
</P>
<P>
 If scenes such as this catch your affection, you keep coming back, form 
attachments, cherish the pile of rusted old horseshoes by the shed, make your 
calls home from the public telephone on the platform where the stage stop used 
to be and watch the wranglers practice their roping on lazy afternoons. They 
stand in the dust, toss a looped lariat at a plastic steer's head on a saw 
horse, hit or miss, recoil, toss and toss again. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Douglas, asingle Brooklynite, came back for 54 summers from 1935 to 
1988, then died. Mary Dailey, a photographer who lives in New York, in 1993 
marked her 43rd year visiting. (Like many veteran dudes, she takes the same 
cabin every year, and has done a lot of renovating and decorating herself.) 
Also last summer, the McNutts of Indiana and the Nimicks of Pennsylvania marked 
their 39th year, the Inglehearts of Kentucky marked their 36th, Col. Ed Clapp 
of North Dakota marked his 34th and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers' list can be interesting too: Among them last year was Tina 
Brown, editor of the New Yorker magazine, along with her husband, Harold Evans, 
president and publisher of Random House Adult Trade Books, and children. (The 
ranch reserves the right to "exchange references" with new dudes, and 
sometimes, according to a source I will call Deep Dude, a newcomer who is 
considered unreasonable or troublesome will find that the ranch is full up 
whenever he or she tries to book a return visit.) 
</P>
<P>
 Using the ranch as a base, a dude could fish for trout in Wolf Creek or the 
Tongue or Bighorn rivers (there are brochures for fishing guides in the 
office), or sample Western civilization in the nearby former frontier towns of 
Sheridan, Dayton, Ranchester, Big Horn, Story and Buffalo. But much of that 
seems to be beside the point to the most devoted dudes of Eatons'. After all, 
sight-seeing would leave less time to ride, to eat, to sit on the porch, and 
then ride some more. 
</P>
<P>
 Pull up a seat in the Lone Mountain Ranch dining room, take note of the high 
ceiling and the handsome twin chandeliers of bleached antlers, and read the 
note on your menu: The antlers above are not hunting trophies, it reassures; 
they "are naturally dropped each winter by bull elk." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one clue to the progressive nature of Lone Mountain Ranch, and there 
are many more. Lone Mountain lies in Montana's Gallatin Canyon, an hour south 
of Bozeman, an hour north of the west entrance to Yellowstone National Park. 
More than 750 miles of blue-ribbon trout rivers run within a two-hour drive, 
the Spanish Peaks mountains rise all around and the Big Sky ski resort stands 
close at hand. So do a few hints of Montana's burgeoning popularity: vacation 
condos under construction and a gas station that advertised itself as a "Travel 
Shoppe." But the ranch's most striking distinction may be that it deals more in 
environmental awareness and haute cuisine than it does in cowboy nostalgia and 
trail grub. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch itself is a compound of 23 log cabins, a stable, various public 
buildings, 700 acres of meadows, trails, wildflowers and pines, and thousands 
of acres accessible through lease agreements with neighbors and in the 
neighboring Gallatin National Forest. Deer and moose peek through the trees. 
The accommodations serve as many as 70 guests in summer and about 50 in winter, 
when the ranch lures cross-country skiers with more than 40 miles of trails. 
</P>
<P>
 My cabin was roomy, with pine-log walls and open sloping ceilings, electric 
heating, a rocking chair, a handsome black stove. As at Eatons', there was no 
phone and no television. There was a lock on the door, but guests are only 
issued keys if they ask, and most don't bother. The bathroom amenities matched 
those of any upscale hotel, and the porch looked out on a babbling creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining room is a log structure too, but went up in 1989. If it evokes the 
word "chow" at all, it's with the Italian spelling. The chef was trained in 
Holland. The restaurant is neighbored by a fully stocked saloon. Guests gather 
their food from a wealth of choices at a buffet table, then can either keep to 
themselves at a table for two or socialize at larger tables. On a busy night, 
the crowd may include two or three dozen day-trippers who have driven up to the 
ranch just for the food. Offerings include trout baked with spinach and Brie, 
schnitzel, pepperoni pizza (for children), cheese ravioli with scallops and 
bison steak. And every meal features a vegetarian option. (Guests eat whenever 
they like, between 5:30 and 9 p.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 No, vegetarianism does not square with the central objective of cattle 
ranching. But Lone Mountain hasn't been a cattle ranch for more than 60 years. 
And as the smoke-free saloon, the hot tub, the staff massage therapist and the 
place's various further comforts and precautions suggest, Lone Mountain hardly 
fits the mold of an old-fashioned guest ranch. Also, no one uses the word 
"dude." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Vivian Schaap, managers and majority owners of the ranch, were both 
raised in Wyoming, went on to big-city life in the Boston area, moved to 
Montana in 1972 and took over management and part-ownership of Lone Mountain in 
1977. Though the land was first homesteaded for a cattle and hay ranch in 1915, 
it was sold to a Chicago paper mill tycoon in 1926 and since then has generally 
had more to do with hospitality than livestock. In fact, neither a steer nor a 
cow has been professionally employed here in more than 20 years, unless you 
count the taxidermized head of Bessie, which looks down on guests in the 
ranch's lounge area. 
</P>
<P>
 The Schaaps' emphasis on wilderness appreciation shows up in various ways. As 
an alternative to the "rancher" package that is highlighted by six days of 
horseback riding in a weeklong stay, the ranch now offers a "naturalist" 
program that concentrates on guided hikes, a Yellowstone tour and activities 
designed to teach children more about the natural world. Basically, the 
naturalist gets everything the rancher gets, minus the riding, and saves a 
little money. (None of the packages is cheap; ranchers pay $1,450 weekly for 
the first person in a cabin, meals included, air fare excluded and $1,000 for 
each additional person.) 
</P>
<P>
 In years to come, Schaap said, "I think there will be a greater percentage of 
guests who won't want to get on a horse, or will want to get on a horse one 
time in a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Lone Mountain attracts its share of return visitors too. In fact, when 
ownership of the property was restructured last year, a handful of committed 
repeat visitors ended up investing and becoming minority partners with the 
Schaaps in the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 I did all sorts of non-equine things at Lone Mountain. On my first morning 
there I joined guide Tim Klare on a three-mile hike up the ranch's North Fork 
Trail. On the way, Klare pointed out glacier lilies, mule deer, the snow-topped 
11,166-foot-high peak of Lone Mountain, and the network of paths that under 
snow would become cross-country trails.  
</P>
<P>
 A day later I joined a rafting trip on the Gallatin, where many scenes in the 
film "A River Runs Through It" were shot. Since this was early June, the water 
was cold (we wore full wet suits) and the rapids fairly strong. After the 2 
1/2-hour, 11-mile ride, we were soaked. Our guide estimated that the rapids 
would be classified a 3 or 4 on the river-runners' 1-6 scale. (This trip is an 
extra excursion through Yellowstone Raft Co., and adds $37 to an adult guest's 
bill.) 
</P>
<P>
 After rafting, I ate and rested for two hours, then followed head fishing 
guide Gary Lewis on a fly-fishing float down the Madison River. Brown trout 
were biting on nymphs, and the landscape was empty of humans but for us. On the 
way home, the sky performed: golden late-afternoon sunshine on our backs, 
bursting black thunderheads off to the horizon on the right and a rainbow 
framing the snowy mountains on our left. Never underestimate anything anyone 
tells you about the sky in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lone Mountain is a ranch, after all, and one with nine wranglers and more 
than 90 horses. It makes sense to ride there. So when the equestrian club of 
Delta Airlines arrived and saddled up, I followed. Soon wrangler Jennifer 
McDonald was leading us across meadows, up slopes, through thick pine groves, 
across ravines and past a handful of recently constructed custom homes. (Lone 
Mountain's wranglers never let a rider out unguided.) We mostly walked, trotted 
a little, never galloped.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not, however, to discount the pleasures of a guided ride. After 
returning to relax for an hour or so, we saddled up again, and this time our 
wrangler led us to a barbecue a little way up the canyon. Pork ribs on the 
grill, along with trout, baked potatoes and a pot of beans. Coolers full of 
beer and pop. A pan full of apple cobbler. Quipping ranch hands. A 
cowboy-hatted toddler with a face full of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the leisurely ride through the cooling evening back to the stables 
and the most difficult decision of the day: To the hot tub next? The massage 
table? Or to the saloon for a toast to the broad new world of the ranch 
vacation? GUIDEBOOK

<P>
 A Whole Dern Passel of Ranches 
</P>
<P>
 Two ranches: Eatons' Ranch (Wolf, Wyo. 82844; telephone 307-655-9285). Rates 
from June 15 to Sept. 5 this year are $900 per week for each person 18 or 
older, $700 for kids 17 or younger, with a minimum stay of seven days. From 
June 1-14 and Sept. 6-30, when activities are more limited, the rates drop to 
$825 for adults, $625 for children. The ranch price sheet also notes that rates 
can vary depending on the type of accommodations and whether cabins are 
occupied to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lone Mountain Ranch (P.O. Box 160069, Big Sky, Mont. 59716; tel. 
406-995-4644). The seven-day "rancher" package (which excludes air fare but 
includes all meals) is priced at $1,450 for the first person in a cabin and 
$1,000 for each additional person age 6 and over; children age 4-5 begin at 
$625, those 2-3 begin at $300. The "naturalist" package costs $1,300 for the 
first person, $850 each for additional people. There's also a "fly fisher" 
package (four full-day fishing trips and various "naturalist" activities) at 
$2,150 for the first person, $850 for a second person sharing the same fishing 
guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Other ranches: The national Dude Ranchers' Assn. (P.O. Box 471, LaPorte, Colo. 
80535; tel. 303-223-8440) publishes an annual directory with descriptions of 
its more than 100 member ranches, and sends out copies for $5 each. Also, a 
two-minute call to (900) 988-0019, Ext. 634 (cost: $2 per minute) offers a 
general explanation of how to plan for a ranch vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colorado Dude & Guest Ranch Assn. (P.O. Box 300, Tabernash, Colo. 80478; 
tel. 303-724-3653 or 887-3128), which counts 40 member ranches, mails out free 
directories. 
</P>
<P>
 Dude ranch prices: Rates generally range from $600-$1,500 per week, per adult, 
excluding transportation to and from the ranch. Children's rates vary just as 
widely. Rates are mostly "American plan," meaning three meals daily are 
included. Riding is generally also included (guests are usually matched with 
horses on their first morning and keep the same horse for the rest of the 
week). Most activities beyond ranch confines (such as fishing with a guide or 
rafting) carry extra fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ranches leave gratuities up to guests or suggest that they leave a 
10%-15% tip (to be shared by staff). Other ranches assess a flat 15% service 
charge when you check out. Be sure to ask what credit cards are accepted; some 
operations are small and prefer cash or checks. Children: Family-friendliness 
means different things to different people. Some ranches are designed as places 
where parents and children spend their time together and don't offer 
baby-sitting. Some ranches provide it free, others provide for an added fee and 
still others will recommend a nearby day-care location. Families should inquire 
closely of individual ranches. Most ranches encourage children to ride horses, 
but start them at varying ages. At Lone Mountain, wranglers lead 4- and 
5-year-olds on pony rides and gradually lead 6- and 7-year-olds through special 
instruction. At Eatons', children under 6 aren't allowed to ride; older 
children are allowed to ride with appropriate supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the trail, don't expect video games. Most ranches offer such diversions as 
board games, puzzles, playing cards, Ping-Pong tables, volleyball and 
horseshoe-pitching.

TRAVEL INSIDER: WEAKENING U.S. DOLLAR STILL FINDS STRENGTH IN CANADA; CURRENCY: 
THE GREENBACK IS BUYING MORE IN THE 13 PROVINCES. AND HOTELS OFFER TAX REFUNDS 
ON THE SPOT. 
</P>

<P>
 Let us all now say a small prayer of thanks for Canada and its currency. While 
the U.S. dollar crumbles against the Japanese yen in global currency markets, 
our money is buying steadily more in Canada. The trend is strong -- in May, the 
U.S. dollar reached its strongest level in seven years against its Canadian 
counterpart -- and experts say it's likely to last at least through this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if you're like many Americans, you don't have a clear sense of how far 
one of our dollars goes when it's renting a room in Vancouver or buying dinner 
in Toronto. The answer is that right now those dollars can go far indeed -- not 
only because of exchange rates, but also because of the generally reasonable 
prices of hotels and restaurants in Canada's leading cities, and Canada's 
often-overlooked system of tax refunds for foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange rates. For about the last three months, the Canadian dollar has been 
buying about 72 American cents in currency markets. That's down four cents from 
the beginning of the year, six cents from a year ago, 11 cents since 1989. 
Citing the independence movement in Quebec and Canada's high public debt, some 
analysts say the Canadian dollar is likely to continue weakening and may soon 
match its all-time low against the U.S. dollar when it was worth 69.2 cents in 
February, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean that the current trend in exchange rates will inevitably 
save American tourists money. Tourists in Canada who buy goods that have come 
from the United States (clothes from a Canadian outlet of The Gap, for example) 
will find the economic machinery working against them. It's better, when in 
Canada, to buy Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and shelter. By one widely used measure, upscale travelers' costs in 
three of Canada's most-visited destinations, Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, 
run at least $40 a day less than they do in Los Angeles or San Francisco, and 
about $180 a day less than in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures come from the U.S. and Canada offices of business travel 
consultants Runzheimer International, which calculates per diem rates for 
business travelers. (Budget travelers, do not be alarmed at the numbers that 
are about to follow. To get its figures, Runzheimer surveys advertised prices 
at top-notch hotels and restaurants near a city's business center -- the most 
expensive places in town, basically. But even if you're staying somewhere far 
cheaper, the prices are indicators.) 
</P>
<P>
 In figures gathered since last October, Runzheimer sets its Los Angeles figure 
at $202.65 for a day's first-class lodgings and meals. Its San Francisco 
figure: $192.15. New York: $338.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Montreal, Runzheimer's most recent per diem rate -- calculated 
last August, before rates got even better for Americans -- was $141.65 in U.S. 
dollars ($104 for lodging, $37.65 for meals). 
</P>
<P>
 In Toronto, the rate was $140.10 ($105.50 for lodging, $34.60 for meals). For 
a broader view of lodging in that city, consider the 1993 hotel survey cited by 
the Toronto Convention & Visitors Assn., which found an average advertised 
price per room-night of $86.81 in Canadian dollars -- in the neighborhood of 
$65 U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vancouver, where prices can vary widely by season, the per diem estimates 
were $147.80 ($115 for lodging, $32.80 for meals) for the months from May 
through September, and $123.30 ($90.50 for lodging, $32.80 for meals) for the 
months from October through April. Most leisure travelers spend substantially 
less; when the Greater Vancouver Convention & Visitors Bureau surveyed more 
than 10,000 visitors last year, they reported an average of $85 per day in 
total expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tax refunds. Like the value-added taxes found throughout Europe, Canada's 
Goods and Services Tax (also known as the GST and currently set at 7%) is added 
to most goods (excluding meals, beverages, tobacco, rental cars, gasoline, 
airline and train tickets, and some artworks and jewelry) and is generally 
refundable to foreign tourists who collect receipts, fill out a form and mail 
them in. But unlike many value-added taxes elsewhere in the world, Canada's GST 
levies on hotel rooms are easily refundable to individual travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 If an American traveler has sales receipts for more than $100 Canadian in 
total spending, he or she can get a refund claim form from a store, hotel or 
any border crossing. The traveler fills out the form and can either seek a 
refund immediately (in Canadian currency) from a Canadian Duty Free Shop, or 
mail the form and receipts in within a year of the purchases and receive by 
mail (an estimated 6-8 weeks later) a check in U.S. currency. Spend three 
nights in a $100 hotel room and you have at least $21 coming to you. For more 
information on GST refunds, call (613) 991-3346 from the United States, (800) 
668-4748 from Canada. (The provinces of Quebec and Manitoba also offer sales 
tax refunds for purchases totaling more than $100.)

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; GORILLAS IN RWANDA SAID TO BE SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world has watched with horror as hundreds of thousands have perished in 
the bloody fighting in Rwanda. But lost in reports about the staggering loss of 
human lives has been any news about the fate of Rwanda's rare mountain 
gorillas, which live in the Parc National des Volcans and were Rwanda's main 
tourist attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, however, came word from conservation agencies that the animals 
appear to be unharmed -- at least so far. 
</P>
<P>
 When fighting broke out in April, foreign scientists and researchers were 
evacuated, but the Rwandan park guards remained on duty, according to Henri 
Nsanjama, vice president of the World Wildlife Fund. The guards report that no 
gorillas have been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain gorillas are one of the most endangered subspecies on Earth. Only 
about 650 are left in the world, one-third of which live in Rwanda's northern 
mountains. Tourism related to the gorillas once supported the Parc National des 
Volcans and supplied tiny Rwanda with its second largest source of foreign 
exchange.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Civil War, thousands of slaves made their way to a new life in 
Canada via the Underground Railroad.The Niagara Freedom Trail is a new 
six-hour, drive-it-yourself tour around southern Ontario with plaques at 
various stops marking where the freedom seekers were hidden, where they crossed 
over the border, where they lived, where they worshiped and where they're 
buried. For a free tour brochure: (905) 984-3626. 
</P>
<P>
 The Underground Railroad is also covered in the "African American Heritage" 
brochure from Lorain County, on Lake Erie west of Cleveland, Ohio: (800) 
334-1673.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK; MOUNTAIN RECESS; A LONG AND WINDING ROAD 
LEADS TO A REMOTE, AFFORDABLE ALPINE GETAWAY COMPLETE WITH PINE CABINS, QUIET 
HIKES AND BLUE LAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 We'd just taken aim on a slice of chocolate walnut pie a la mode when someone 
sounded the alarm: "BEAR!" 
</P>
<P>
 My husband, John, and I dropped our spoons and bolted out of the Silver City 
restaurant, joining about a dozen other awe-struck spectators in the early 
summer twilight. Sure enough, there stood a young black bear -- posing 
nonchalantly atop a nearby tree stump for a minute or two before ambling back 
into the tangle of white pines and incense-cedars behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just another 'Saturday Night Live' in Mineral King," shrugged pie-maker 
Connie Jones, whose family has owned the Silver City restaurant, a small 
adjoining store and surrounding cluster of rustic cabins in the Mineral King 
area for six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely 24 hours after arriving in this isolated southern swath of Sequoia 
National Park by way of a tortuous mountain road that made Big Sur's California 
1 feel like the Santa Ana Freeway, our wildlife count was the stuff of a city 
slicker's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen mule deer (not including the mother and newborn fawn a previous guest 
had spotted behind our cabin a few days earlier). Several six-inch-long rainbow 
trout, their cinnamon-hued gills flashing in the clear, icy waters of the 
alpine lake we'd ridden horses to that morning. And hordes of Yellow-bellied 
marmots -- sassy, squirrel-like creatures with a voracious and unexplained 
appetite for vehicle hoses, fan belts and electrical wiring. (Marmots are 
prolific year-round Mineral King residents, but their yen for radiator fluid 
apparently peaks in late spring and early summer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad average for two wilderness novices whose hiking boots are buried in 
the garage and whose idea of "camping" is a 30-foot chartered sailboat with hot 
shower and plenty of ice. Our three-day getaway was shaping up to be just what 
we'd wanted: a taste of the High Sierra, sans tents or blisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched a heart-pounding 7,800 feet above sea level at the edge of the Great 
Western Divide about 5 1/2 hours northeast of Los Angeles, the glacier-carved 
Mineral King Valley was the center of a short-lived silver mining boom in the 
late 1870s. But it was "white gold" -- frequent, abundant snowfall -- that 
yanked the area out of subsequent obscurity. Walt Disney's controversial plans 
to turn Mineral King into a major ski resort were thwarted in 1978, when the 
region was added to Sequoia National Park and protected from further 
development. Today, the saw-toothed peaks remain largely untrammeled -- the 
summertime province of backpackers with lungs and legs sturdy enough to handle 
trails that climb precipitously to nearly 12,000 feet. Not all are up to the 
challenge: The mid-June weekend we visited, rangers were scaling back a search 
for a solo day hiker who'd been missing for five days. He emerged, hungry but 
unhurt, the day before we left. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From Los Angeles it's a pleasantly innocuous four-hour drive on California 99 
and 198 to Three Rivers, a small resort town in the foothills of the Sierra 
Nevada. But those last 25 miles on Mineral King Road, a mostly paved route that 
dates back to the silver mining years and is closed from November to May, 
depending on snowfall, call for Dramamine and steely nerves. The narrow, dusty 
road hugs the boulder-choked East Fork of the Kaweah River most of the way, 
climbing steadily through a succession of chaparral, oak and pine. Fifteen 
m.p.h. is considered top speed, thanks to gut-wrenching potholes and a dizzying 
number of curves (698, for those obsessive -- or frightened -- enough to 
count).  
</P>
<P>
 By the time we'd arrived at Silver City, a private community of about 100 
summer residents that's surrounded by national park land, we were ready to 
stretch our legs and take deep gulps of the cool, pine-scented air.  
</P>
<P>
 Our weekend base was Dale and Connie Jones' Silver City resort -- the only 
lodging option in Mineral King, aside from wilderness camping (permits 
required) and a $5-per-night in one of 60 first-come, first-served spaces at 
two campgrounds. For $60 per night, our snug one-bedroom cabin offered 
bare-bones charm in a family-friendly setting. It was furnished with 
kerosene-fueled hurricane lamps and a wood-burning stove, plenty of wall hooks 
for hanging jackets and packs, a single and double bed, and a few well-placed 
cotton rugs that came in handy on mornings when the thermometer flirted with 40 
degrees . . . especially when I realized I could see daylight between cracks in 
the unfinished pine walls. Men's and women's bathhouses, with toilets and hot 
showers, were a few yards away -- next to a playground with slide, swings and a 
trapeze-like contraption that elicited squeals of glee from the children who 
congregated there. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cabin included a deck with charcoal barbecue and picnic table and kitchen 
with gas stove and cooking utensils, a setup that made us wish we'd brought 
along a stocked cooler (the resort doesn't supply ice). But we were happy to 
settle for a green salad, a bowl of Connie's beef stew and glass of jug 
burgundy for $9 per person, served in a dining room whose windows looked past 
freshly planted geraniums to mountain ridges that glinted in the setting sun.  
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, after wolfing down a breakfast of French toast and oatmeal, 
we drove another four miles to the end of Mineral King Road, where our reward 
was a glistening meadow with open vistas of avalanche-scoured peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 We would have been content to stake out a perch along the gurgling river that 
cut through the valley, but we were also curious about the spoke of trails that 
led into the mountains. So we took the "wilderness for wimps" option: a 
day-long, $50-per-person horseback ride from the Mineral King Pack Station to 
Franklin Lakes, a pair of impossibly blue bowls about 5 1/2 miles above the 
valley floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by an amiable singing cowboy named Kevin (whose repertoire ranged from 
"It's a Small World" to "Heartbreak Hotel"), we tramped through patches of 
snow, past lush clusters of lupine and corn lilies, and next to a waterfall so 
loud I mistook it for an airplane long before I spotted it. But the real payoff 
was the lakeside clearing where we tied the horses to a gnarled juniper tree, 
attacked a picnic lunch of tangelos and dried fruit we'd bought from a Central 
Valley roadside market the day before, and reveled in the fact that we were the 
only humans in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Our final morning in Mineral King, we decided to work off our saddle sores 
with a stroll under our own power. Equipped with a map, bottled water, extra 
sweaters and copious quantities of trail mix we headed for a logging 
camp-turned-campground called Atwell Mill. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentle, mile-long descent from the campground to the East Fork of the 
Kaweah was a pleasant one, and once again we found ourselves alone on the 
trail. Alone, except for a solitary giant sequoia that loomed out of the 
surrounding forest with a palpable sense of majesty.  
</P>
<P>
 Tiptoeing through the underbrush, we stood for a moment in the shadow of a 
20-foot-high, fire-caused gash in the sequoia's trunk. It was a fitting spot to 
reflect on the beauty of one of earth's oldest living things -- and to 
congratulate ourselves on braving the road to Mineral King. Budget for Two

where judges taste jars of pickled okra) include best lard cooking and best 
low-sodium categories. A special attraction this year: a life-size Garth Brooks 
carved in butter. Also, a rodeo, midway, livestock shows and an all-Iowa store.

HIKING: BUDAPESTHEAD NO BLUES ON THE DANUBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mysterious, exotic, surprising. These are some of the reactions I had while 
exploring the "Queen of the Danube," Budapest, on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the Danube are the Buda Hills, said by some geologists to be 
the last gasp of the Alps, rising dramatically from the water. On the other 
side of the river is Pest, low and flat and stretching into the plains. Marking 
this meeting of Europe and Asia are towers and turrets, castles and cathedrals. 
And over on Margaret Island is a tall bronze monument symbolizing the 1873 
union of old Buda and new Pest, the result being Budapest, surely a more 
euphonious name combined than divided. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular river walk, for visitors and locals alike, is the Danube 
Promenade on the Pest side of the city. It's a place for an evening stroll or 
an evening talk in one of the many riverside cafes. You can walk from Chain 
Bridge south to Elizabeth Bridge, then walk back on the Buda side of the 
Danube. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief riverside landmarks are the Danube's eight beautiful bridges. Oldest of 
the bridges so beloved by Budapest residents is Chain Bridge, built by 
Englishman Adam Clark in 1849, destroyed by retreating Nazi armies, and rebuilt 
and reopened in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bridges, the Arpad and the Margaret, link Margaret Island with Buda and 
Pest. The Margaret, designed by French engineer Alexandre Gustave Eiffel, is 
especially intriguing because it abandons its straight trajectory about 
midriver and heads off at an obtuse angle. From certain angles the bridge 
appears to end in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Island, a green refuge away from the hubbub of the city, is another 
great place to walk. The island's thermal pools, extensive hydrotherapy 
programs and fine hotels draw spa-goers from around the world. Slake your 
thirst with some Margaritsziget Kristalyviz, Margaret Island Mineral Water. 
</P>
<P>
 Enjoy an afternoon walk under fine old trees and through a rose garden and a 
sculpture garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Must-do city walks include Castle Hill, a half-mile-long limestone plateau on 
the west bank of the Danube containing Budapest's most important medieval 
monuments and best museums. Gellert Hill, crowned with Independence Monument, 
Budapest's unofficial symbol, offers great views. 
</P>
<P>
 While city walking, pick up the widely available Budapest map by Cartographia 
that includes hiking trails in the Buda Hills. DANUBE, MARGARET ISLAND, BUDA 
HILLS TRAILS 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Budapest, Hungary 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 1-4 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Riverbanks and hillsides 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Budapest's bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy, though the Buda Hills may get your heart pumping.

BUDGET BEEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the money spent on a trip involving a two-night stay gets up to $500 and 
more for two persons, you might as well rename the box found in your accounts 
of weekend excursions "Money Is No Object." 
</P>
<P>
 I have a similar complaint about your overseas reports.Let's take Europe. Your 
paper gives the impression that one must spend an average of $100 or more per 
night. But there are plenty of alternatives. Not just youth hostels or obscure 
hospices that you tend to banish into separate columns, but real options for 
the average not-so-fussy traveler.

<P>
 My husband and I look forward to your weekly "Weekend Escape" articles, which 
vary greatly in subject and focus, from posh resorts in Palm Springs to family 
camping trips in Yosemite. We read with some amusement John Lybarger's letter 
to the editor on June 19 (in which he described his own weekend visit to Santa 
Barbara, which cost him and his wife about $127). 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine critics like Mr. Lybarger requiring any guidance for 
their journeys other than a map with markers indicating the location of the 
nearest fast-food restaurant. For many of us, "indulging" in the unique local 
offerings of food, wine and atmosphere is one of the great joys of travel. It 
need not be costly, but it does require a willingness to adventure beyond the 
closest Be Bop Burger. 
</P>
<P>
 And if one wants to see a movie, it's infinitely cheaper to stay home.

ANGRY AT PICTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I couldn't help but feel disgusted and shocked by your "My Best Shot" of the 
painted elephant on parade in Jaipur, India (June 5). I am sure much of your 
intelligent and thinking readership would feel as I do: that your choice of 
such a picture represents an irresponsible and ignorant attitude on the part of 
The Los Angeles Times regarding appropriate and humane treatment of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 An animal is beautiful as nature created it, in its own environment, not 
slathered with paint all over its skin and paraded about on the hot city 
streets.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's grow up, and start teaching our children to respect the environment and 
all living beings with whom we share our world.

imminent, military operation in Haiti. What might such an operation entail and 
at what cost? 
</P>
<P>
 Some senior military people I know are perplexed by what it is they will be 
called on to do if ordered into Haiti. They are confident that any operation 
will be thoroughly professional. But they are troubled by what appears to be a 
lack of a clear military objective. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only two possible missions that the military can accomplish. The 
President could order U.S. forces to enter Haiti and take over the government, 
installing the exiled, democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, by force. Or Bill Clinton could order forces to protect, and perhaps 
to evacuate, U.S. citizens whose lives may be endangered. Both types of 
missions have been carried out before. 
</P>
<P>
 The protection mission widely hinted at by the Administration would not be a 
simple one. The Marines fear that any evacuation of Americans living in Haiti 
may result in a long-term occupation. The last time such an operation was 
mounted -- in 1915 -- it was 19 years before the Americans left the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan of attack is undergoing revision as conditions change, it 
probably calls for the seizure of the airport at Port-au-Prince and the 
establishment there of a secure base for subsequent operations to evacuate U.S. 
Embassy personnel, business people and journalists in the Haitian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 To round up the hundreds of Americans, mostly missionaries and aid workers, 
scattered at dozens of remote locations and small towns in Haiti, the Marines 
would have to fan out into the countryside. Many of these Americans would have 
to be told that they were indeed being rescued and need to move to an area from 
which they could be picked up by helicopter or small boat. This rescue mission 
-- known as a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation, or NEO -- is fraught with 
risk, because it would take time to get to the sites where Americans are known 
to be and because military authorities could not possibly know all the 
locations where Americans might be in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The second mission that may be assigned to U.S. forces is restoring the 
"legitimate" government to power in Haiti. U.S. troops have recently performed 
this mission. It was, in large part, what Desert Storm was all about -- taking 
Kuwait from the Iraqis and returning it to the Kuwaiti government. But any such 
operation in Haiti would be more like those undertaken by U.S. forces in 
Grenada and Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 The thugs surrounding Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras would probably have to be captured 
or killed before Aristide could be safely returned to power. These kinds of 
operations are called Coups de Main. They can be quite bloody. They require 
extensive preparation and rehearsal. They always demand the use of overwhelming 
force, because all centers of power have to be stormed. In a country like 
Haiti, this would be a tall order, since armed bands of thugs, many not under 
Cedras' control, may welcome the opportunity to try to take control and 
militarily challenge the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is a good possibility that the Cedras gang would simply run 
when faced with the prospect of doing battle with a Panama-like U.S. military 
campaign involving 22,000 soldiers. Certainly, neither the Haitian armed forces 
nor the elite presidential guard, which is loyal to Cedras, would be a match 
for a suitably sized and equipped U.S. invasion force. The entire Haitian army 
numbers no more than 7,000, with about 1,000 of them armed and equipped for 
fighting with small arms only. It has about a dozen armored cars, a few dozen 
light guns, a tugboat and two traffic-cop airplanes. One Marine can do more 
damage than the entire Haitian military. 
</P>
<P>
 The more difficult problem for U.S. forces would be to deal with the 
well-armed citizenry, which makes Haiti more like Somalia than Grenada. For 
example, what will the rules of engagement be if a U.S. soldier comes upon a 
threatening teen-ager with an Uzi? Most Haitians, in or out of uniform, will 
not warmly embrace invading Americans. And taking a shot at a low-flying 
helicopter is an easy way to express such displeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the environment will be hostile. Most of the time, it's hot and humid in 
Haiti. Worse, the hurricane season is about to begin, and Haiti sits in the 
zone of greatest danger from killer storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Administration must consider in its military calculations the 
price to be paid in U.S. personnel. While ours is the most highly trained and 
effective military force in the world, it is also one of the least rested. The 
Marines now waiting offshore Haiti had only two weeks of leave before being 
deployed there. They may have to wait some more. Certainly, they will have to 
engage in more dry-run training exercises before being committed to battle. It 
will be a supreme challenge to the motivation of these troops and to the skills 
of their leaders to get mentally prepared for battle in Haiti. Pentagon leaders 
call it the "Optempo" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, that since the end of the Cold War, more U.S. forces have been 
deployed for longer periods away from their home bases than ever occurred 
during the long face-off with the Soviet Union. Operations such as those in 
Somalia and in the former Yugoslavia cost millions in additional deployment and 
maintenance costs. This has produced a severe strain on readiness rates, with 
the Army and Air Force currently experiencing serious shortfalls in the 
mission-capable rates of much of their combat equipment, according to recent 
congressional testimony by the logistics chiefs of the services. 
</P>
<P>
 The political leaders in Washington are locked in a policy dilemma of immense 
proportions when it comes to Haiti. Faced with distasteful diplomatic and 
political options for dealing with the thugs in Port-au-Prince as a result of 
an irresolute Haitian policy, they are turning to the military to create an 
option to bail them out. The armed forces may find a way to do it, but it is a 
risky enterprise that is probably not worth the likely costs.*

A MATTER OF HONESTY: BILL CLINTON AND WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carl Bernstein, Carl Bernstein, co-author of All the President's Men, is 
author, more recently, of Loyalties: A Son's Memoir. He is now working on a 
book about Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If anyone doubts that self-interest, not the national interest, is the coin of 
the realm in Washington, Whitewater is ample confirmation. It is the inevitable 
culmination of a quarter-century of hypocrisy, lying and posturing by 
Presidents, press and partisan hacks alike. This time, the result may be 
tragic: to take a seemingly insignificant series of questions that should have 
been settled in the 1992 campaign -- and turn them into the diminution and 
possible ruin of the first presidency in a generation to deal seriously with 
the nation's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 On Whitewater, I have read far too much and learned far too little from the 
effort. But failing a whole new conspiracy unearthed by the special prosecutor 
or Congress or the press, Whitewater is not Watergate -- or anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton hasn't abused his presiden- tial authority, as Richard M. Nixon 
-- or even Ronald Reagan -- did. He has not promulgated illegal, 
unconstitutional schemes to bring about desired political goals, judging from 
the facts thus far revealed. But the distinction may be meaningless in today's 
atmosphere of rabid partisanship and media stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant fact known about Whitewater to date is that it occurred 
15 years ago. Clinton, as President, is being prosecuted for his ethical 
standards as governor. Moreover, he is being judged wanting by members of a 
congressional political class who, in many cases, fed at the same statehouse 
troughs that he apparently fattened at and who, according to PAC reports, have 
continued their bottom-feeding on the Potomac. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton's own lack of candor that has 
ensured this sordid story is going to go on, and on. Congressional hearings 
begin on July 26; the special prosecutor will be at work for at least another 
year. The Clintons' truth trimming has guaranteed that the press and Congress 
will continue down predictable paths -- reducing the whole sorry business to a 
high-stakes game of liar's poker, where only the Clintons can lose. They are 
heading toward a credibility problem that, in today's talk-show nation, could 
achieve Nixonian and Johnsonian proportions. Worse, unlike Reagan, who had his 
own troubles with the truth, Clinton is now perceived as a less-than-strong 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 This is something quite apart from obstruction of justice, as practiced by 
Nixon and documented on his tapes, or the Iran-Contra cover-up. George 
Stephanopoulus sounding off at the Treasury Department about the appointment of 
an official investigator who is an acknowledged political opponent of the 
President would seem, under the circumstances, reasonable. And, indeed, the 
special prosecutor reported June 30 that White House aides had not acted 
illegally in their contacts with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton has conspired with his aides to lie to grand juries or pay off 
colleagues for their silence ("I don't give a shit what you do. Lie, stonewall, 
whatever you have to do to get past the grand jury," Nixon said into his 
microphones), the press has uncovered no shred of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clintons and this presidency have a special burden. Unlike Nixon, the 
Clintons came to Washington riding the engine of political reform and change. 
Indeed, they have brought substantive change to the swamp of inertia and 
indifference that is Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is impossible to accomplish genuine political reform while practicing 
the same old tricks without bringing new values -- some might say spiritual or 
moral values -- to Washington. That was the promise of this Administration, 
that the breeze of truth -- about our politics, our national condition, 
ourselves -- would blow through the denial and pathology about America's 
difficulties. The "new politics" would be reality-based. 
</P>
<P>
 For that to happen, our President could not be a part-time truth teller. He 
had to break the pattern of deception that for a generation has informed what 
passes for political debate in Washington: a pattern in which posture passes 
for principle, process is valued more highly than policy and the most urgent 
national business goes untended. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, for the Clinton presidency to succeed on the terms it aspired to office 
-- honesty about our problems and the means available for their solution, 
beginning with the country's economic health -- a new pattern of presidential 
candor had to be established, especially after Lyndon B. Johnson's falsehoods 
on Vietnam, Nixon's on Watergate, Reagan and George Bush's disingenuousness on 
Iran-Contra and the arming of Iraq.  
</P>
<P>
 The conundrum of the 1992 campaign was always that Clinton promised us the 
truth, and we bought the promise -- because he told the truth about almost 
everything except himself. His judgment was right that, ultimately, people 
cared less about the assertions of Gennifer Flowers than about health care. But 
he was wrong to believe most people bought his self-serving answers to tough 
personal questions in the campaign; any more than most people are buying the 
Clintons' tortured explanations about cattle futures and chicken lobbyists. 
Let's face it: The Clintons sleazed some back in Arkansas. It is time to fess 
up: To acknowledge the glaring conflicts of interest -- and whatever else 
untoward may have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton ran for President under a new-age banner: The courage to change. The 
difficulty is that Clinton implicitly promised not only change for the country 
-- but change in himself. Perhaps that is why he is politically vulnerable in 
Whitewater: He appears not to have changed. The truth shaving, the lack of 
candor, that came to be known as the "character" issue in the campaign are now 
attached to his presidency. Surprisingly, the issue of candor -- and character 
-- now extends to Hillary Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, the Administration's responses to its substantive failings and 
inconsistencies, to the differences between principle and practice from Bosnia 
to Haiti, are increasingly described in the same kind of defensive, 
half-truthful context as the Clintons' answers on Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton presidency is in danger of becoming marginalized by temporizing. 
Clinton no longer commands the political high ground -- though, substantively, 
the facts and public opinion remain on his side of the issues. ("When 
Whitewater hearings are televised, it will be Clinton's turn in the bucket," 
Nixon told a trusted friend shortly before his death -- remembering that his 
own polls remained relatively high until the Watergate hearings.) Today, 
Clinton is much less an inspiring presence in the thought life of the nation 
than in the days following his election or his masterful State of the Union -- 
even as his eloquence and daring in confronting some of the true problems of 
our civil society have become more apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 His explanations of inconsistencies between his campaign rhetoric and policies 
-- on gays in the military, the abandonment of nominees when they got into 
trouble, his waffling on campaign-finance reform -- all fit the same pattern as 
the Clintons' answers on Whitewater. These are the old patterns of presidential 
prevarication, not the new politics he promised. Clinton's problems -- with the 
press, the Congress and the people -- are due to a growing perception that we 
are in danger of moving back to business-as-usual. 
</P>
<P>
 I write this as a believer in the potential of the Clinton presidency. Clinton 
shifted the terms of debate, just as Reagan moved the terms of debate and 
reference roughly 180 degrees early in his tenure. Clinton is the best-informed 
President of our lifetime. Today, imaginative ideas are being discussed -- in 
Washington and the country -- to address national problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is articulate, and clearly relishes the job and its opportunities. He 
has the political instincts to be a great leader. Moreover, like Reagan, he is 
prevailing: His basic economic program is being implemented. Some health-care 
reform will be accomplished, though in what form is still to be determined. As 
promised, he has undone 12 years of Reagan-Bush antipathy to abortion rights. 
He speaks sensibly and compassionately -- not in code -- about crime and family 
values and race. He was elected to change the country and the way things get 
done in Washington, and his agenda still reflects the promise. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this could disappear in the flotsam of Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton succumbs to that part of himself that plays fast with the truth, 
that doesn't inhale -- he is finished. If he thinks the lesson of the campaign 
is that he was helped by his equivocations, that he got away with it -- on the 
draft, on his personal life -- he is courting disaster. The press will, 
inevitably, make this the central issue of his presidency -- regardless of all 
the substance and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has been besieged by partisan enemies and thoughtless journalism since 
his tenure began. With some justification, he disdains the press. The press 
would be more interested in the truth if it were easier to obtain and did not 
require attention to context. Hence, the wild and loopy coverage in Whitewater. 
But the underlying questions raised in a handful of legitimate stories deserve 
honest, expeditious answers. Those haven't been forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying and dissembling, once the press pack is on to it, is an easy story to 
cover -- and contributes mightily to the devastation of presidencies. Witness 
the final chapters of Johnson in Vietnam, of Watergate, Iran-Contra. The GOP 
and the press are on the lookout for "Slick Willie," and any time they sense 
his presence, the truthfulness of the President -- not the worthiness of his 
programs -- will become the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In electing Clinton, the country summoned the courage to change that he called 
for. Now he must summon that same courage to change. The fate of his presidency 
may be at stake.*

RETURNING TO HAITI; IS IT ALL OVER FOR THE MONROE DOCTRINE? 
</P>

 'No, I don't despair, I don't believe in despair, but our problems won't be 
solved by the Marines. I'm not sure I wouldn't fight for Papa Doc if the 
Marines came. At least he's Haitian. No, the job has to be done with our own 
hands. We are an evil slum floating a few miles from Florida, and no American 
will help us with arms or money or counsel. We learned a few years back what 
their counsel meant.'- Graham Greene, 'The Comedians' 1966  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 July 28: Under orders from Washington, U.S. Marines land in Haiti. July 31: 
After losing two men to sniper fire, U.S. forces proceed to disarm Haitians. 
Sept. 3: The U.S. commander declares martial law, announces he is "invested 
with the power and responsibility of government in all functions." Sept. 16: 
Haitian puppet officials agree to treaty giving the United States the authority 
to maintain "a government adequate for the protection of life, property and 
individual liberty." This chronology is not a prediction, but a summary of real 
events in the year 1915. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, as in 1915, Haiti is wracked by deadly political violence. Today's 
rulers are contemptuous of democracy and human rights. They have not been moved 
by a punishing economic embargo. They have spurned the efforts of the United 
States and others to negotiate a political settlement leading to the return of 
ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. And now U.S. naval vessels are 
gathering near Haiti and the Marines are practicing amphibious operations. 
William H. Gray III, the Clinton Administration's special adviser on Haitian 
affairs, says no invasion is "imminent," but defines imminent as a matter of 
"hours or days."  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, with the strong possibility that history may be repeated, it is useful 
to explore the past, noting how much has changed in the relations of the United 
States and Haiti in 80 years -- and how much remains the same. A comparison 
will not provide a solution to the Clinton Administration's difficulty, but it 
will clarify the nature of U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the 20th Century, the Monroe Doctrine, with its attached corollaries, 
was the guiding principle for U.S. security in the Western Hemisphere. It held 
that the United States would oppose all European interference with the 
independent republics of the Americas. But the political turbulence and fiscal 
irresponsibility of several countries in the Caribbean basin -- Venezuela, the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti -- seemed to invite European intervention. The 
United States was particularly fearful that Germany might obtain a naval base 
threatening the sea lanes to the Panama Canal, then under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 President Theodore Roosevelt came up with a solution in 1904 -- known as the 
Roosevelt corollary to the Monroe Doctrine. He declared that civilized nations 
everywhere in the world should exercise "an international police power" toward 
countries engaging in "chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a 
general loosening of the ties of civilized society." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Western Hemisphere, that responsibility belonged to the United States. 
Under the Roosevelt corollary, the United States first established a 
protectorate over the Dominican Republic, Haiti's neighbor on the island of 
Hispaniola. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1913, President Woodrow Wilson added the establishment and protection of 
democracy as a goal of Latin American policy. The next year, the issues of 
democracy, "chronic wrongdoing" and U.S. national security came together in 
Haiti. The Haitian government was little more than a succession of military 
chieftains. Haiti was in debt to foreign investors. Germany appeared to be 
interested in settling debts in return for a base at Mole St. Nicolas, a harbor 
overlooking the passage between Haiti and Cuba. The United States, invoking the 
Monroe Doctrine, declared it would not tolerate "a foothold" by any other power 
in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 By January, 1914, normal conditions in Haiti -- meaning constant fighting and 
changes of regime -- led the Wilson Administration to demand the country's 
leaders follow democratic procedures and protect the life and property of 
Americans and other foreigners. A small force of Marines, about 120 men, landed 
and remained briefly in Port-au-Prince to emphasize American seriousness. But 
nothing changed. This month's revolutionary leader became next month's 
president -- and ex-president the month after. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1915, Gen. Vilburn Guillaume Sam seized power and arrested large 
numbers of the opposition. The Guillaume government lasted until July 28 -- 
murdering 167 political prisoners in its last moments. Sam took refuge in the 
French legation. The U.S. charge in Haiti reported what happened: "At 10:30, 
mob invaded French legation, took out president, killed and dismembered him 
before legation gates. Hysterical crowds parading streets with portions of his 
body on poles. U.S.S. Washington entering harbor." 
</P>
<P>
 Instructions went immediately to Adm. William B. Caperton to land the Marines. 
Germany was out of the picture because of the great European war, but the 
United States told the French and British not to even consider landing troops. 
The United States would look out for the interests of their nationals. The 
Monroe Doctrine was alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Port-au-Prince was under U.S. control, and 19 years of American 
occupation and military government had begun. The young assistant secretary of 
the Navy, Franklin D. Roosevelt, sailed down to see how his boys were doing and 
later boasted that he wrote Haiti's new constitution and it was "a pretty good 
constitution, too." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1934, Roosevelt was President and, as part of the Good Neighbor policy and 
in the absence of a European threat to American strategic interests, withdrew 
U.S. troops from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast-forward to the present. Haiti was a backwater during the Cold War. The 
CIA monitored possible communist influence, but found little. From 1957 to 
1986, Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) 
Duvalier, ruled Haiti through terror and corruption. Haiti, never prosperous, 
was the poorest country in the hemisphere. An increasing number of the people 
sought to emigrate to the United States. After a succession of presidents, 
reminiscent of 1913-15, Aristide was elected president in a free election in 
1991. But he was overthrown later that year by the military group now in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Terror is again the order of the day. Theodore Roosevelt and Wilson would have 
no trouble finding grounds for sending back the Marines. But the strategic 
arguments for intervention under the Monroe Doctrine are gone -- along with the 
Monroe Doctrine itself. Not even the most perfervid American patriot can find a 
foreign threat. No Germany, or Soviet Union, or any power wants a naval base in 
Haiti. Where formerly, under the Monroe Doctrine, the United States excluded 
first the League of Nations and then the United Nations from a political role 
in the hemisphere, now the U.N. presence is welcomed by Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt and Wilson had no qualms about using the U.S. government as an 
international policeman, whether to combat "chronic wrongdoing" or support 
democracy. But U.S. experience as a policeman since the end of the Cold War has 
not won broad support in Congress or with the public. Policeman has become a 
forbidden word in U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as in 1915, the United States has to consider the alternatives to 
intervention, but faces difficulties not present in the past. The desperate 
flight of thousands and thousands of Haitian refugees in their overcrowded and 
unseaworthy wooden sloops is new. Also new are the self-inflicted wounds on 
America's better conscience when these desperate people are turned back or 
gathered in the equivalent of detention camps. The other side of the coin is 
the political cost to any U.S. Administration of admitting large number of 
Haitians to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1915, before radio and TV, the American public received only delayed and 
attenuated accounts of conditions in Haiti. Today, we see on television the 
equivalent of President Sam's body parts being carried on the ends of poles. 
Such instant, vivid images may lead some Americans to favor intervention, but, 
on balance, they are probably a deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of support for democracy and human rights? It is easy to cite the 
historical record and say the U.S. intervention of 1915-34 did nothing for 
those ideals. But neither has nonintervention. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1915 intervention involved a question larger than Haiti. Wilson and his 
advisers asked what would be the consequences for region, the United States and 
international stability if the bloody chaos of Haiti was left unattended. One 
can argue whether their answers were sound -- but at least they tried to look 
at the big picture and act decisively.*

THE WORLD; BRITAIN ADJUSTS TO ITS NEW 'SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Martin Walker, Martin Walker is U.S. bureau chief for Britain's The Guardian 
and author of The Cold War: A History (Henry Holt).

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is our own fault. We Brits have picked and worried at this old scab of the 
"special relationship" until President Bill Clinton mercifully stepped in to 
stop the bleeding and save us from our own foolish myths and self-inflicted 
wound. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bonn last week, Clinton dispatched the British concept of the 
Anglo-American partnership to the mists of the sentimental past, and embraced 
America's new intimacy with Germany. Quite right, too, from Clinton's point of 
view. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just that financially and industrially, Britain is no longer even in 
the upper-middle classes of the global pecking order. It is that, with the end 
of the Cold War, the United States no longer needs the British Isles as an 
unsinkable aircraft carrier and provider of reliable diplomatic and military 
cannon fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 50 years, we have been America's white Gurkhas, loyal, gallant, 
little folk of quaint warlike ways, ready to do the bidding of the Yankee 
Sahib. 
</P>
<P>
 Atomic air bases and nuclear submarine facilities? At your disposal, dear boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overflight rights to conduct President Ronald Reagan's diplomacy-by-airstrike? 
Don't bother to ask, old chap. 
</P>
<P>
 A usefully located British dependency in the West Indies to decant Haitian 
refugees away from U.S. shores? The Turks and Caicos will do nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 We did our military bit, and not only in the Gulf War, but also with the 
British Army on the Rhine, the armored divisions of which were the backbone of 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's defenses on the North German plain. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnson's new Administration tentatively suggested 
that some token British presence might be helpful in Vietnam, he was reminded 
that, after defeating the communist insurgency in Malaya, and still fighting a 
low-intensity war in Borneo, Britain had more troops in Southeast Asia than the 
United States did. 
</P>
<P>
 We tried hard to please, but the game is up. One sure sign is on CNN daily. In 
the currency-news roundup of the state of the dollar, the yen and deutsche mark 
are the currencies that matter. The pound sterling has gone the way of the 
equally devalued Sterling, the last British family car we tried to market in 
the States. 
</P>
<P>
 We have gone through a series of self-deluding metaphors to protect and 
comfort ourselves against the cold reality of our declining status in American 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, when John Maynard Keynes and Harry Dexter White drew up the 
blueprint for the postwar financial order at Bretton Woods, the dollar and the 
pound sterling assumed equal status as the world's two reserve currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 years ago, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan mused about our being 
Greeks to the American Romans, the civilized and cultured slaves who really ran 
the Empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in that last and gloriously flaring supernova of the old alliance -- as 
Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher went arm-in-arm against the Evil Empire -- 
the image changed. We became the wise and keen-eyed Tonto to the American Lone 
Ranger, with our special forces always ready to creep stealthily through some 
foreign undergrowth, and our diplomacy available to explain the Lone Ranger's 
brusque ways to wary tribesmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The most compelling image, however, has always been of the Americans as Don 
Quixote, with Britain as plump little Sancho Panza, trotting loyally alongside, 
occasionally plucking fretfully at his master's sleeve to suggest that some 
windmills are not for tilting. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the Russians have taken the common enemy away, and Don Quixote 
has returned to the rickety ancestral home to consider domestic renovations, 
Sancho Panza is surplus to requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters of such gravity concerning the national interest go far beyond any 
personal coolness in the relations between Clinton and Prime Minister John 
Major. Though the low esteem in which British interests are held was signaled 
by the visa granted to Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams earlier this year, it is 
the underlying relations of states rather than surface bickerings of elected 
and temporary leaders that is driving the U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Sancho Panza has any sense, he will realize Clinton has done him a 
favor, sluicing away the befogging illusions of the past with a bracing douche 
of reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's embrace of Germany in a "truly unique relationship" was rooted in 
his belief that a fully integrated Europe is the crucial institution to 
stabilize the traditionally turbulent old Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 As the economic powerhouse of that Europe, and the nation most committed to 
the investments and trade that can draw Eastern Europe into the prosperity of 
the West, Germany is the essential vehicle for Clinton's grand design. 
</P>
<P>
 As the grumpily recalcitrant island that tries to stall the process of 
European integration, Britain is not only less and less relevant to U.S. 
interests, but is starting to antagonize them. 
</P>
<P>
 With its strategic utility to the United States declining, Britain has found a 
new niche, living like a parasite off the long equivocation that has bedeviled 
America's policies toward Europe. Unsure whether it feared a rich united Europe 
as a trade and possible strategic rival, or desired it as stabilizing 
democratic grouping to share the burdens of global management, the United 
States, under Clinton, has finally made up its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The German friendship is the path to the kind of Europe America now wants. The 
traditional special relationship with Britain would perpetuate U.S. dithering, 
an Anglo-Saxon mutual insurance policy against a Europe that might one day grow 
into a Frankenstein monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Under their breath, the British have a phrase for this, and at least one 
minister has been forced to resign for referring to "the Fourth Reich" in 
public. Thatcher, most certainly, was against it and, like so many of her 
countrymen locked in mystic memories of D-day, trusted too much and too long in 
U.S. devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 The little Englanders are right to say the emerging Europe will be a 
German-led Fourth Reich. But they are thumpingly wrong to assume this will echo 
the Third one. The point about the new Europe is that it will be what all of 
us, British and French, Italians and Spaniards, Greeks and, probably soon, 
Finns and Swedes, will make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 We all understand the need to tame the historic German beast. We also 
understand the need to provide a European answer to the German question. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, at last, America's white Gurkhas have been given their liberty, set 
free by Clinton's unsentimental decision to squash the old illusion, and force 
us to face the new challenge. Not only will we be of more use to America that 
way, we will be more use to ourselves and to our fellow Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 A generation ago, Dean Acheson warned that Britain had "lost an empire, and 
not yet found a role." Now we have one: to ensure that Europe's Fourth Reich is 
equally what the French can see as an entente cordiale, the Brits embrace as a 
commonwealth, the Italians join as a Risorgimento and, perhaps, even one day 
what the Russians call semya, a family. 
</P>
<P>
 If we Brits can finally put aside the humiliating role of Sancho Panza, and 
aspire again to the leading role of Don Quixote in building such a Europe, that 
is a windmill worth a tilt. And if Brits and Americans can join in that 
adventure, that will be the real triumph of a special relationship that has, in 
all other respects, outlived its usefulness.*

THE WORLD; THE PLOTTERS WHO SOUGHT TO KILL HITLER: A GIFT TO HUMANITY AT LARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Beate Ruhm von Oppen, Beate Ruhm von Oppen teaches at St. John's College. 
Her publications include Helmuth James von Moltke: Letters to Freya 1939-1945 
(Knopf). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the first news fragments about the failed attempt to kill Adolf Hitler 
came over the ticker tape in the afternoon of July 20, 1944, it was almost 
unbearably exciting. I was working in the Political Intelligence Department of 
the British Foreign Office. We had a machine that gave us intercepts of the 
German news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 I listened to Hitler's midnight broadcast. There was, alas, no doubt about it 
-- it was his voice. He denounced the "tiny clique" of traitorous, ambitious 
and stupid officers who had tried to rob the German people of its leadership 
and way of life. The stab in the back of the embattled nation had failed. There 
would not be another 1918. The traitors would be exterminated mercilessly. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, there seemed to be a silver lining in the cloud of 
disappointment when official word spread in London that the failure of the plot 
might be a good thing. Success might have made a martyr of Hitler and might not 
have broken his spell. And it might have started a new legend that traitors had 
deprived Germany of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, in July, 1954, Theodor Heuss, the first president of the 
Federal Republic, called the desperate and costly attempt to overthrow the Nazi 
regime a "gift to Germany's future." It was, I should say, a gift to humanity 
at large. For, despite the sometimes obvious diplomatic use made of "other 
Germans" who laid down their lives for a better Germany and a better Europe, 
despite the usefulness of "the German resistance" as fig leaf and olive branch 
after the war, there is more involved than Germany and its image in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a foregone conclusion that killing Hitler, even if possible, was 
the best thing to do -- though it would free the soldiers from the oath of 
loyalty they had all sworn to him personally. Thus, Helmuth James von Moltke 
thought it better to let Hitler live and bear the responsibility for the 
defeat. Moltke was an international lawyer working in the Abwehr, the military 
intelligence service, as legal adviser to the German High Command. He helped 
save many lives. He was one of the victims of the purges carried out after the 
July 20 assassination attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge saw Moltke as at least as dangerous to the regime as those who had 
taken violent steps to end it. Moltke had opposed the Nazis from the beginning, 
but had argued against the assassination and coup attempts. He did not think 
they would bring about the necessary change in the German mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Protestant theologian, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, held the opposite view. 
He thought that killing Hitler would be an "act of liberation," freeing the 
Germans from their stupefaction with the Nazi display of power. So he and his 
brother-in-law, Hans von Dohnanyi, were part of the circle of plotters. They 
were both members of the Abwehr, too, protected by its head, Adm. Wilhelm 
Canaris, and in league with his most active right-hand man and plotter, Hans 
Oster. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their good works -- the successful transfer of a small group of Jews to 
Switzerland under the guise of German intelligence agents -- led to 
Bonhoeffer's and von Dohnanyi's arrest in April, 1943, and to a serious 
weakening of the Abwehr. Bonhoeffer, Dohnanyi, Oster and Canaris were executed 
two years later. They were among the hundreds killed in connection with the 
plot, who were by no means all members of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Others had gone to the gallows and guillotine, to prisons and concentration 
camps, for less ambitious and more purely altruistic aims. Students of the 
White Rose group disseminated their leaflets to rouse the conscience of their 
countrymen -- and were beheaded. Bernhard Lichtenberg, the dean of the Catholic 
cathedral of Berlin, regularly said public prayers for the Jews; after serving 
his jail sentence, he died on his way to Dachau. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cold War and the division of Germany and Europe are over, their 
after-effects are still with us. Divisions between left and right, even of East 
and West, persist, straining German commemorations of the anti-Hitler 
resistance. Social Democrats don't want Chancellor Helmut Kohl to be the main 
speaker at the ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the assassination 
attempt. Some of the people connected with the permanent center of 
commemoration at the Stauffenbergstrasse in Berlin are worried that the 
military Establishment is muscling in. Conversely, others object to including 
exhibits representing Moscow-sponsored groups. Yet, the decision seems right 
not to censor them, but to let people make up their own minds about the likely 
motives and relative merits of the diversity of Germans who opposed the Nazi 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Allies called the events of July 20 a "Generals' Plot." It was a misnomer. 
Obviously, generals were needed if there was to be any chance of overthrowing 
the Nazi regime.  
</P>
<P>
 But the literature on the German resistance to the Nazis has made it clear how 
hard it was to recruit more than a few generals to the cause. In the end, it 
was left to a colonel, Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, to apply the final 
impetus. And it turned out that he had to be in two places at once: planting 
the bomb in Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia, and directing the coup in 
Berlin. It was obvious the chances were slim. But the desperate attempt had to 
be made -- even if it was likely to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost in lives was terrible. Peter Yorck von Wartenburg, the co-founder, 
with Moltke, of the Kreisau Circle that worked on plans for a better future, 
joined in the conspiracy after Moltke's arrest in January, 1944, as did other 
Kreisauers. Yorck was one of the accused in the first of the ghastly People's 
Court trials that followed the assassination attempt. His last letter before 
his execution speaks of atonement for "the guilt we all bear." He gave his life 
in expiation of the crimes of the regime he had fought. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, surely, is the significance of the attempt of July 20, 1944: There 
were people who tried to end the abomination, though there was hardly any 
chance of success; and the sacrifice of their lives was a demonstration of the 
sprit of humanity in an inhuman age.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; RON CAREY; THE UNION PRESIDENT TRYING TO CREATE 
THE 'NEW TEAMSTERS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harry Bernstein, Harry Bernstein covered labor issues for The Times for 32 
years. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For decades, the scandal-ridden Teamsters Union was dominated by mobsters, its 
top officers lived in luxury at members' expense, with salaries that ran into 
the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Three of the union's former presidents, 
along with hundreds of lesser officers, went to prison for white-collar crimes. 
Most members have relatively good contracts, thanks to many competent local 
officers, but critics charged that too much of union dues was spent on the top 
officers. The union's ugly reputation hurt it and smeared all other unions, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the government threatened to indict many top union officials. To 
avoid prosecution, the executive board agreed to a government-supervised, 
secret-ballot election for the top jobs, while other government investigators 
helped root out most of the remaining corrupt element. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, in came a little-known local union leader, Ron Carey. He and 
his reformist slate won the closely supervised 1991 election by a narrow 
margin. Carey was the first popularly elected president -- one with no known 
mob ties. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of the first-ever, serious internal battle for control. 
Many "old guard" officers around the country were apparently free of the 
underworld, but they tolerated the mobsters and supported them in office. This 
crisis in the Teamsters is more than an internal struggle. Last week, a 
critical bill affecting all organized labor was furiously debated in the 
Senate. The bill, which was killed by a Republican filibuster, was strongly 
supported by Carey. It would have prohibited employers from firing or 
"permanently replacing" workers who go on strike. The "permanent replacement" 
is one the strongest weapons management has in defeating unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the union old guard is fighting to oust Carey, or at least weaken his 
administration, as he restructures the Teamsters and slashes double salaries 
and large expense accounts. Carey, a slim man, dresses like a conservative 
businessman. He doesn't laugh much these days as he criss-crosses the country, 
meeting with groups of his 1.4 million members to try and hold his hard-won 
presidency of the nation's largest private-sector union. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school graduate, Carey became a truck driver, served a hitch in the 
Marines and, by the age of 20, followed the route of his father and became an 
active unionist. He and his wife, Barbara, have five grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's civil war is continuing, but Carey won a major battle when an 
independent investigating committee last week cleared him of all allegations of 
ties to organized crime and corruption, charges made by the old guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The Teamsters have been plagued for years by mob influence and most 
of that has been eliminated with government help. But now you have been accused 
by your foes inside the union of having ties to the underworld. What's going on 
here?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's utter nonsense. What they are talking about, if you pardon my 
expression, is the old trick that they hope . . . if they throw enough dirt 
against the wall, some of it will stick. They figured that since four previous 
presidents -- supported by my opponents -- went to prison or were indicted on 
corruption charges, it would be easy to smear me as the new president. They are 
lying. 
</P>
<P>
 I was elected because our members were sick of corruption -- which is what the 
average person walking down the street thinks when you say Teamster. I've 
established an ethical practices committee that investigates members' 
complaints of corruption. I've put more than 30 locals in temporary trusteeship 
so the members could help correct wrongdoing and undemocratic practices. That 
should help change the public's view of us. But my opponents don't seem to want 
that. They want this union back so bad they could care less if they destroy the 
union in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some of your opponents in the union have lost key positions on the 
international executive board, but they still have powerful roles. Despite 
their opposition, have you been able to make any other real changes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. For instance, we've played a leading role in the fight to bring up 
wages and safety standards for workers in Mexico instead of bring them down 
here. We're fighting for health-care reform that benefits working people and 
not the insurance companies. The old leaders of this union didn't do those 
things. The members voted for reform, for the platform that I put forward, and 
I'm moving forward on that platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You reversed the union's position in national presidential elections. Was 
that a dramatic move?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My predecessors backed anti-union, reactionary Presidents like Nixon and 
Reagan and Bush in hopes those Presidents would keep those former union 
presidents out of jail. That didn't work for long. But my administration didn't 
need or want such help. We supported the Democrat, Bill Clinton, along with the 
rest of organized labor, because he is at least trying to do more for workers 
and unions. I appreciate the story that asking working people if they were 
better off after four years under Bush is like asking whether the chickens are 
better off under the leadership of Col. Sanders. We are no longer going to be 
chickens. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about your goal of reforms. You said you were reforming the union when 
you and your allies voted to get rid of the four regional divisions that were 
centers of opposition. Your foes said you were just out to get rid of them, or 
at least punish them, by taking away important jobs. Didn't that just increase 
the internal struggle?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think it did. But I certainly was not doing that because many conference 
officers opposed me. We were not talking about individuals. None of those who 
lost hefty salaries as conference leaders were on trial. There were no 
prosecutors, no defendants . . . . We held hearings about the structure of the 
union and decided the old structure wasn't working. It was just an unnecessary, 
extra layer of bureaucracy. It allowed salaries of $300,000 and more, plus 
lavish expense accounts and pensions for a small group of officials of the 
conferences. What they were doing could be done cheaper at the local level, and 
by our offices at the international union in Washington. It was another step 
toward democratic reform. The old structure was undemocratic and wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about charges that your administration is not doing enough to win new 
members or get better union contracts? And that when you get into an election 
with other unions, the Teamsters lose, like the recent union election at U.S. 
Air?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We are doing much more to win new members than my predecessors . . . . We 
allocated over $25 million to organizing campaigns. They did almost no 
organizing and never saw that as important. That's one reason why the union had 
dropped in numbers -- in addition, of course, to trucking deregulation that 
opened the door for massive numbers of little, non-union companies that got 
jobs because they were willing to work for a fraction of the rates our drivers 
get, and with few, if any, benefits. The old guard had two or three organizers 
on the national staff. We have about 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what about your effort to win the union representation election at U.S. 
Air?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We lost it by a couple of hundred votes, and we were the last of three 
unions to get involved in that one. You know, you wonder about these folks in 
our own union who say they care deeply about it . . . but still handed out smut 
material against us in the U.S. Air election. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of smut material?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The smut material about the union, asking workers why would they want to 
join the Teamsters that has such serious financial problems, and then getting 
into those lies about me. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many other elections going on throughout the country that we're 
involved in, and while our membership is still going down somewhat, the rate of 
decline is half of what it was before. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your opponents have called you everything from a liar to a dictator and 
you've denounced them with equal fury. Will this infighting hurt the union?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Very badly, but in the long haul, this union will be a stronger and more 
democratic union when this fight is ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Workers join unions largely because they want better wages, benefits and 
job security. Your foes say you are weakening the union. Have your reforms made 
any difference in these areas?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Of course. Among other things, we are using new techniques to win better 
contracts, such as pressuring management with corporate campaigns that let us 
get help from workers in other companies, as we did in the strike at Diamond 
Walnut. We persuaded many candy companies to stop using Diamond Walnut because 
of the rotten way that company treated its striking workers. We're getting 
involved in shareholder meetings to gain some voice in management policies 
about the company operations and about attitudes toward our members. And we are 
getting our members involved in the reaching out to community groups, religious 
groups, women's organizations and others to say our fight for better wages and 
conditions is a fight that benefits the whole community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your union is having serious financial trouble. Your attempt to raise union 
dues was defeated by the members and opposed by many of the other officers. 
What are you planning now to keep the union solvent? Another vote for a dues 
increase?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I think another vote is certainly something that we can look at down 
the road. First, though, I think the vote itself was important to show we 
believe in union democracy. In the meantime, we are asking locals to consider 
other ways of getting needed finances to operate this huge organization, such 
as getting locals to decide if they want to raise more money from their own 
members to support strike funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Union payment of benefits to strikers were increased from $50 to $200 a 
week at the last convention, with no plan to pay for the increase. That was a 
hefty drain on the strike fund. You borrowed money for it. Have those benefits 
now been stopped?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, they have. Yet, we know they're vital, and that is why we are looking 
for alternative plans, like the one about local unions volunteering to raise 
their own strike funds so members can stand up to bosses who don't believe in 
treating workers decently. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your opponents say you're putting in inexperienced staffers to replace the 
men and women your allies have called members of the old guard network that ran 
the union for years. Is that true?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, that is not true. Fact of the matter is, when I came into office, our 
trade divisions and trade conferences had many staffers who were put there by 
past presidents. Some of them are still there, and they're doing a great job. 
We removed individuals from the international payroll when they would not give 
up their multiple salaries they were getting by holding at least the titles of 
more than one union job. But we are moving very qualified Teamsters into very 
critical positions that are left open. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Despite your claims, didn't you lose the first major nationwide strike the 
union had called against the trucking industry in many years, as your foes 
contend?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. We made some significant economic gains, although we wanted more. But 
one of the crucial issues was the industry's insistence on a demand that it be 
allowed to dump full-time jobs and replace them with part-timers. That not only 
would have hurt our members, but all workers, since it would have encouraged a 
terrible trend of employers to hire part-timers and get rid of badly needed 
full-time jobs. The AFL-CIO called that victory of the Teamsters "a victory for 
all labor." I'm proud of that and the other things we are doing. That's why we 
are calling our union "The New Teamsters." It really is.*

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; L.A.'S LATEST SPORT: TRASHING THE D.A.'S OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Katherine Mader, Katherine Mader is a Los Angeles County deputy district 
attorney and former criminal-defense lawyer who, among other defendants, 
represented Angelo Buono in the Hillside Strangler case. The views expressed 
here are her own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's so easy to kick 'em when they're down. "The Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office can't win the big ones." "All the older, good deputy district 
attorneys have left to become judges." "The district attorney should consider 
contracting out for legal talent." Any politician, talk-show host or shock jock 
can win points by participating in such "dumping," and no one seems to be 
fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the district attorney's office has not had terrific results in 
some recent well-publicized cases. There were no convictions in the McMartin 
Preschool child-molestation case. Nor in the Rodney G. King-beating trial. And 
prosecutors failed to win murder verdicts in the Menendez brothers' case. Of 
course, the same critics rarely mention other highly publicized cases that 
resulted in convictions, such as the Cotton Club murders and the Charles H. 
Keating Jr. securities fraud. Indeed, the district attorney's office 
successfully prosecutes 93% of the felony and 99% of the misdemeanor cases it 
acts on. But that's not front-page news. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is the source of the bad rap? First, we are, unfortunately, living in 
a culture in which "attack journalism" and mean-spirited talk-show hosts play 
prominent and rewarding roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, it appears journalists are desperate not to be left on the sidelines 
of a story. If the "story of the week" is that the district attorney's office 
can't try cases, within 24 hours of one story appearing, all forms of media 
jump on the bandwagon and tout the same theme. Guest speakers, usually from the 
defense bar, turn up on talk shows criticizing prosecutors. Usually, they 
haven't ever won any "big" case against the office. Yet, why turn down free 
publicity and an opportunity to pick up new clients? Right now, it's a pretty 
tough world for criminal defense attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Another explanation involves office politics. A year ago, Gil Garcetti won the 
election for district attorney. Not everyone in the office supported him, 
however. In fact, one deputy district attorney, still working in the office, 
ran against him. Presumably, he plans to run again. Why is it that no one in 
the media seems to appreciate the possibility that the unhappy deputy district 
attorneys quoted in magazine articles and other stories on the office have 
their own political agendas? Suckering the media to buy your negative rap sure 
beats raising campaign funds and paying for the attack ad yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, I watch dozens of hard-working deputy district attorneys, who are 
also talented trial lawyers, break their backs to achieve good results for the 
office and, most important, for the community. Furthermore, the office has on 
its staff a number of nationally recognized experts in various specialties. 
Unfortunately, the public only pays attention, at the media's direction, to a 
couple of high-profile cases in which the results weren't so great. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the "little" murders? I can assure you that the pain suffered 
by family and friends of murder victims who are never featured in newspapers is 
every bit a great as that suffered by the celebrated. There's also no 
difference in the degree of difficulty in prosecuting these "little" cases, 
especially those involving gangs, in which most witnesses are fearful of 
participating and prosecutors have to beg them to come forward. There are 
dozens and dozens of prosecutors who work night and day on these "little" cases 
-- without overtime pay, without thanks -- and treat each one as though it were 
the "biggest" murder in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Every month, the district attorney's office publishes a "Kudos" list, on which 
appears the names of prosecutors who achieve trial success where none was 
thought possible. This list, however, never seems to warrant a news story. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, perhaps the surge of critical interest in the district attorney's 
office can produce some positive results. Believe it or not, the world of 
computers has still not arrived for most prosecutors. Fax machines are few and 
far between. Many senior prosecutors share offices with several deputies. Many 
investigators have to delay interviews because the cars they share are 
continuously in the shop. 
</P>
<P>
 So why continue a career as a prosecutor? I can think of numerous prosecutors 
who passed up much more lucrative jobs. It's not that it feels good to lock 
someone up. What feels good is making the justice system work, and feeling that 
a case was solved and a conviction won because of individual extra effort. The 
high-level dose of bandwagon criticism is annoying because it is generally 
administered by ignorant commentators or others with their own political 
agenda. But it's not going to cause any of us to work less hard on our cases. 
And our conviction rate is going to remain just as high.*

SCORING GOALS; THE WORLD CUP CHAMPIONSHIP GAME AS POLITICAL PARABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who do you like in the World Cup? When Germany played Bulgaria, German 
Americans backed Germany, Bulgarian Americans and perhaps other Slavic 
Americans backed Bulgaria. That was fairly predictable. But when the match is 
between Italy and Brazil, where does the American sentimental allegiance fall? 
Do we take our stand with Brazil in the Western Hemisphere or with Italy in the 
Northern? As the eagle flies, Washington is only a little further from Rio than 
it is from Rome. But these days, which route does the American eagle prefer to 
fly: east-west or north-south? 
</P>
<P>
 Latino sympathy pretty clearly rides with Brazil. " Solos contra el Mundo, " 
trumpets the headline on the July 14 Nuestro Tiempo, " Brasil el ultimo 
representante de America ": "Alone against the world, Brazil the last 
representative of America." America there means the Americas, not the United 
States. But does pan-American solidarity outweigh Euro-American solidarity? Not 
for Italian Americans and probably not for most European Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun to think about these matters when nothing more is at stake than the 
world championship in a sport most Americans don't follow. But the underlying 
question, a question of national identity, is as rich, and interesting, as it 
is difficult. Wolf Lepenies, rector of the Berlin Wissenschaftskolleg, 
Germany's equivalent of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, recently 
greeted a group of visiting Americans with a soccer story. Twenty years ago on 
his first visit to the United States, he watched a soccer game played on an 
American football field: "How far apart America and Europe were became 
painfully clear to me when the announcer excitedly shouted: 'And now, ladies 
and gentlemen, we have a free kick from the 45-yard line!' " 
</P>
<P>
 The distance between football and Fussball (German for soccer) may seem a 
matter of small moment, but Lepenies linked that memory of his to another. 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a reception for visiting American foundation 
heads. Why, he asked, were they so little inclined to get involved in Europe? 
"You know," came the lapidary answer, "we tend to invest in the more 
interesting parts of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was before 1989," Lepenies adds ruefully. Since 1989, he says, the 
collapse of communism has not just unleashed long-dormant intra-European 
hostilities, it has also provoked scarcely foreseeable antipathy toward the 
United States. No longer needed as the Lady Bountiful of the Marshall Plan or 
the Captain Courageous of NATO, the United States may now be resented with 
impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, Lepenies says, the American experience may be more relevant than ever 
in Europe. He quotes the great 19th-Century German historian Leopold von Ranke, 
who, refusing to see Europe and the United States as opposites, expressed his 
view, somewhat astonishingly, as follows: "New York and Lima are growing nearer 
to us than Kiev and Smolensk." Though Lima may be spiritually a bit further 
from Berlin now than it was then, New York is closer. As for Kiev and Smolensk, 
they are at least as distant as ever, the Iron Curtain having been replaced by 
a Silken Curtain of trade barriers and immigration quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has its own trade and immigration problems, of course, but 
NAFTA has lowered the trade barriers, and Lepenies sees the European future in 
the current American immigration struggles rather as Jacob Burghardt, another 
great 19th-Century German historian, saw "an experiment in the European future" 
in the multiethnic European state that had come to life in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The question, of course, is whether the United States can manage this feat 
once again with a population so large and diverse that there is scarcely a 
World Cup team for which Americans cannot cheer. And yet if we do succeed, ours 
will be, once again, a historic success. 
</P>
<P>
 For now at any rate, let us celebrate historic success that is far less 
profound: the culmination of a highly successful World Cup tournament in 
Pasadena's Rose Bowl. May the best team win.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES: REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; THE SECRET TO LOS ANGELES IS THAT 
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than two decades ago, the English writer Reyner Banham came to this 
region and found a strange, sunny new world where "mobility outweighs 
monumentality" and where "only the extreme is normal." He observed, "I share 
neither the optimism of those who see Los Angeles as the prototype of all 
future cities, nor the gloom of those who see it as the harbinger of universal 
urban doom." 
</P>
<P>
 PSYCHIC IMAGE: Much has happened since 1971 when Banham penned those words, 
but they still ring true. Almost from its founding, Los Angeles has assumed a 
large and usually exaggerated image in the world psyche, alternately painted as 
a palmy pastel paradise and as an urban disaster worthy of the apocalyptic 
fiction of Nathanael West. For now, the latter woeful vision predominates, even 
among many Angelenos. But the reality, as Banham suggests, is somewhere 
between. It is along this median strip of life that those of us who, by choice 
or necessity, live in or near Los Angeles must negotiate our daily existence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is to that end that The Times today publishes a special 16-page section, 
"The Next Los Angeles: Turning Ideas Into Action." It is meant to offer 
practical ideas to mend a scarred city; to help it move on. Rarely in American 
history has a major urban area been so convulsed as Los Angeles has over the 
last three years. Our mettle has been tested by fires, floods, deadly civil 
disorders, a deeply depressed economy and, most recently, the Northridge 
earthquake. Some have reacted by leaving for more placid climes. This special 
section is meant for the 15.5 million who have stayed and are determined to 
make this a better place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 It is striking that the Times Poll found that 69% of L.A. County residents 
overall remained satisfied with their communities, although the level of 
satisfaction varied with locality and stood below the national average. For all 
the troubles, Los Angeles still offers much of what drew the movie makers and 
millions of others over the last several decades: fine climate, beaches, 
mountains and deserts, quiet peaceful neighborhoods, good cultural assets, 
tolerance for eccentricity and non-conformance and economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 CURRENT REALITIES: For all this, no progress is possible unless it is also 
understood that this region still has a great deal of work to do. It is not 
where it wants to be in race relations, though more has been accomplished here 
than in many other places in America. The economy is doing better but it is 
still far from recovered -- and no doubt the tight times have blemished the 
region's record for tolerance of diversity by exacerbating anti-immigrant 
fever. Violence, street gangs and graffiti have combined with insufficiences in 
police staffing and police-community relations to make the appearance of crime 
greater than the actual reality. The ranks of the homeless are distressingly 
large; overwhelmed, too many schools are struggling to educate and socialize 
our youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The special section addresses these and many other issues, not just to provide 
yet another litany of woes but to offer practical solutions. In February we 
published a similar section in which experts were asked to think about a better 
future. Some of it was visionary, some highly practical. Today's section 
focuses on specific feasible steps that can have near-term tangible results. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, for example, there is discussion of increasing student interchanges as a 
means of promoting racial harmony in a region that since 1980 has become both 
more diverse ethnically and more geographically segregated. And there is 
considerable discussion of nurturing small business and taking other steps to 
improve the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the ideas presented are not entirely new. Many of them could already 
have been implemented were it not for ossified state and local government 
structures that make innovation difficult. Clearly the region's city and county 
charters, dispersing so much power to local officials, need updating to deal 
with regionwide problems. But the section also strongly implies that individual 
actions, taking personal responsibility, can also make a big difference in 
solving many urban ills. 
</P>
<P>
 FUTURE POSSIBILITIES: The Times poll results show that crime and gangs rank 
well above unemployment and the poor economy as the chief perceived ills of 
Southern California. Concern about crime is certainly justified. But we should 
not lose sight of the larger reality that this region stands at an historic 
economic juncture. Our past glories were built, successively, on ranching, 
agriculture, oil, entertainment, manufacturing, aerospace and real estate. But 
we must recognize that our exuberant economic adolescence is over. While the 
new underpinnings of our economy are not yet clear, we must realize we have 
matured and must stand on our own feet. Certainly we can't complain that Los 
Angeles is not getting enough attention from Washington. In some ways the 
Clinton Administration is more responsive to needs here than Sacramento is. 
Fundamentally the real answers to our problems can be found here, especially if 
we are true to our history of sometimes freewheeling innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a valiant effort to find rationality in the seemingly random Brownian 
motion of Los Angeles, Banham 23 years ago reduced Los Angeles to four 
"ecologies:" Surfurbia, Foothills, the Plains of Id, and Autopia. He would have 
to expand that list today. But the underlying theme of Banham and other 
perceptive observers is that the history of Los Angeles suggests that anything 
is possible here. Let us not forget that.

DISCRIMINATION AGAINST GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It must be either hopeless naivete or Machiavellian intent that motivated 
the July 7 editorial, "The Right to Have a Job." To suggest that the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act will not lead to homosexual counting in the workplace 
ignores the history of civil rights enforcement in this country. For instance, 
Sec. 703 of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act contained this prohibition: 
"Nothing contained in this title shall be interpreted to require any employer . 
. . to grant preferential treatment to any individual or group . . . on account 
of an imbalance." In short, no numerical solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the courts have used 
numbers, almost from the beginning, to enforce this act. Every firm of any size 
in this country must fill out paperwork listing the demographic breakdown of 
the firm's work force. Imbalance in the proportions of minorities and women 
will trigger an EEOC investigation.  
</P>
<P>
 I can only surmise that The Times either is not aware of this contorted 
evolution, or is all too aware, hence the recommendation.

 * Rep. Robert K. Dornan's letter (July 11) is a distortion of The Times' 
editorial position, which he characterizes as a "cheap shot" against him and 
others who share his opinions. In fact, The Times' position on the issue of 
civil rights for gays and lesbians is, I would contend, quite moderate and 
sensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay and lesbian people do not expect people to "glorify" their lifestyle. Nor 
do they want "special" treatment. All they expect is fair treatment, just as 
people from other minorities have a right to expect. It is probably true that 
special legislation to protect gays should not be necessary (after all, the 
Bill of Rights should protect them). However, the fact is that gay and lesbian 
people are discriminated against on a routine basis in every facet of life, 
including employment opportunities and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Homophobia is one of the most insidious forms of bigotry and discrimination 
around because homophobics wrap themselves up in religion.  
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Dornan, I don't expect that this letter will cause you to change your 
opinion. In fact, I don't particularly care if you want to go on believing that 
"homosexuality . . . is inherently immoral," as long as you are willing to 
accept that gays and lesbians should have the right to live and work where they 
wish. But please, spare me from your protestations that you are not a bigot -- 
your own words betray you!

<P>
 Are we now to shrink from doing the right thing because it gives fresh 
ammunition to the fundamentalists who are livid over our President's concern 
for gays? 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's argument against this directive is that it smacks of special-interest 
lobbying. But to cave in to the bigotry of the radical right would amount to 
the same thing. Should Clinton also reverse his policy on abortion to satisfy 
Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson and Phyllis Schlafly? 
</P>
<P>
 Gays helped Clinton get elected and they deserve his concern exactly as Reagan 
and Bush pushed the agendas of the Christian extremists.

GOVERNOR'S RACE

 * Everyone in California is a winner before the election if our two very 
intelligent candidates for governor could stop the political positioning and 
address the issues you correctly raise in "Let's Try to Do This One Right" 
(editorial, July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to reinvent government will fail unless it starts with a more 
enlightened political system.I wish I could vote for both Democrat Kathleen 
Brown and Republican Pete Wilson as a team. We could not lose if they worked 
together and combined their strengths to develop strategies to lead California 
back to the top in education, business and as a great place to live and visit. 
The least they can do is share their best thinking with us and then implement 
it, regardless of who is elected.

<P>
 * I heartily applaud your editorial. You ticked off 10 issues about which our 
gubernatorial candidates need to develop a dialogue to inform voters. The death 
penalty was not among them, having been rightly dismissed as irrelevant earlier 
in the editorial. Yet Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, in the same issue of Opinion ("Will 
the Father's Political Sins Visit the Daughter?"), devotes five columns to an 
analysis of Kathleen Brown's problems in defining her death penalty stance. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we get campaign strategists to cut the baloney and get their 
candidates to discuss matters of importance if supposedly informed commentators 
such as Jeffe continue to expound on the irrelevant ones? Sadly, I would 
venture a guess that more has been written and spoken about Brown's stance on 
the death penalty than on any other issue she has addressed.

SELLING WATER TO SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Congratulations for your comprehensive account of the historic first 
transfer of Central Valley Project water to urban Southern California ("Tapping 
Into the Heartland," July 3). Whenever treading uncharted courses, it's only 
natural that those who are involved express concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be noted, however, that the Metropolitan Water District is not 
excluding local irrigation districts in the San Joaquin Valley in arranging 
voluntary water transfers. In fact, discussions now are under way with the 
Central California Irrigation District about incorporating the Areias dairy 
farm transaction into a district-to-district water transfer, and with other 
water agencies in the San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Water transfers represent but one portion of the overall mix for Southern 
California's future water supply. The Metropolitan Water District is deeply 
committed to water conservation, reclamation, waste-water recycling, 
ground-water cleanup and ocean desalination programs. Through these and other 
measures, the Southland will be conserving approximately 1 million acre-feet of 
water annually within 15 years -- water that will not need to be imported to 
supplement local supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 To put this into perspective, Southern Californians now use about 4 million 
acre-feet of water annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these mammoth conservation efforts, there still will be a need for our 
urban region to import some additional supplies from other parts of the state 
where water is more abundant and less expensive. These voluntary water 
transactions, all with the necessary safeguards to protect the local 
agricultural economy, promise benefits for the entire state's urban and 
agricultural economy, as well as its environmental interests.

TURKISH STRAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to your article "New Shipping Rules Bring Turkey Into Conflict 
with Russia, Neighbors" (July 2): 
</P>
<P>
 Annually over 50,000 ships carry their passengers and cargo through the 
Turkish straits (Bosporus and Dardanelles) which connect the Black Sea to the 
Mediterranean via the Aegean. For the 10 million residents of Istanbul, the 
only city in the world which sits astride two continents, the Bosporus Strait 
is a connecting waterway between the city's European and Asian sides.The oil 
tanker accident in March in the Bosporus, which caused at least 19 deaths and 
10 missing and horrified the city's inhabitants, is not the first but the 
latest example of the kind of the grave danger Istanbul is facing unless 
navigation is regulated according to the current conditions of the Bosporus 
Strait. There have been 40 big shipping accidents in and around the Bosporus 
since 1960, including the 1979 tanker collision which claimed the lives of 43 
seamen. It is for this reason that the Turkish government decided to put into 
effect new regulations designed to manage safer passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow Turkish straits are first and foremost a sea corridor, but not a 
passageway for oil and natural gas transportation. As long as thousands of tons 
of such inflammable and explosive materials are shipped in this heavy traffic, 
other vessels and human lives will remain in constant danger and disastrous 
accidents will be unavoidable. Therefore, the oil and natural gas from Central 
Asia and Azerbaijan should reach the sea via projected pipelines.

<P>
 Among the most pressing problems confronting Deval Patrick as the new 
assistant attorney general for civil rights is how to respond to the growing 
number of federal court decisions casting doubt on the constitutionality of 
racially delineated legislative districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenges began last summer, when, in a case involving congressional 
redistricting in North Carolina, several Supreme Court justices signaled their 
discomfort with racially determined districts, noting an unfortunate irony in 
using a form of electoral "apartheid" to solve problems of inadequate 
representation. In December, a three-judge Court of Appeals ruled unanimously 
that Louisiana's 4th Congressional District, which snakes along the state's 
borders for 600 miles, is an unconstitutional racial gerrymander. On 
instruction from the Supreme Court, another three-judge panel is reviewing the 
constitutionality of two "majority minority" districts in North Carolina. One 
of these, the 12th Congressional District, meanders along three interstate 
highways to connect majority black communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The easiest response to these challenges would be a reflexive defense of the 
present system. Liberal editorialists and civil-rights organizations 
characterize the choice as limited to upholding the status quo or returning to 
the bad old days of minority exclusion. There are, however, other options. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than try to defend a flawed system, the Justice Department should seize 
the opportunity to pursue more effective strategies for achieving equitable 
representation. For not only do black and Latino districts tend to reinforce 
and legitimate patterns of racial segregation; they also reproduce the 
injustice they seek to remedy by denying representation to other minorities 
within the so-called minority district.  
</P>
<P>
 The essential problem is that the very nature of our "winner take all" 
electoral system discriminates against minorities, and no satisfactory way has 
been found to fix it. As illustrated by a Florida redistricting case, in which 
blacks and Latinos have been battling over mutually exclusive plans to secure 
an additional seat in the state Senate, there is no way to draw district 
boundaries without shifting the burden of uneven representation from one group 
of citizens to another. And gerrymandering, as in Louisiana's 4th Congressional 
District and North Carolina's 12th, invites ridicule, if not hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple justice demands a more equitable system, one designed to assure equal 
representation to every citizen, regardless of race, creed, political 
orientation or ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the vast majority of the world's democracies -- ranging 
from Sweden to Spain to Costa Rica -- have adopted forms of proportional 
representation. Under proportional representation, single-member districts are 
replaced by multiple-member districts, and seats are assigned in proportion to 
the percentage of votes received. Thus, in five-member district, a ticket that 
wins 20% of the vote is entitled to one seat, one that wins 40% gets two seats 
and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom holds that proportional representation could not be 
introduced in the United States because it requires voting for political 
parties instead of individuals. Though "party list" systems are indeed common 
in Europe, they represent but one form of proportional representation. An 
alternative form known as the single transferable vote (STV) is, like our 
existing political system, centered not on parties but on candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under STV, which is used in Ireland, Malta and Australia, voters rank 
candidates in order of preference. In our hypothetical five-member district, 
the candidates who obtain at least 20% of the first-choice votes are elected. 
The remaining seats are filled by successive choices, subject to the same 20% 
threshold. This ensures proportional representation of significant minorities 
while preserving majority rule (a ticket that receives 60% of the vote will win 
three of the five seats). It also avoids racial and ethnic discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, STV transfers more power to the citizen. There is no presumption 
that members of a given ethnic group will always want to vote on the basis of 
their ethnicity. Minorities of all types -- political as well as ethnic and 
religious -- are guaranteed a voice.  
</P>
<P>
 STV also would free voters from the strictures of the two-party system. Since 
candidates would not need to win pluralities in order to be elected, 
third-party and independent candidacies would become viable. With 20% of the 
vote, a third party could elect something like one-fifth of the House of 
Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, since all votes under STV count toward the outcome, none are 
wasted. There is little pressure to vote for the "lesser of evils" and less 
incentive for the disaffected to not vote at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Proportional representation has the additional advantage of eliminating the 
swing factor -- that 5% or so of the vote that often tips a close election one 
way or the other. The heavy spending and negative advertising that have come to 
characterize U.S. campaigns are targeted at the small swing vote. By abolishing 
winner-take-all, proportional representation removes the 95% gain that can 
result from a 5% swing, greatly diluting the impact of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, there are no constitutional obstacles to electing the House of 
Representatives and most state legislatures by proportional representation. 
Thus, California, with 52 representatives, could divide itself into eight 
five-member and two six-member districts. North Carolina, with 12 seats, could 
set up two six-member districts. Louisiana, with seven seats, could form a 
single seven-member district. Should blacks, Latinos or Asians in any of these 
districts wish to elect members of their own ethnic groups, they would then 
need only 15% to 20% of the vote in each district to elect one representative 
(30% to 40% to elect two representatives). Hence, the objective of achieving a 
Congress and state legislatures that look like America could be achieved 
without separating the country into racial enclaves.

PLATFORM; A MOTHER'S PLEA TO KEEP FOCUS AND FUNDING ON TREATMENT FOR AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRENDA FREIBERG, BRENDA FREIBERG is a health-care management consultant, a 
member of the L.A. County Commission on AIDS and president of Research 
Sanctuary, an organization working to accelerate access to promising therapies 
for people with HIV and AIDS. She comments on the need to recommit funding for 
AIDS research: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I lost one of my two sons, Brett, to AIDS three years ago. I do not intend to 
lose my other one, Michael, who has been living with HIV for six years and with 
AIDS for the last two years. He is leading a productive, happy and hopeful 
life. But, our hopefulness is being sorely tested. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Congress approved a large budget increase recommended by President 
Clinton, along with a restructuring of the Office of AIDS Research, to better 
plan, coordinate, evaluate and expedite AIDS research. But we've seen little 
action. There is no strategic plan, no clear accelerated activity -- just more 
dialogue. And it's not apparent where the discretionary funds authorized for 
1994 have gone. Further, the budget process for 1995 is a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the scientists at the National Institutes of Health determined that 
they needed an additional $550 million to mount an effective research fight 
against AIDS. The President's budget proposed a $78-million increase, or nearly 
$500 million less than what the leading scientists think is needed. The House 
has appropriated only a $41-million increase. Yet the AIDS epidemic continues 
to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the results of last year's European Concorde study of 
AZT only highlights the short-lived benefits of that treatment. Now, to keep 
our hopes alive, we anxiously follow every twist and turn in the development of 
a new class of treatments, protease inhibitors. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we end this horrible epidemic if we fail to give our scientists the 
resources they need to conduct vital research? How can the new director of AIDS 
research, Dr. William Paul, reinvigorate the effort if he does not have the 
money to keep pace with last year's grants or the discretionary funds 
authorized so that he can act quickly when new opportunities arise? 
</P>
<P>
 To cut back in the face of a pandemic that is ravaging continents and which 
has grown from 10,000 cases in 1985 to more than 330,000 in the United States 
alone is unconscionable. Together with with groups like Mothers' Voices (which 
seeks an end to the AIDS epidemic through education and advocacy) and other 
families across the country, I ask the Senate to recommit the funds needed to 
keep the research intense, focused, vigorous and hopeful.

THE STATE; THE CASE FOR THE DEFENSE -- IF YOU'RE POOR AND CHARGED WITH MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles L. Lindner, Charles L. Lindner is past president of the Los Angeles 
County Criminal Bar Assn. and counsel of record in 13 capital cases. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson has purchased a Rolls-Royce defense team. Were he poor, Los 
Angeles County judges would grudgingly try to provide him with the legal 
equivalent of a broken- down Yugo from which they had siphoned the gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has had an opportunity to glimpse how capital cases are prepared by 
watching Simpson's lead attorney Robert L. Shapiro work. Experts are brought 
in. Police reports and transcripts memorized. Law books and scientific texts 
digested. Lines of attack -- as well as lines of retreat -- planned. Before the 
trial begins, Simpson's team will have devoted thousands of hours to preparing 
his defense in the murders of his former wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her 
friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, a poor person arrested on murder charges in Los Angeles could 
expect similar dedication from his or her public defender, or court-appointed 
attorney, even if the lawyer did not command the fee of an F. Lee Bailey. But 
within the last few years, a majority of Superior Court judges decided that the 
objective in capital cases should be the appearance, not the substance, of 
fairness -- a victory of Hollywood illusion over constitutional reality. 
</P>
<P>
 A capital defense attorney now tries his cases as much against the judge as 
against the prosecution, because judges keep dropping their thumbs onto the 
scales of justice. It is the defense that invariably gets short-weighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Supervising Judge Cecil J. Mills, along with some of his 
brethren, dramatically changed the way members of the death-penalty defense bar 
in Los Angeles are compensated. What the judges apparently desire is to 
transform what was once the most energized and talented group of 
criminal-defense lawyers in America into a fractured bunch of beaten-down 
public defenders and court-appointed lawyers. In the first year of the new 
policy, there were as many death verdicts handed down in the Criminal Courts 
Building as had been in the previous six years combined. 
</P>
<P>
 What Mills, Judge Michael Tynan and other judges did was to institute a 
flat-fee contract. Attorneys who had received an hourly fee of $100 (a fee 
unchanged since 1977) would instead receive, in the vast majority of cases, a 
flat fee of $60,000 for handling the entire death-penalty defense, no matter 
how long it took. Most capital cases take from between six months and a year to 
prepare and try. Mills proposed, and unilaterally implemented, a huge fee 
reduction for undertaking the most difficult task a lawyer can perform -- 
defending a man's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the reduction of fees was not without some wrinkles, however. Each time a 
defense lawyer won a motion, his or her pay would be cut. It does not require a 
rocket scientist to figure out that reducing lawyer's pay for winning creates a 
direct conflict of interest between the lawyer and his client. Put simply, it 
is unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 After a number of prominent defenders objected to the contract approach, a 
committee of judges was assembled and 15 objectors were suddenly removed from 
the capital-case panel. In their place, Mills appointed his friends and 
sympathizers. The standards that had been set by the Los Angeles County Bar 
Assn. were lowered. The result is Discount Death Days at the nation's busiest 
courthouse. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * The defense is legally authorized to have two attorneys in a case, such as 
Simpson's, with factual or legal complexities. But judges routinely refuse to 
appoint a second chair. In cases where the absence of a second would guarantee 
a reversal at the appellate level, the second lawyer's pay is put at 15% of the 
amount paid to lead counsel, roughly $1,500 a month for spending six months in 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Michael M. Baden, the pathologist hired by Shapiro, usually testifies 
for the prosecution. Dr. Charles Lee, the chemist who will do the forensic 
examination for the Simpson team, also usually testifies for the prosecution. 
The Los Angeles Police Department has committed well over 10,000 man-hours to 
collecting evidence against the former football star. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, under the death-penalty defense contract, a defense attorney 
representing a poor person must file a long motion for each $500 he seeks to 
spend in defense investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The prosecution has ready access to the pathologists at the coroner's 
office. In defending a poor person, the lawyer must not only petition the court 
for a pathologist to review the autopsy materials, but also is likely to have 
the amount paid to the pathologist radically reduced. As a result, only two 
pathologists are willing to testify under court appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * If a defense lawyer needs laboratory analysis, he may get it or not, largely 
based on the whim of the judge hearing the motion. The same is true for 
psychiatrists and psychologists, jury experts, criminalists, penalty-phase 
expert witnesses and numerous other professionals who go into creating a 
serious death- penalty case defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The epitome of the adversary system is a highly trained prosecutor and a 
highly trained defense attorney fighting it out in front of a jury. Los 
Angeles' capital defense lawyers, a number of whom are now household names, 
consistently have persuaded juries that either a) the defendant was not guilty, 
or b) the "special circumstances" allowing for the death penalty were not true, 
or c) that a jury should choose life imprisonment without possibility of parole 
instead of death, even if death was an option. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are rich, you stand to benefit from this system. But if you are poor, 
you will face a judiciary in relentless pursuit of creating defense mediocrity. 
It is this dumbing-down of the criminal defense that is reprehensible. In the 
Deep South, more than half of all state death judgments are reversed by the 
federal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 One does not need a psychic to see the future in Los Angeles.*

 * BURGLARY ALARMS: Referred to the Public Safety Committee a proposed 
ordinance that would require owners of alarm systems to notify the Police 
Department, either verbally or by electronic confirmation, of a need for 
service after an alarm has been activated. The ordinance, which has police 
approval, is designed to cut down on the number of false alarms responded to by 
police. Last year, there were 153,000 false alarms in the city. Police estimate 
that during the last five years responses to false alarms have cost $13.5 
million. Any violation of the proposed ordinance would constitute a 
misdemeanor. A decision by the committee is expected within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFER: Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of the people responsible for the murder of Kevin 
Murray, who was shot to death at 11:30 p.m. June 4 on 49th Street near 
Normandie Avenue. Murray, 17, and three friends were shot while in their car, 
apparently by gang members who mistook them for rivals. Murray's family is also 
setting up a reward fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD OFFER: Approved offering a $25,000 reward for information leading to 
the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the wounding of Los Angeles 
Police Officer Gabriel Rivas, who was shot in the face July 9 while patrolling 
5th and Glaes streets in Boyle Heights. Rivas, 31, underwent surgery at 
County-USC Medical Center and is recuperating. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE: Approved the closure of the west side of Towne Avenue 
between 4th and 5th streets Aug. 16 and 17 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. because of a 
back-to-school event sponsored by the Fred Jordan Missions. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * VICTIM ASSISTANCE: Approved the transfer of $48,000 from the city's reserve 
fund to the Special Emphasis Victim Assistance Program. This program focuses on 
the needs of robbery and assault victims in Los Angeles' Korean American 
community. One of its objectives has been to help Korean Americans cope with 
the psychological and emotional problems they have experienced in the wake of 
the 1992 riots, which hit Koreatown especially hard. Passed 12-0. Voting yes: 
Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Nate Holden, Jackie 
Goldberg, Rudy Svorinich Jr. Absent: Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

MCDONALD'S MASSACRE; TIME CAN'T HEAL ALL WOUNDS INFLICTED BY 21 SLAYINGS; 
CRIME: SAN YSIDRO LOST ITS INNOCENCE IN THE VIOLENCE 10 YEARS AGO. SURVIVORS 
COPE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The image has come to epitomize that hot, sunny afternoon 10 years ago, when a 
41-year-old unemployed father of two named James Oliver Huberty walked into a 
McDonald's and began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Three boys -- two of them dead -- lie sprawled on the sidewalk outside the 
restaurant, their bodies full of lead, their bikes fallen over their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving boy is a man now. Joshua Coleman is 21 years old, a mustachioed 
ironworker who helps build highway bridges and high rises. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow of July 18, 1984 -- and of the 21 adults and children who died in 
Huberty's rampage -- haunts many who were there that day. But Coleman insists 
that he is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly the day it happened and I think of my friends every time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as feeling sorry for myself or anybody, I can't let that stop my life. 
Nothing bothers me. Death doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers it well: He and his two buddies, Omar Hernandez and David Flores, 
had gone to buy some doughnuts. But Joshua wanted ice cream, too, so they 
tooled their bicycles over to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 They were on the sidewalk when 11-year-old Joshua heard the man yell. He 
turned and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying on the broiling pavement, his right side riddled with shotgun pellets, 
his pals nearby and the gunman still shooting, Joshua had the presence of mind 
to play dead. 
</P>
<P>
 How? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got lucky. The fact he kept shooting at us. . . . You hear about an 
accident and sometimes you think, 'What would you do if you were there?' And I 
always thought I would play dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty's paroxysm ended after an hour and 17 minutes, when he was killed by a 
police sharpshooter. In the aftermath, Joshua Coleman's parents enrolled him at 
a new school for a year to avoid scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 He never saw a therapist. Neither he nor his parents believed he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 He still keeps a big shoe box of letters from the hundreds of people who saw 
the picture of him lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of courage," they say. And "Be strong." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He could have been a hero. If he hadn't run, maybe -- just maybe -- Ken 
Dickey, a 20-year-old college student working behind the McDonald's counter, 
could have saved somebody's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember sitting in a chair for a long time, for days afterwards, and 
thinking, 'What could I have done?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I could easily have grabbed a metal object and bashed this guy across the 
head. That would have been the hero's route. I didn't feel I showed grace under 
pressure. I ran to a room in fear, hoping I didn't get shot." 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting started, Dickey and a male co-worker fled to a basement 
utility room. Later, three female workers joined them. Eventually, a woman with 
a baby came down, and then a bleeding man. 
</P>
<P>
 They huddled in the hot, stale basement with gunfire sounding overhead. 
Finally, police knocked at the door and, though they were fearful, they opened 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers told them to put their hand on the shoulder of the person ahead, and 
to look only at the wall to their left as they exited. He remembers seeing the 
spatters of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dickey lives in the small town of Payette, Idaho, with his wife and 
their 2-year-old daughter. He teaches high school chemistry. He comes back to 
the San Diego area only to visit his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I go four or five months and I don't think of it at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Aurora Pena-Rivera couldn't talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 About being shot in the jaw. About losing two friends and an aunt and a baby 
cousin. About them lying dead around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple things would trigger awful memories. "I remember I went to a restaurant 
and this man was drunk and he was yelling. He got mad with one of the waiters, 
and I just broke down. I thought about that other man." 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 No more doctors, she told her mother. On her own, she learned to accept the 
loss, the guilt, the unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I used to ask, 'Why did it happen and why us?' I would say, 'Why her? 
Why the baby? She doesn't have any sins.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I see that I'm just being selfish. If it didn't happen to us, it 
would have happened to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora was 11. Her aunt wanted a fish sandwich. The group of six relatives and 
friends was standing at the counter when Huberty walked in; four died. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora lay on the restaurant floor, her eyes closed tight, afraid to look. 
Then, like all kids, she got curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I heard him far away, so I opened my eyes and he saw me. He walked 
to the trash can and he had some (guns) in there. He got his shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when he shot me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Aurora is 21 and has a 9-month-old girl. An administrative assistant for 
the Navy, she has nieces and nephews who ask about the scars on her leg. 
Sometimes, she gets annoyed. She tells them she fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, at a K mart, Aurora saw Adelina Hernandez, mother of 
Joshua Coleman's friend Omar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hugged me and kissed me and asked me how I was doing. I told her I got 
married and she's like, 'You got married already?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And my mom goes, 'Well, she's 21. She's the same age. . . .' She (Mrs. 
Hernandez) goes, 'Oh, yeah, he would have been 21 too.' 
</P>
<P>
 Adelina Hernandez is still surrounded by children -- she works at Sunset 
Elementary, the school Omar attended. The children remind her of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good therapy," she said. "It's my medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The exuberance and vitality of the children who call her "Grandma" help Omar's 
mother each day. They help her forget the sight of her lifeless little boy, and 
of the hard days that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the feelings are not so intense. She rarely gets depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it becomes unbearable, Hernandez, 63, finds comfort in a cassette 
tape she and Omar made when he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternately playing the roles of reporter and interviewee, they ask each other 
simple questions in Spanish: "What is your name?" "Where do you go to school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tears clouding her eyes, Hernandez said: "It's hard for a mom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were death threats. Etna Huberty's young daughters were taunted at 
school, and they moved twice within a year of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at age 52, she lives with her two grown daughters in the working-class 
community of Spring Valley, 20 miles east of San Ysidro. Her home is a brown 
trailer on a quiet street. Broken-down cars and trucks clutter the driveway, 
next to an unkempt front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Etna Huberty filed an unsuccessful $5-million lawsuit against McDonald's, 
alleging that her husband's rampage was triggered in part by too many Chicken 
McNuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 And she tried to sell her story to a Hollywood producer. But the public outcry 
was so strong, the project was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Etna Huberty has graying hair, cropped short. Her face is drawn; her 
expression one of agitated exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 She works as an in-home nurse. She told a reporter in late June she hadn't yet 
paid her rent. She was willing to do an interview for $400, she said. (The 
reporter declined; paying for interviews violates Associated Press policy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Zelia was 14 at the time of the shootings, Cassandra 10. They had 
gone to school with many of their father's victims. After the shootings, they 
changed schools, enrolling under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're surviving," said Etna Huberty's friend, Ann Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the shootings, Etna Huberty apologized for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is wondering why he would do such a thing," she said in a statement. 
"He was always very sad and lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty and his wife moved to San Diego just seven months before, after he 
lost his job as a welder in Massillon, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Huberty worked as a security guard. A week before the shootings, 
he was fired because of "a general instability . . . plus the fact that he was 
not performing his duties in a proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty was a loner, those who knew him say. He could be a troublemaker. He 
became loud and abusive to neighbors during a dispute. He let his two German 
shepherds run loose. He liked guns. He was something of a survivalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers just laughed at him, a former boss said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 17, he called a local mental health clinic asking for an appointment. 
A receptionist took his name, but he never got a call back. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of July 18, Huberty went to court to plead guilty to two 
traffic infractions. He and his wife and a daughter then ate at the McDonald's 
across from the courthouse, miles north of their apartment. Afterward, they 
went to the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 They got home just before 4 p.m. Huberty kissed his wife goodby (she would 
later tell police that was unusual). Then, he told her he was going to hunt 
people -- just one of the crazy things he was always saying, she figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty loaded his guns, got in his car, drove a block and parked. Toting an 
Uzi, a semiautomatic pistol and a shotgun, he strode to the McDonald's; 257 
rounds later, he was dead.

ASIAN GANGS COULD BE THE FUTURE OF U.S. ORGANIZED CRIME, EXPERTS WARN; LAW 
ENFORCEMENT: ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE WAH CHING, UNITED BAMBOO AND WO FAMILIES 
NOW REACH OUT OF THEIR TRADITIONAL BASES, OFFICIALS SAY. THEY HAVE BEGUN TO 
VICTIMIZE THE WORLD WITH DRUGS, GUNS AND FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By RICHARD COLE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More flexible than the Mafia, more savvy than Colombia's drug cartels, Asian 
gangs may be the future of organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has promised to make the gangs a priority, and 
Willard Myers III, director of the Philadelphia-based Center for the Study of 
Asian Organized Crime, says it's none too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asian organized crime is already at the top of the list," he said. "It's like 
a giant spider web spread across the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese Triads, some with as many as 180,000 members worldwide, specialize 
in smuggling aliens and heroin into New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
They smuggle military weapons out of China, Vietnam and the former Soviet 
Union, with the help of the Russian mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 * The tattooed Japanese Yakuza, experts at high-level financial fraud and 
almost a shadow government in their homeland, have penetrated the U.S. real 
estate and banking industries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasingly violent Chinese and Vietnamese street gangs in the United 
States specialize in home invasions, low-level drug dealing and protection 
rackets. They also provide muscle for Triads. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the worst of both worlds," said Geoffrey Anderson, chief of the 
Organized Crime Strike Force in the San Francisco U.S. attorney's office. "They 
have an international organization that gives them access to information and 
commodities throughout Asia -- and then they have local gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizations like the Wah Ching, United Bamboo and Wo families now reach out 
of their traditional base in the Asian community, Anderson said. They have 
begun to victimize the world at large with drugs, guns and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver, Canada, may be the future for many North American cities, warns 
Thomas Ritchie, the top organized crime investigator in British Columbia. The 
city's organized crime is already dominated by Chinese syndicates, including 
the Big Circle Boys, founded by former Maoist Red Guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Circle Boys travel freely between the United States and Canada, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Asian organized crime is going to be the single biggest 
concern for law enforcement in the future," Ritchie said. "It's definitely on 
the increase, and Asian criminals have no boundaries." 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian gangs have the flexibility to avoid pitfalls that brought down other 
organized crime empires, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 La Cosa Nostra was penetrated and crippled by law enforcement, in part because 
of the families' rigid structure and regionalization. Colombian drug cartels 
made themselves easier targets because of their centralization and focus on a 
single commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Triad members dabble in many crimes, and think nothing of flitting from 
Thailand to Vancouver and on to Ohio or New York on a single caper. 
</P>
<P>
 Their organization is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there has been testimony that drug dealers in this country turned to 
a godfather in Macao for approval of a heroin deal, Myers said the Triads often 
act more as a loose network of independent contractors who team up for specific 
crimes -- in effect, a criminal version of the Elks Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Yakuza, although less common in the United States, have a growing 
presence in property and banking, said U.S. Atty. Michael Yamaguchi in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Yakuza had a substantial investment in golf courses throughout the United 
States, and the strike force in Las Vegas seized a couple of them," he said. 
"They were also reaching into the banking system, laundering money." 
</P>
<P>
 However organized, the gangs can reap astounding profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Triad-linked groups handle an estimated $200 billion in international heroin 
trafficking, said Myers. They make $3 billion smuggling Chinese aliens to the 
United States, and millions more smuggling aliens and prostitutes into Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese syndicates control gambling in parts of Asia, the Dominican Republic, 
and in many U.S. cities with large Chinese populations. 
</P>
<P>
 Untold millions come from trading heroin to the Russian mafia in exchange for 
abandoned Soviet military weapons, and from selling outdated People's 
Liberation Army weapons to Japan's Yakuza -- and U.S. thugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're dealing off huge stocks of weapons (that) find their way right here 
to the United States," said Myers. "Ask a policeman who takes a Chinese 
automatic rifle away from a street gang member." 
</P>
<P>
 The weapons trafficking particularly worries the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms, said Gary Thomas, head of the International Enforcement 
Branch in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The bureau has increasingly up-to-date information exchanges with Europe and 
Latin America, he said. But they are only beginning to impress their Asian 
counterparts with the necessity for quick, timely reports on weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unique about a gun is that, unlike cocaine or other kinds of 
contraband, it's traceable; it has a history," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland-based ATF agent James Newberry said that despite the organization and 
power of the Triads, law enforcement has made some inroads. 
</P>
<P>
 To overcome the closed gang culture, investigators discovered young criminals 
could often be shamed into cooperating by bringing in a father or other 
relative to urge them to act with honor. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more Asian officers have joined police forces and can work freely in 
communities once suspicious of outsiders, said Newberry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Yamaguchi said more is needed, especially as the United States looks more 
and more to the Pacific Rim as a trading partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Triad suspects have fled into China, which has no mutual assistance 
treaty with the United States, he said. In many countries, such as Thailand, 
high-level corruption makes cooperation spotty at best. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least early action is possible because the threat is recognized, 
Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we finally dealt with La Cosa Nostra in the 1960s under Bobby Kennedy, 
the Mafia had become entrenched in our institutions," the prosecutor said. "But 
with Asian organized crime, we have an opportunity to beat this early."

CONROY'S PADDLING PROPOSAL DESERVES A COUPLE WHACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There's something very wrong with this picture. The (Assemblyman) Mickey 
Conroy (R-Orange) team says that had Assembly Bill 15OX, the paddling bill, not 
passed the Assembly Public Safety Committee for fear the paddling punishment 
could cause permanent physical damage, Conroy's chief of staff, Pete Conaty, 
would offer to paddle his 15-year-old son, Patrick, as a demonstration 
(Politics '94 column, July 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Presumably, 15-year-old Patrick is absolutely not guilty of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 What a bizarre solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Why doesn't Mr. Conaty offer up his own behind, or better yet, why doesn't 
Mickey Conroy offer up his posterior for up to 10 whacks with a paddle 
three-fourths inch thick, 18 inches long, six inches wide, with a six-inch 
handle and made of hard wood? 
</P>
<P>
 After all, AB 15OX is Mr. Conroy's baby, he is so sure that no physical damage 
will be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldn't he experience exactly what he is advocating? 
</P>
<P>
 It does seem to me that Pete Conaty is being rather cavalier with his son's 
posterior. Or is it all just a PR scam? 
</P>
<P>
 F.J. KAPSCH 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblyman Mickey Conroy's effort to fight crime with his bill to paddle 
graffiti vandals should be a bit more fair. 
</P>
<P>
 We can paddle graffiti vandals like they do in Singapore. Then we can also 
castrate rapists. We can also out off the hands of all white-collar criminals 
who steal from investors. That same punishment could be meted out to 
politicians who steal public funds to promote their own lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 My proposal is a bit drastic perhaps, but no more ridiculous than Conroy's 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The punishment suggested above has also been carried out by less enlightened 
countries. In our own country we hanged thieves. Would Mr. Conroy like to adopt 
that policy as well? 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of white-collar crime far exceeds the cost of graffiti vandals' 
crimes, so let us mete out justice on a more equal basis.

ROLLER RINK IDEA IS IN LINE WITH SAFETY; INNOVATIVE IRVINE ALLOCATES FUNDS FOR 
YOUTH FACILITY TO PUT BRAKES ON STREET SKATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's infatuation with hockey, a game imported from colder 
climates, has found an outlet in this land of malls and parking lots. In-line 
skates have made it possible for skaters to bypass the need for plummeting 
temperatures and frozen ponds, and even artificial rinks.  
</P>
<P>
 However, there increasingly are concerns being expressed nationally about the 
safety of in-line skating. One young woman we noticed flying down an Irvine 
street on a recent weekend had the presence of mind to wear elbow pads and knee 
pads, but alas, no helmet. The speeds that skaters can reach and the passions 
of the games that may make players unaware of traffic hazards increase the risk 
of accidents on busy streets or even in parking lots. These thrill seekers can 
become unguided, unprotected human missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Irvine, ever an innovator in the search for order, has decided 
wisely to address the problem directly as part of its laudable overall effort 
to provide better facilities and activities for its young people. The City 
Council recently approved a $29,000 allocation to either create a permanent 
roller hockey court at a local park or buy a portable court. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's celebrated predictability as a planned community has prompted its 
share of humorous observations about what it is like to live in a place where 
even the ducks adhere to the rules and regulations. But as the city has evolved 
as a residential place, companion concerns have grown up about providing 
interesting things for young people to do in a place of such regimentation. 
Recognizing that it needs to provide more and better youth activities, the 
city's Safe Community Task Force, a group of city and school officials, has 
been proposing after-school programs and activities, as well as looking into 
ways of reducing teen violence. 
</P>
<P>
 A roller rink under the aegis of that effort should address both needs, the 
desirability of having safe facilities for a game that has appealed to many 
young people, and the search for better youth activities. But having such a 
rink will require a plan of its own, so that everyone who wants to take part 
can. In the meantime, parents can do their share by insisting that youngsters 
wear proper safety equipment along with their in-line skates and avoid 
confusing the street with the playground or an empty parking lot.

IT'S A TAKE -- BUT WHERE'S THE GIVE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Any talk about "not letting Orange County turn into another L.A." goes out 
the window fast when star-struck supervisors think about production companies 
filming here ("County Acts to Lure Movie, TV Crews," June 29). 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a few hotels and restaurants will make money on it; but for the great 
majority of people who'll feel any effect at all, it will be the negative 
effect of being inconvenienced and delayed while film crews are given the right 
to shut down public streets, parks and buildings.In case the O.C. supervisors 
haven't been through this, others of us have, and it's a pain. 
</P>
<P>
 This idea of selling private, for-profit organizations rights superseding the 
public good amazes me. And I wonder if it would extend, to pick an example, to 
an association of T-shirt sellers. Might they expect the same sympathetic 
reception from the board to a request to shut down Irvine Spectrum for a day or 
two to pursue sales? 
</P>
<P>
 As for the actress' contribution to the discussion -- "a lot of actors (who) 
live . . . in places like Newport Beach . . . might find it easier to get to 
work" -- those few of us who are not hoteliers, restaurateurs or actors will 
try to take our comfort from that thought while stalled in traffic or unable to 
park to conduct some business because of a film shoot.

KEEPING SPACE EXPLORATION SPIRIT ALIVE; LOCAL AEROSPACE FIRMS MUST NOT LOSE 
SIGHT OF POSSIBILITIES MOON LANDING REPRESENTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Orange County grew after World War II, its changing economy provided jobs 
and fueled a sense of optimism about the future. Perhaps nothing symbolizes 
more significantly the heady optimism of the post-war time than the role played 
by local firms in the moon landing. Its 25th anniversary will be celebrated 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, three corporate divisions took part in the effort. The 
second-stage rocket was built by North American Rockwell, which later became 
Rockwell, in Seal Beach. The third-stage rocket was built by McDonnell Douglas 
in Huntington Beach. And the lunar exploration module engines were tested at 
TRW's San Juan Capistrano facility. Engineers and other workers, inspired by a 
sense of national purpose, willingly put in extra hours on overtime and on 
weekends without complaint. It was a time when it seemed that all things were 
possible. As the county tries to climb out of recession and cope with reduced 
expectations all around, perhaps it is appropriate to use the occasion of the 
anniversary to ask: How do we rekindle the spirit in fresh ways and channel it 
in new directions? 
</P>
<P>
 In the decades since, there has continued to be considerable growth, but the 
aerospace industry that fueled the space exploration effort has fallen on hard 
times. And today, the struggle to keep the space shuttle mission alive is as 
much a symbol for the present uncertainty as the moon project was for the 
earlier sense of limitless horizons. As the county plunged into recession, 
McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co. has seen its role in the space program 
dangling by a thread. The number of employees working on the project has been 
cut in half, and the survival has been on a year-to-year basis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the space station got a life in a recent important congressional vote, its 
chief advocate, Rep. George E. Brown Jr. (D-Colton), noted that the station 
"represents the expansion of the human spirit and the continuation of the human 
drive to explore Earth and the universe around it." That's a tall order for the 
controversial space station to meet, and its future remains uncertain. Brown 
nevertheless put his finger on some exciting quality that inspires all sorts of 
new technologies down on the ground, whether they be in space-related projects 
or other fields like biotechnology. Orange County, with its role in the 
changing space program, and with its place as an international center of 
business, ought not to lose sight of that historic vision as a driving force in 
its future.

DOES THE COUNTY REALLY NEED ANOTHER AIRPORT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We Californians never learn. Repeatedly, the courts have struck down 
initiatives that attempt to plan our lives or take away constitutional rights, 
but again the politicians in this county and in our cities haven't got the 
courage to show the necessary leadership that is required to occupy the offices 
they hold. It's a crime to waste taxpayers' money. Sounds harsh, but it is 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law requires that the impacted community make the decision concerning 
what base reuses they would like to see. It is rather peculiar that "certain 
rich people in this county want to manipulate other poor people for their own 
selfish interests." But isn't that politics as usual? 
</P>
<P>
 We citizens who are unabashedly opposed to an airport at El Toro need 
politicians who can lead us into more productive, real, thoughtful jobs. To the 
beleaguered taxpayer, two active airports next to each other make no financial 
sense -- especially when the second airport is a Band-Aid approach. We need a 
world-class solution. Are there any politicians in Orange County with the 
leadership and vision to achieve this result? 
</P>
<P>
 THOMAS M. WHALING 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * Robert Stein in his letter "Protests Don't Fly" (July 10) is absolutely 
correct in that the Orange County airport was built with taxpayers' money, but 
he neglects to mention that perhaps 90% of all such facilities in the U.S. (and 
some foreign lands as well) have been so constructed, and this of course 
includes El Toro. As far as the danger connected in flying from El Toro, 
apparently he has never done so or he would know differently, as the statistics 
will testify. 
</P>
<P>
 It is recognized that as a resident of the "Southern County" area he has a 
perfect right to try to improve his environment, but at the same time he must 
also realize that the rest of us likewise have that right, and, yes, the 
necessity. We in the Newport Beach area already have more than our share of 
irritation, and if we must have more of the same in the county, certainly 
others should share. If El Toro were to be developed into more housing, would 
we be happier with the thousands more additions to an already overburdened 
highway system? 
</P>
<P>
 ALAN L. BLUM 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Island 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan J. Nestlinger ("Assessing the County's Air Traffic Needs," Letters, 
July 3) needs to be corrected with regard to his comment " . . . the flight 
paths into and out of El Toro are are already cleared of residential housing." 
</P>
<P>
 On our visits to friends in Laguna Hills, it was quite obvious that the flight 
paths are not clear of residential housing. The level of noise inflicted on 
them as the jets approach for landing is very disturbing. All conversation 
stops, the television or radio cannot be heard and the house shakes. 
</P>
<P>
 From my own experience living in Orangetree (the closest residential community 
to the base in Irvine), the larger, less powerful aircraft often take off (into 
the prevailing wind) over our community. The associated deafening noise and 
window rattling is quite distressing for us too. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the North County cities will harp on about how much quieter 
commercial aircraft are. Whether the noise level is 80dBa or 100dBa is 
irrelevant. It is loud and should not be permitted over residential 
communities.

BANNER-TOTING PLANES RUIN THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * If Doug Stavoe ("High Flying Messenger," July 4) could lie on the beach on a 
beautiful sunny day instead of flying above it in his infernally noisy 
airplane, he would get a better idea of what many of us believe is a strident 
intrusion and a visual pollution of our blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying for a respite from the noise and congestion of the streets behind us, 
we walk the shore enjoying the lapping waves, the sea birds, the peace and 
tranquillity of ocean, sand and sky, when suddenly, a noisy plane buzzes across 
our view, toting a huge banner."Buy this, buy that!" it screeches, as it drones 
back and forth, back and forth. Who cares which product it sells? I'm so 
annoyed, I'll never buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial advertising along our beautiful coast should be banned. We hate it. 
Make a buck another way, Mr. Stavoe.

 * I work six days a week, and I also happen to live near Disneyland. Before 
switching to the day shift, I worked the graveyard shift, which meant sleeping 
during the day. The article about the high flying advertising planes (July 4) 
struck a cord. These planes fly overhead in what sounds like worn-out lawn 
mowers, "putt-putting" overhead all weekend long. I never in my wildest dream 
thought I would look forward to returning to another work week each Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since you wrote business seems to be so good for these entrepreneurs, I pray 
they will be able to afford to buy an airplane with a quieter engine or find 
their way to Magic Mountain soon!

CLAS TESTING IS INFORMATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a freshman honors student at Woodbridge High School in Irvine, I have 
grown concerned with the rising controversy concerning the CLAS testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who think that these tests don't test a teen's knowledge are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 I personally took the CLAS test in the eighth grade, and I didn't have any 
problems with the questioning. In my opinion, these tests are much more 
interesting than the CTBS or the old CAP testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the state keep the test the way it is. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * It's sad to hear, but understandable, that some parents have chosen to 
combat the state CLAS tests. 
</P>
<P>
 After many in this generation have turned their children over to television 
and their peers, these parents are afraid that the public will find out how 
little parenting is going on in the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools don't have to give tests to discover this. The way many children 
dress and conduct themselves demonstrates parental guidance and control. The 
very first step a child takes into kindergarten is a mirror of family values 
and practices. One need go no further.

FULLERTON'S RECALLED CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS IGNORE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * On June 7, the voters of Fullerton voted to have Buck Catlin, Molly 
McClanahan and Don Bankhead removed from their City Council positions and 
stripped of their power in our city. More than 13,000 voters said that if the 
recall was successful they wanted those individuals replaced by special 
election. That was and is the will of the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city clerk, Anne M. York, spared in the recall, has decided to take an 
action that will eliminate the replacement elections for McClanahan and Catlin, 
and allow those two recalled council members to serve out their terms of 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 York purposely delayed the "certification" of the vote count until after July 
2 in order to force a consolidated election that will cancel the replacement 
elections for McClanahan and Catlin. This action goes against the will of the 
people as expressed by the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason she gives for her intentional delay is to "save money." The 
registrar of voters has stated that a special replacement election will cost 
approximately $27,000 more than combining the replacement election with the 
November election. It seems that the city is only prudent in its spending when 
the "savings" will thwart the majority will of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 York narrowly survived the recall because people believed "she was just doing 
her job." Look closely and you might ask, "For whose benefit?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Onthe 5th of July, one day after the celebration of the signing of the 
Declaration of Independence from an oppressive and taxing government, the three 
recalled Fullerton City Council members voted to stay in power, maybe forever. 
The signers of the Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their 
fortunes and their sacred honor in the belief that "Governments are instituted 
among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed." 
</P>
<P>
 Delay the June recall election certification, use the maximum time before the 
special election is required by law, and bingo, the recalled City Council 
members run the city until the November general election. They no longer have 
"the consent of the governed." Honor requires the recalled City Council members 
to follow the vote of the governed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a general election when there are many issues to distract the voter, 
incumbents have an advantage. If they stay in power until November and the 
recall vote is split among the many candidates, they can win. When asked, the 
recalled City Council members refused to say if they would run again in 
November. Are they honorable? 
</P>
<P>
 There would be no reason to spend one red cent of taxpayers' money on a 
special election if they would pledge not to run or resign. Do these recalled 
City Council members have any honor left to pledge to the voters in November?

CONGRESS PLAYING HEALTH CARE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In support of a commentary ("Congress and the People Should See the Final 
Bill Before a Vote," July 3) by Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach): A 
"meltdown of the legislative process" was pointed out by Rep. Cox, indicating 
that Congress is once again playing tactical games and using special interest 
groups to draft legislation such as health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 What ever happened to the team-player concept to strive toward a common goal 
of such importance to us all? Being employed in a pharmaceutical company 
myself, I've seen how today's economic conditions make it unwise for employees 
to perform their jobs pursuing their own agenda.To survive in today's business 
means to focus the appropriate resources, minimize redundancy, stress 
efficiency and encourage innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 We must work together effectively to be successful in meeting the demands of 
the marketplace or fail to complete our objectives. Perhaps members of Congress 
are not aware that health care opportunities for all should be treated with the 
same amount of conviction. Instead, they jockey and position themselves just as 
the prosecuting and defense attorneys trying the Simpson case, most interested 
in public opinion rather than what they can do for their fellow citizens.

IDENTIFYING WAYS TO PREVENT REPEAT OF MELEE IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I live a short distance from the downtown Huntington Beach area. July 4, 
about 10 p.m., I was returning from a friend's home when heavy traffic forced 
me off PCH and onto 9th Street. As I drove down Walnut Avenue toward Main 
Street, the crowds were restless and intimidating. Police presence was 
apparent, and in some ways even more intimidating. The problems that developed 
were easily anticipated, as were citizen complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems apparent that any crowd becomes bolder and more aggressive when 
protected by the anonymity of large numbers and darkness. We are powerless to 
affect that situation, so a strong police presence is necessary to protect the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers, because of fear or cruelty, overreact and strike out 
indiscriminately. Because each officer is individually anonymous, the citizenry 
is terribly exposed to violence perpetrated by certain officers. If only two 
people wearing dark uniforms, helmets and face masks lose control and hurt 
innocent people, the entire force is stigmatized and the entire community is 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year all officers should be required to have either their last name or a 
large number stenciled on their protective vests, both front and back, in a 
high-visibility color. Each officer, knowing that he can be readily identified, 
will be sure that his actions could bring personal accountability. We cannot 
control crowd anonymity, but anonymous police are not necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, extensive use of video cameras should be considered. A few cameras 
mounted high along Main Street, a few carried by concerned citizens, and police 
encouragement for news media video coverage make sense. The tapes could be used 
later to identify lawbreakers, assess police tactics and generally reduce the 
anonymity provided by crowds, darkness and uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The only solution to the kind of insanity that visits our community every 
Fourth of July is a strategy to ensure individual accountability. Blaming a 
crowd of rioters or a group of police officers guarantees that guilty 
individuals behave with impunity while the rest of us pay. 
</P>

 It was bad enough that Huntington Beach made it on TV and in the news because 
of the night of the Fourth of July with the fires and out-of-control groups 
being hauled away to jail. But to hear that the clowns that were in the 
Huntington Beach Fourth of July parade were attacked with water pistols and 
some string stuff that ruined their makeup and costumes so badly that later in 
the day some of them could not be part of the Anaheim Hills parade, that is 
really the pits of life! 
</P>
<P>
 It's going to be a long time before I tell anyone I live in Huntington Beach!

WILL LIBRARIES SURVIVE THE DIGITAL AGE?; SOME READERS ARE MAKING BOOK ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am bothered by John Strahl's letter (July 10), espousing, in effect, 
"virtual reality" over books -- and of your paper's giving such position to it. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder if he thinks a travelogue is preferable to walking the streets of 
Paris? 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago I learned that, when visiting a home, the owner's library (if there 
is one), gives an accurate picture as to his or her inner person. But what will 
one see when a visit is made to Mr. Strahl's home -- a video screen? 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt if Abraham Lincoln would walk a mile to borrow a computer disk, let 
alone bother to return it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will ever take the place of a good book, whether for reference or 
pleasure. There is a tactile quality, the ability to read and reread, one may 
put it down until another time, and there is simply the pleasure of owning, or 
using, these finest objects of man's enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 I work with a computer hours daily. I appreciate it as a tool, but I will 
never see it replacing books, wonderful books, and I hope that civilization 
will never replace libraries of books with computers and digitized memories.

<P>
 * The letter (July 10) by John Strahl that all books in the future will be 
digitized (CD-ROM) eliminating the need for libraries is thought provoking and 
well written. Is it a half answer? 
</P>
<P>
 My publishing background began in 1956 when we self-published our first 
sailing book. It was a need to help others, with a comfortable profit for 
thousands of hours invested. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Booksellers national trade show was held in L.A. in May with 
publishers worldwide displaying in 4,800 booths. For the first time I realized 
almost all books are designed like islands unto themselves, as our marine 
educational books are in sail and power boating, to fulfill a need with their 
own unique messages. It was amazing, the number of authors from Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 More creative minds involving ALL professions are found in a tiny band from 
Laguna, north to Santa Barbara, seldom more than 15 to 20 miles from the ocean, 
than anywhere else in the United States. They can find their answers from many 
sources in our creative Orange County environment, with our excellent library 
system, a major source of answers. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROMS and other electronic forms of media will keep growing until as Mr. 
Strahl says . . . "where everything is digital" . . . with . . . "supposedly 
sophisticated structures (libraries) designed for a soon-to-be-obsolete 
purpose: book storage." 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM ability is to gather as much information as possible on a specific 
topic in minimum time . . . but is that your goal, to spend the rest of your 
life staring at and playing with computer screens? Our Orange County libraries 
will remain live and vigorous into the foreseeable future to provide the best 
mix of both worlds. Regular readers and researchers will continue to enjoy 
reading well-illustrated hard-copy books for pleasure -- and for research. 
</P>
<P>
 At 72, I'm darn glad I wasn't born into the one-method push-button generation 
seeking instant answers. Mr. Strahl well defines the colorless digitized 
corporate world he may be seeking after graduation.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON HEALTH CARE; THE CORPORATE PHYSICIAN HAS 
MUCH MORE TO OFFER THE PATIENT; THE MARCUS WELBY PROFESSIONAL IS A MYTH. HMOS, 
OTHER GROUPS ALLOW DOCTORS MORE TIME, RESOURCES FOR CLIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN R. ZWERNER, Alan R. Zwerner, MD., JD., is director of medical/legal 
affairs for the Unified Medical Group Assn. and CEO of the Unified Medical 
Quality Commission in Seal Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most significant changes taking place in the practice of medicine 
is the rise of the corporate physician -- a change some people greet with 
skepticism. What, no Marcus Welby? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is a huge gap between the myth of Marcus Welby and the 
reality of America's health care system today. This development of the 
corporate physician is, however, not something to fear, but rather something to 
cheer. It is the best answer to our national health care crisis -- if you value 
good health care, careful attention to outcomes and reasonable costs. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, patients are receiving their care from physicians and other 
health care professionals who are employees of -- and often partners in -- 
medical groups or health maintenance organizations (HMOs). Americans are seeing 
corporate physicians in group settings instead of visiting solo practitioners 
in private offices. Health care is increasingly paid through prepaid capitation 
(fixed fee per patient per month) instead of the traditional fee-for-service. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us involved in prepaid group practice see every day how this trend 
can significantly improve the quality of health care while decreasing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 We see, through the success of many of Unified Medical Group Assn.'s members, 
that this is good for both doctors and patients. We are convinced that prepaid 
group practice represents the future of health care in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Group practice permits the sharing of important data related to medical 
outcomes, quality of care, utilization of resources, clinical information and 
medical/legal risk. With this shared data, medical groups can develop 
comprehensive programs to assure, manage and improve quality. They can examine 
their systems and practices, and conduct peer review and patient satisfaction 
studies -- all with the goal of improving every aspect of health care delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 As electronic clinical information systems and automated patient medical 
records become more readily available, groups will be able to analyze 
sophisticated outcomes data and identify "best practices" guidelines for 
improving quality and reducing costs. Such activities are virtually impossible 
in an individual practice setting. 
</P>
<P>
 In group practice, multiple health care professionals -- primary-care 
physicians, specialists and ancillary providers -- can work together, drawing 
on a bank of information, to assure a continuum of care. The group setting also 
lends itself to effective ambulatory case management in which case managers 
help "shepherd" frail and catastrophically ill patients through a complex 
medical system. All of these factors lead to better outcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fee-for-service world, clinicians, hospitals, drug companies and 
ancillary providers get paid only when they do something. Traditionally, 
fee-for-service care tends to be reactive rather than proactive. Doctors wait 
for "sick people" to seek care, hospitals wait for doctors to admit "sick 
people," drug companies wait for doctors to prescribe medication to "sick 
people" . . . and the beat goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, fee-for-service care has not focused on wellness, disease 
prevention, patient education or early diagnosis and treatment. In fact, 
traditional indemnity insurance often did not cover such programs. The focus 
was on episodic ambulatory care and acute hospital care of "sick people." 
</P>
<P>
 Prepaid health care takes the opposite approach. It takes care of people while 
they are still well and tries to keep them that way. 
</P>
<P>
 People don't want to be patients. They want to be well and stay well. If they 
are not well, they want to get well quickly and without an economic burden. In 
a health care system of capitation, physicians, medical groups, hospitals and 
HMOs, all of whom are "at risk" financially, have identical goals. All are 
rewarded financially for promoting wellness and preventing illness. To help 
meet these goals, physicians are encouraged to focus on case management and 
continuity of care and to provide high-quality ambulatory care that helps 
prevent acute inpatient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepaid group practice aligns the goals of the provider, the insurer and the 
patient. The corporate physician, working within the prepaid group practice, is 
thus freed from the management burdens placed upon the private practitioner. He 
or she has the opportunity to focus on what a physician does best -- the 
practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers should be pleased with the advent of the medical group-affiliated 
"corporate physician." These physicians learn to focus on prevention first, and 
then on early intervention and expeditious treatment. They learn to become 
partners with their patients with the common goal of good patient health. 
</P>
<P>
 All these factors favor improved quality and cost-effectiveness. It is a 
proven system that is already working for millions of Americans. Let us not 
lament the passing of Marcus Welby.  
</P>
<P>
 The corporate physician will do a better job.

A HEAD-HUNTER?; EXPOS' MARTINEZ STRUGGLES WITH THE REPUTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE MARANTZ, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The care and feeding of a young pitcher is one of baseball's most uncertain 
endeavors. A tender sprout depends on firm support, shelter and proper 
nutrients. Well-nurtured, a young pitcher may become a hearty perennial. But so 
much can go wrong. Baseball is not a garden; it's a jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montreal Expos' Pedro J. Martinez, 22, is one of baseball's most promising 
young pitchers. In the past season-and-a-half, he has accomplished what many 
thought impossible: distinguish himself from 41 other Martinezes playing pro 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's 92-m.p.h. fastball has something to do with that. This season, 
Pedro ranks among National League leaders in ERA, strikeouts and opponents' 
batting average. The Expos are one of the most capable clubs in cultivating 
young pitchers, and in management's eyes, Pedro is an exotic and delicate 
hothouse flower. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rose has a thorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez also leads the National League in two negative categories -- hit 
batsmen (10) and brawls incited (three). Opponents have tried to prune him down 
to size. They have charged at him on the mound, aimed retaliatory pitches at 
his teammates and questioned his character, privately and publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 The pounding, both physical and psychological, has taken a toll on Martinez, 
whose frail 160-pound body, large dark eyes and polite manner suggest an 
earnest schoolboy. Although raised in the Dominican Republic, Pedro is fluent 
and comfortable with English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Has this season been hard on you?" I ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a personal thing," Martinez says. "I don't really like to have 
enemies on the other teams. I'm a friendly man. I don't like to hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 A surge of emotion wells up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not from here," he says. "I'm looking for a living, trying to support 
myself and my family the best I can. I'm not trying to hurt anybody. I wouldn't 
like anybody to hurt me, so why should I want to hurt someone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez tells a story about himself, as a first-year pro in 1989, at the 
Dodger Academy in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day a coach saw me running in the stadium. He say, 'How far you been 
running?' I say '27 laps.' He say, 'Next time I find you running I fine you 
$500.' I was only 137 pounds. He was telling me not to run because they wanted 
me to gain weight. At the time I was making $700 a month. Five hundred dollars 
was a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 "So what did you do?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I say 'OK.' But I know I have to keep running to keep in shape for pitching. 
They let me run sprints and five laps. I wasn't comfortable with that. So I pay 
the security guard at night to let me run. He would be watching for me, and I 
would be running." 
</P>
<P>
 "The guard saved you 500 bucks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I pay him; I give him 20s and 50s. But I got my running in." 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the story? Some National League hitters might suggest Martinez 
has no regard for rules. But others who know Pedro interpret it another way: 
Pedro is no fighter. He's a runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing inside is considered a fine and necessary attribute for a pitcher. 
Throwing deep inside, so that a batter might be hit in the arm, hip or lower 
back if he doesn't move -- a brushback -- is considered nasty but acceptable. 
Throwing a brushback at a batter's head -- a beanball -- is considered immoral 
and marginally criminal. A routine brushback will make a batter nervous and 
discourage him from crowding the plate. A beanball can shatter a batter's face 
or skull, as well as his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between the pitches is roughly that, somewhere between verbal 
harassment and assault and battery with a deadly weapon. But a problem arises 
in determining intent. Nobody is sure -- except the person throwing the ball -- 
whether the pitch is meant to be a brushback or a beanball. The umpires and 
league presidents think they know, but they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Batters usually point to the outcome and the situation: A pitch at the head 
probably was meant to be a beanball, and a pitch at the head immediately after 
a home run definitely was meant to be a beanball. 
</P>
<P>
 However, pitchers never admit to throwing beanballs and rarely to brushbacks. 
They explain such pitches as accidental and inevitable lapses of control. 
Martinez characterizes his hit batsmen as accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no rule in baseball that says you are not allowed to pitch on the 
inside corner or close to batters," he says. "You don't hit someone on purpose, 
which I'm not trying to do. Why doesn't the media say anything when I hit 
someone with a breaking ball? Half of my 10 hit batters were on breaking balls. 
But when I hit someone with a fastball they have to think it's intentional." 
</P>
<P>
 When he is on, Martinez prefers to challenge hitters inside rather than nibble 
at the outside corner, which accounts for his relatively low walk total. "I'd 
rather let them hit the ball," he says. "I never try to hit anyone, but if I'm 
on the outside of the plate I can be hit, even with my fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a power pitcher. I'm supposed to go in and get people out. If I keep 
throwing over the middle and away, they hit it. I'm not a sinker pitcher like 
Greg Maddux. I don't have the experience. Everybody thinks of me like a Cy 
Young. I'm not Cy Young. I'm just in my second year in the league, and I'm 
learning. If I was a veteran that always knocked people down, that is a 
different thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his protestations, Martinez finds himself caught up in a timeless 
debate. Is he intentionally throwing at batters? Or is he accidentally wild? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dodgers pitching coach Ron Perranoski, under whom Pedro played 
last season, points to Martinez's 30 walks in 104 1/3 innings, a mark of 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could he have few walks and lead the league in hit batters?" Perranoski 
asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good question," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a good question," says Perranoski, eyebrows raised. 
</P>
<P>
 After a June 14 brawl, Pittsburgh Pirates Manager Jim Leyland complained about 
Martinez. Pirates pitcher Blas Minor had hit Larry Walker, after Pedro had hit 
Carlos Garcia in the hip. Six players, including Pedro, were ejected. "He's 
already hit eight or nine people," Leyland says. "I'm tired of people making 
excuses for him. It's a damn shame. Somebody is going to get hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The perception in some National League dugouts is that Martinez throws at 
people. It is rooted in an April 13 incident, when Cincinnati Reds outfielder 
Reggie Sanders charged Pedro after being hit in the eighth inning of what had 
been a perfect game up to that point. While some concluded that Sanders simply 
had not understood the situation, others saw in Martinez a pitcher willing to 
sacrifice a perfect game in order to dominate the inside of the plate. San 
Diego Padres outfielder Derek Bell called him a "headhunter" after he touched 
off a brawl April 30 by charging the mound to get to Pedro. "I don't know if 
he's intentionally throwing at someone's head or not," Padres batting coach 
Merv Rettenmund says, "but he's coming up there too often. He's not supposed to 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 It has gotten so that Pedro's reputation precedes him into each National 
League city, Expos catcher Darrin Fletcher says. "Probably the first thing they 
think of is -- this guy hits batters," Fletcher says. 
</P>
<P>
 Expos outfielder Lou Frazier says Martinez's name comes up in conversations 
with his friends on other teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing they say is 'If Pedro throws inside, I'm going to get him,' " 
Frazier says. "I don't know if they're joking, but that's their first 
reaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you say to them?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them he's not throwing at anyone," Frazier says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro's travails are a source of acute anxiety to his parents, three brothers 
and two sisters. His mother, Leopoldina, who lives in Los Angeles with his 
older brother, Ramon, frets until his games are over and she has heard that 
Pedro has not been in another brawl. Ramon, 26, a starter for the Dodgers, 
talks with Pedro frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell him to be careful," Ramon says. "I don't want to see anything happen 
to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro's manager, coaches and teammates ferociously defend him. They say he has 
been victimized by overwrought and obsessive news accounts of his incidents -- 
one Montreal headline referred to Pedro as "Senor Plunk" -- and that in any 
event, he is not throwing at batters. They characterize him as "effectively 
wild" and explain his hit batsmen figure and occasional high brushback as a 
result of mechanical problems with his delivery. They say some problems are 
expected in converting from a relief role with the Dodgers last season to a 
starting role. 
</P>
<P>
 Expos Manager Felipe Alou describes the coverage of Pedro as "a delirium for 
the negative." Last winter, Alou was not enthusiastic about the deal that 
brought Martinez to the Expos for second baseman Delino DeShields, but Alou has 
become a passionate advocate of his fellow Dominican. He would like to refocus 
the perception of Pedro; however, his task might be difficult as long as the 
Expos' press notes refer to Pedro as "Ejecto-King." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pedro is 22 years old, and he is holding his own as a man," Alou says. "There 
were many questions about him. Could he throw strikes? Could he make the 
adjustment to start? So now all the positive this man has done is thrown in the 
. . . . Nobody asks me about his change-up or his fastball, just this . . . 
about hitting people. This kid could strike out 250 batters, but nobody knows 
that. He's on his way to 200 innings." 
</P>
<P>
 Expos outfielder Moises Alou wishes Pedro's detractors could know him 
personally. "He is a great guy, the kindest person," Moises says. "He is the 
last guy you would think would throw at somebody. He's just a very good human 
being. I don't see why people think he is throwing at people. He is not." 
</P>
<P>
 The daily instruction of Pedro falls to pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, a former 
big leaguer with an analytical approach. Kerrigan explains Pedro's hit-batters 
figure in the dry language of mechanics. "He rushes his body, drops his arm, 
flattens his wrist and gets a wide sink, where the ball moves on a flat plane 
from left to right instead of boring down," Kerrigan says. "He tries to 
overthrow pitches. It's almost a relief mentality where instead of pitching he 
goes back to throwing. Pedro has to learn that good delivery goes along with 
good location." 
</P>
<P>
 "How is he going to shake the reputation?" he is asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk about it," Kerrigan says. "We're just concerned with mechanics, 
the consistency of his curveball and keeping his arm up on top. To us, inside 
the clubhouse and industry, he is not that type of pitcher. He knows himself." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Kerrigan's idea to have Pedro practice pitching inside to a 
foam-stuffed dummy following the April 30 brawl. Pedro complied, pumping pitch 
after pitch past the unblinking dummy, clad in an Expos uniform. Pedro never 
hit the dummy, but he was of a mind to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt really embarrassed to be working with the doll in front of everyone, 
like I'm not normal," Pedro says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did it help?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely," he says. "I'm pitching better inside. I'm not throwing over 
people's heads now. But nobody realizes that yet."

PRO FOOTBALL; MEMO TO NFL: BRING BACK REPLAY RULINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GLAUBER, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Football League probably thinks it has seen the last of the 
arguments supporting the reinstituting of instant replay, considering the lack 
of controversy in the two years since the system was abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 But if any NFL executive who voted against replay was watching Game 6 of the 
Stanley Cup finals between the New York Rangers and Vancouver Canucks -- or 
even the subsequent drama of Game 7 -- he should have been thinking long and 
hard about giving the idea another chance. In a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Just imagine a National Hockey League without instant replay for a moment, and 
you'll realize there might never have been the spectacle of that 
winner-take-all match in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Without replay, Vancouver winger Geoff Courtnall's goal with 1:32 remaining in 
the third period of Game 6 would not have counted, and Mark Messier's 
subsequent goal with less than a minute to go would have been allowed and 
brought the Rangers to a one-goal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, replay correctly established that Courtnall's shot had gone into the 
net, and Messier's goal was taken off the board. The result: a 4-1 Vancouver 
lead and the assurance of a Game 7. The result without replay: Messier's goal 
stands, the Rangers get a chance to tie it in the final minute to send the game 
into overtime and perhaps win a Stanley Cup tainted by a blown call. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers wound up winning the Cup, but they won it fair and square, not 
with the help of a bad officiating call. 
</P>
<P>
 So we ask you this: Can you think of a better argument to bring replay back to 
the NFL, which now has no mechanism for correcting a potentially 
championship-sized mistake by an official? Of course not. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL replay should never have been overturned in the first place at the 1992 
spring owners meetings, where discontent over the inner workings of the system 
ultimately killed the 6-year-old experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, there were long delays and an inability to master the technical aspects 
of the system. And, yes, instant replay should have been viewed more as a 
useful means of ensuring the proper call on a given play, not the Big Brother 
menace it came to represent to some NFL referees and team executives. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of simply giving up on replay -- a concept that remains popular 
with many fans -- the owners should continue investigating ways to improve the 
system and bring it back as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 They can start by taking a page out of the NHL rule book: Reduce the scope of 
replay to review only the most crucial plays in a game. Hockey's replay doesn't 
overrule such judgment calls as penalties and offsides, and an NFL replay 
system should adopt a similar approach. If the NFL limited replay to all 
scoring plays and turnovers, the entire process wouldn't get bogged down in 
determining whether a receiver had his little toe inbounds on a five-yard catch 
at midfield or whether the quarterback was an inch over the line of scrimmage 
when delivering a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll grant you things have gone relatively smoothly in the two years since 
replay was abandoned. Hey, even the replay-meister himself, Dan Dierdorf, was 
pretty quiet on Monday nights. But that shouldn't leave NFL executives 
complacent about what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the league has been pretty fortunate the last two years," says former 
Dallas Cowboys president Tex Schramm, who was the major force behind 
instituting replay in 1986. "But you can just as easily have two years coming 
up where you have a whole bunch of (controversial) plays that are very pivotal 
in games."

CRUISE VIEWS: ROYAL VIKING TO UNDERGO SEA CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the saying goes, there's good news and bad news. The good news is we came 
back recently from the most wonderful cruise we've taken in years, perhaps the 
best ever, a 14-day culinary extravaganza produced in cooperation with the Le 
Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris aboard the 200-passenger Royal Viking 
Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a perfect coalescence of interesting itinerary, outstanding cuisine, 
top-of-the-line service and a beautiful ship. In the two years since we were 
aboard its inaugural sailing, the Royal Viking Queen has developed into one of 
the finest three or four ships afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is, we arrived in London to learn that at the end of this year 
the ship will cease operations under Royal Viking, leaving only a few more 
months remaining to enjoy what turned into the quintessential Royal Viking 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 We sailed from Lisbon along the coast and rivers of France to London, pausing 
in Bordeaux.  
</P>
<P>
 For the last three days of the voyage, we sailed along the Thames into London 
to anchor alongside the Tower Bridge for the celebration of its 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 But during our blissful days at sea, other negotiations were going on back in 
the Coral Gables, Fla., office of RVL and its parent company Kloster Cruise 
Ltd. that would determine the future for both the Queen and the line's 
758-passenger flagship, Royal Viking Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an open secret for months that the two-ship Royal Viking Line was up 
for sale. Effective last June 30, Kloster sold the Royal Viking Sun to Cunard 
Line Ltd., along with the Royal Viking brand name and other company trademarks, 
for $170 million, plus potential payouts of another $5 million based on the 
ship's future performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Viking Queen, not included in the Cunard transaction, will sail on 
its scheduled itineraries with its present crew in place for the remainder of 
1994. It will then be transferred to Kloster's Royal Cruise Line to become the 
Queen Odyssey on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Adam Aron, president of both Royal Cruise Line and Norwegian 
Cruise Line, the two remaining cruise divisions of Kloster, the fare for the 
Queen Odyssey "will be roughly half of what it was on the Royal Viking Queen." 
(Based on published brochure prices on our cruise, the new fare would be around 
$440 a day per person, double occupancy.) 
</P>
<P>
 In acquiring the flagship and the brand name, Cunard is in effect the new 
owner of Royal Viking Line. Cunard's senior vice president of marketing Navin 
Sawhney says that Cunard Royal Viking will market the Royal Viking Sun, 
Sagafjord, Vistafjord and the two new Sea Goddess ships as an ultra-luxury 
brand name. 
</P>
<P>
 While Cunard and Royal Cruise Line are good companies in their own right, 
they'll have to work hard to maintain the exemplary standards set by Royal 
Viking Line during its 22 years at sea. In its best days, it was something to 
aspire to, and even in its second-best days, it was far better than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cunard's Sawhney says his line has no plans to change anything on 
the Sun, including its name. "The itineraries that we will operate in 1995 are 
as they are published in the RVL brochure. " 
</P>
<P>
 The next Le Cordon Bleu cruise scheduled is a November segment of the 50-day 
Southern Cross itinerary aboard the Royal Viking Sun, leaving San Francisco 
Nov. 2 and Los Angeles Nov. 3. For more information, contact a travel agent or 
call Royal Viking Line (through Sept. 30) at (800) 422-8000 or Cunard at (800) 
221-4770. 
</P>
<P>
 Slater and Basch travel as guests of the cruise lines. Cruise Views appears 
the first and third week of every month.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: ORAL OASIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the back wall at Ara's is a mural of a desert caravan doubtlessly in need 
of an oasis. Too bad the camel riders couldn't just step off the wall and into 
Ara's, which is something of an oasis from the hectic nearby intersection of La 
Brea and Melrose.The desert travelers, like the customers, would enjoy the 
relaxed setting and Armenian food prepared here by Said and Zabel Boghosian. 
</P>
<P>
 Named for the couple's son, Ara's is a familiar name in Hollywood's large 
Armenian community even though the restaurant is only 4 months old. The 
Boghosians owned another Ara's on Hollywood Boulevard for nine years before 
selling it in 1992 to open a pastry shop. However, Said Boghosian, 49, grew 
bored with that venture: "All I did was collect money. I needed to cook again 
and see the smiles of satisfied customers." So the Boghosians sold the pastry 
shop.  
</P>
<P>
 To begin your meal, there are such appetizers as baba ghannouj ($3.50), or the 
extremely refreshing jajik ($3), a homemade yogurt mixed with cucumber and 
dried mint. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular main courses is the chicken kebab ($7.95), marinated 
overnight in a concoction of lemon, garlic, red pepper, paprika, cilantro, 
curry, cumin and cinnamon, then cooked over an open flame. Two other kebabs, 
one of leg of lamb, the other filet mignon, get a simpler treatment of salt, 
red pepper, onions and olive oil. 
</P>
<P>

 Ara's, 7015 Melrose Ave.; open noon to 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday, noon 
to 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, closed Sunday; (213) 939-5577.

TARDY POLICY: SACRIFICING EDUCATION FOR PUNISHMENT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How can any responsible parent or educator approve of tardy policies that 
result in students missing more classroom time ("Crenshaw High Praised for 
Tardy Policy," June 19)? 
</P>
<P>
 Does it make sense to sacrifice 45 remaining minutes of classroom education to 
punish five to 10 minutes of tardiness? 
</P>
<P>
 As a parent, I have a long history of making sure my children are punctual at 
school. My son, who was one of the few students to graduate with honors from 
Crenshaw in 1992, received an award for perfect attendance in both the 10th and 
11th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter Megan, who has just entered our family through my recent marriage, 
comes from Compton schools with serious confidence problems and learning needs. 
Yet Crenshaw has chosen to unfairly punish her in a very degrading, unhealthy 
and unsanitary way, denying her access to classrooms she had trouble finding, 
classrooms where teachers deliberately ignored the fact that she can't read. 
</P>
<P>
 Her first year in high school has been an educational disaster, yet it need 
not have been, had the teachers contacted us as we requested when we enrolled 
her. Why did Crenshaw fail to report her reading and tardy problems to us in a 
timely fashion so that both home and school could address and correct them? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are school personnel now trying to get us to bring Megan in for a reading 
evaluation, so she can be placed in a special program, when this should have 
been done in the second week of September, 1993?  
</P>
<P>
 In keeping Megan home as a protest to the way she has been treated, God sent 
us a blessing. Megan somehow felt enough confidence in my concern for her life 
to come to me and say, "I want to tell you something that I have kept secret 
for a long time, that I don't think my mama even knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I sit in the classroom I feel so bad because all the other kids can read 
and I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother was cruelly passed from grade to grade without being taught to read 
and function beyond a third-grade level. She was never in a position to 
properly monitor her daughter's special educational needs. Her only recourse 
was to trust her daughter to the same system that had miseducated her. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan told me she thought it would hurt her mother if she knew she could not 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 This is happening to far too many people, especially African Americans, and it 
must be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Miseducation is the enemy that we all need to be concerned about, for it is 
placing a blot on American life that is coming back to haunt us. We continually 
feed the crime and drug zones of our nation with those who can't function. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask any student -- magnet, regular or so-called learning disabled -- how it 
feels to be locked out of the classroom for being late and told to pick up 
trash with no gloves on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask children if being treated this way makes them appreciate the school, 
classroom and education more, or if they feel degraded and humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
 Students need mandatory subjects on the universal healing power of good 
nutrition, cultural awareness and self-respect to promote cross-cultural love 
and understanding. For as we continue to leave these basic living values out of 
education, we are creating more trouble for human relations and for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 To fail or pass one child untaught hurts everyone. Parents who feel the same 
way can call (213) 294-3024.

 MONEY TALKS: Who should control the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza when it 
opens? The question has touched off an unusual power struggle among the city's 
civic leaders (B6). . . . Some say it should be the civic center's rich donors. 
Others say it should be political appointees accountable to the voters. . . . 
Nancy Dolensek, executive director of the McCallum Theater in Palm Desert, 
offers this slice of practical wisdom: "Money begets money.We need people who 
travel in the right circles (to generate operating funds), and that's generally 
not politicians." 
</P>

 FLESH WOUND: Pure oxygen treatments have begun to suffocate an infection that 
was eating away at the skin and tissue of a Fillmore woman's leg. . . . 
Guadalupe Pulido, 63, was rushed to a Thousand Oaks hospital Friday for special 
therapy to treat a condition known as "flesh-eating bacteria." What started as 
a pimple a week ago spread from her groin to her knee and across her leg. . . . 
Pulido could be done with her treatments within two days, but it is too early 
to tell what follow-up treatment she might need. Her condition was improving on 
Saturday.

 PARTY ON: For more than 50 years, Ventura County has offered a home to the 
Seabees. On Saturday, the Navy construction workers threw a giant party in Port 
Hueneme to say thanks (B1). . . . In full parade dress, 900 white-clad Seabees 
kicked off the annual weekend festival with an hourlong march and assembly at 
the sprawling naval base. More than 30,000 people are expected to attend the 
two-day event. . . . So impressed was 12-year-old Joey Cerda of Port Hueneme 
that he said he plans to join up when he's old enough. "It's a challenge," he 
said. "I like tough challenges."

CIVIL WAR'S UNKNOWN SOLDIERS BORE NAMES LIKE ROSETTA, SARAH; HISTORY: ABOUT 400 
OF THE 3 MILLION COMBATANTS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN WOMEN. OTHERS MAY BE BURIED 
UNDER MALE NOMS DE GUERRE.  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From 1862 to 1864, a Union Army private wrote to kinfolk back home in New 
York, describing strange Southern lands, drills and duty, loneliness and an 
itch to go into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am well and tough as a bear," Lyons Wakeman wrote. "I have got so that I 
can drill just as well as any man there is in my regiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeman died of dysentery after fighting in Louisiana's Red River Campaign in 
1864. The 21-year-old soldier was laid to rest in Chalmette National Cemetery, 
just one among the 654,000 killed during the four-year Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeman, though, died harboring a secret guarded with the vigilance of a 
sentry at post. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons Wakeman was actually Sarah Rosetta Wakeman, who left home at 19 to find 
the freedom in breeches that she couldn't in a dress. She cut her hair, bound 
her breasts, put on a uniform, and in 1862 enlisted in the 153rd Regiment, New 
York State Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeman wasn't alone. Of the 3 million Union and Confederate soldiers in the 
Civil War, about 400 women are known to have posed as men so they could fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably many, many more" lie under graves bearing their male aliases, said 
Lauren Cook Burgess, Civil War historian and editor of "The Uncommon Soldier," 
a collection of Wakeman's letters. "We'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing to distinguish Wakeman's grave from the other 15,000 thick 
stone markers at the Chalmette cemetery, just outside New Orleans. Her 
tombstone reads simply, "4066 Lyons Wakeman N.Y." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't so hard for Wakeman to keep her secret while alive, either, 
historians say. 
</P>
<P>
 The urgency for more soldiers meant that physical examinations of new recruits 
were spotty at best. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes all that was required of an enlistee was a trigger finger that 
worked and two opposing teeth strong enough to rip open a Minie ball cartridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In her memoir, "Nurse and Spy," Sarah Emma E. Edwards, who posed as Pvt. 
Franklin Thompson for the 2nd Michigan Volunteers, described her physical 
entrance exam as "a firm handshake." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, so many teen-age and pre-adolescent boys fought in uniform that it 
wasn't unusual to see a small, smooth-faced soldier with a high voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeman often sent money home to Afton, N.Y., to keep the farm going, though 
her defiance so embarrassed her parents that they told siblings too young to 
remember her that she was a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am enjoying my Self better this summer than I ever did before in this 
world," she told them in June of 1863. ". . . I will Dress as I am a mind to 
for all anyone else (cares), and if they don't let me Alone, they will be sorry 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 A younger sister, born after Wakeman died, found her letters in the attic, 
along with her ring and a daguerreotype of Wakeman in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time Catherine Wakeman realized her "brother" Lyons was a 
woman, according to her great-great-grandniece, Ruth Goodier, of Chipley, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't talked about," Goodier said in an interview. "The younger ones 
didn't know about it; it was just not discussed because it was not the kind of 
thing women did. They sort of brushed it under the carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Grant de Pauw, president of the Minerva Center on Women in the Military 
in Pasadena, Md., said, "People said it was disgraceful when the other side did 
it. But when their girls did it, it was patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodier told Burgess about her great-great-aunt when she read a newspaper 
article about the historian's own gender conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess had been portraying a male soldier in 1989 for a re-enactment of the 
Battle of Antietam, and was spotted leaving the ladies' room. Authorities at 
Antietam National Park in Sharpsburg, Md., told her she couldn't join any more 
living histories -- because they wanted to preserve the authenticity of the 
1862 battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taken aback," Burgess said, explaining that "it was a pretty well-known 
fact in historian circles" that five women, posing as men, fought at Antietam 
(two were wounded, one killed). She sued the National Park Service for sexual 
discrimination, and won. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosetta Wakeman's letters -- the most important cache to date on female 
soldiers in the Civil War -- show that she felt a deep responsibility toward 
her family, particularly helping pay her father's debts. "I knew that I could 
help you more to leave home than to stay there with you," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We speculated in the family about why she did it," Goodier said. "We decided 
she did it for the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Economics was only one reason women gave up their identity to enlist, Burgess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like men, "they were patriots, of course. They wanted to strike a blow against 
the enemy. . . . The third reason is for adventure, to gain a measure of social 
and legal and economic independence not available to women." 
</P>
<P>
 Others accompanied husbands, lovers or brothers into battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were discovered when they were treated for illness or wounds; a few 
became pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "A corporal was promoted to sergeant for gallant conduct at the battle of 
Fredericksburgh," wrote Union Col. Elijah H. C. Cavins, "since which time the 
sergeant has become the mother of a child." 
</P>
<P>
 Many women kept their disguise successfully throughout the war. 
</P>
<P>
 When Albert D. J. Cashier of the 95th Illinois Infantry Regiment was 
hospitalized long after the war, doctors found that "he" was really Jennie 
Hodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 After her secret was discovered, Hodgers continued to receive a pension and 
lived out her last years in a soldiers' home, but the Pension Bureau "made her 
dress like a woman," Burgess said. "She wasn't very happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Cashier's name appears on a monument to the Illinois soldiers who fought at 
Vicksburg, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeman got her wish to see battle during the Red River Campaign. She survived 
its fiercest engagement, the Battle of Pleasant Hill, and marched about 400 
miles in Louisiana's subtropical weather on a meager diet. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounts show she equaled -- and some might say exceeded -- her male 
counterparts in skill, bravery and toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel afraid to go (into battle)," she wrote in August of 1863. "I 
don't believe there are any Rebel's bullet made for me yet. Nor I don't care 
that there is. I am as independent as a hog on the ice. If it is God's will for 
me to fall in the field of battle, it is my will to go and never return home. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "Good-by for this time, from yours respectful, 
</P>
<P>
 "Miss Rosetta Wakeman."

MISSILES: AMERICA'S UNREAPED PRAIRIE CROP; MILITARY: DESPITE THE END OF THE 
COLD WAR, THE AIR FORCE MAINTAINS LOADED SILOS OF ICBMS BURIED BENEATH NORTH 
DAKOTA WHEAT FIELDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL GLAUBER, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wheat field outside Henry Frantsen's front door remains armed and 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a silo burrowed 90 feet underground, hardened by concrete and steel, 
topped by a 110-ton hatch, a 20-foot antenna, and 10 yards of railroad track. 
And there is the missile, the one beneath the wheat, the one with the three 
nuclear warheads, each of which could wipe out a major city. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a third of his 92 years, Frantsen, a second-generation North Dakota 
farmer, has lived side by side with the missile, witness to a nuclear holocaust 
that never was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought they'd shoot one," he said. "They say, though, you've never 
lived unless you've heard one fired off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War may be over but the nuclear missiles remain buried on the 
prairie, an unharvested crop that for most Americans remains out of sight, out 
of mind. On farms and cattle ranches less than a hundred miles south of the 
Canadian border, and 30 minutes by rocket power from downtown Moscow, a chunk 
of America's land-based nuclear arsenal is on alert, 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have lived and worked with the intercontinental ballistic missiles 
(ICBMs) since their installation in 1962 have grown accustomed to their 
presence, the silos as much a part of the Great Plains landscape as the grain 
bins and barns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never worried about the missiles," Frantsen said. "Having them is better 
than shooting, better than a real hot war. The communists, they might have 
tried something if we didn't have these missiles. But me, I always felt secure 
out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The security blanket starts at Minot Air Force Base, where the silos that hold 
150 of America's arsenal of 500 Minuteman III's are spread in the shape of the 
letter C across 8,500 square miles in the surrounding countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 It is flat here. Quiet, too. Winters are harsh, but there is a beauty to the 
summer, especially when the wheat is waving in the breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 But do not be deceived by the gentle landscape. From here, you could end the 
world, and catch the last few seconds on CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force Capt. Scott Rothweiler's office lies 60 feet beneath the soil, 11 
miles outside a town named Kenmare. 
</P>
<P>
 He sits in a heavily-padded red chair inside a rectangular room suspended by 
shock absorbers roughly the size of a one-story house. A radio crackles. A 
Teletype spews out messages. There is a bed and a toilet at one end of the 
compartment, a six-foot-tall computer about as powerful as your average 
wristwatch at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 The telephones have rotary dials, the Air Force following a policy of not 
fixing things not broken. But the system is due for an upgrade of electronic 
equipment soon. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the microwave oven and the cassette player stashed above a console, 
this could be 1962, with Kennedy in the White House and Khrushchev in the 
Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is 1994, the Soviet Union no longer exists, and for the first time in 
more than 30 years, the nuclear weapons are no longer targeted on specific 
cities. But officers like Rothweiler and his partner, Capt. Bert Braza, 
continue to man one of the area's 15 missile-alert facilities in 24-hour 
shifts, up to 10 times a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're in a big eggshell down here," said Rothweiler, 27, of 
Memphis, Tenn. "We're here to launch a missile. And we've never launched one." 
</P>
<P>
 America's missileers have time to kill and plenty of time to study when 
submerged beneath the ground. The 200 missileers at Minot may be dressed in 
blue jumpsuits that make them look like a bunch of car mechanics, but they are 
all officers, all brandishing college degrees, and nearly all enrolled in 
master's degree programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to find your own reason for doing the job," said Braza, a 
27-year-old from Newport News, Va. "You find your own gains. You realize, 'Yes, 
what I'm doing is valuable.' The system has worked." 
</P>
<P>
 In the day-to-day routine that rules life along the missile range, it is often 
hard to believe that this is the front line of a war that has never been 
fought. It isn't just peaceful out here -- it's downright dull. A security 
breach at the missile site is when a jack rabbit happens to skip into the range 
of sensors, or when the wind blows too hard, or when the snow melts and sets 
off an alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Above ground at the missile-alert facilities, the personnel can play 
basketball, lift weights, shoot pool, watch satellite television or videos, or 
simply read books. The guards who work four-day shifts carry loaded M-16s, but 
outsiders rarely venture near the fenced compounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my mind, I know why we're out here," said Staff Sgt. Tambra 
Shafer, 28, of DuBois, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Shafer, who runs a security detail, harbors few illusions about her future in 
the event of a nuclear confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be toast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But few inside or outside the military dwell on the possibility of being at 
the center of a nuclear war. Live with something long enough, even nuclear 
weapons, and, well, you get used to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Glenn Wunderlich, farmer, the man who actually grows the wheat out 
front of Frantsen's home in Voltaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a different feeling out here," he said, taking a visitor on an 
impromptu tour of the wheat field and the missile silo. "Maybe we're more 
patriotic. But you realize the nation has to have defense. We're in a unique 
spot out here. You can go over the North Pole from here and get where you need, 
real fast. We don't know when we would need those missiles. Maybe everything is 
fine now. But maybe we could end up like Pearl Harbor in 1941, not having any 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Listen to Bud Olsen, who ran Minot's Chamber of Commerce Military Affairs 
Committee for 31 years before his retirement in 1990, and who can recall the 
city raising $50,000 in one day to buy land for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep our missiles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And listen to Frantsen, who legend has it was born under a wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The missiles? We don't pay much attention to them anymore," he said. "They're 
just here." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, the main issues in the area are keeping the missiles, keeping a 
wing of 22 B-52 bombers, and keeping the base off the congressional hit list. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't do peace demonstrations in Minot. In this city of 35,000, the 
missiles mean money, jobs and security. The Air Force base with its population 
of 10,000 is the region's chief employer, pumping about $178 million annually 
into the area economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Around here, folks still say that North Dakota is the world's third-largest 
nuclear power, behind the rest of the United States and the old Soviet Union. 
But this is a new era. America has cut its ICBM missile force by nearly half. 
Those ICBMs that remain are also due to be converted to single warheads, 
pending the ratification of a START II treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Minot has survived the first two rounds on the base closure merry-go-round, 
but may face another test when the next round comes along mid-decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But when will America fill in the last of the silos? The Department of Defense 
plans to keep the Minuteman system viable through the turn of the century. So 
the missileers still have a tough, tedious job to perform.

STUDY: PREGNANT WOMEN UNAIDED BY BED REST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors tell nearly one in five pregnant women to stay in bed for a week or 
more, but a study has found little evidence that the prescription does any 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed rest disrupts women's lives and costs more than $1 billion a year in lost 
wages, lost productivity around the home and hospital costs, the study said. It 
may also present its own medical risks, such as blood clots, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prescribed for a variety of conditions, bed rest is usually done at home and 
can last several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "In nearly every case when it's been studied, there is no proof of benefit," 
said Dr. Robert Goldenberg, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his co-authors conclude in the July issue of the journal Obstetrics and 
Gynecology that doctors should cut down sharply on ordering bed rest and that 
further studies should be done to see if it really helps. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers used results of a 1988 national survey to calculate that more 
than 700,000 women a year, or about 18% of pregnant women who deliver after 20 
weeks of pregnancy, are advised by their doctors to rest in bed for at least a 
week during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers also did a computerized search of studies that evaluated bed 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 They found no evidence that it reduces the rate of first-trimester 
miscarriage, even though it is sometimes prescribed for women who have slight 
bleeding called spotting. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, although obstetrics textbooks generally recommend bed rest for 
women at risk of premature delivery, researchers found no sign that it lowers 
that risk in women carrying a single fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings for high blood pressure were more complex. For a dangerous form 
called proteinuric hypertension or pre-eclampsia, women should be hospitalized 
so they can be closely monitored, the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For other women, those whose high blood pressure began before they became 
pregnant, there's little evidence bed rest will lead to a healthier baby, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Larsen, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at George Washington 
University who was familiar with the study results, said some pregnant women 
with high blood pressure can benefit from bed rest in which they lie on their 
sides.

FOG COLLECTOR BRINGS WATER TO ARID CHILE VILLAGE; SCIENCE: THE PEOPLE OF 
CHUNGUNGO HAD DONE WITHOUT RUNNING WATER FOR TWO DECADES. BUT A NEW SYSTEM OF 
TRAPPING MOISTURE LETS WATER FLOW, GARDENS FLOURISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Nets that catch fog have given the people of this village on the desert coast 
their first opportunity in nearly a generation to plant flowers and trees, 
raise pets and take showers. 
</P>
<P>
 Daysi Sasmaya spoke of a simple luxury: "You can bathe every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Chungungo was without running water for two decades after the government 
closed an iron mine in the mountains above and dismantled the system that had 
piped water to it and the village from wells 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they could not afford to build their own system, the 200 villagers had 
to depend on water trucked nearly 15 miles over a dirt road so rutted and 
winding that there is no bus service. Once a week, a truck brought water in 
50-gallon drums. Each resident was allowed a little over 3 1/2 gallons a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you washed yourself or something else, you could only rinse once," 
Sasmaya said. "The clothes water was used for bathing. The dishwater went into 
the vegetable patch." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a $250,000 Canadian aid project with Chungungo as its pilot site, 
there is plenty of water today and trees line the village's dirt streets. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Chungungo's 90 houses have had fresh water collected by 75 nets 
that capture droplets from the fog that shrouds the mountains on most days. The 
"fog trappers," which resemble black plastic volleyball nets, line the brown 
crests where the homes of mine executives once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 Water runs from the nets to troughs, then into a gravity system where the 
water is chlorinated and descends to the village through a four-mile pipeline. 
The result is nearly 14 gallons a day per person at half the cost of the 
trucked-in water. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilar Cereceda, the engineer who laid out the pattern for the nets, said they 
are easy to maintain. The polypropylene nets should last 10 years, she said, 
and the other components about 20 years. Maintenance consists mainly of 
clearing algae from the nets and debris from the troughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the aid money went for research that will not need to be done again, 
according to Cereceda. About one-fifth of it was spent on the pipeline and only 
4% on the nets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chilean government plans to build trappers near Paposo, another fishing 
village about 300 miles north of Chungungo, which now survives on less than a 
gallon of water a day per person. 
</P>
<P>
 At Paposo, "the cliffs nearby are beautiful for collectors," Cereceda said, so 
costs can be reduced by setting the nets closer to the village. 
</P>
<P>
 Fog collection is under way in Peru, and such diverse countries as Ecuador, 
India, China and the Philippines have studied the Chungungo system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cereceda went to Kenya and Oman to help determine the best sites for 
collectors and feels Tanzania, Namibia and Cape Verde are other good 
candidates. "In Africa, the people already collect rainwater to use during the 
drought season; they understand how to conserve water," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fog collection is not new. A South African scientist demonstrated it in 1903, 
and in the 1950s the Dole company developed a system on the Hawaiian island of 
Lanai that used evergreen trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Collection is feasible wherever there is steady fog, Cereceda said. Northern 
Chile has frequent fog because cold air currents from Antarctica collide with 
damp sea air over the desert coastline. Chungungo has up to 189 days of fog 
annually and 89 of patchy fog. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar Andrade, a 44-year-old Chungungo fisherman who now has roses and other 
flowers in his front yard, has nothing but praise for the water project. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers when Bethlehem Steel ran the El Tofo mine and shipped ore from 
Cruz Grande, a now-unused port next to Chungungo. The village had electricity, 
clean water and a hospital, all provided by the company, and the people could 
shop at well-stocked stores in the port. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Chile nationalized the mine and closed the hospital and stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "From 1970 on, we suffered from the lack of water," Andrade said. "Thanks to 
Canada, we now have water. The Canadian government gave us a real present."

TEACHER BLEW WHISTLE ON BRUTALITY, LOST HER JOB; NEW YORK: WHEN SHE LEARNED 
THAT AN 'ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT' AT TROUBLED TEEN CENTER MEANT A BEATING, SHE 
REPORTED THE PRACTICE AND WAS FIRED. SHE IS SUING FOR BACK WAGES AND 
REINSTATEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Five weeks into her new job, Patricia Hanley witnessed an "attitude 
adjustment" at Austin MacCormick Center, a youth lockup with a reputation for 
turning menacing teen-agers into model inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Two boys were adjudged to have misbehaved for questioning a teacher about a 
spelling, so all 13 students in their unit were detained in a recreation room 
and pelted with abuse for nearly an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Then two burly guards took the offending pair into a padded chamber called the 
"timeout room." 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard banging, and the boys came out and their faces were all red and 
bruised, and that was it, the 'counseling session' was over! I walked out of 
there that night and I don't think I've ever felt as guilty in my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Hanley decided she could not live with that guilt; she blew the 
whistle and spurred an investigation into brutality at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a price to pay: Hanley lost her job as a special education 
teacher. These days, she gets by on tutoring, mowing lawns and painting houses. 
She visits a mental health clinic for therapy each week. 
</P>
<P>
 All, she says, because she revealed the abuse of children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I was as naive as I was. I mean, child abuse is supposed to 
be a hot issue," she said. "If it had been a different set of kids, I think it 
would have been." 
</P>
<P>
 She is suing for back wages and reinstatement under a state whistle-blower 
law, contending she was retaliated against for simply doing her duty. 
</P>
<P>
 The 52-bed center had built up renown for its ability to handle New York's 
most violent and maladjusted youths. Hanley had expected a tough-minded but 
innovative regimen for trying to remold the 13- to 18-year-olds, many of them 
learning disabled or emotionally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't like that at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program was all based on fear. There was no learning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a Pollyanna. I wouldn't be a big nurturer with these kids -- they'd 
manipulate you to death. But you can work on self-esteem, have them do 
something educationally and be proud of it. They're salvageable people." 
</P>
<P>
 She assumed that the first beating -- a few days before Christmas, 1989 -- was 
a lapse that her supervisors would surely clamp down on. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was nothing new, and they didn't seem troubled. "You must learn 
MacCormick's ways," a senior counselor told her. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "beat-downs," she soon discovered, were routinely administered at 
the hilltop detention center to keep the youngsters in line, even when they had 
done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 And the threat of retaliation had deterred anyone from complaining -- at least 
not any new staffers who wanted to keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 She began cataloguing a litany of beatings by guards, some so severe that the 
victims needed hospital treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The bylaws of the Division for Youth forbid the hitting of any youngster. An 
employee who fails to report suspected child abuse can be charged with a Class 
A misdemeanor and dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanley alerted the state's Child Abuse Hotline but got nowhere. She was 
subjected to ridicule, malicious gossip and death threats. Six months later, 
she was dismissed without a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was probationary, so they thought I would be history. If you don't want to 
be fired, you have to look the other way for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 But she persevered. Last summer, propelled by an expose in Syracuse's 
Herald-Journal/Herald American, her complaints finally got the attention of 
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. In January, state investigators confirmed a pattern of 
physical abuse at MacCormick dating back to at least 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the U.S. Justice Department is investigating beatings and 
other possible civil rights violations at a Buffalo facility that was shut down 
in March. And the state Legislature allocated $150,000 for an evaluation of 
MacCormick and three other top-security youth centers. 
</P>
<P>
 This May, Hanley went to Washington to accept a Cavallo Foundation Award for 
Moral Courage, a $10,000 national prize for whistle-blowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the amount of people who have come out of the woodwork," the 
soft-spoken Hanley, 40, said at her rural home outside Ithaca. "It's something 
you fall into, not anything you seek. People like us believe in the system, 
even though right now I think I'm an anarchist." 
</P>
<P>
 MacCormick's old management is gone, and state regulators have spelled out new 
practices to help prevent abuses there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is no one should fear trying to help root out bad employees," 
said James Cotter, Division for Youth spokesman. "If they don't come forward, 
they're doing a disservice to young people in our care." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency attempted to settle with Hanley two days before the Syracuse 
newspaper published its six-month investigation of MacCormick. The offer, 
however, was later withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can get is back salary. No one does this for money," Hanley said. "I 
won't feel free until it's settled and I can move on with my life. I'm not 
going to find work around here; I know it."

GERMAN DRIVERS' LICENSE CAN COST $1,000; MOTORING: NATION REQUIRES AMERICANS TO 
TAKE EXPENSIVE CLASSES TO GET A LICENSE, EVEN IF THEY HAVE A GOOD DRIVING 
RECORD IN THE UNITED STATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Want a German driver's license? That will be $1,000 and 40 hours of schooling, 
please, even if you've been driving all your life. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a year-old law, Americans and citizens of most other countries must go 
to driving school and pass tests if they have lived in the country a year and 
want to continue driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Weise said she was "just livid" to find that her 16 years of driving 
counted for nothing -- that she not only had to enroll in driving school but 
had to take five hours of first-aid training. 
</P>
<P>
 An individual cannot even make an appointment for the written and road tests. 
The driving school does that, and its instructor must accompany the student in 
a school-owned car with dual controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This driver's license thing was about enough to make me move back to the 
States," said Weise, of Denville, N.J. "It's quite humiliating." 
</P>
<P>
 It also is not the best way to attract foreign commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Impediments like this are real deterrents to doing business," said Andrew 
Luedders of the American Chamber of Commerce in Frankfurt, which is trying get 
the United States included on the list of exempt countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was in large degree a response to a sudden influx of Eastern 
Europeans, too many of whom had phony licenses, according to German officials. 
Germany also has special driving rules and conditions, such as super-fast 
autobahns, and many road signs unfamiliar to Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the old law, Weise and her husband, who works for an American TV network 
in Frankfurt, could have obtained German licenses simply by having their New 
Jersey permits translated, getting eye tests and paying nominal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new one, each spent $900 and 40 hours in a driving school and 
studying, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a scam," said Denise St. Pierre of Montreal, whose husband, 
Gaetan Malo, plays professional hockey for the Berlin Prussians. She spent more 
than $1,200 getting her license. 
</P>
<P>
 Transport Ministry officials acknowledge that some unscrupulous driving 
schools take unwitting students for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are black sheep in the occupation who say that without 10 hours of 
behind-the-wheel schooling you can't take the test," said Annegret Killmann, a 
ministry spokeswoman. "That is not in the law, however." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to telephone inquiries, representatives of several Berlin driving 
schools insisted that 10 hours of practice were necessary to take the test. 
</P>
<P>
 That was what St. Pierre was told. Although she has never had an accident, her 
instructor described her driving as "almost dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Pierre failed her road test the first time. Retaking it cost another $180. 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies that employ foreigners pay the costs of their licenses, which 
add up to tens of thousands of dollars annually for a firm like Opel, a GM 
subsidiary based in Ruesselsheim, near Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are from Switzerland or Italy, for example, you get your license 
automatically transcribed. Why not the Americans?" said Kurt Schnaebele, who 
helps Opel executives and their spouses get licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Killmann of the Transport Ministry said the main problem is the lack of a 
uniform U.S. licensing standard -- "requirements differ from state to state." 
</P>
<P>
 For a license to be deemed transferable, she said, the requirements for it 
cannot differ significantly from those in Germany. Japan, one of 27 countries 
that won exemptions, qualified easily because its licenses are issued by a 
national agency. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have provided information the ministry requested on 
requirements in various states, and a decision on making American licenses 
transferable is expected by late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible solution short of that, Killmann said, "is to extend the grace 
period to two years." 
</P>
<P>
 That's little comfort for most U.S. executives, who generally spend about 
three years in Germany.

ELECTRONICS CUTS RED TAPE, SHORT-CIRCUITS BUREAUCRACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE THOMPSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Register your car by telephone. Renew your driver's license at the shopping 
mall. Pay speeding tickets with your credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Departments of motor vehicles around the country are slowly going the 
all-electronic route. Motorists once driven to distraction by red tape, long 
lines and sometimes cranky clerks can take care of paperwork without going 
anywhere near the dreaded hive of bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a much kinder, gentler registry these days," said Aubrey Haznar, 
spokesman for the Registry of Motor Vehicles in Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Massachusetts became the fourth state to offer car-registration 
renewal by phone, said Larry Greenberg of the American Assn. of Motor Vehicle 
Administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Wisconsin, Illinois and California, which was first in 1989 and 
now plans as well to install kiosks around the state where residents can renew 
their registrations with machines that take credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't have to wait, they don't have to commute," said Greg Niva, a 
supervisor of vehicle registration for the Wisconsin Department of 
Transportation. "When you can just pick up the phone and do it, people are 
attracted to the convenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Limited to vehicle owners with credit cards, the telephone registration 
systems allow renewals as late as the date the registration expires. In the 
exchange, the telephone clerk consults a computer to be sure the caller has 
auto insurance, then takes a credit card number to bill the registration fee, 
and finally records the renewal, again on computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new registration document is sent the old-fashioned way, however: by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative in Massachusetts, still in use, requires residents to mail or 
bring to the registry proof their car is insured to renew their registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to the registry also get routed by a telephone system that lets people 
pay traffic violations, such as speeding tickets, by credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers also can renew their licenses at one of seven shopping malls at 
registry branches called "License Express." Two more branches will open this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerold Gnazzo, the state registrar of motor vehicles, said his department now 
renews 200 to 300 auto registrations daily by phone, still a fraction of the 
34,000 transactions the agency conducts each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is for you to never have to go to a registry office again," said 
Gnazzo, who acknowledged the agency may have difficulty getting some to break 
the habit.

 "They may not want to stop coming (in person) to the registry because it gives 
them something to complain about," he said, laughing. "But they'll just have to 
find a new state agency to hate."

EROSION OF LAW COULD COST SOIL; FARMING: AUDIT SHOWS AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT 
WEAKENED A PROGRAM REQUIRING GROWERS TO REDUCE LOSS OF EARTH IN ORDER TO 
RECEIVE SUBSIDIES.

 Millions of dollars in government payments -- as well as tons of topsoil -- 
could be lost because the Agriculture Department weakened a strict conservation 
program in the late 1980s, an internal audit says. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1985 Farm Bill required farmers to combat erosion on vulnerable land if 
they wanted to keep receiving government support payments for their crops. 
Farmers were to use methods that kept erosion to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 But farmers applied pressure, saying that following the rules would cost too 
much. So the department promoted less burdensome "alternative conservation 
systems" that permitted more erosion, according to the audit by the 
department's Office of Inspector General. 
</P>
<P>
 The systems are outlined in highly detailed technical guidebooks, the field 
office technical guides, that local conservation officials use to work out 
conservation plans with farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, obtained by the Associated Press, the alternatives 
were developed even when it couldn't be shown they were needed. Moreover, the 
alternatives didn't always say how much soil loss would be allowed, or allowed 
losses far greater than average erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allowed producers to maintain eligibility for U.S. Department of 
Agriculture benefits even though erosion reductions were not achieved," the 
audit report said. But it gave no indication of what those losses have been or 
might be. 
</P>
<P>
 A soil loss limit of 20 tons an acre for all highly erodible land had been 
lifted in 1987, the report noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas County, Okla., a system allows the loss of 55 tons of soil per acre 
each year, although a loss of more than five tons would eventually make the 
soil barren, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Hebert, deputy assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources, 
said the audit showed flaws in the technical guidebooks rather than the 
realities of conservation compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farmers have opted to implement conservation systems that are by and large 
achieving much more erosion reductions than what would have occurred if they 
had implemented just what is on the books in those alternative conservation 
systems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the highly erodible acres examined by the Soil Conservation 
Service in 1993 were under conservation plans that brought erosion to or below 
the minimum rate needed to keep land productive over the years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When all plans are considered, the overall reduction is less than 1.5 times 
the minimum rate, a healthy number given the vulnerable soil in question, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 million highly erodible acres are in cultivation. Hebert said 
average annual erosion on those lands should be reduced from 17.5 tons per 
acre, the pre-1985 level, to six tons by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Cook, head of the Environmental Working Group, said the lax guidelines 
make it possible for farmers to cut back on their conservation efforts without 
losing benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are cases where the practice is bad based on the (alternative 
conservation systems) and where we squandered a lot of conservation just 
because of these policies," said Cook, whose group is frequently critical of 
the department's conservation policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the alternative systems let farmers skip such important but 
inexpensive practices as farming along the contours of the land, growing crops 
in alternating strips, planting buffers, using conservation tillage, or even 
rotating crops. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sedgwick County, Colo., a system called for 75% of the crops planted to be 
the kind that leave soil-retaining residues after harvest. But it allowed for 
the residues to be destroyed, leaving no barrier against wind erosion, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The requirements to cut erosion were so inconsistent that in Doniphan County, 
Kan., soil losses were limited to 27 tons an acre. But in adjoining Buchanan 
County, Mo., losses for the same kind of soil were limited to eight tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The audits reviewed 17 counties in 10 states from November, 1992, through 
April, 1993.

ENDANGERED WARBLER BRINGS TRADITIONAL FOES TOGETHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's enough to make a spotted owl green with envy: The timber industry, 
environmentalists and government regulators are working together to try to save 
an endangered bird called the Kirtland's warbler. 
</P>
<P>
 The same groups that have been at each other's throats over the habitat of the 
spotted owl have united to try to save the half-ounce, yellow-breasted warbler, 
also threatened by a shrinking habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The endangered owl dwells in the Pacific Northwest's old-growth forests, where 
a 3-year-old logging ban cost thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the warbler lives near young trees, nesting in the thick 
underbrush beneath stands of jack pines just 5 to 15 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The pines start dying when they reach 16 to 20 feet, but by that time, they've 
choked the undergrowth. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last year, fewer than 1,000 of the warblers were known to exist -- all 
within an eight-county area of Michigan's Lower Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the Endangered Species Act is working in Michigan is one simple 
word -- partnerships," said Charles Wooley, Kirtland's project leader for the 
U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologist Rex Ennis of the U.S. Forest Service was among several dozen 
biologists and volunteers who fanned out in early June for the last day of the 
annual Kirtland's census. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupping an ear, he strained to hear the warbler's melodious chirp. Hearing 
one, he noted the warbler's approximate location on a map, then resumed his 
trek. 
</P>
<P>
 Annual counts of the bird began in 1971, when a 10-year census showed a sharp 
drop in their numbers. In 1974, only 167 males were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 census found 485 males, up 22% from the previous year. This year's 
figures are being tabulated.

NASA'S GOLDIN BOY WANTS TO BOLDLY GO WHERE NO MAN HAS GONE BEFORE; SPACE: HE'S 
OUTSPOKEN, DETERMINED AND IN CHARGE. DAN GOLDIN IS SHOOTING FOR THE STARS WITH 
PLANS FOR A SPACE STATION AND A MISSION TO MARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people clustered around the TV in the lobby of New York's 
LaGuardia Airport that Sunday in July, watching as Neil Armstrong and Buzz 
Aldrin became the first men to walk on the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Goldin sat there, transfixed, as his flight to Boston left without him. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin was so proud to have had a small part in Apollo 11. His company built 
the engine of the lunar lander that carried the astronauts to the surface that 
day -- July 20, 1969. He made a pact with himself right there: Someday, 
somehow, he would be part of a Mars mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 25 years later, Goldin has that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-seven years ago, Goldin, then a junior engineer, left NASA for TRW Inc. 
He's back, but now he's in charge of the entire space agency -- and battling 
the bureaucracy that drove him away. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA's candid and controversial chief of two years is rocking the agency's 
boat hard, to the disgust of many old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 He's ousted longtime officials, rearranged the hierarchy, cut the work force, 
shaved the budget, insisted on "faster, better, cheaper," fought for Russian 
participation in the planned space station and, at least for now, won. 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo 16 commander John Young, who holds the record with six space flights, 
says that despite his rough edges, Goldin's heart is in the right place. Apollo 
10 commander Thomas Stafford, who circled the moon but never landed, considers 
Goldin the best NASA administrator since Jim Webb, who laid the foundation for 
Apollo during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pike, head of the Federation of American Scientists' space policy 
project, also is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Walks on water," Pike said of Goldin. "He's been extremely effective in 
formulating a post-Cold War political rationale for NASA that does not require 
industrial-strength mendacity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated by President Bush and retained by President Clinton, Goldin is 
receiving much of the credit for last month's stunningly large House victory 
for the space station. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 15th time he'd had to weather a space station vote in Congress. All 
these votes are "enough to make you want to puke," he blurted publicly last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 He admits he got carried away that day, but quickly asks, "Doesn't it bother 
you?" 
</P>
<P>
 If he's blunt at times, even brash, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As Popeye says, I y'am what I y'am," Goldin said during an interview in his 
large, top-floor office at NASA headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't changed," he insisted. "I decided I would be myself, and that I 
will do the very best I can. I don't know if I can try harder, because I put in 
a good 15-hour day. I was doing it seven days a week and I now have it down to 
5 1/2." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin, who turned 54 this month, eased his maniacal schedule so he could 
train for a triathlon -- a swimming, biking and running competition. 
Unfortunately, a bicycle accident in late April wrecked his training plans. 
</P>
<P>
 For Goldin, who just never seems to stop, it's NASA versus the NFL, space 
research versus taco chips and beer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about $14 billion out of a $5.5-trillion economy," he said of 
NASA's budget. "Give me a break! One-hundred-forty million people now watch the 
Super Bowl. I don't want to demean professional football, but is that what 
life's about? 
</P>
<P>
 "We consume taco chips and we consume beer. We have to have two cars and 
sometimes three. We have to have vacation homes. How come people don't 
criticize those that have three cars and two vacation homes, yet they say, 'How 
come when people are starving you go and do a space program?' It rips my heart 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 And he's just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about the space program. I'm worried about America," Goldin 
said. "Our nation has become a nation of consumption. Entertainment and 
recreation are the most important things for the future. God help us!" 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin became interested in space while growing up in the Bronx. His Uncle Joe 
taught him how to build model airplanes and rocket ships, and he devoured 
science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 After college in 1962, Goldin applied for a job at NASA's Lewis Research 
Center in Cleveland, because it was working on a mission to Mars. TRW lured him 
away in 1967, and he soon was managing secret military spacecraft programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin was vice president and general manager of TRW Space and Technology 
Group in Redondo Beach when Bush offered him NASA's top job in March, 1992. 
Ex-astronaut Richard Truly had been pressured to resign by the White House; 
he'd helped to lead NASA back from disaster after the 1986 Challenger 
explosion, but refused to go along with changes to reform NASA's old boy 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin was considered the medicine NASA needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, George Bush was out and Bill Clinton was in. Goldin prepared to 
leave, but was asked by the incoming Administration to "hang in there" -- one 
of the few agency heads who survived the sea change in administrations. He 
stayed, even though he says it cost him millions in pay and real estate 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 He harbors frustrations, but no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day I wake up and I say, 'There are thousands of millions of very rich 
people and executives, but I'm only the ninth NASA administrator.' I have the 
best job, because if you're the NASA administrator during good times, you're 
not being tested." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin is being tested all right. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took over NASA, for example, he was shocked to learn there was no 
single person in charge of the crucial Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. 
He put Randy Brinkley at the helm and ordered extra training and practice 
spacewalks. The result was last December's spectacularly successful mission 
and, universally, the praise was for the training that preceded it. Brinkley is 
now managing the international space station program office. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldin's overriding concern, for now, is keeping the station on track; 
construction in orbit is supposed to start in 1997. Once the station is 
completed in 2002, Goldin said, it will be time to plan international 
expeditions to the moon, Mars, maybe even an asteroid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a pact with myself, so I can't back off," he said. "Now, I accept the 
fact that maybe there may be a higher priority for human beings to go to places 
other than Mars. But my deepest dream is that in my lifetime I will some way be 
responsible for a mission to Mars. It would be the next noble thing that we 
could do as a society." 
</P>
<P>
 The last noble thing was Apollo. Twenty-five long years ago.

RESEARCHER SCAVENGES ANCIENT HUMAN BONES FOR ANSWERS ON DNA; BACTERIA: OTHER 
REMAINS, INCLUDING GUTS AND FECES, ARE EXAMINED BY PALEOMICROBIOLOGISTS SEEKING 
INSIGHTS INTO EPIDEMICS AND AILMENTS.

<P>
 After 25 years of surgery, Dr. Mark Spigelman left his patients in Australia 
to look after a much older clientele here. About 1,500 years older, in fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeon-turned-sleuth scours remains of human bones, guts and feces 
searching for bits of bacterial DNA. These remnants from long-dead bacteria, he 
believes, will provide one of the most accurate pictures of medical history and 
may also offer clues to understand current epidemics. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still do not understand the ebb and flow of germs -- why the same 
bug can wipe out a community one year and barely cause illness the next. The 
answer may lurk in the genes and how they slowly mutate over time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are giving a handle to a lot of historical diseases, but there is also the 
practical application. I've always felt that a lot of problems of modern 
diseases lay in ancient times," said Spigelman. He was surrounded by boxes of 
human bones and glass cases of skulls in an office at the Institute of 
Archaeology. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the research has important implications outside medicine. A team at 
the University of Minnesota retrieved TB from a 1,000-year-old Peruvian mummy, 
a finding that suggests Columbus has been wrongly accused of bringing the 
disease to the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 Spigelman is one of a small but growing group of scientists worldwide studying 
genes from ancient germs. The fledgling field, called paleomicrobiology, 
involves an eclectic group of researchers, including archeologists, 
pathologists, microbiologists and, in Spigelman's case, a surgeon with a 
penchant for the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to learn archeology, not medical history, because I'm a surgeon, a 
hands-on man," said Spigelman. 
</P>
<P>
 He displayed a vial of ancient feces -- now looking more like sand -- that he 
collected recently at a dig in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stuff to me is even more important than bones," he said. "Bone is from 
an individual, but when you go into the toilet it's like a community roll call 
for disease." 
</P>
<P>
 DNA scavengers have no intention of reincarnating microbes from yesteryear, 
building a microscopic "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is threefold: to verify historical theories about how infections 
have spread, to provide insight into current diseases and perhaps to shed light 
on the origin of some species, such as tuberculosis or leprosy. 
</P>
<P>
 The scraps of DNA lurking in human remains are far from enough raw material to 
create a bug. They are more like fingerprints that scientists examine to 
identify a particular microbe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up until now you were only able to look at ancient diseases by the impact on 
the growth of bone. A lot of illnesses kill too soon, before it impacts bone, 
or they don't have an impact on bones at all," said Dr. Martin Jones, a 
professor of archeological science at Cambridge University. Jones also heads 
Britain's Ancient Biomolecules Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, most of Spigelman's research has been on bones, which seems to be the 
best for preserving DNA. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Spigelman fetches the bones from digs in England and Israel and 
brings them to his collaborators in the department of microbiology at the 
University of London. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've really done is apply modern diagnostic clinical techniques to the 
ancient bone," said Dr. Helen Donahue, one of the microbiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last 10 years, scientists realized that bacterial DNA can survive 
centuries, escaping enzymes that degrade the rest of the human body. At the 
same time, researchers devised a technique, called polymerase chain reaction, 
or PCR, that amplifies DNA so it can be studied more easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue and her colleagues X-ray bones to zero in on where the germ seemed to 
do its damage, the most likely spot for hunting its DNA. Then they jab the bone 
with a sharp needle and retrieve a sample, perhaps half a gram. 
</P>
<P>
 Using chemicals that clean off excess proteins, they isolate the DNA and then 
amplify using PCR, comparing the pattern of genes to the known pattern of the 
incriminated germ. The pattern looks like lines of ink blots. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Spigelman said he's retrieved genes of E. coli, a gut bacteria, from a 
bog man dating to AD 500, tuberculosis DNA from ancient bones and leprosy DNA 
from a bone dating to 600 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 The TB findings were published last year in the International Journal of 
Osteoarchaeology and the leprosy study in a letter in a recent issue of the 
Lancet, a medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts said the research may be an important step forward but the 
findings need to be confirmed, particularly because the group did not do any 
gene sequencing -- identifying the precise order of the DNA -- to validate 
their preliminary findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Svante Paabo, a pioneering DNA hunter and professor of biology at 
University of Munich, said gene sequencing -- identifying the precise order of 
DNA -- is crucial because PCR can sometimes gives false results. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed, the findings would provide yet another step forward in a lengthy 
trail of chasing the bacterial culprits, Paabo said. 
</P>
<P>
 'It's extremely interesting if one can go back and look at the evolution of 
pathogens and see how rapidly they change over time," Paabo said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it turns out that some genes don't change over time, they could be targeted 
by new drugs or vaccines, he said.

SCRAP NUCLEAR ARSENAL, GENERAL SAYS; MILITARY: AIR FORCE OFFICER'S COMMENTS RUN 
COUNTER TO THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION VIEW THAT THE STOCKPILE CAN BE REDUCED, 
BUT NOT ELIMINATED.

<P>
 The United States should eliminate all its nuclear weapons, a top Air Force 
general said Friday in a sharp break from Pentagon orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Charles A. Horner, head of the U.S. Space Command, said the nation would 
secure "the high moral ground" worldwide while losing little militarily by 
eliminating its nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nuclear weapon is obsolete," Horner said at a breakfast meeting with 
defense reporters. "I want to get rid of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Horner made clear he was "talking long-term" and said nuclear disarmament 
should only take place if other nuclear powers, especially Russia, go along. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the comments from one of the military's most senior officers run 
counter to the Clinton Administration view that the nuclear weapons arsenal can 
be reduced, but not eliminated entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 Horner, as head of one of the military's nine "unified commands," reports 
directly to the secretary of defense. His command covers military satellite 
operations and ballistic missile defense efforts, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to heading the U.S. Space Command, Horner also leads the North 
American Aerospace Defense Command, which is responsible for defending the 
United States and Canada from a nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Horner first raised the idea of eliminating the nuclear arsenal last year, but 
only as something the Pentagon should consider in "what if" studies. His 
comments Friday marked a rare instance of an active-duty officer criticizing 
one of the fundamental pillars of U.S. defense throughout the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to zero and I'll tell you why: if we and the Russians can go to 
zero nuclear weapons, then think what that does for us in our efforts to 
counter the new war," Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new military threat, unlike the superpower tensions of the past, comes 
from smaller, less stable countries that obtain weapons of mass destruction, 
Horner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of the high moral ground we secure by having none," said Horner, who 
plans to retire soon. "It's kind of hard for us to say to North Korea, 'You are 
terrible people, you're developing a nuclear weapon,' " when the United States 
has thousands of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, in a review of its nuclear posture, is not 
endorsing total nuclear disarmament. But with the annual cost of maintaining 
the U.S. nuclear arsenal estimated at about $20 billion, Administration 
officials are looking at ways to reduce the stockpile sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Current arms reduction treaties would bring the U.S. and Russian nuclear 
arsenals down to about 3,500 weapons apiece from an estimated 45,000 now on 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Horner is far from a pacifist. He led coalition air forces during the Persian 
Gulf War and he worries that the nation's conventional forces are being cut too 
deeply. His concern over nuclear weapons is a practical one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think nuclear weapons are usable," Horner said. "I'm not saying 
that we militarily disarm; I'm saying that I have a nuclear weapon, and you're 
North Korea and you have a nuclear weapon. You can use yours. I can't use mine. 
What am I going to use it on? What are nuclear weapons good for? Busting 
cities. What President of the United States is going to take out Pyongyang?"

IN GUYANA, SUGAR CANE REMAINS KING AND CUTTING IT ANYTHING BUT SWEET; SOUTH 
AMERICA: THE COUNTRY REMAINS AS TIED TO SUGAR FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE AS THE 
CUTTERS ARE FOR EARNING A LIVING. MOST OF IT GOES TO BRITAIN AS PART OF 
GUARANTEED ANNUAL SALE TO EUROPEAN UNION.

 Any legitimate history of the Caribbean Basin must focus on the centuries of 
bitter labor in cane fields that have fed the passion for sweets in Europe, 
Asia and North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand for sugar caused the Dutch to build dikes and canals here in the 
seaside lowlands of northeastern South America. It prompted their British 
successors to import African slaves and indentured workers from India to till 
the soil and, like their descendants today, stoop and strain to cut the thick, 
tough stalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyana's plantations are state-owned now, but because of mismanagement, 
supervision has been returned to Booker-Tate, the British company that once 
owned them. After decades of independence, Guyana remains as tied to sugar for 
foreign exchange as do the cutters for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar is still the backbone of this economy. Without it, Guyana is nothing," 
said Dean Ali, 56, who supervises 600 workers on La Bonne Intention, a 
23,000-acre estate seven miles east of Georgetown, the capital. Ali grew up in 
the sugar fields and became a manager with Booker-Tate in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 Life on a cane plantation has been much the same for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutters line up at the entrance before dawn, equipped with machetes and lunch 
bags of curried meat and rice. The supervisors stroll in from their comfortable 
houses, past the tennis courts built for them and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers crowd into the open backs of trucks that carry them to the fields, 
often miles away over bumpy trails that run along the canals. 
</P>
<P>
 There are snakes and fierce Africanized honeybees in the fields some days, and 
caimans emerge from the canals. The sun gets so hot that much of the best work 
is done before 9 a.m. Without missing a beat as they chop row after row, the 
men talk of making it north to better lives in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, they pile the cut stalks next to the canals. Other men 
load the cane onto pontoon boats and tractors pull the boats to the mill a 
dozen at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those at the gate one morning was Mooklall Ramuth, dirty-faced, wearing 
a yellow-and-red shirt, blue pants and dusty shoes. He and the others cut and 
clear the fields for the equivalent of about 25 cents an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always just thinking about finishing the cane," Ramuth said, sharpening 
his machete. "Every day, I feel very tired. Cutting work is very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramuth started cutting at age 15. He is 49 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Although their work is different, the bosses share Ramuth's obsession: "With 
sugar, you live it, you sleep it," said George Allen, an administrator at La 
Bonne Intention. "You're always thinking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the sugar goes to Britain as part of the 167,000-ton guaranteed annual 
sale to the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali said Booker-Tate had improved the lot of workers over the years, stopping 
the use of child labor and providing canvas bags of water so cutters do not 
have to drink from the canals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the drudgery remains. As a chicken hawk flew overhead, Ali watched the 
laborers from the back of a truck, chewing on a piece of cane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cane cutting is the toughest job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Sugar Cane," Trinidadian poet Faustin Charles says of the labor of 
cutting: 
</P>
<P>
 Cane is sweet sweat slain;  
</P>
<P>
 Cane is labor, unrecognized, lost  
</P>
<P>
 And unrecovered;  
</P>
<P>
 Sugar is the sweet swollen pain of the years;  
</P>
<P>
 Sugar is slavery's immovable stain;  
</P>
<P>
 Cane is water lying down,  
</P>
<P>
 And water standing up.  
</P>
<P>
 Cane is a slaver,  
</P>
<P>
 Cane is bitter,  
</P>
<P>
 Very bitter  
</P>
<P>
 In the sweet blood of life.

STUDY FINDS WETLANDS CAN SPEED EFFECT OF CARBON DIOXIDE ON GLOBAL WARMING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Marshes, rice paddies and other wetlands may amplify the global-warming effect 
of future increases of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, a study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists found that when salt marsh sites were subjected to twice the normal 
concentrations of carbon dioxide, they gave off elevated levels of 
methane.Methane has more warming potential than an equivalent amount of carbon 
dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in carbon dioxide stimulates more photosynthesis and buildup of 
carbon in the plants, and when the plants die and decompose, more methane is 
released into the air, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The work shows that carbon dioxide has an indirect impact on global warming as 
well as a direct one, researchers write in the July 7 issue of the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The work was done by researchers at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution 
in Woods Hole, Mass., the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center in 
Edgewater, Md., and Michigan State University's Kellogg Biological Station in 
Hickory Corners, Mich.

ARCHEOLOGISTS SEARCH HIGH FOR AIR DISASTER CLUES; AVIATION: CLUB MEMBERS GO 
THROUGH ARCHIVES AND COMB SITES TO LEARN THE DRAMA AND DETAILS OF CRASHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Hank Peterson and Doug Wyman were teen-agers in 1954, they were 
spellbound by the news of a spectacular airplane crash, the stuff movies are 
made of. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 45 hours to find the wreckage of the Northeast Airlines DC-3 in the 
mountains of New Hampshire that winter. There was death and survival, a heroic 
flight attendant, a cryptic radio message and a dramatic rescue by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, the two set out on what became a painstaking search for 
the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born the Aviation Archaeology Club of New Hampshire, one of only a 
few such clubs in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviation archeologists can be motivated by goals as lofty as looking for 
history or as mundane as escaping weekend yard chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence Webster, 47, of Shannock, R.I., a mechanical design engineer who 
calls himself "an aviation archeologist-lunatic," says New England has a 
smattering of such groups, some more formal than others. New Jersey, Virginia, 
North Carolina, Colorado and California all have a few groups and individuals 
who search for plane wreckage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some like to restore antique planes, others just like the recreation part of 
it," Webster said. Formal organizations are rare, though, he said. "The air 
museums and the industry like to avoid us because we're a reminder that people 
die when airplanes crash." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster has extensive computer files of New England crashes going back to the 
1908 crash of "an airship," probably a balloon, at a fair in Waterville, Me. 
The operator, C.O. Jones, was killed. His records indicate that the first 
airplane flight in New England produced the region's first crash, "a hard 
landing on ice" in Essex, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster, who also belongs to several Rhode Island and Connecticut aviation 
groups, is concentrating on restoring a World War II Navy Grumman Hellcat 
fighter that crashed off Martha's Vineyard in 1945 and was retrieved from the 
Atlantic last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few organized clubs is the Maine Aviation Historical Society, a 
nonprofit group whose objective is to chronicle "anything dealing with Maine 
and aviation, from postcards to restored airplanes," said Leo Boyle, president 
of the society. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Boyle of Westbrook, Me., has searched for evidence of L'Oiseau 
Blanc, the White Bird, a seaplane two Frenchmen set out to fly across the 
Atlantic from Paris to New York a few weeks before Charles Lindbergh made his 
historic New York-to-Paris solo flight in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle, 67, is convinced that the legendary plane, which Lindbergh himself 
called the "White Ghost," crashed in the mountains of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson and Wyman have a less scholarly bent. Their fascination with the 1954 
DC-3 crash 13 miles from the Berlin airport was rekindled periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'My God, it's still there!' " Peterson recalls telling Wyman once after 
seeing a picture of the wreckage in a newspaper anniversary story. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane crashed just below the summit of 3,570-foot Mt. Success. " 'Another 
100 feet and they would have made it,' " Wyman said. Two of the seven people 
aboard were killed; a flight attendant heroically tended to the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The two resolved to act one day in the early 1980s as they were returning home 
to Concord from a hike in the White Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Remember that DC-3 crash when we were kids on Mt. Success?,' " Wyman, 54, 
recalls asking. " 'Let's go find it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman, a police lieutenant at the time, spent days at the state library and 
state archives doing research. "It took us three or four trips and we couldn't 
find it," he said, although the wreckage was only 100 yards from a hiking 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined, they kept searching. Finally, with the help of a game warden, they 
found what they were looking for in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 31 serious crashes in New Hampshire recorded in various state and 
federal archives since the mid-1940s, the club's members have visited and 
inspected 18. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't bother with the accidents that were little more severe than rough 
landings in cow pastures," said Nick Wallner, 47, head of a travel agency 
branch in Concord and the club's historian and chief researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The club's work is recognized and cited by the state Aeronautics Commission. 
The four members (a fifth died last year) carry a letter from the agency asking 
landowners to allow them access. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have a wonderful time and are very helpful to us," said Rick 
Bolin, a commission inspector. Bolin said information the club has collected on 
crash sites has helped planes making air-to-ground searches ignore wreckage 
from previous crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Club members can describe details not only about the planes, but their pilots 
and passengers, their occupations, destinations, who was drunk or off-course, 
whose flying license had been suspended, which plane was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 They can tell a heart-rending story of three men who died on Mt. Kearsarge 
after their plane crashed on Aug. 19, 1960. The pilot was found in the wreck; a 
second victim was found 70 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 The third, Oliver Newcomb, was found along a brook more than a mile away. He 
had fashioned a small flag from his shirt to mark the spot and left a farewell 
message to his family on the back of a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ralph Miller and Dr. Robert Quinn, whose plane crashed on Feb. 21, 1959, 
in a snowstorm in Lincoln, survived for four days in subzero weather. They 
wrote messages on the plane's upholstery. They tried to get out of the 
wilderness on makeshift snowshoes and managed to build a campfire before they 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with topographical maps and compasses, finding wrecks can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frustrating searches was in Waterville Valley, Wallner said. 
"We found it literally when I stepped onto the tire. I've been back four times 
and know the exact heading -- 143 degrees off Jennings Peak -- and I haven't 
been able to find it again. If you're off by five yards, you can miss it 
because the terrain is so overgrown." 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the club is trying to get a $400 GPS (global positioning 
satellite) finder that can find any spot on Earth within 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallner compares the club's work to searching for sunken treasure in the 
ocean, "except that ours is two-dimensional and a lot less expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Lost treasure is part of the lore of the Parker Mountain crash of an amphibian 
Grumman in Center Strafford on May 6, 1946, that took the lives of three 
people, including a Columbus, Ohio, industrialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supposedly the plane had a box of jewels on it, and when that rumor got out, 
everybody from Rochester and Center Strafford went up that mountain looking for 
those jewels," Wyman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course there was no jewel box, which later was found in a safe in a New 
York City hotel."

RESTAURANT, IN REVERSAL, REFUNDS DEPOSIT AFTER BRIDE-TO-BE DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A restaurant owner refused to refund a $1,500 deposit even though a wedding 
was canceled because the bride-to-be died. The restauranteur changed his mind 
after the story appeared in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally apologize for any lack of timeliness in the decision that was 
made," Mark Haseltine wrote Thursday in a letter to Daniel Barretto. 
</P>
<P>
 Barretto's fiancee, Nancy Ogrodowczyk, died in April after suffering an asthma 
attack. The couple were to be married on Aug. 13 and had made the deposit at 
Haseltine's restaurant, Levi Lowell's Restaurant. It was there he had proposed 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 His apology came after Barretto complained to at least two newspapers, which 
published his story. 
</P>
<P>
 Haseltine called the complaint premature, although he had earlier written a 
letter to Ogrodowczyk's estate calling the deposit "totally non-refundable as 
stipulated in the contract." He had also written that he would consider 
refunding part of the deposit if he could book a function similar in size and 
cost for the date. 
</P>
<P>
 Barretto, 31, had set up a scholarship in his fiancee's name at Souhegan High 
School, where she had taught for about a year. Teachers and students sent a 
petition to Haseltine criticizing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer and disc jockey hired by the couple for their wedding 
returned deposits so they could be used for the fund.

DOCTOR'S 20-YEAR-OLD DREAM BLOSSOMS INTO SOUTH BRONX CLINIC; MEDICINE: THE 
SPANISH-SPEAKING STAFF AT SAN JUAN HEALTH CENTER REACHES OUT TO THE COMMUNITY. 
THE FOCUS IS ON PERSONAL CARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH J. HARPAZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an abandoned building in the South Bronx filled with needles, garbage and 
broken pipes gushing gallons of water, Dr. Richard Izquierdo hatched a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He imagined a clinic where doctors, like their Puerto Rican patients, would 
speak Spanish. Where poor people -- just like middle-class people -- would see 
the same doctor every time they needed treatment and could call for advice 24 
hours a day. Where no one would be turned away, and where everyone who walked 
in off the street for a rash or a cough would walk out with a plan for better 
health. And where the doors would stay open -- no matter how bombed out the 
neighborhood got. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too dumb to know that it couldn't happen, so I did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Izquierdo, 64, bought the building in 1968 with $3,000 in borrowed money, and 
a year later he opened the San Juan Health Center with a group of 
private-practice doctors. But within a few years he realized that a dozen solo 
practitioners could not provide the comprehensive care he envisioned. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the San Juan Health Center celebrates its 20th birthday as a 
nonprofit clinic. With 15,000 registered patients, 72,000 patient visits a 
year, and 20 to 30 new patients each day, it has become one of the largest 
independent clinics in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The doors open at 6:30 a.m. New patients are sent off for the nutritional and 
social service screening provided to everyone. Regular patients wait to be 
called for appointments for diabetes, hypertension, asthma and other common 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I would do if I didn't come here," said Deborah Rivers as 
her 13-month-old, Shavona, was given a tuberculosis test. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jenkins brings her 3-year-old and 7-month-old sons for checkups. "You see 
the same doctors. That's why I like it. Somebody is looking at your chart who's 
familiar with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do the doctors speak Spanish, but the nutritionists also plan their 
dietary recommendations around traditional Spanish food. 
</P>
<P>
 "We laugh and cry in the language of our patients," said Izquierdo. 
</P>
<P>
 There are programs for AIDS, tuberculosis and prenatal care; off-site clinics 
in a local high school, drug rehab center and a homeless shelter; and special 
sessions for adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day of the adolescent session was an eye-opener," Izquierdo 
recalled. "There were a half-dozen teen-agers. Three were pregnant and four 
tested positive for TB." 
</P>
<P>
 And when a state institution for the retarded closed in 1988 and placed its 
clients in group homes, the clinic agreed to help. "Today we are the largest 
health-care provider to mentally retarded in the Bronx, with 800 patients," 
Izquierdo said. 
</P>
<P>
 But health care is only part of what the clinic provides. There's a Halloween 
parade, ceremonies honoring teen-agers for academic achievement, a newsletter 
that lists patient birthdays, and volunteer work that helps both the clinic and 
the person doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm building job skills, and I've learned a lot about computers," said 
volunteer Bernice Perez, 38, as she handed a stack of papers to an 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Rivera, 15, who has been a patient at the clinic since she was born, 
worked there last summer and now wants to go to medical school. "They inspired 
me," she said. "They treat you like a friend instead of a patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Acklema Mohammad was a teen-ager when she began working part time for 
Izquierdo; now she is head of pediatrics. And the director of external affairs, 
Rosemarie Longo, was Izquierdo's patient as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic is an economic Rock of Gibraltar in an area that was once a 
burnt-out moonscape overrun with pushers and hookers. When it first opened, it 
had but a few dozen patients a day, most of them "bums," as one administrator 
put it. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the Hunts Point area where the clinic is located is making a comeback. 
Women push strollers on every corner, and shops and restaurants bustle along 
Southern Boulevard, the main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "The health problems of this community don't only stem from disease," said 
Paloma Hernandez, Izquierdo's daughter and the clinic's executive director. "So 
we have to be committed to improving the whole socioeconomic status of the 
community. We're part of the infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 Every inch of the clinic's 16,000 square feet is crammed with tiny offices, 
examining rooms, waiting areas and equipment. There are 113 people on staff, 
including 15 doctors, plus another dozen consulting specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 The $5-million budget is mostly paid for by Medicaid reimbursement, but 
foundation grants are being sought to fund the purchase of a nearby vacant lot 
where a much larger facility could be built. Izquierdo's latest goal is to 
double his space and his patient load, and even perhaps open a birthing center 
and a food pantry. 
</P>
<P>
 He can hardly believe that his original vision ever came to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started all of this?" he said, looking around. "I can't believe it, that it 
was once just a dream in my head."

INMATE DOESN'T LET BARS KEEP HIM FROM LEARNING TO BE A BETTER PARENT; PRISON: 
SERVING A LIFE SENTENCE, ARTHUR HAMILTON JR. IS MORE INVOLVED WITH HIS KIDS 
THAN EVER BEFORE. HE WANTS TO TEACH OTHERS THE SAME SKILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Hamilton Jr. is haunted by the harsh memories of his youth: beatings by 
his alcoholic father, fighting with rats for food in his infested home, the 
murder of his drug-addicted brother. 
</P>
<P>
 He is determined to give his own children a better life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an enormous challenge. He is separated from his children by a 
barbed-wire fence and a 37- to 65-year prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my cell one night, I began thinking of all the negative things I'd done 
and how I wanted to pay society back. But even more than that, how I wanted to 
make it up to my children," Hamilton said at the Lakeland Correctional 
Facility, where he is in the 12th year of his sentence for armed robbery and 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 So, 2 1/2 years ago, Hamilton began writing. Late last year, his book, "Father 
Behind Bars," was published. It is a searing look at life in prison and how 
Hamilton wound up there. 
</P>
<P>
 But its ultimate message is one of hope. It stems from Hamilton's 
determination to turn his life around, educate himself and help his two 
troubled children escape a life he feared would lead them down the same 
self-destructive path he took as a youth in Detroit's ghettos. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has turned the book's message into a prison program for fathers, 
teaching them how they can overcome the obvious barriers and become better 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes Fathers Behind Bars Inc., a support group he began in 1992, will 
someday be a fixture at every prison in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up in an environment where I saw entire families wiped out, mothers 
whose five sons are dead through guns and dope," said Hamilton, 36, a large man 
with a shy smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The African-American community is committing self-genocide; we have to wake 
up and put the family unit back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's book, co-written by William Banks and with a foreword by actor 
Danny Glover, has sold 10,000 copies and is in its second printing, said 
publisher W. R. Spence. 
</P>
<P>
 The little money Hamilton will earn will be put into trusts for his children. 
If he makes more than a few thousand dollars, the state Department of 
Corrections likely will go after it to help pay his room and board. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton says he has received hundreds of letters from inmates and prison 
officials nationwide in response to his book and his work on behalf of 
incarcerated fathers. He beams with pride as he speaks of how his children and 
stepchildren have brought their father's book to school to show their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton says he felt like a failure from the moment he became a father. His 
first child was born in 1978 when he was 20; he was serving his first of three 
prison terms, a two-year sentence for attempted unarmed robbery, the only crime 
for which Hamilton insists he was wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got out, he married his daughter's mother. He tried to find work but 
was repeatedly laid off. Finally, he resorted to robbing a fast-food restaurant 
with a gun he says was unloaded. He was sent back to prison for another two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was released in 1981, Hamilton and his wife had a baby boy and he 
tried again to find work. Too proud to go on welfare, he gave up and robbed 
another fast-food restaurant, again with what he says was an unloaded gun. 
</P>
<P>
 He was again convicted of armed robbery but escaped while being transferred. 
He fled Detroit and, while working at a video arcade, fatally shot an alleged 
drug dealer Hamilton says had threatened him. He was convicted of manslaughter 
and began serving what in the prison system is considered a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when he began turning his life around. 
</P>
<P>
 During his current stretch, Hamilton has earned an associate's degree and 
become an award-winning prison newspaper editor. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife divorced in 1992. He fell in love with a fellow inmate's 
sister and began forging a relationship with her three children. She bought him 
a typewriter and encouraged him to write his book; they married later that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 And from behind bars, he fought his ex-wife in court when he heard that drugs 
were being used in her home and that their two children were being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibility that one of my own children could join me in prison was too 
much to stand," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton's ex-wife was charged with neglect and their daughter, now 15, was 
placed in the custody of the state Department of Social Services. Hamilton and 
his new wife, Marilyn, have temporary custody of his 13-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton says he speaks with his children and stepchildren by phone almost 
daily and they are excelling in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been great," said Hamilton's stepson, Michael Brown, 17 and a senior at 
Niles High School. "He's always there to listen to our problems and he's been 
helping me set goals for the future." Michael plans to attend Central Michigan 
University this fall and eventually medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriet E. Harris, the Wayne County Juvenile Court referee who handled the 
neglect cases of Hamilton's children, said it is unusual for a father in prison 
to take such an active role with his children. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents don't even choose to come (to court hearings) if they're 
incarcerated. They figure there's not much they can do anyway," Harris said. 
"That's what makes his case, his deep involvement in his children's future, so 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeland Deputy Warden Bob Collins figures Hamilton has served as a role model 
for more than 100 inmates at the medium-security prison since he arrived eight 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he's sincere," said Collins, who has read the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Spence, who heads WRS Publishing in Waco, Tex., has been writing and calling 
prison officials trying to win Hamilton's early release. He has even offered 
Hamilton a job on the lecture circuit. Hamilton says he would like nothing 
better than to take his message about the importance of family, of nurturing 
children, to cities across America.

 Excerpts from Arthur Hamilton Jr.'s book:  
</P>
<P>
 "Was the beginning (of Hamilton's road to prison) when my brother Greg and I 
put phony money in the collection plate at church so that we would have money 
to buy candy? Was it when I pulled my first armed robbery? Was it when I killed 
the man who sold little children drugs? No, by those times, and at the stages 
of crime, I had already fallen by the proverbial wayside and was already headed 
toward this hell. The beginning for me was when my father finally mentally 
pounded out of me any sense of self-worth or sense of caring for other people." 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked into a McDonald's, introduced myself politely as a bandit who wanted 
to be taken seriously, and demanded money. I got it and before I left I 
couldn't help but say to the manager whose hands were high in the air: 'This is 
for my kids.' . . . It was nowhere near Christmas but I was playing Santa 
Claus. Toys, gifts and most of all food, food that my son, who was not even a 
year old, had never eaten -- food to make him grow. I also got them clothes and 
took them out a few places. I don't think I spent a dime on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys from broken homes have always found their way to prison, but the guys I 
saw coming through in the '80s were a different breed. They were getting 
meaner. . . . More of them came not just from second- and third-generation 
welfare homes, but from second-, third- and fourth-generation criminal homes -- 
i.e., homes where parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents had been 
incarcerated for serious crimes. . . . What worried me most was that my kids 
were becoming part of the same trend."

WALTER A. FAIRSERVIS; ARCHEOLOGIST FOUND ANCIENT LOST CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walter A. Fairservis Jr., 73, a pioneering archeologist credited with locating 
and exploring lost cities, some previously known only through legend. 
Fairservis joined the American Museum of Natural History in New York in 
1941.After World War II, he went on to become a staff archeologist at the 
museum and in 1949 led the first American archeological expedition to 
Afghanistan, where he and two colleagues found the ruins of a long-forgotten 
imperial city. He led a team to Pakistan in 1960 and discovered a ceremonial 
complex that shed light on the prehistoric inhabitants of the region. During 
World War II, Fairservis served on Gen. Douglas A. MacArthur's staff in Japan 
as a member of Army intelligence. Fairservis said he wrote so many books he 
could not remember them all. They include "The Roots of Ancient India" in 1969, 
"The Ancient Kingdoms of the Nile and the Doomed Monuments of Nubia" in 1962 
and "The Archeology of the Southern Gobi -- Mongolia" in 1993. In Sharon, Conn. 
on Tuesday.

DANA PARSONS: SIGHTS, SOUNDS AND SMELLS OF FAIR LEAVE SENSES SPINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I went over to the fair about 7:30 Friday to watch it slip into its night 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever it wears during the day, a county fair doesn't really become 
enchanting until the evening approaches. The magic of a fair is in transforming 
real life into something a little bit mysterious, a little bit sinister, a 
little bit dangerous . . . and yet all the while sending out sweet echoes of 
safer, happier times. 
</P>
<P>
 What an illusion. And what better time to practice sleight of hand than as 
light gives way to darkness? Now you see it, now you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next song we're going to do for you was made famous by Mr. Johnny Mathis 
-- 'Misty,' " the balladeer in the black dress said from the bandstand. The 
Armando Blais Orchestra began to play behind her, and the songstress purred, 
"Look at me. I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 If you tried, you could easily pretend it was the late '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 I set off on my meanderings, buffeted by the smell of hamburger competing with 
the smell of fish. The wind direction favored the fish, perhaps explaining why 
the line was longer at that stand. I wondered if it was just a coincidence that 
the pigs and cows are kept far, far away from signs offering "Hot Dog on a 
Stick." 
</P>
<P>
 A banner announced "The Magical World of Dancing Horses," but the show had 
been at 6 and I missed it. Even so, I fixed on the image of dancing horses, and 
it evoked memories of bygone days, tempered only slightly by the presence of a 
bank of automated teller machines next to the barn. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't especially hungry but went into an old-style building with a buffet 
line. I got some chicken, corn on the cob, a roll and lemonade for $3.95. From 
my seat next to a screened window, I could look out onto the midway and see the 
essence of the fair: a Ferris wheel, a sign that said "Fresh Roasted Corn" and 
another that said "Shoot a Basket, Win a Bear." 
</P>
<P>
 If you were quiet, you could hear in the distance the pop of balloons, either 
by darts or by the water pistols that filled them to the bursting point. You 
could hear the bark of the carnival workers -- that ageless sound of them 
enticing youngsters and old-timers into their lairs. At the same time, a soft 
breeze blew in through the window screen, and it struck me how much a sensory 
barrage a fair is: It bombards your eyes, your nose and your ears in seemingly 
equal measure. 
</P>
<P>
 I hit the midway, walking the pitchmen's gauntlet. "Excuse me, can I show 
you?" one said, explaining his game. "No obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 Another was luring people to win a prize by tossing a dime and making it land 
on any of the rows of plates clustered in the booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many people win on a typical night?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 30," he said. The prizes are either Pink Panther, Bugs Bunny or 
Tasmanian Devil stuffed animals. I asked how many dimes he collects every 
night, but he said he didn't know. I asked where he'd be next week, and he said 
Turlock, in Northern California. Before Orange County, he said, it was Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The people working the booths are the soul of the fair. They persuade us that 
knocking over three bottles with a baseball will bring us fulfillment. "Need a 
ballplayer here!" they cry, and once and future ballplayers reach for their 
wallets. For only two bucks, why not take a shot at gratification? Gimme your 
money, I'll give you happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder, did Jerry Falwell start this way? 
</P>
<P>
 Screams came from the far end of the midway, so I headed in that direction. A 
ride called "Top Spin" created a great visual against the night sky. The ride 
is set up with what looks like two rows of theater seats, so once it starts 
turning riders upside down and up and down, it looks like those newsreel shots 
of people watching a horror movie. 
</P>
<P>
 A thumbs up to whoever devised it. 
</P>
<P>
 I stopped to watch men and boys try to ring the bell with the sledgehammer in 
the age-old test of strength. Few contestants were up to the task. Because I 
was there by myself with no one to impress, I saw no reason to prove that I 
was, indeed, the strongest man at the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm kind of disappointed that things like the Fat Lady and the Bearded Lady 
aren't around anymore. I love the image of turning the corner in a secret 
chamber and seeing the World's Ugliest Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I plunked down 50 cents each for a look at the World's Largest Horse 
and the World's Biggest Steer. Only later did I notice that they put a question 
mark after Horse, so maybe he isn't the largest after all. In the steer's pen, 
a man leaned against the railing staring at the steer, seemingly transfixed. I 
didn't have the courage to ask about his ruminations on a 3,250-pound steer. 
</P>
<P>
 By 10:30, my feet were sore, so I headed for my car. I imagined the carnival 
workers packing up their traveling show of scary rides and barking carnies and 
stuffed animals and moving on to create their illusions all over again 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the carnival stays a bit ragged around the edges. We need more 
throwbacks like this, not fewer. Maybe by next year, they'll find a Bearded 
Lady. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people think fairs are passe. All I know is that when I finally got to my 
car some three blocks away, I was glad I could still see the Ferris wheel 
churning in the distance.

SCOTT HARRIS: LITTLE BARBS OVER SLUR ABOUT BAKERSFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There I was, just minding my own business and watching the World Cup in a fern 
bar packed with noisy Brazilians. I was sipping on something called "a Rio 
Rhumba" when I felt a tug on my pants cuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to hide me!" a small voice said. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked down and was delighted to see my old friend and confidante Deputy 
Mayor Barbie. She was out of breath. But as always, her clothes were perfect, 
and every strand of blond hair was in place. Mayor Riordan's most important 
aide -- she joined his office as a pay-back for Riordan's work with the Mattel 
Corp. -- seemed pleased to see me. 
</P>
<P>
 So pleased, in fact, that she scurried up my shin, pulled herself up my 
necktie and then flung herself toward my face. Her tiny hands put a death grip 
on my nostrils. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eeeeeeyyyooooowwww!!!" I said, no longer delighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to hide me!" she repeated. There was desperation in her baby 
blues. "It's my cousin! She's going to kill me!" 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, there was the loud blast of gunfire. Everybody jumped, except for 
Deputy Mayor Barbie, who swung from my nostrils into a back flip with a full 
twist, diving expertly into the interior breast pocket of my sport coat. 
</P>
<P>
 There was silence and the aroma of burnt gunpowder. Only then did I notice the 
source of the commotion -- a tiny yet leggy woman standing just inside the 
doorway. Minuscule six-shooters were pointed toward the heavens. Bits of 
acoustic ceiling fell like snowflakes. She stared us down as she twirled and 
holstered her revolvers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call me Bakersfield Barbie!" she announced. "Y'all got a problem with 
that?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians didn't, so long as she didn't shoot the TV. I feigned interest 
in the game, but couldn't resist an occasional glance toward the new gal in 
town. The resemblance was striking. They looked more alike than those cousins 
on the old Patty Duke show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barbie I know prefers pepper spray to pistols. And she shops at 
Nieman-Marcus, not Howard and Phil's. Never before had I seen a pink Stetson, 
pink cowboy boots and a pink holster. "BARB," the buckle declared. 
</P>
<P>
 It dawned on me why Bakersfield Barbie was so steamed. She must have figured 
out that her cousin was the real culprit in Mayor Riordan's unkind verbal barbs 
on Bakersfield. The mayor, you may recall, recently spent the longest 3 1/2 
hours of his life touring the Gateway to that other Valley, the San Joaquin. 
This peace mission was his way of making amends for proclaiming "Bakersfield is 
boring" in a radio interview in February. Riordan managed to get in a few more 
rips on his visit. When civic boosters gave him subscriptions to the local 
magazine and newspaper, Riordan said he would read them "every night when I 
have insomnia." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, Bakersfield Barbie must have realized something I knew all along. 
Riordan wasn't doing this on his own. The Deputy Mayor for Damage Control was 
coaching him. And why shouldn't she? If you're an Angeleno, it's good to be 
reminded that things could be worse. The City of Angels has its flaws -- 
earthquakes, riots, fires, crime and such -- but at least it's not Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, handsome," Bakersfield Barbie said. 
</P>
<P>
 What can I say? She noticed me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy me a drink, big boy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Before I knew it, she was sitting on my lap. Are all Bakersfield women this 
fast? Inside my sport coat, Deputy Mayor Barbie trembled with fear. Bakersfield 
Barbie noticed the flutter of my jacket -- but maybe she would just think it 
was the pounding of my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, she drew her guns. She pointed one at the bulge in my sport coat and 
one between my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, handsome, who put those little paw prints on your nose?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is that my cousin in your pocket? Or are you just glad to see me?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Barbie climbed out of my sport coat and met her cousin's cold 
stare. Neither one of them blinked.  
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, cuz," my old friend said. "Admit it. I did your hometown a favor. It 
needs the publicity. When's the last time people in L.A. really thought 
seriously about moving to Bakersfield? Seattle, yes. Oregon, sure. Good God, 
people even go to Vegas. But Bakersfield ? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bashing that place is a win-win proposition. It's good for L.A. It's good for 
Bakersfield." 
</P>
<P>
 She can really turn it on when she needs to. Deputy Mayor Barbie has that 
big-city confidence. She can roll with the punches. Bakersfield Barbie is a 
small-town girl whose feelings are easily hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 She holstered her guns. "Come on," I said, lifting them to the bar, "let me 
buy each of you little ladies a drink." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield Barbie pouted. "I've got to go. Cowboy Ken is waiting for me." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, she grabbed the umbrella from my Rio Rhumba and leaped from the 
bar, floating down like Mary Poppins. "Bye, cuz," she said as she floated to 
the floor. Then she looked at me. "See ya later, handsome." 
</P>
<P>
 We watched her zigzag past the dancing Brazilians and out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're shameless," I said. "A win-win proposition?" 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy mayor shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really a lot like Bakersfield," she said. "Nice enough . . . and a bit 
slow."

ENVIRONMENT: NOTES ABOUT YOUR SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea Tours--It's been a busy summer at the Orange County Marine Institute in 
Dana Point, which has built a number of new programs around its new 70-foot 
research vessel, the R/V Sea Explorer. Among the weekly offerings: 
</P>
<P>
 * An "underwater interactive audio-video cruise," in which visitors are able 
to use the newest underwater communications technologies to interact with 
Marine Institute divers as they explore reefs and kelp forests (Saturdays, 9:30 
a.m. to 12:30 p.m., $22 for adults and $16 for children 12 and under). 
</P>
<P>
 * A bioluminescence night cruise, which explores the ocean animals active at 
night, including glowing plankton, fish and worms (Saturdays, 8:30 to 11 p.m., 
$22 for adults and $16 for children 12 and under). 
</P>
<P>
 * The marine wildlife dusk cruise, an exploration of life just beyond the 
waves. Special equipment is used to collect and observe microscopic plankton, 
ocean floor sediment and bottom-dwelling animals (Fridays, 7 to 10 p.m. and 
Saturdays, 5 to 8 p.m., $22 for adults and $16 for children 12 and under). 
</P>
<P>
 * The harbor eco-tour, a 1 1/2-hour excursion that introduces visitors to 
harbor marine life and local maritime history (Thursday, 7 to 8:30 p.m. and 
Sundays, 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., $6 for adults and $4 for children 12 and 
under). 
</P>
<P>
 Another new program, one that stays on land, is called a beachcomber's guide 
to the marine life refuge. Participants will join marine biologists as they 
sort through the natural clues left by the day's waves and tides and learn more 
about the life just beyond the waves. This program runs on Sundays, with times 
determined by the tides. (Cost is $6 for adults and $4 for children 12 and 
under.) 
</P>
<P>
 Several additional programs are held aboard the tall ship Pilgrim, moored at 
the institute. These include a free open house, held Friday through Sunday from 
noon to 4 p.m. Educational displays and a gift shop are housed in the main 
institute building, and tide pools are open to the public in the adjacent 
marine life refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fee programs can sell out, so reservations are recommended. The marine 
institute is at 24200 Dana Point Harbor Drive in Dana Point. For information, 
call (714) 496-2274.

HEIGHTENED SECURITY IS NEEDED AGAINST NEW HIGH-TECH THIEVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Northridge woman wasn't particularly concerned when the cellular telephone 
bill arrived with the thickness of something not unlike the first step in a 
complicated Internal Revenue Service audit. Advertisements, she thought; maybe 
a few pages of calling plans in which she would have no interest. Perhaps you 
can imagine her considerable chagrin when she instead found eight pages of 
telephone calls she had never made, to numbers she had never seen before, and 
to all manner of area codes, the locations of which she could only guess at. 
The bill was for nearly $400. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't have to pay it. At most, her inconveniences were confined to the 
first few hours of shock -- perhaps horror -- at the bill, and to the annoyance 
associated with acquiring a new telephone number that had to be memorized and 
then passed on to business associates, family and friends. The larger questions 
involve who made the calls, toward what end, and the ease with which the fraud 
was perpetrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider it one of the parasitic accompaniments to advanced technology. Your 
connections to systems designed to make life easier also open many new avenues 
for fraud and abuse. Times were, for example, that you only had to worry about 
making withdrawals from automated teller machines during late night hours, in 
poorly lit or obscure locations, and when suspicious types were lurking nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we're told that the U.S. Secret Service is investigating a sophisticated 
ring of thieves that has been operating in the San Fernando Valley and other 
parts of Southern California. Using a video camera and a long distance lens, or 
binoculars, they will record, from a safe distance, the finger movements that 
reveal the ATM user's personal identification numbers and the time of the 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, according to Times reporter Tim Williams, they will rummage through 
discarded receipts left carelessly at the scene. When they have a match, they 
can use a personal computer to withdraw money from your account at whatever 
daily rate that account will bear. The less greedy of these types of thieves 
will use the same techniques to siphon off small amounts at barely noticeable 
rates over a longer stretch of time. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular problem is dealt with relative ease: always stand close enough 
to the machine to block it from view as you access your account; never leave 
the receipt sitting at the machine or stuffed whole into the ATM's waste 
container; always record the transaction in your checkbook and quickly alert 
the bank to any discrepancies in your balance. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called "shoulder surfers" use the same techniques of observation and guile 
at rows of frequently used pay phones such as those found at the local mall or 
airports. It's all in the hopes of catching a glimpse of the numbers involved 
in your next telephone credit card or long-distance or local telephone card 
number. Once gained, it is quickly transmitted to colleagues for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 To guard against this type of telephone fraud, you can use the same shielding 
techniques we mentioned for automated bank teller machines. You can also throw 
in a more careful look at your monthly telephone bill for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phone fraud is a much more difficult matter. According to a seminal 
article in Scientific American by staff writer Paul Wallich, "Every cellular 
telephone call begins with a broadcast of the telephone's serial number and 
billing number," Wallich wrote in March. "Unfortunately, these numbers are also 
the only information a thief needs to impersonate a legitimate caller." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the annals of suspected thieves of computer software and data from 
several leading cellular telephone manufacturers, few are as notorious as the 
San Fernando Valley's own Kevin Mitnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick apparently cut his teeth in these matters by breaking into the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's main computers while he was still a student 
at Monroe High School in North Hills. Before pleading guilty to one computer 
crime and serving a year each in prison and at a residential treatment program, 
Mitnick broke into a North American Air Defense Command computer at Cheyenne 
Mountain in Colorado Springs, and tapped into the electronic mail of computer 
security officials at MCI Communications and Digital Equipment. Mitnick is even 
suspected of having managed to wiretap the FBI agents who are looking for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitnick has been the subject of an FBI manhunt for more than a year and a 
half. He is a suspect in the theft of software that can be used for the 
handling of billing information, determining the location of a caller, and for 
scrambling wireless telephone calls to keep them private. As some experts have 
concluded, the theft of such products could even make future cellular phone 
networks vulnerable -- even as their manufacturers claim to have reached new 
levels of protection and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the general ease with which such piracy is effected on everything from 
bank machines to giant corporations and government agencies that speaks to the 
need for heightened efforts at security in such matters. We have come to quite 
a pass in this society when we all need to huddle guardedly in front of bank 
machines and pay phones like spies making information drops.

A PIPELINE TO THE FACTS; DON'T BASE DECISION ON PROPOSED LINE ON FLAWED DATA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has put off a vote on a resolution to oppose an oil 
pipeline that would run from Santa Barbara and Ventura counties to Los Angeles 
area refineries. The decision to delay a vote will allow talks between Burbank 
Fire Chief Mike Davis and representatives of Pacific Pipelines Inc., which has 
proposed the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles already has passed a resolution opposing the project, 
and the city of Glendale is considering a similar action. The final decision 
will be made by the state Public Utilities Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not here to pass judgment on whether this pipeline should be built, nor 
on whether this particular route is better or worse than any other. We are 
concerned, however, at the statements that have been made by various local 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 To whit: the concerns expressed over a possible repeat of the 
earthquake-related break of an old pipeline that resulted in a fire that 
destroyed three homes and 17 vehicles in Mission Hills. And there were the 
comments of Fire Chief Davis, who said: "If the crude oil was transported by 
ship or ground tanker, the danger would not be so high." 
</P>
<P>
 First, the pipeline that ruptured during the Northridge quake was one of the 
state's oldest, built in 1925 using acetylene welds that are antiquated by 
today's standards. Modern pipelines are built to much tougher specifications 
and include flexible segments to better withstand ground movements. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the idea that deep water tankers or ground transportation are safer 
is absurd in the extreme. Tankers are to be considered the carriers of last 
resort whenever people have good reason to suspect the slightest chance of oil 
washing up on their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the tremendous volume of our region's crude oil needs suggests that 
the number of trucks needed would place an inordinate burden on our already 
clogged roads and freeways. The decision on whether to build this pipeline is 
months away, but it should not be based on fears of dated technology and badly 
flawed information.

CITY BREAKS PROMISE TO CLOSE LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When will the City of Los Angeles ever keep its word to its citizens? 
</P>
<P>
 The latest step by the members of the Board of Public Works instructing the 
Bureau of Sanitation to make plans to keep the Lopez Canyon Landfill open 
beyond the current closure date of February, 1996, is a violation of the 
conditional use permit granted in 1991 for a period of five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Lake View Terrace and Kagel Canyon, who have borne out the brunt 
of this massive monster of garbage for 20 years, were promised in 1991 that 
this dump would shut down forever in 1996, and now the city is reneging on that 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Sanitation has consistently deceived residents of the affected 
areas and produced misleading and erroneous statistics regarding costs and 
operational failures at the dump site. It appears that the Los Angeles 
newspapers have accepted the bureau's handouts as being true representations of 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 What is needed is determination to insist that the city recognize the closure 
date and actively pursue alternative measures such as rail haul before other 
cities get the benefits of cost negotiations and L.A. is left with little or no 
alternative in desperate circumstances in later years.

REAL ESTATE BECOMING A DANGEROUS PROFESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have been a licensed real estate broker for 17 years, and it was with horror 
that I read about the abduction of the Val Verde agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Increased visibility in the market has made the female real estate agent more 
of a target for weirdos.Even though the industry has addressed the issues of 
safety from time to time, not one person, company or association has taken the 
proactive step of declaring a direct change of policy to insure their agents' 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, most offices only suggest prudent conduct. It should become mandatory 
that new clients must first come to the office and register upon meeting the 
agent. The client's driver's license should be kept on file. A telephone number 
should be verified. A colleague or member of the management team should 
accompany their agents while showing vacant homes or remote properties. 
Advertising that mentions that a home is unoccupied should not be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Open houses have been problematic for many years. They present a chance for 
the wrong people to enter a home freely for the wrong reasons. Numerous 
burglaries have been reported where one party gets the real estate agent's 
attention and another searches for valuables. They have also been the sites of 
attacks and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 How long can the real estate industry ignore this danger before some one has 
the courage to affect much needed procedural changes to limit their agents 
risk?

AD SIGNS AN EYESORE ON PUBLIC PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that graffiti vandalism seems to be slowing down somewhat in the Valley, 
perhaps it is time for action against the private signs being posted on 
city-owned trees, parkways, utility poles and other public property. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of brash advertising is just as illegal and unsightly as graffiti 
ever was.Everything from yard sales to real estate to antiques to gym 
memberships to dancing classes is being promoted this way. This is especially 
true on weekends near busy intersections. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of uncaring activity uses public property for private gain. And we 
the taxpayers must foot the bill for cleaning up, just as we must to erase 
graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 We citizens should pull down these advertising eyesores and deposit them in 
the nearest trash container. Furthermore, we should report repeat offenders to 
our city council member's office and let the law take its course.

SYBERT EXPLOITS IMMIGRATION ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Sybert's "three-pronged" approach to immigration reform (Valley 
Commentary, June 26) puts him clearly in the forefront of candidates with 
questionable records who have chosen to exploit this issue for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Without addressing at length the dubious originality of his first "prong" 
aimed at stemming the tide of illegal immigration (which looks very much like 
the hard fought agenda of his opponent, Rep. Anthony Beilenson), I would only 
like to point out that Sybert was until recently a member of Gov. Wilson's 
administration that did nothing while the problem escalated at breakneck speed 
to the crisis it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 But with regard to his other two "prongs," I was nothing less than revulsed by 
his elitist perspective on legal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 First, while it makes for good scapegoating for our economic woes, it is 
patently untrue (as many sociological studies demonstrate) that today's legally 
admitted immigrants are poorer and less educated than in past generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, Sybert's implication that "family unification" as a basis for 
admission to the United States should somehow be valid only when the proper 
work skills are possessed by the family member is cruel, especially when one 
considers that many of those qualifying under this program are either elderly 
or children. 
</P>
<P>
 But most troublesome, indeed frightening, is his suggestion that a "social" 
solution would be to prohibit all but English on our radios and televisions! I 
feel compelled to point out to this candidate for Congress that he is 
suggesting we change the First Amendment! 
</P>
<P>
 All of this sadly underscores Mr. Sybert's failure to distinguish between 
legal versus illegal immigration. A majority of undocumented heads of household 
consider their stay here as temporary and do nothing to assimilate. But legal 
immigrants are committed to becoming "real Americans" and are typically the 
most staunchly enculturated and on the whole learn English at record speed ... 
without tinkering with our most precious Bill of Rights.

<P>
 Thanks to the many workers who spent much energy and time away from their 
families to rebuild the Antelope Valley and Golden State freeway overpasses. I 
watched the progress daily, and their efforts are to be commended, especially 
through the rain and heat. It is a job quickly well done, and I appreciate 
their making my drive to and from work easier.

LOSS OF OAKS MORE SERIOUS THAN IT SEEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The removal of 1,800 oak trees from Sunshine Canyon is an environmental 
catastrophe, not unlike the continual destruction wrought upon the rain 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is yet hard for people here to grasp how the destruction of forests 
in other countries affects them.Does the rain forest really contribute 
something like a quarter of the global oxygen supply to all of us? Does it 
really affect the climate? 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution of 1,800 oak trees to our immediate environment may be easier 
to grasp. While we still do not fully understand the interrelationship of all 
life, we do know that a good sized oak on a warm day emits about 150 gallons of 
water, hence that lovely, cool air beneath a grove of oaks or even in the shade 
of one. 
</P>

 One hundred fifty gallons times 1,800 oak trees equals 270,000 gallons of 
water returned to the atmosphere daily. Multiply this by the days in a year and 
you have 98,550,000 gallons of water. My adding machine cannot go any higher 
but just try to imagine the lifetime contribution of that grove of lovely oaks 
to our local environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Now consider how many times this kind of environmental disaster occurs, how 
many counties, states, countries and continents allow and even encourage it, 
how many individuals and private corporations do it illegally -- and imagine, 
if you will, how long we can possibly have a sustainable future. 
</P>
<P>
 The "environmental movement" is not the luxury of rich countries. It is our 
only hope for world survival.

KIEV PIECE NOTHING MORE THAN BASHING

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joyce Sunila's bashing of radio KIEV (Valley Commentary, July 3) and 
especially veteran newscaster George Putnam conveniently left out the fact that 
KIEV does not screen its calls. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 41 year-old baby boomer, I would trust the word of George Putnam over a 
Bill Clinton or Joyce Sunila.

 We were surprised to read an article ("The Place to Tune In for Some Really 
Weird Talk," July 3) which is so far off the mark that your editors must have 
left early for the Fourth of July weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer suggests that we have a person named Roy Masterson when a simple 
phone call could have identifed him correctly as Roy Masters . 
</P>
<P>
 The article went downhill from there. Erroll Smith, who is the only full-time 
Monday through Friday black talk show host in Los Angeles, "apparently studied 
elocution from Barbara Walters," and asked, "Who is afwaid of the weligious 
wight?" Cheap shot? Ask Tom Brokaw. 
</P>
<P>
 This level of reporting moved to George Putnam, who has a tremendous following 
and has been a major TV and radio newsman in Los Angeles for 40 years and will 
be 80 years old this month. His problem, among others is a "stentorian" voice, 
that most in the media would give anything to emulate. Does The Times print 
everything without editorial correction of the facts? Haven't we progressed 
beyond making fun of those with different speech patterns? 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, we are not a "Valley station." with a 15,000-watt signal (three 
times that of KABC and KFWB), we are a Southern California station.

LIFT ROADBLOCKS ON VALLEY RAIL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial ("Indecision May Doom Valley Red Line Project," July 3) was 
right on target in suggesting that the metropolitan Transportation Authority 
needs to make a final decision on the alignment of the San Fernando Valley rail 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the residents of the Valley who supported the freeway monorail by a 
five-to-one margin over the subway in a 1990 advisory vote would agree with you 
that this issue has dragged on far too long.In December, 1992, all the leading 
supporters of the subway, including Supervisor Ed Edelman and Mayor Tom 
Bradley, demanded a final showdown vote at the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission. The vote was held. They lost. The freeway alignment 
was selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Edelman and Mayor Bradley were mortified. In January, 1993, they 
launched an all-out effort to reverse the LACTC's "final vote." Again, they 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they did succeed in subjecting the project to a totally unnecessary 
18-month financial review, which will again conclude that the freeway monorail 
would be hundreds of millions of dollars cheaper than digging a tunnel across 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The excessive delays in bringing rail service to the San Fernando Valley could 
have been avoided had the opponents agreed to enter the 21 Century voluntarily 
instead of being dragged there kicking and screaming, abetted in their 
recalcitrance by a tiny clique of NIMBYs and special interests. The time for 
decision is long past. The time for a cost-effective, environmentally aesthetic 
monorail system which can be built quickly without disrupting our community is 
now.

GATHERING AT THE TV FOR A COMMUNAL EXPERIENCE; WHEN LINCOLN WAS ASSASSINATED,

 Where were you when President Kennedy was killed? Everyone who is old enough 
to know what was happening on Nov. 22, 1963, knows exactly what they were doing 
and where they were. I was in my dorm at military school between lunch and my 
next period. Another resident ran through the hall yelling for everyone to turn 
on their radio. Kennedy had been shot! For the next three days the world 
literally stopped to watch and listen. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the first generation in history to have globally communal experiences. 
Radio to some extent, television to a much greater degree, are the reason why. 
</P>
<P>
 We have now gone a whole week without the O.J. Simpson case taking up daytime 
television. Many of my friends are going through withdrawal. This mass 
witnessing of events is a phenomenon without historical precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, it took nearly a week to get the word 
out to the frontier. Now 95 million of us simultaneously witness a fallen 
sports hero lead the police on a chase through Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 People throughout the Valley planned their days around the television 
coverage. Stores were deserted when the hearing was on. They and the streets to 
get to them were busy during the lunch break. Phone calls were postponed until 
recesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake reconstruction chased my grandchildren from their home to mine. I 
suffered through their wails when all they found on television was the Simpson 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder what memory they will have of it half a century from now. I wonder 
what other pieces of history they will share with millions of others in their 
living room. As I look back on the experiences I have shared with millions of 
others, I realize that before instant mass communication, this sharing never 
took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Television entered my home when I was 3 years old. The deliverymen brought the 
carton into the apartment upside down. The picture didn't work. I thought it 
was a radio with a funny looking speaker. But as soon as I saw my first 
cartoons on the 10-inch screen, I knew this box was going to get a lot of my 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, nearly half a century ago in Washington, D.C., most of the 
stations were on for only part of the day and then back on again for Uncle 
Miltie in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 I was part of a mass, shared experience at a young age. I remember vividly 
that many of my favorite shows were cut off by some old guy named Kefauver who 
had taken over my television. He had "guests" on his show who taught me, at age 
5, to respond to my parents with, "I refuse to answer on the grounds it may 
tend to incriminate me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Estes Kefauver's organized-crime hearings fascinated the country for 
weeks on end in 1951. There were only 5 million sets and only 100 stations 
nationwide. Yet 150 million people did their best to find a television to 
watch. In those days people stood on the street in front of the appliance store 
to watch the TV in the window. 
</P>
<P>
 Every night John Cameron Swayze showed day-old pictures of battles in a place 
called Korea, and every Friday he gave away gift cartons of Camel cigarettes to 
soldiers in veterans hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1952 I got up early to share Queen Elizabeth's coronation with the world. 
In 1954 my shows were interrupted again by a blustery guy named McCarthy 
yelling "point of order" to various people in the same room Kefauver had used 
three years before. Twenty million television sets were in homes and all the 
channels covered the Army-McCarthy hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago this week most of the nation stayed up all night to 
watch our astronauts land on the moon. Hardly anyone showed up for work the 
next day. Nearly all the 78 million U.S. televisions were on that night. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973 I was "between jobs" when Sen. Howard Baker filled my days asking the 
likes of John Dean, "What did the President know and when did he know it?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987 I was building a business back up after six years in Washington 
working for Congress when Oliver North's attorney told a joint intelligence 
committee that he was not a "potted plant." I shared the Iran-Contra hearings 
and Oliver North's riveting testimony with a good portion of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 These past few weeks most of the nation's 93 million television sets were 
being watched by as many of our 250 million countrymen who could sneak away 
from work or hide from their boss. It wasn't hard. The boss was probably 
watching too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My generation is the first that has been able to see and hear history as it's 
being made. Fifty years from now, how will the history books differ from 
today's because so many people shared the experience? Will my grandchildren be 
more attuned to the events of the world because they have seen them happen? 
</P>
<P>
 Recent voting trends suggest the answer is no. The more we learn about the 
world around us, the less we seem to want to participate in it. Perhaps half a 
century from now my grandchildren won't have to leave their television sets to 
vote or voice their opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in the television age people witnessing events live run home to turn 
on their sets to see if what they saw really happened. Virtual reality may 
someday, unfortunately, be the only reality we know.

A TERMINAL CASE OF THE TRAVEL BLUES; THE HUGS AND KISSES HAVE CEASED. THERE ARE 
NO MORE LONG AIRPORT GOODBYS FOR THIS FREQUENT FLIER, WHOSE WIFE WOULD PREFER 
HE TAKE THE SHUTTLE.

<P>
 As a comedian I fly a lot. How much is a lot? My wife and I recently 
celebrated our 12th wedding anniversary. If you deduct the time I've spent on 
the road, it would be more like our eighth. Should I be receiving a rebate of 
some kind? 
</P>
<P>
 I often get asked, "With the constant travel, is it tough trying to keep the 
romance alive?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," I say like a man scorned, "especially during the many drop-offs and 
pickups at the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 I used to get a hug. Now I'm lucky if my wife stops the car while driving 
outside the terminal. "Uh, honey you passed my airline." "Next time ring the 
bell." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, when she dropped me off at Burbank Airport for Sacramento, instead of 
a kiss I got a wink.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, we've been married for so long my wife rarely offers to give me a 
ride to the airport. The night before, she promises to take me. But she wakes 
me up at three in the morning and says, "You know, if you call the shuttle now, 
you can still catch your seven o'clock flight." Thanks, sweetheart. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate taking a shuttle because they pick you up two or three hours before 
your flight. That means I'm actually up four to five hours before my flight. I 
think I could spend that time doing something more constructive -- like 
sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Life wasn't much easier 15 years ago when I was a single guy living on my own. 
In addition to a ride to the airport, I had to find someone to feed the plants, 
water the paper and throw away the cat. Ooops, I meant throw away the paper, 
feed the plants and water the cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then I would ask my cousin Harry for a ride. We rarely made it to the 
airport. We lived in South-Central Los Angeles. Harry drove a 1963 Rambler 
station wagon. He needed the extra seats for the guys who were going to get out 
and push when it broke down. In June, 1979, it did just that in the fast lane 
on the eastbound Santa Monica Freeway at about 8 a.m. Some of you may remember 
us. I remember the occasion because I missed my flight. Harry and I learned a 
valuable lesson that day. When the gas gauge reads empty, it's empty. 
</P>
<P>
 However, on the rare occasions we made it to LAX, Harry at least gave me a 
hug. I don't know if it was because we made it, I helped him push or he was 
truly going to miss me. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, wedding bells took my ride away. Harry got married and moved to the 
Valley. For me it was either buy a car or move to the Valley. I got married 
instead. And moved to the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 When I asked my wife to marry me, the airlines must have been looking down on 
me because she worked a block from LAX. In comedic terms, I killed! Then my 
wife was transferred to Newhall. Great! I could get a ride to Burbank Airport. 
Now my ride . . . ooops, my wife . . . works in Reseda. She can still give me a 
ride to Burbank Airport, but as I said, we've been married a long time. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When she picked me up last month, she met me at the curb in curlers and with 
an attitude. "Couldn't they fly that plane any faster? One more minute and I 
was going to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive home, while she told me how many times she had circled the 
airport, I dreamed of starting a new type of shuttle service. I'd call it the 
Love Shuttle. Customers would have a choice of hellos and goodbys. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, $30 would get you the White Zone Goodby. That's five minutes of 
kissing, hugging and baby talk at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 For $40 you could get the Beverly Hillbillies Goodby. One or more persons 
would stand at the gate waving goodby like the Clampetts as you head down the 
ramp and into the air (a waving baby would be extra). 
</P>
<P>
 For as little as $10 you could get the Oh My God We're Going To Be Late! 
Goodby. We'd pick you up with less than an hour before your departure, drive 
like a New York cabby, run to the gate swinging luggage and knocking over 
Australian tourists, and arrive just in time to hear, "Due to mechanical 
problems this flight has been canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 For pickups there would be the $50 A Little Too Much Hello. When you arrive at 
the gate the Cuban Johnny Mathis (the Russian Whitney Houston for men) would 
belt out "Misty" as we screamed your name, burst into tears and say, "I missed 
you so much! Don't ever stay away that long!" You would get a 5-foot-high, 
stuffed teddy bear, a dozen roses and a confetti procession to baggage claim. 
Embarrassed yet? 
</P>
<P>
 For $10 you could get the Sorry I'm Late Hello. That's right, we would show up 
45 minutes after your arrival and deposit you at Aunt Mabel's gum surgery party 
just in time to say, "I missed the strained beef sandwich? Oh well." 
</P>
<P>
 I awoke from my dream when we finally arrived home and my wife complained, 
"You could have brought me a T-shirt." I could have stayed in Sacramento. The 
only person to welcome me home with hugs and kisses (actually licks and licks) 
was our dog. Now how do I teach him to drive?

PHILLIES A PAIN FOR DODGERS; BASEBALL: AFTER HERSHISER LEAVES BEFORE GAME 
BECAUSE OF A SORE MUSCLE, PHILADELPHIA ROLLS TO A 10-6 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 He took the mound as usual and began his warmup routine. But when Orel 
Hershiser walked off the mound before the game started Saturday night, it was 
merely a harbinger of a night that was to be anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, complaining of a cramp in his side, made the earliest exit possible 
in baseball, and replacement Ramon Martinez, who could have complained but 
didn't, made one of the earliest exits of his career, lasting only 4 1/3 
innings in a 10-6 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies at Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows where these things come from?" said Hershiser, who has a strained 
left rib cage muscle that he said might sideline him from two days to two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Victories by the Colorado Rockies and the San Francisco Giants reduced the 
Dodgers' lead in the National League West to three games and 5 1/2, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first half we lost a lot of games and the Giants did also, but now we 
have to win," said Martinez (8-6). "Those guys look like they are back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies scored four unearned runs by the third inning with the help of 
two errors by Eric Karros, who said afterward it felt like he had made six. 
After the Phillies' five-run third inning, which included two home runs and two 
unearned runs because of Karros' error, the Dodgers trailed by 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight I was miserable and I probably, no, I did cost us the game tonight," 
Karros said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point later in the game, Karros fielded a routine grounder and made the 
out at first, and the crowd of 46,479 erupted in mock applause. "It was nice," 
Karros deadpanned. "How many errors did I make? 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser said he has never had a strain in his rib cage before, but he spent 
time during the game listening to his teammates talk about their experiences, 
which included the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio will pitch today in the final game of the series. Friday's 
doubleheader complicates the rotation for the upcoming series against the New 
York Mets. Options include a start by Ismael Valdes, who was a starter before 
being promoted to the Dodgers, and/or a call-up of Chan Ho Park, who Executive 
Vice President Fred Claire says is doing well. Tom Candiotti can pitch on three 
days' rest and could be ready to go Tuesday. But the scenarios are premature 
until Hershiser sees how he feels today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was warming up in the bullpen and it was the last pitch before the national 
anthem when I felt a cramp in my side," Hershiser said. "Every pitch from that 
point I felt a tightness or a twinge, so I cut my warmups short and came into 
the training room during the first inning and it started to feel good. I went 
out to the mound to throw my warmup pitches, but every time I tried to increase 
the velocity the pain followed. I decided it would not be a good idea not to 
push it. I felt it could be very severe." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez usually runs 45 minutes a day and follows that with an exercise 
program, except on the days he pitches. He did his normal routine Saturday, 
except he cut his running to 20 minutes because of the heat.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was just finishing my exercises when I saw Orel walking in, and I thought 
he was there to change his jersey," Martinez said. "(Pitching coach Ron 
Perranoski) followed him in and told me Orel got hurt and be ready just in 
case. . . . There was no time to prepare, so I went and put on my spikes and 
took the ball. It was tough, but I don't feel sorry for anything that happened. 
. . . I don't think I did that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers scored three runs in the fifth to pull to 6-5. There were a single 
by Martinez, who had two hits in the game, a single by Mike Piazza, who went 
three for five, and a two-run homer by Tim Wallach, his first since June 29. 
But the Phillies added three more in the bottom of the inning, knocking out 
Martinez, who might have wished he had never been there to start with. Karros 
certainly does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been playing well defensively, and tonight, for whatever reason, I did 
not make the plays," Karros said.

RARE CONDITIONS OPEN DOOR FOR FAXON, ZOELLER; GOLF: THEY LEAD THE BRITISH OPEN 
BY A STROKE AS HARD FAIRWAYS, SOFT GREENS AND GENTLE WINDS PRODUCE LOWER 
SCORES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Brad Faxon happily recounted the details of a Saturday round that put him 
in a two-way tie for the British Open lead, there came across the Ailsa Course 
the sound of bagpipes. 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon heard nothing. He was too busy describing a three-under 67, which put 
him at nine-under 201 after three rounds, the same total as Fuzzy Zoeller's. 
Then he talked about the drive he skulled off a spectator's knapsack on No. 7, 
the one where he thought he killed somebody. Then he talked about his string of 
41 bogey-less holes -- in a major, no less. Then he talked about the last time 
he was this close to winning a major, which is never. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when you could hear the bagpipes at their clearest. There it was . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "Amazing Grace." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the whole day was amazing. From Greg Norman's fast start and slow 
fizzle, to Zoeller's near-record 64, to Faxon's unexpected run. The gentle 
winds off the Firth of Clyde, the rock hard fairways and the soft greens made 
for a day when par was cause for depression. Forty-two of the 81 players broke 
par Saturday, which explains why the average score on a course statistically 
ranked among the toughest on the rotation was 69.39. Forecasters call for a 
more sunny conditions today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother Nature has produced an easy course for us this year," said Tom Watson, 
who began the day in the lead but ended it tied for second. "Very simply, it's 
a golf course there for the taking." 
</P>
<P>
 The greedy ones took advantage of every calm moment, knowing how quickly the 
weather can change here. 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon did his part, though it might come as something of a surprise. Two years 
removed from a skiing accident, Faxon's reputation on the tour is simple 
enough: nice guy from Rhode Island . . . scrambler . . . low on style points. 
</P>
<P>
 So perhaps that's why Faxon, 32, did a double-take when someone asked if it 
worked in his favor to enter today's final round as a dark horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it an advantage not having won a major?" an incredulous Faxon said. "Oh, 
big advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon probably wishes he had Zoeller's resume right about now. Zoeller, 42, 
who already has a Masters and U.S. Open championship, started at three under 
and didn't stop until he was a birdie putt away on No. 18 from tying the 
British Open record for low round. He settled for a 64 and a share of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did things today that I hadn't done for a long time," Zoeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller, who missed a 2 1/2-inch putt here in 1986 ("the shortest putt of my 
career"), had shot a 64 only one other time all year. And his previous low 
round in 12 years of British Opens was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Zoeller didn't have a clue about his score. Someone yelled from the 
gallery at No. 17, "C'mon, Fuzzy, give us a 63!" 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller didn't hear a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other days you can hear a guy tying his shoe out there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Zoeller walked into the scorer's trailer, took pencil to card 
and then added up the numbers that he realized what he had done. He turned to 
playing partner David Feherty and said, "Did I shoot that?" 
</P>
<P>
 A shot behind Zoeller and Faxon were Watson (69), England's Ronan Rafferty 
(65), defending PGA champion Nick Price (67) and Sweden's Jesper Parnevik (68). 
At 203 were Feherty, followed by Mark James at 205 and 11 other players, 
including Craig Stadler, Larry Mize, Colin Montgomerie, Peter Jacobsen, Tom 
Kite and Davis Love III, at 206. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson could have been leading the tournament, but he had a self-described 
case of the putting "hiccups" on No. 14 and No. 16 that cost him pars. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't dwell on that very much anymore," he said. "I have a chance to 
win the British Open." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson birdied the last two holes, which put him in a better mood. What would 
really make him happy is a new weather forecast. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know a secret? I wish the wind would blow about 40 miles per 
hour. But it's not going to." 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with most everyone else. Price wouldn't mind a little wind, but 
wants it warm. Parnevik, who has been paired with Jack Nicklaus and Watson 
during the week, is happy simply to be here. The same goes for Rafferty, 
Feherty and the rest of them. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Feherty is happy to simply find his ball these days. So errant were 
his drives Saturday, that he hit a one-iron off the 18th tee "in an attempt to 
keep it in Scotland." 
</P>
<P>
 Feherty had to qualify for this year's Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I've said, I've got nothing better to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who could have done better is Norman. He had birdies at the first, 
third and ninth holes, ending the front nine with a 30-foot putt. But his 
chances of retaining his title faded at the bottom of a creek known as Wilson's 
Burn. 
</P>
<P>
 After a front nine of 32, Norman was five under and two shots off the lead 
when he self-destructed at the par-four, 410-yard 16th hole called Wee Burn. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman pulled his drive into the left rough, then lofted a sand wedge that 
landed short of the elevated green. The ball stopped for a split second, then 
slowly rolled back down the slope and into the shallow burn that guards the 
green like a moat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing for a little flyer and it came out soft," Norman said. "I had 
88 yards to the front end of the green and hit it about 85 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a penalty drop, Norman left his chip at the back of the green and 
two-putted for a double-bogey six. He parred the final two holes for a round of 
69 and a total of 207, six shots off the lead.

MORNING BRIEFING: IT WAS A JOKE, BUT REPORTER DIDN'T GET IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Proving there's nothing quite like a good story, even if it isn't true, we 
submit this one from the Philadelphia Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
 In his sports gossip column, Jeff Samuels wrote that Magic Johnson said he was 
talked out of making a comeback as a player in his last two games as Laker 
coach by Times sportswriter Scott Howard-Cooper, who covers the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called Scott and asked him," Johnson said, according to Samuels. "He told 
me 'No, no.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Samuels: "God bless you, Scott Howard-Cooper." The story ran under the 
headline "Writer Had To Talk Magic Out Of Playing In Final Two." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard-Cooper said Johnson actually had singled him out in a group of writers, 
but it was a joke, which is what Howard-Cooper considers the Daily News story 
to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I advised Magic not to play," he said. "I remember now. That was the 
day after Michael Jordan called to ask me if I thought he should try basketball 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which two athletes who went on to dominate their sports did the 
Chicago Bulls draft in 1984? 
</P>
<P>
 Everything else was taken: John Skipper reports in his monthly baseball trivia 
newsletter called "Batter Up" that former Detroit Tiger outfielder Willie 
Horton named two of his sons Daryl, calling them Daryl I and Daryl II. 
</P>
<P>
 Conine the Bruin: It was interesting to see Jeff Conine of the Florida Marlins 
on the National League All-Star team as a first baseman/left fielder. The 
former UCLA player has come a long way -- he never batted in a three-year Bruin 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Conine was a 55th-round draft pick by Kansas City in 1987 after posting an 8-3 
record and 5.34 earned-run average as a pitcher at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 History lesson: On this date in 1974, the Southern California Sun of the World 
Football League played its first home game at Anaheim Stadium and defeated the 
Hawaiians, 38-31.  
</P>
<P>
 Attendance was 32,088 and the quarterback for the Sun was Tony Adam. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists: For what it's worth, the New England Patriots have sold more than 
46,000 season tickets, coming off a 5-11 season. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gas: This item comes from the Fly in the Sporting News for those who 
might want to go to the Goodwill Games in Russia later this month.  
</P>
<P>
 "Russian police have been assigned to ride the overnight train from Moscow to 
St. Petersburg because criminals gas passengers until they are unconscious, 
then rob them. They don't even do that in the New York subways." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan update: Michael Jordan reached the halfway point of his first 
professional baseball season with a .194 batting average for the double-A 
Birmingham Barons, with no home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Michael Jordan in the first round and Carl Lewis in the 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Former Kansas City Monarch pitcher Connie Johnson, on legendary 
Negro league superstar Buck Leonard: "You'd have to throw the ball 200 m.p.h. 
to get it by Buck. Ain't no doubt about it, Buck was a dude. Bad as you can 
get." THOMAS BONK

JACKSON, OWEN DELIVER IN NINTH INNING FOR ANGELS, 4-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting pitcher Chuck Finley sat in the Angel clubhouse during what loomed as 
another Angel defeat Saturday night when Bo Jackson popped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Fin, what do you want me to do?"Jackson asked in the top of the ninth 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Finley: "Get somebody on base, and hit one out." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson: "OK, I'll be right back." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson then walked out of the clubhouse, whispered to reliever Joe Grahe that 
he was going to be the winning pitcher, told the rest of his teammates they 
were going to win the game and grabbed a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson couldn't do a thing about getting someone on base, but he kept his 
promise, hitting a home run with one out in the ninth to tie the score before 
watching Spike Owen hit a two-out triple that gave the Angels a 4-3 victory 
over the Baltimore Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those few athletes that come along in a lifetime," Finley said. 
"There's (Joe) Montana, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan . . . those guys with that 
flair of the dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's Bo." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson may be a part-time baseball player these days, and his football career 
is long over, but every time he steps out of the dugout, the murmur in the 
stands lets you know there's no one like him. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came off the bench to pinch-hit for second baseman Harold Reynolds to 
face closer Lee Smith, the crowd of 23,371 at Anaheim Stadium stood and erupted 
in cheers. The fans didn't know whether he'd strike out or hit a homer, but it 
was sure going to be fun watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a flair for the dramatic," Jackson said, "people just like me 
here. Maybe I should run for mayor. Think I'd win?" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who leads the major leagues with 30 saves, knew he needed to pitch 
carefully. He fired the first pitch low and away. Home-plate umpire Ed Bean 
called it a strike. Jackson argued, but now he knew that he'd have to swing at 
anything close. 
</P>
<P>
 The next pitch was two inches higher, and maybe an inch farther inside. 
Jackson swung late. It didn't matter. The ball hit off the end of his bat . . . 
and didn't land until it reached the right-field seats, sending the crowd and 
Angel bench into a frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw it right where I wanted," said Smith, who has been scored upon in 
five consecutive outings. "It was a good pitch, low and away." 
</P>
<P>
 What made it more painful for Smith to accept was that the ball came off the 
end of Jackson's bat, prompting someone to ask if he broke it. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, not when you have them corked like me," Jackson said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really trying to brag, but when I hit it, I knew I hit it. I knew the 
ball was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only question to (Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann) when I got to the dugout 
was, 'Am I going (in) to (play) second for Harold?' 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachemann: "No, go get your outfielder's glove." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson didn't need to bother. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary DiSarcina, the No. 9 hitter, hit a line drive off All-Star shortstop Cal 
Ripken's glove into center field. Rex Hudler popped up to Ripken for the second 
out, bringing up Owen. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, working Smith to a 2-and-2 count, hit a fastball into the left-field 
corner that caromed away from left fielder Brady Anderson. Third-base coach Ken 
Macha watched the ball and never hesitated, sending DiSarcina home. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was thrown up the line, and DiSarcina didn't even have to slide as he 
ran across the plate, giving the Angels (39-53) their first ninth-inning, 
come-from-behind victory since May 20 against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 While DiSarcina was slapping hands with Tim Salmon as he crossed the plate, 
there was Owen, leaping into the arms of Hudler. The Angels ran on to the 
field, and if you didn't know any better, you'd have thought they won the 
pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you win a game like this," Owen said, "it lifts people up. Maybe we can 
get that (winning) feeling again. We're six games out now. We can either jump 
back in this thing or get buried in it." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Angels had lost Saturday, dropping to a season-high seven games behind 
the Texas Rangers, Owen might have been able to answer his own question. 
</P>
<P>
 That all changed, of course, with one swing of the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when you think you've seen it all from Bo, you see something like 
tonight," first baseman J.T. Snow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say, the man is amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, he is amazing."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; STOITCHKOV CAN'T GET THE BOOT FROM RAVELLI; SWEDEN: 
GOALKEEPER RECORDS 10 SAVES, INCLUDING A BIG ONE AGAINST BULGARIAN STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli danced with an invisible partner, swaying to 
a beat he alone heard of the 83,716 fans who sunned themselves at the Rose Bowl 
during Saturday's third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory was his, he knew, and he wasn't going to wait for the formality of 
hearing the final whistle to celebrate his first shutout in his 10 World Cup 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectators had previously cheered loudest for Brazil, which wasn't even on 
the premises but was in their hearts as they awaited today's championship game. 
Ravelli's strange and happy gyrations inspired them to change their "Ole 
Brazil" chant to a chorus of "Ra-vell-ee!" as injury time played out and 
Sweden's 4-0 triumph was assured. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli, a born performer, loved entertaining the fans and drawing their 
attention away from Brazil and back to Sweden's bronze-medal performance 
against Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the score was 4-0 and there were five minutes left, then I didn't have 
to be so concentrated," said Ravelli, who turned a cartwheel after making a 
diving save on Yordan Letchkov in the 87th minute and waved to the stands to 
acknowledge the fans' applause. "I had fun. The crowd pushed me, also." 
</P>
<P>
 The free-shooting Bulgarians pushed him to make 10 saves and managed to beat 
him once, only to watch in frustration when Krasimir Balakov's shot caromed off 
the left goal post in the 78th minute. They took 21 shots, including one that 
produced a classic showdown between Ravelli and forward Hristo Stoitchkov in 
the 85th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 For Stoitchkov, a goal might have meant the Golden Boot, an award given the 
top scorer in the World Cup. For Ravelli, a save meant remaining in contention 
for the Lev Yashin Cup, an award named for the former great Soviet goalkeeper 
and given to the tournament's top keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov, who began the game with six goals -- tying him with Oleg Salenko 
of the long-eliminated Russian team -- broke in alone on Ravelli and faced his 
rival head-on.  
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov tried to draw Ravelli down before getting his feared left foot on 
the ball. Ravelli, patient but obligated to commit, went down and got his right 
foot on the shot to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 The two appeared to have a short discussion after that save, followed by 
Ravelli patting Stoitchkov on the back and the Bulgarian pointing to him, 
perhaps in anger. However, each denied feeling any animosity toward the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took the last chance he had, he kept lying on the grass and I thought 
I could help him up," Ravelli said. "But I think he was very angry at himself 
for missing an opportunity to make his (seventh) goal of the tournament and he 
ran away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't speak Spanish. And he doesn't speak English. Or Swedish, either. 
After he ran 50 meters, he gave me this finger up." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a thumb. "Like this," Ravelli said, jabbing his right thumb skyward to 
emphasize his point. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov claimed he was not disappointed that Ravelli and the Swedish 
defense prevented him from taking the goal lead outright, or at least 
distancing himself from the two players who might wrest the title from him 
today. Brazilian forward Romario and Italy's Roberto Baggio each have scored 
five goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov also said he and Ravelli did not have a personal duel, despite 
their gesturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," said Stoitchkov, who took a team-leading seven shots in the 
game. "He is an excellent goalkeeper." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli thoroughly enjoyed playing before what might some day be his home 
crowd. "It's easy to be a goalkeeper when you're winning, 4-0," he said. "You 
want to win the game and you can show a little bit (of individuality) also." 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli repeated that he would like to play in the United States, should a 
professional league be formed whose teams could compete with the salaries paid 
in Europe. He praised the appreciative audiences he found here, even if he was 
a bit puzzled by some of their antics Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them were behind me," he said, "but one or two or them yelled, 
'Romario!' I didn't see Romario on the field."

WORLD CUP USA 1994; SPOTLIGHT; A REDSKINS FAN? FROM WASHINGTON: 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RHODES, The Times of London 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "When the final whistle echoes around the Rose Bowl in Pasadena and the 
victors parade the World Cup, many in the United States will probably review 
the past month as a spectacular, but rather eccentric diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have witnessed some of the best that football has to offer in an 
atmosphere more congenial than perhaps anywhere else in the world. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The gladiatorial struggle between Romario and (Roberto) Baggio, the Brazilian 
and Italian strikers, will doubtless be discussed long into the night in bars, 
but then, it is felt, America will revert to the more comfortable arenas of 
football, baseball and basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Republican party staff member Christopher Rousso: "We have enjoyed the 
spectacle for the time being, and we will watch the match, but that will be the 
end of it. We like games that are based on strength, and soccer is just not 
seen that way over here." TOM RHODES, The Times of London

 "If it all comes down to the passion that moves mountains, to the hunger that 
lifts genius from the gutter, to ambitions that transcend personal gain, then 
there can be only one winner in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Italy is driven by a pride so intense that it borders on vanity and by a fear 
of failure so acute that (players) may not dare return home to face a 
population for whom football is the most fervent expression of nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for Brazil, the World Cup final is much more important than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "The men in the most hallowed yellow jerseys of all are playing for a future 
for their vast country, to inspire hope in its teeming population, to displace 
the corruption of poverty with the capacity for salvation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we exaggerate the significance of 22 grown men kicking a ball across a 
field? Not if we listen to the players who raise that simple boyhood pleasure 
to an art form on this, the weekend when the game reaches its highest pitch."

 The music of the World Cup plays at the Rose Bowl for the final time today. 
What to expect: 
</P>
<P>
 "Glory Land": The tournament's official theme song, this 
stamped-out-of-a-computer mess tries to mesh Bruce Springsteen with Lee 
Greenwood.It winds up leaving listeners longing for "Rock the Pond," the Mighty 
Ducks' wretched anthem. Score: 2 
</P>
<P>
 "Ole, Ole Ole, Ole": Every soccer fans' favorite, Brazil's faithful sing this 
early and often. Doesn't have much of a beat, but who cares? Score: 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA anthem": Completely without merit, though fans across the United States, 
used to rising for "The Star-Spangled Banner," have stood each time this has 
been played. What's the capital of FIFA? Score: 0 
</P>
<P>
 "Eee-tal-ya, Eee-tal-ya": A conservative bunch compared to the Brazilians, 
Italians don't sing much, but when they do, it's this. Score: 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ohh ohh, ehh ehh, Bra-sil": After their team scored in the semifinal, 
thousands of Brazilian fans, all seemingly in green and gold outfits, sang this 
while hip-hopping out of their Rose Bowl seats. It might have been the day's 
best moment. Score: 10 EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; YANKEES USE LONG BALL AS KEY WINS 14TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Key became a 14-game winner and Gerald Williams homered twice to lead 
the New York Yankees to a 9-3 victory over the Mariners at Seattle on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Key, who is 14-2 and 32-8 in his 1 1/2 seasons with the Yankees, equaled his 
season high with eight strikeouts to defeat major league strikeout leader Randy 
Johnson (10-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to change some things," said Key, who lost his last start against the 
Mariners at Yankee Stadium July 2, ending an 11-game winning streak. "They had 
10 hits off me the last time I saw them. When they hit you that well, you've 
got to try to change something. It might not work or it might. I tried to 
change some pitch patterns and stuff like that to disturb the hitters. It 
seemed to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Key went seven innings and gave up only three hits while walking five as the 
Yankees won their third in a row from the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 New York took a 1-0 lead in the first on Don Mattingly's run scoring double, 
then made the score 3-0 in the second when Mike Stanley hit his 10th homer and 
Williams got his first homer of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 2, Chicago 0 -- Dennis Martinez won his eighth consecutive decision, 
pitching a four-hitter, and the Indians moved a game ahead in the Central 
Division at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (9-4) gave up a single to Darrin Jackson in the second, a double in 
the third by Tim Raines, a single to Frank Thomas in the sixth and another 
single by pinch-hitter Warren Newson in the eighth. He walked two and struck 
out four. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the same Dennis I remember," said Chicago's Tim Raines, who played with 
Martinez for Montreal. "He never gave in to any hitters. He threw it just the 
opposite of the way you thought he was going to throw." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, with their second victory in the first three games of the 
four-game series, scored in the first on Omar Vizquel's single and a run 
scoring double by Carlos Baerga, extending his hitting streak to 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Milwaukee 2 -- Jim Deshaies and three relievers limited the 
Brewers to six hits and the Twins hit three home runs at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Deshaies (5-9) gave up five hits in 6 1/3 innings before giving up a home run 
to Greg Vaughn. Rick Aguilera, Minnesota's fourth pitcher, worked a perfect 
ninth for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Munoz, Scott Leius and Alex Cole homered against Bill Wegman (6-3), who 
lost his third consecutive start. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Toronto 2 -- Ivan Rodriguez homered for the third time in five games 
and Kevin Brown gave up only seven hits in eight innings at Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown (7-8) struck out six and walked two. Tom Henke pitched the ninth for his 
10th save. Rodriguez hit a two-run homer against Pat Hentgen (11-6) in a 
three-run third. He later singled, his 17th hit in 36 at-bats over his last 
nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 13, Kansas City 7 -- Travis Fryman's grand slam capped an eight-run 
fourth inning and Kirk Gibson added a two-run homer in the seventh at Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Samuel had a single, double and triple with two runs batted in and three 
runs scored for the Tigers. Wally Joyner went five for five for the Royals. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Boever (8-2) won in relief of Bill Gullickson, who started the fifth with 
a 10-3 lead but failed to get out of the inning. Boever gave up two hits in 
four shutout innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 9, Boston 0 -- Scott Brosius hit two home runs, including a grand slam 
in the third inning, to keep the Athletics four games behind the Rangers in the 
AL West. Rickey Henderson and Ruben Sierra hit home runs in the first inning to 
give the A's a 3-0 lead.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BONDS HITS TWO MORE HOMERS, GIANTS WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a slow first half of the season, Barry Bonds and the San Francisco 
Giants are in a groove. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds hit two home runs and drove in three runs for the second consecutive 
night Saturday, sending San Francisco to its seventh consecutive victory, 4-2 
over the Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's locking in there," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said of Bonds. "He's 
healthy, he's strong and it seems he's got his concentration back. He's been 
fun to watch these last couple of days, and we're back in the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds hit solo homers -- his 26th and 27th -- against Ken Hill (13-4) and 
added a run-scoring single in the seventh inning that chased Hill. Bonds has 
homered 12 times in his last 22 games. 
</P>
<P>
 John Burkett (6-7) limited Montreal to two runs and eight hits in 6 2/3 
innings. He struck out six and walked two. Rod Beck pitched the ninth for his 
19th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bonds is hot," Expo Manager Felipe Alou said. "You can't pitch him when he's 
hot. But if you don't, you've got a guy with 33 home runs next (Matt Williams), 
then (Darryl) Strawberry." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, still undefeated in a Giant uniform, went two for four with a 
towering fly ball to the wall in right-center. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 15, St. Louis 4 -- Dante Bichette homered and drove in four runs and 
Andres Galarraga had two home runs and three RBIs for the Rockies at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies, in beating St. Louis for the third consecutive time in the series 
and fifth in a row overall, have scored 33 runs on 39 hits in the first three 
games of this four-game series. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Painter (3-3) gave up seven hits and three runs in seven innings for the 
Rockies. Cardinal starter Omar Olivares (1-2) lasted 4 1/3 innings, giving up 
seven runs on seven hits and six walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, Florida 5 -- Fred McGriff hit a three-run homer in the seventh 
inning and Jose Oliva added two home runs to lead the Braves to a 
come-from-behind victory at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Braves trailing, 4-3, Roberto Kelly and Dave Justice reached base 
before McGriff hit his 24th home run of the season to give reliever Mark 
Wohlers (6-1), who worked one-third of an inning, the victory. Greg McMichael 
pitched the ninth for his 19th save, matching his total from last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliva, a rookie third baseman, hit his third and fourth homers. He is 
10-for-22 with two doubles, four homers and six RBIs. McGriff has five homers 
and 14 RBIs in his last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 5, San Diego 4 -- Todd Hundley drove in two runs in a three-run first 
inning as rookie Jason Jacome won his first start at Shea Stadium in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundley's two-run single in the first helped Jacome win for the second time in 
three starts for New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about him is that he pitches with his head and his heart," Met 
Manager Dallas Green said of Jacome, who gave up two runs and eight hits while 
striking out three in six innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight he struggled a bit in the sixth inning, leaving some of his pitches 
up. I decided to let him go out with the lead and take advantage of the 
pinch-hitting opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 John Franco gave up two runs in the ninth but struck out Eddie Williams with 
runners on first and third for the final out and his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sanders (3-7) took the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 7, Pittsburgh 1 -- Pete Harnisch won his fourth consecutive start 
since coming off the disabled list and the Astros held onto an early lead, 
unlike Friday when the Pirates rallied from an 8-0 deficit to win at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Servais and Orlando Miller had run-scoring singles in the second inning 
and Luis Gonzalez hit a solo homer in the fourth as Houston took a 3-0 lead 
against Zane Smith (9-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Harnisch (6-4) lasted seven innings for the first time since coming off the 
disabled list June 30, giving up five hits and an unearned run with four 
strikeouts and no walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 7, Cincinnati 2 -- Mike Morgan pitched his first complete game in a 
year and the Cubs hit four solo homers at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a step in the right direction," Morgan said. "All year, on and off 
the field, I've struggled. I said I'm going to see what I'm made of. I've got 
24 players and a coaching staff behind me. I forgot what happened in the first 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan (2-9) gave up seven hits as he went the distance for the first time 
since July 15 of last year. Glenallen Hill scored three times, doubled twice 
and homered for Chicago.

CHENEY LOSES HIS SHIRT, BUT WINS SEMIFINAL; TENNIS: AFTER TAKING A BREAK TO 
CHANGE, HE FINISHES CORNELL IN NATIONAL 45 TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Steve Cornell didn't mind that four of the past five sets he'd played had 
resulted in tiebreakers. He didn't want to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Not after his opponent, top-seeded Brian Cheney, double-faulted to lose the 
second-set tiebreaker in the semifinals of the U.S. Tennis Assn.'s national 
men's 45 hard court championships Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Cornell of Oakland, who lost the first set in a tiebreaker, was ready 
to start serving the third. But Cheney headed for the clubhouse to change his 
shirt, leaving Cornell standing at the fringes of the sun-scorched playing 
surface of the Westlake Tennis & Swim Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney was gone for 10 minutes. When he returned, he played the final set as 
if he had done more than change his shirt. Cornell, who didn't take shelter, 
withered. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney advanced to today's final with a 7-6 (7-3), 6-7 (9-7), 6-2 victory. "I 
don't like to take that much of a break," said Cornell, 45, who played on two 
NCAA championship teams at UCLA from 1969 to 1971. "And at the beginning of the 
third set, I wasn't really in there, mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell's previous two matches had gone to three sets, but he said he didn't 
notice any fatigue. "(But) maybe I was a little slower in (Saturday') third 
set," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney, 46, a Santa Monica native who lives in Chandler, Ariz., broke 
Cornell's serve three times to take a 5-0 lead in the final set. Cheney could 
have closed it out, 6-0, but he double-faulted away his third service to make 
it 5-1, and Cornell held to make it 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Cheney put an exclamation point at the end of the 2 1/2-hour affair with 
a backhand volley, a service winner, a charging forehand and a running forehand 
volley. Love game, set and match. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been 6-0," Cheney said. "At 30-all, I hit a good volley. 
(Cornell) came up and hit a backhand down the line. It was his only shot and I 
didn't cover it really well. But he played well. He hit good volleys and deep 
ground strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the second tiebreaker, Cornell was serving for the set at 6-4 when Cheney 
hit a backhand winner. Cheney rallied for a 7-6 lead but hit a backhand long on 
match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell answered to lead, 8-7, and evened the match when Cheney 
double-faulted. But Cheney, a three-time NCAA quarterfinalist in singles at 
Arizona, dominated the third set. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheney will face Charlie Hoeveler of Ross, Calif., in the 10:30 a.m. final. 
Hoeveler defeated Cliff Price of Tulsa, Okla., 6-2, 7-5.

RACING ROUNDUP; DANIELS HOLDS OFF STREAKING WOODSIDE

<P>
 Sean Woodside's bid for a fourth consecutive Sportsman main event victory met 
with stiff competition at Saugus Speedway Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting sixth, the Saugus resident had three former track champions standing 
in the way of his winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 After moving past former El Cajon champion Jerry Gay and three-time Saugus 
Modified champion Kenny Sapper, Woodside did not have enough to overtake former 
Orange Show Raceway champion Ron Daniels from San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels started on the pole after setting fast time and survived some 
mechanical difficulties during an earlier trophy dash and a strong challenge 
from Woodside, the current points leader, in the 40-lap feature race to 
register his first victory at Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough track to tame," said Daniels, 37. "This is the hardest track 
I've ever raced at." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodside wound up a close second, while Sapper was a distant third. 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran an awesome race," said Woodside, 23. "I used up my brakes early in the 
race and I didn't have enough left. If I had a hat on, I'd take it off to him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30-lap Grand American Modified main event, Gary Nazaroff won his first 
feature race this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Covina resident started on the outside of the first row but quickly moved 
past pole-sitter Rick Crow of Canyon Country and led every lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time defending champion Dave Phipps of Simi Valley moved past Canyon 
Country's John Watkinson III on the final turn to finish second. Dave 
Blankenship of Reseda finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Benner went wire to wire to take the checkered flag in the 25-lap Street 
Stock oval main event and complete a big night. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his third feature victory of the season, the Whittier resident 
also posted the fastest qualifying time and won the six-lap oval trophy dash. 
</P>
<P>
 John Schultz of Valencia was a distant second, followed by Northridge's Jeff 
Drummen and Kirk Miller of Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz came back to win the 15-lap Street Stock figure 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Trophy dashes were won by Woodside (Sportsman), Watkinson (Grand Am), Benner 
(Street Stock oval) and Northridge's Greg Bratschie (Street Stock figure 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Heat race winners include Tim Huddleston of Chatsworth (Sportsman), Canyon 
Country's Rick Crow (Grand Am) and Van Nuys residents Steve Gilmore (Street 
Stock oval) and Jack West (Street Stock figure 8). 
</P>
<P>
 In qualifying, fast times were set by Daniels (Sportsman) 16.17; Blankenship 
(Grand Am) 16.18; Benner (Street Stock oval) 18.64. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bower of Northridge won the 15-lap Street Stock oval semi-main event. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Three strong entries were eliminated at the start of the 20-lap U.S. Auto Club 
Western States three-quarter Midget main event, paving the way for Richard 
McCormick of Granada Hills to grab his second victory at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick, who was 10th in the points standings coming into the race, earned 
the first victory of his career on May 28, also at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time winner Marc Hart of Ventura tangled with Kenny White of Ventura 30 
yards past the finish line at the start, knocking both cars out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was caused when the steering broke on Hart's car, causing him to 
swerve into White. 
</P>
<P>
 Pole-sitter Jim Brusseau of Pasadena led the first seven laps, then yielded to 
McCormick after getting sideways in Turn 4 while attempting to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Brusseau came back to finish third, behind defending champion J.J. Ercse of 
Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
 Points leader Rick Atkins of Fullerton added to his lead by finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Dorn led all but six laps, winning the 20-lap Dwarf Car feature. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his lead on the sixth lap, Dorn got a break when Russ Butland 
spun on Lap 11, then lost his steering on Lap 12, bringing out the caution flag 
both times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorn needed less than one lap to take back the lead after the restart. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Drake of Val Verde posted his second career victory in the 30-lap Midget 
main event. DARIN ESPER

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SOVIET PROBLEM EASY WINNER OF THE VALKYR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soviet Problem has already won a match race this year and there was some 
discussion about another during the upcoming Del Mar meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 4-year-old Moscow Ballet filly did what she was supposed to against 
six California-bred rivals in the $108,300 Valkyr Handicap at Hollywood Park on 
Saturday, a showdown with Cool Air was mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 The night before, Cool Air had won for the sixth time in seven starts since 
joining trainer Gary Jones' barn and remained unbeaten in three tries on the 
Hollywood Park turf with a 2 1/2-length victory over males in the $155,600 
Hollywood Budweiser Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning for the 11th time in 14 starts, Soviet Problem, the 3-5 favorite, won 
by 1 1/2 lengths in 1:01 3/5 for the 5 1/2 furlongs on turf, the same time Cool 
Air had Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, Gary Jones won't think about resting Cool Air," said Chris 
McCarron, who is perfect in two tries with Soviet Problem. "(Jones' assistant 
and son) Marty said Friday there is nothing down at Del Mar for her. So, maybe 
we can get a match race put on. It would be the first ever at 5 1/2 furlongs on 
the grass at Del Mar." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying top weight of 125 pounds, Soviet Problem battled with Miss L Attack, 
drew away by five lengths with an eighth of a mile to run, then had more than 
enough left to beat Best Dress, the 9-2 second choice who rallied from last. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one filly and mare (sprint) race at Del Mar (the Rancho Bernardo 
Breeders' Cup Handicap on Aug. 13), " said John Harris, who owns Soviet Problem 
along with Don Valpredo. "It's a Breeders' Cup race, but she's not eligible 
(for) the Breeders' Cup, but we'd take a look at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, there's the Bing Crosby (on July 31), but that's coming back in two 
weeks. We thought about running her in the race at Laurel today (the Frank J. 
DeFrancis Memorial Dash), but she was in California and doing well here, so you 
hate to ship around if you've got nice races right here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cadet, making his first start since Nov. 21, 1992, is the 2-1 morning-line 
favorite in the $163,300 Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood Park today. 
</P>
<P>
 Bothered by ankle problems and colitis during his time off, the 6-year-old 
Bolger horse has a series of sharp works for trainer Ron McAnally and has never 
been off the board in five starts at Hollywood Park. He has two victories, a 
second and two thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular rider Alex Solis will be aboard and he is the highweight at 119 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way, who won for the first time in eight American races, is the 5-2 
morning-line second choice. Trained by Bobby Frankel and ridden by Kent 
Desormeaux, the 4-year-old Secretariat colt won as the 2-5 favorite in the 
Golden Gate Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap. In his last local start, he was 
beaten by a half-length by Del Mar Dennis in the Mervyn LeRoy Handicap on May 
15. 
</P>
<P>
 The other main contenders in the race are Region, who hasn't run since 
finishing last in the Santa Anita Handicap, and Lykatill Hil, who has won two 
of three since returning to the races after being sidelined for more than five 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field in the 1 1/16-mile Bel Air includes Williamstown, 
Brilliant Blue, Dr Pain and Seahawk Gold. Williamstown will go back on Lasix 
today after being without it for his last two starts. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Journalism, the 2-5 favorite, won the $66,200 Khaled Handicap, easily beating 
Der Rosenkavalier in 1:40 for the 1 1/16 miles on turf. Corey Nakatani rode for 
owner Richard Stephen and trainer Wally Dollase. . . . Hollywood Park will 
simulcast the River Downs Budweiser Breeders' Cup at 1 1/2 miles on turf 
between the third and fourth races today. . . . User Friendly worked a mile in 
1:38 1/5 Saturday and is scheduled to make her American debut for trainer 
Rodney Rash in the Ramona Handicap on Aug. 6 at Del Mar. . . . Miss High Blade, 
the 6-year-old mare who has won two in a row while in foal, is the 8-5 
morning-line favorite against five rivals in the $60,000 Ack's Secret Handicap 
at 1 1/16 miles on turf. . . . There were seven perfect tickets in the National 
Best Seven Saturday, and based on a 50-cent wager, each was worth $16,910.90. 
Six winners was worth $123.95 and the total pool was $672,804.50.

NO VICTORY TOO SMALL THESE DAYS; ANGELS: OWEN'S TRIPLE DRIVES IN WINNING RUN IN 
COME-FROM-BEHIND VICTORY AND TOUCHES OFF EMOTIONAL CELEBRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a celebration worthy of a World Series or a championship series, or at 
least a victory in the final days of a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it was only a victory in July by a team that's two week's worth of 
games under .500, but that didn't stop Spike Owen from sprinting past third 
base and flinging his body into a mob of waiting teammates who embraced him 
like a family hugging a soldier returning from war. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Angels should be excused for this demonstration of emotion. On the 
doorstep of yet another disappointment, they tied Saturday's game in the ninth 
inning on Bo Jackson's home run and then won it when Owen tripled to score Gary 
DiSarcina from first. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-3 victory over the Orioles marked the first time the Angels have come 
from behind to win in the ninth inning since May 20. It came against baseball's 
save leader, Lee Smith. And, as Manager Marcel Lachemann so succinctly put it, 
"the wins haven't been coming easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes after his game-winning hit, Owen, a 12-year veteran, was still 
smiling like a Little Leaguer who had just hit his first home run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a great win for us tonight and hopefully it will give us a lift that 
will turn things around," he said. "This is such a big home stand for us. We're 
only six games out and we can jump back in it, or maybe get buried, in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've struggled and it feels good to have a little fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the fun started six weeks ago for Owen, who spent the first two 
months of the season trying to adjust to role-player status. Then, when Damion 
Easley went on the disabled list with an inflamed shoulder June 5, Owen was 
back in the starting lineup, just like the good old days with Montreal, Boston 
and Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 In April and May, however, he walked in the clubhouse each day and approached 
the lineup card on the wall like a guy looking at the winning lottery numbers 
in the morning paper. He didn't really expect to see his name, but it was OK to 
hope, OK to fantasize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, this year I've really developed a respect and an appreciation 
for all the role players I've played with over the years," he said. "It's not 
easy to keep yourself ready to play when you're mostly sitting. It was a big 
adjustment for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say I was happy with that role, but I knew this team was going to 
be going with the younger players. So I just prepared for the time when I'd get 
my chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, he prepared well. He has hit safely in 28 of his last 39 starts 
and has nine runs batted in during his last seven starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say enough about the way he's played," Lachemann said. "He's a pro in 
every sense of the word. He's not only produced, but he's played with such 
professionalism and enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night was a case in point on both counts. After Jackson tied the 
score with an opposite-field bases-empty homer, DiSarcina sent a shot up the 
middle that caromed off the glove of Cal Ripken Jr. and into center field for a 
single. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionalism? Owen worked Smith to a 2-2 count, fouling off a pitch with 
two strikes to keep the at-bat alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fastball away," he said. "I think it was probably a ball, but it was 
too close to risk it at that point. I was pretty lucky to get a piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he got another outside fastball and went with it, sending a slicing line 
drive that landed five feet inside the left-field line and bounced into the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I saw the ball was fair and that we got a favorable bounce off the rail 
and away from (Baltimore left fielder Brady) Anderson, I was tracking Gary the 
rest of the way. When I saw the catcher come up the line, I knew we had it." 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm? Owen literally jumped for joy and didn't come down until his 
teammates relaxed their grip so he could wrap his arms around DiSarcina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, when you win in the ninth, it's always exciting," he said sheepishly. 
"We've been scuffling lately, so this was pretty satisfying. Maybe this is 
something we can build on." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. And if not, it's a moment they can save for the 1994 highlight film. 
After all, there haven't been that many.

POSTAL OFFICIALS ARE TRYING TO LICK MAIL THEFTS; CRIME: MISSING ANY LETTERS?

 The check is in the mail -- or is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of Huntington Park and Walnut Park have been left wondering 
after a series of postal vehicle break-ins and robberies of postal service 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Blocks of residents' mail have been stolen more than 20 times this year, said 
Mike Gomez, vice president of the Walnut Park Community Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's just a fraction of postal thefts in the Los Angeles division, which 
stretches from San Luis Obispo to the outskirts of San Diego, said Pamela 
Prince, media liaison for the Postal Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, thieves have broken into 52 vehicles and robbed about a dozen 
carriers each month. And during its last fiscal year, from October, 1992, to 
September, 1993, the U.S. Postal Service reported 524 vehicle break-ins and 91 
employees robbed -- some at gunpoint, one even with a meat cleaver -- in the 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those responsible are mainly well-organized rings that operate throughout the 
state," Prince said. The Los Angeles division consistently has the highest 
number of vehicle break-ins and robberies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last local incidents took place July 1 and 5, when about 850 residences in 
Huntington Park and Walnut Park were robbed of their mail. In those thefts, new 
postal service vehicles were pried open and bags of mail stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and third of each month are when most of these incidents take 
place, since those are targeted check-delivery days," said Prince, referring to 
the days many federal assistance checks are delivered. Mail thieves then try to 
cash the stolen checks at banks, grocery and liquor stores and check-cashing 
services, a task made easier by Los Angeles' burgeoning counterfeit 
identification industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, it's not that difficult to get a fake ID for about $50 in 
L.A.," said Detective James Lally of the County Sheriff's Department. "If you 
have a $500 stolen check in your hand, that's a pretty small investment. So 
what you get is one scam working off another."  
</P>
<P>
 Police in Huntington Park recently cracked down on that city's growing trade 
in illegal identification documents. Twenty-nine arrests were made in the 
two-week stakeout. Materials recovered in a June 9 raid included a laminating 
machine, photo equipment and fraudulent California driver's licenses and 
resident alien, Social Security and state identification cards.  
</P>
<P>
 "We now have verification programs to check people with phony IDs and checks 
that aren't theirs," said Roberto Aguilar, manager of Western Union in 
Huntington Park. "But the problem is getting a lot worse now, you can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves are known to travel as far as Phoenix to cash stolen checks. Wherever 
the checks are cashed, U.S. Postal Service inspectors say the operations are 
sophisticated and well-organized.  
</P>
<P>
 Prince also said that those who ultimately pay for this crime are the 
businesses that are fooled into cashing the checks and those whose checks are 
stolen. Businesses that cash stolen checks lose the amount written on each 
check, since banks don't reimburse them. For some businesses, this loss is 
compounded by a bad credit rating. "Ultimately, the person who cashes the 
stolen check is financially responsible," Prince said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the authorities' efforts haven't satisfied everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's utterly ridiculous for the federal government not to respond in a 
positive and proactive manner," said Gomez, criticizing the federal response to 
the robberies. "You might as well send a troop of Boy Scouts to Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez and other Walnut Park residents have made repeated appeals to the U.S. 
Postal Inspection Service, and the office of Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Los 
Angeles), which have both taken up investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Yolanda Chavez, Roybal-Allard's chief of staff, the easiest way 
to deter check thefts is for residents to have their checks deposited directly 
into their bank accounts. Chavez said her office plans to warn residents with a 
letter, informing them of the risks associated with routine mail delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service is also looking into other solutions, such as providing 
mail carriers with beepers and cellular phones. This would allow carriers to 
immediately inform police and postal inspectors of any situation they deem 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Inspection Service also hopes to implement locally a Customer Alert 
Program, in which customers who are home during the day can be on the lookout 
for postal crimes. Prince said that program holds promise: San Jose started the 
program in January and has had a 100% success rate in deterring break-ins.

MOVIES; CAN HE DO SIDE-SPLITTING ACTION?; DIRECTOR JAMES CAMERON IS KNOWN FOR 
EXPLOSIVE, EFFECTS-RIDDLED WORKS SUCH AS 'ALIENS' AND 'T2.' BUT WITH ARNOLD 
SCHWARZENEGGER'S LATEST, 'TRUE LIES,' HE HAD TO MAKE SURE THE COMEDY DIDN'T 
BLOW UP IN HIS FACE. 
</P>

<P>
 Director James Cameron is currently in front of the camera, not behind it, 
posing for some publicity shots for his new movie, "True Lies," and for a 
change, his assistants are directing him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smile," suggests a young woman who worked on makeup for his latest action 
epic. "You have a nice smile." 
</P>
<P>
 "How would you know?" Cameron good-naturedly demands. "You've never seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Every picture of you makes you look so mean," frets another assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The camera never lies," Cameron says -- and smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron, who turns 40 next month, is clearly enjoying goofing on his 
reputation as a hard-nosed task master; as a self-described "total, 
obsessive-compulsive filmmaker"; as a guy who, well, might be advised to switch 
to decaf. On this day, though, the week before "True Lies' " July 14 opening, 
he's positively relaxed, quick with a quip as well as that otherwise reticent 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 And this, despite the fact that the night before, at a crucial screening of 
his film before influential media, a projection glitch showed the film in what 
he decries as "slow-motion," dragged out the 2-hour-and-17-minute opus almost 
an extra 10 minutes. "It was driving me nuts; everybody was talllkiinnng . . . 
liiiike . . . thiiissss, " Cameron laments. "You work on a movie for a year, 
and then it gets shown in slow motion." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing was, practically nobody outside of Cameron noticed. Even at a 
protracted length on a faulty projector, "True Lies" largely operates at full 
throttle, particularly its final act, which easily boasts the most deliriously 
over-the-top action sequences of the year. Put it this way: This is a movie in 
which an island in the Florida Keys is blown up by a nuclear device -- and 
that's not even the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the spectacle, "True Lies" is also a larky homage to the early 
James Bond movies and such spy vehicles as "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." Arnold 
Schwarzenegger -- whom Cameron elevated to superstardom a decade back with the 
first "Terminator" movie -- stars as Harry Tasker, ultra-cool super-agent 
battling international terrorism by day, monotonous family dreg by night. His 
wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), who takes him for no more than a mossy computer 
geek, is a trifle stifled by his domesticity and longs for an existence as 
thrilling as his true life. Naturally, she gets her wish, and just about 
everything not named Tasker gets blown away in the bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Cameron and Schwarzenegger were fans of the tongue-in-cheek spy thrillers 
that serve as their movie's antecedents, but recent efforts in the genre had 
disappointed them both. "The past 10 or 15 years have not seen any of those 
great Bond movies," says Schwarzenegger, who brought a French film, "La 
Totale!," with a similar theme to Cameron's attention. "We wanted to bring that 
idea -- the gadgets, the ballsy way Bond would do things -- into the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron is more blunt: "Bond's an aging, alcoholic Brit. C'mon! Let's pump 
some new blood into him!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Action Hero," last summer's mega-disappointment, loomed heavily over the 
two men. Schwarzenegger, says Cameron, spent a day or so balking at the idea of 
leaping in a single bound from one action-comedy to another.  
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about why it didn't work, and I felt that it was because the film 
was laughing at Arnold and the genre and his fans from the outside, instead of 
laughing with them from the inside, which is what we would be doing," Cameron 
says. "Besides I wanted to do a comedy, since I hadn't done one before, so I 
wasn't about to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of "Last Action Hero," Cameron drolly observes, "not being funny is kind of a 
deficit for a movie that's supposed to be a comedy." He admits, however, that 
an action-comedy is "a lethal combination, a tricky souffle. I don't know if we 
pulled it off here 100%, but I know people laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger says simply, "I never liked the phrase, 'action-comedy.' I 
prefer to let the people discover the comedy in the movie, like they do in the 
James Bond movies. They don't go to the movie for the comedy, but it's there. 
That's what accounted for my hesitation." Still, Schwarzenegger believes the 
humor in "True Lies," sewn into the fabric of the story, easily bests the gags 
tossed helter-skelter throughout his earlier effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cameron, Schwarzenegger maintains, is a director who inspires both trust 
and courage in him -- whether it regards trying comedy again or executing the 
stunts the movie required. Among the activities that compose just another day 
at Harry Tasker's office are swimming under water with a spreading wall of 
flames fanning out on the surface, trying to coax a horse to jump from one 
building to another and, in the film's most outrageous sequence, bouncing 
around the Miami skyline in a Harrier -- a military jet with helicopter-style 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You trust him not to lead you to the path of death," Schwarzenegger deadpans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron maps things out carefully, he says, but "if you screw up, no one can 
provide you with safety. If I say I can dive for 100 yards, without breathing, 
under water, and I screw up and can only go for 50 yards, I'll be burned to 
shreds." 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't happen, but, Schwarzenegger says, "In a scene on the rooftop of 
the hotel, the horse freaked out and almost stepped literally over the rooftop. 
If he had taken one more step, we would've fallen 30 feet to the ground." 
Instead, Schwarzenegger emerged from the movie with only the usual amount of 
scratches and scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger was hardly the only performer placed in seeming danger. In one 
sequence, Curtis is rescued from a careening limousine seconds before it 
plummets into the water around a bombed-out segment of the Seven-Mile Bridge in 
the Florida Keys. Cameron says, "The trick to that is she was never in the car. 
She was attached to the helicopter and the helicopter flew up and matched the 
speed of the car and dropped her in there. So there was never a way that she 
could go off with the car." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the filmmakers never actually blew up the bridge, although, 
Cameron says with a laugh, "We did ask. We always ask first. On 'T2,' we blew 
up a building that was a rental. But we asked: 'We're gonna rent your building 
-- and by the way, we're gonna blow it up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not getting permission to blow up the real thing just means Cameron 
and his team of effects technicians have to get creative. All of Cameron's 
prior major-studio directing efforts -- "Aliens," "The Abyss" and "Terminator 
2" -- have won Oscars for their special effects, and "True Lies" just might 
continue the trend. It's virtually impossible to tell where the reality ends 
and the computer imaging begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this film, the way this film advances the state of the art is 
that -- I want to say this in a way that doesn't sound like I'm bragging -- our 
goal was to combine techniques seamlessly," Cameron brags, but only a little. 
"We didn't want to create something flashy, like the T-1000 coming out of the 
floor. What we tried to do was spend hours and months at computer work stations 
doing things that are totally invisible in the final film -- where you don't 
know whether you're seeing something that happened full-size or miniature, or a 
composite. There are over 35 composite shots in the final sequence cut into the 
real rooftop in Miami, and you can't tell the difference. We could composite 
the shots six or more different ways. Jet pointing this way, jet pointing that 
way. Jet closer, jet further away. We could put in different backgrounds. Every 
single trick I ever learned in visual effects was called into play in that 
sequence, and some new stuff that hadn't been created. It's probably the most 
complicated single effects sequence I've ever done." 
</P>
<P>
 All that effort, and Cameron was actually most concerned about other elements 
in the movie. He requested an extra two weeks of post-production -- not to 
complete the effects, but to find the perfect pitch for the film's comic 
moments. "The most important thing was that the tone be right and that the 
comedy worked," he says. "I know how to do the action stuff, I knew the effects 
stuff would work. I wanted a chance to get it in front of an audience and 
fine-tune it a little bit. For comedy, that's absolutely vital to put the film 
in front of an audience. That's something I didn't have to do on 'T2.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And, as usually happens when the names James Cameron or Arnold Schwarzenegger 
are associated with a movie, the budget was pumped up, widely reported to be 
somewhere between $100 million and $120 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent a lot of money," Cameron says unapologetically. "It's like a really 
good value for a $7.50 ticket. That's the way anybody should look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cameron, the reason studios are sheepish about announcing exact 
budget figures is because "everybody in this business is afraid of failure. And 
the more afraid you are of failure, the more you program yourself for defeat. 
They're afraid of the consequences -- if the film fails, it fails relative to 
how much it cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to me, if the film fails, I've failed. So I don't care how much the movie 
cost. It's a different mind-set for the filmmaker than it is for the studio. 
It's always gonna be that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Cameron vows he will bring down costs on his next project for 
20th Century Fox, the comic-book adventure "Spider-Man," and will do so by 
avoiding working with American unions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really stuck it to us," he says of the unions. "But I'm not gonna be 
stuck twice. We tried to negotiate with them and I told them that if we were 
not able to come to terms that I would shoot out of the country next time. So I 
will shoot out of the country next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron's movies have come at a price beyond budgets that stretch to the ozone 
layer: He has watched his career help splinter three marriages. "It's really 
one of the problems with this business, and with a lot of high-pressure 
businesses, where in order to be competitive, you have to invest all of 
yourself into it," he maintains. "And sometimes there's not a lot left over to 
give to someone else. That's a classic problem, and I don't know that there's a 
solution to it."  
</P>
<P>
 That two of his former wives are also in the film industry -- producer Gale 
Ann Hurd and director Katherine Bigelow -- didn't seem to help. "I think the 
thinking there was, if I get someone as driven as myself, then they can't 
criticize me," he says, then laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 One aspect of that drive that sets him apart from other action filmmakers is 
his meticulous attention to the composition of shots, even in stunt scenes. 
Where many directors are happy just to get the stunt committed to celluloid, 
Cameron looks both for a spectacular thrill and a carefully sculpted image, 
which means demanding, nearly impossible camera work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crew accuses me of intentionally making the shots hard," Cameron says 
with a laugh. "The key grip will come up to me and say, 'There's probably a way 
to make this harder, but you just haven't found it yet.' But I try to keep it 
challenging every single day." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this desire to "keep it challenging" that contributes to Cameron's 
legendary on-set demeanor, a take-no-prisoners management style that inspired 
crew T-shirts that read, "You can't scare me -- I work for Jim Cameron." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwarzenegger says that Cameron's ends justifies his means. "He's a fanatic 
about realism. He doesn't shy away from any scene; he can do anything. He's 
totally focused -- nothing else exists for him during a movie -- and he expects 
that of others. I have the ultimate respect for him." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call my style relaxed," Cameron says with something approaching 
understatement. "I walked down to Katherine Bigelow's set, 'Strange Days,' 
recently, and it's like New Age filmmaking, everybody's so calm." He laughs at 
the very idea, then defends himself. "I never grew up in a film culture of any 
kind: I didn't go to film school, I didn't set foot on any other director's set 
-- I just sort of started doing it. So I've kind of evolved my own method, for 
good or bad."

 They came to Watts from all over the world to listen to the prophets. 
</P>
<P>
 "To light up Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, New York, it takes billions and 
billions of watts . . to light up Los Angeles, it only took one. . . . I 
remember Watts," poet Otis O'Solomon chanted to the beat of a bongo. His 
partners, Anthony Hamilton Amde and Richard Dedeaux, echoed the words to the 
jazzy rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Their audience, a group of international journalists and foreign dignitaries, 
listened attentively as the trio of poets known as the Watts Prophets told the 
tale of the past, present and future of their community in their unique style. 
</P>
<P>
 "The poem, 'I Remember Watts,' spans two rebellions," Dedeaux said the next 
day at a performance in Long Beach. "The more things change, the more they 
remain the same. But there's hope in everything. Something good has to come out 
of it. . . . Look at us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's precisely what the Los Angeles Tourism Industry Development Council 
wanted -- for outsiders to look at the cultural treasures of South-Central and 
its surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit to the Watts Towers and its arts center Tuesday was part of a bus 
tour titled "South Central Renaissance: The Struggle for Community." Third in a 
series of "Insight Tours" planned to coincide with the World Cup, the tours 
were designed to take foreign journalists and visitors to several Los Angeles 
neighborhoods commonly considered to be smoldering capitals of gang violence 
and racial tension. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose was to identify resources in these communities that are in stress 
and to construct building blocks that will elevate tourism promotion and 
development," said Billi Romain, project coordinator of the Tourism Industry 
Development Council, the nonprofit group sponsoring the tours. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, organizers wanted to attract the hundreds of foreign and national 
reporters that came to cover the World Cup in Pasadena. But a low turnout of 
soccer journalists prompted the council to invite along other reporters and 
officials of the tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also offered tours of East Los Angeles, Hollywood and the 
Pico-Union/Koreatown districts. Similar tours of these areas after the World 
Cup are still on the drawing boards, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months, community organizers and tourism industry workers 
developed plans and schedules to showcase their cultural and economic regions. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a busload of 40 tourists -- including representatives from the 
Australian, Dutch, German and Hungarian consulates and reporters from England, 
Italy and Japan -- were driven through southern Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Crespi, a reporter covering the World Cup for the Italian newspaper 
L'Unita, said he never imagined that he would venture into South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a misunderstanding of this area in Europe. The only time you hear 
about this place is when there's bad news," Crespi said as the bus motored up 
Central Avenue after a stop at the historic Dunbar Hotel. "L.A. is scary when 
you first get here, but this tour helped me to get rid of a lot of false ideas 
that I had." 
</P>
<P>
 Legendary for hosting America's great jazz musicians during the time when 
African Americans weren't allowed to stay at other hotels, the Dunbar was a 
major stop in the five-hour tour. Fire Station No. 30, the first all-black fire 
company in segregated Los Angeles, and the former Black Panthers Headquarters 
at 41st Street were also singled out as points of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour also stopped at the Watts/Century Latino Organization, where visitors 
were introduced to African American and Latino leaders. It continued through 
culturally vibrant Leimert Park and ended at the William Grant Still Art 
Center, where a reception included a performance of the Caribbean sounds of 
Bobby Matos. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bus stopped at the Watts Towers about midway through the tour, 
visitors talked to local youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watts is very stereotyped," said Jamal Rivers, 17, a resident of Watts and 
docent at the Watts Arts Center. "Of course, you have the shootings, but the 
media never comes here to see the good side." 
</P>
<P>
 Hungarian Consul General Andres Marton agreed: "There are so many beautiful 
things here to see," he said, looking away from the towers and toward 
surrounding homes. "Look how they adorn their houses with the beautiful 
flowers. You can see the hopes and dreams of the inhabitants here." 
</P>
<P>
 The words of hope rang similar to what the Watts Prophets recited earlier in 
their poem, "Breathe What You Need." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sprinkle the seeds of faith, love, love, love . . . and work early in the 
garden of the young child's mind and divineness will occupy its time. . . . "

SLUMLORD PROVIDES PLAY TIME TO AVOID JAIL TIME; COURTS: UNPRECEDENTED 
PLEA-BARGAIN AGREEMENT CALLS FOR GIVEAWAY OF $5,000 WORTH OF TOYS. MORE THAN 
FOUR DOZEN CHILDREN SHOW UP TO RECEIVE GIFTS AT LAS FAMILIAS DEL PUEBLO.

 Give children a toy and they'll embrace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them more than one and they'll jump for joy. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them as many as they want, and . . . well, the energized toddlers will 
turn the place into a romper-room madhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened Tuesday when the city attorney's office delivered to the 
kids at Las Familias del Pueblo $5,000 worth of toys -- given at the expense of 
a convicted slumlord in an unprecedented plea bargaining arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have given away hundreds and hundreds of toys," said Alice Callaghan, 
executive director of the garment workers' community center at 307 E. 7th St. 
"It looked like killer territory there. I wasn't going in." 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 children ages 5 to 15 lined up at the community center, sometimes 
excitedly lunging forward, to take the various toys that city officials brought 
out from the piles and piles of boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barney!" shouted one girl, as she spotted the popular cuddly, purple 
dinosaur. "I want a Barney." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a half-hour, a dozen or so remote-controlled red Ferraris were zooming 
around the Las Familias center, while Barneys could be heard saying the 
tape-recorded message: "I love you, I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 The kids were too excited to care how the early Christmas presents made their 
way into their hands or who was playing Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are children of sweatshop workers," Callaghan said. "These are really 
poor families. The typical income of our families is probably $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "(So) it's really rare to get all these little toys," she said. "It's like 
Christmas in July." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claus, at least for that day, turned out to be Sumruey Aueyong, 38, of 
Arcadia, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aueyong pleaded no contest in May to 10 building, health and safety code 
violations at the Brownstone Hotel, a three-story, 59-room complex nearby Las 
Familias, said Richard Bobb, head of the city attorney's housing task force. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his second conviction -- the first one being a 1992 case in which he 
faced similar slum charges -- and Aueyong could have faced up to five years in 
jail or a $30,000 fine, or both, Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, his attorney offered a plea bargain in which Aueyong, who also owns a 
wholesale toy business, would serve 100 hours of community service, pay $7,342 
in fines and city costs and donate $5,000 worth of toys, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we have gotten cash contributions (from plea-bargain sentences), 
but we never have gotten things like this," Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aueyong couldn't be reached for comment. But his attorney described him as "a 
charitable guy . . . always making donations to his religious temple." 
</P>
<P>
 "The image of the slumlord is one that doesn't really fit too well with him," 
said Daniel Behesnilian, adding that Aueyong and his wife say they have 
invested $60,000 to $80,000 to maintain the hotel only to see it damaged or 
dirtied by its tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Behesnilian nor Aueyong showed up during the toy giveaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney, who planned to attend the Las Familias event but was pulled away 
to a court case, said he likes to brainstorm innovative plea-bargaining 
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Aueyong case, "it just seemed like instead of donating cash money or 
paying more in fines to the city that it would make sense to have a nonprofit 
organization benefit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just feels good when as part of an overall bargain you can do some good 
and bring some smiles onto people's faces." 
</P>
<P>
 Nalleli Garcia was among the happy campers last week. By day's end, she had 
collected nine toys in a large trash bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Nintendo video games, "I have (only) one teddy bear," said the 
8-year-old girl, who was looking forward to bringing home company for the 
stuffed animal. 
</P>
<P>
 She liked Barney the most because "it talks."

COVER STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, art's first generation spanned the late 1950s to the early 
1970s. First there was Assemblage, Pop and the Light and Space artists in 
Venice.Then there was Bruce Nauman. The first group included many artists -- 
among them Billy Al Bengston, Ed Ruscha, Robert Irwin and James Turrell -- who 
defined a clean, serene image of their city. Nauman, in reaction, made art that 
questions everything, from space, to light, to words to the meaning of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Nauman's sharp, concise, wry and provocative sculptures, neon, video 
installations and every-other-sort-of-medium have earned him a reputation as 
one of the most important and revered American artists working today. Long 
since departed from Los Angeles for a home in New Mexico, he continues to be 
the inspiration and role model for innumerable younger artists working here and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A retrospective look at Nauman's career opens today at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, and in recognition of that event, Calendar asked painter and 
Newsweek art critic Peter Plagens, author of the pivotal book "Sunshine Muse: 
Contemporary Art on the West Coast" (1974), to recall the early days when both 
he and Nauman had studios in Pasadena, a center of L.A.'s then-burgeoning art 
scene.

 From 1972 until it gradually pooped out sometime in '78 or '79, there was a 
standing weekly artists' basketball game. We'd meet every Sunday at 10 a.m. on 
the Santa Monica High School outdoor courts, 4th Street and Pico. We'd play for 
about two hours, under the blistering sun, or through puddles left by Saturday 
night's rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the guys were Westside boys: Bob Smith, Jud Fine, occasionally Doug 
Wheeler and very occasionally Bill Wegman. (Maybe it was just once: When one of 
Wegman's Weimaraners tried to join him on court during a fast break, causing a 
spill worthy of the Tour de France, Wheeler screamed that if Wegman's dog ever 
came back, his German shepherd would eat it.) And some of the participants came 
all the way from Pasadena: Ron Linden (who'd scoop me up on the way, at the 
Ventura Freeway and Laurel Canyon), Merwin Belin, Jay Willis, Richard Jackson 
and, usually, this one other guy. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore long pants more often than shorts, sometimes played in work shoes 
rather than sneakers, favored being a "skin" instead of a "shirt" and had a 
good build for the sport -- a little over 6 feet tall, thin, with wide, 
coat-hanger shoulders from which his sinewy arms appeared to hang straight 
down. He also seemed to have that snaky extra vertebra at hip level that 
competitive swimmers often possess. 
</P>
<P>
 The book on Bruce Nauman, conceptual artist and weekend forward, was that he 
couldn't go to his left, didn't penetrate much, had a soft touch from the 
baseline, didn't mind the dirty work of rebounding but could get frustrated if 
closely guarded. (Sometimes I did that, trying to body him out of shooting 
range with my big ass.) Bruce was a pretty dependable shower-upper, but as the 
'70s gradually slouched toward the '80s, this question was heard more and more 
on Sunday morning: "Where's Nauman?" And the answer would come back: "Oh, 
Bruce? He's in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade before Nauman's avocational stint as the Happy Hairston of 
the SaMoHi asphalt, New York painter Frank Owen met Nauman in grad school at UC 
Davis. As Owen remembers it, Nauman didn't hang out much, because he'd arrived 
from Wisconsin already married to his first wife, Judy. (Later she changed her 
name to Justine Time.) He hadn't quite given up painting, but he'd already 
started to make his characteristic odd objects and manifest his laconic, 
Duchampian personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce wasn't a wise-ass," Owen recalls, "but he wasn't afraid to take charge 
of a situation and put his stamp on it. Like coming into a crit before 
everybody else arrived, and dumping a latex sculpture on the floor, then not 
showing up for the crit. When everybody else came, there was the ominous object 
on the floor, and people were left asking, 'Why isn't the guy here to explain 
himself?' The object was all the more ominous for that. Bruce had a talent for 
figuring out the power equation between objects and the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman obtained his master of fine arts degree in 1966 and went to San 
Francisco. He taught at the Art Institute, got a little studio in the Mission 
District and made art out of what Owen calls "studio messes." Then Nauman moved 
down to Pasadena in '69, because he could move in with his grad-school buddy 
Richard Jackson, who'd rented Walter Hopps' big, old wooden house on North 
Orange Grove Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, Pasadena was the local art world's second city within the 
national art world's second city. Venice was the headquarters of the recently 
discovered (by the art magazines) "L.A. Look" of Billy Al Bengston, Larry Bell, 
Craig Kauffman, DeWaine Valentine, et al. But it had become too expensive for 
many artists. Seekers of big, funky studio spaces at cheap rents looked 
elsewhere. They often landed in the Temple Street quarter near Beaudry, or Ed 
Ruscha's Baby Jane section of Hollywood, or Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1970 to '78, painter Walter Gabrielson and I split a 3,500-square-foot 
loft, at the corner of Fair Oaks Avenue and Union Street in the Old Town 
section of Pasadena, as a day studio. I talked on the phone a couple of weeks 
ago to Gabrielson in his Santa Barbara storefront atelier and asked him to jog 
my memory. After furnishing his obligatory philosophical nugget ("It's hotter 
'n sin up here, and sin gets mighty hot"), Gabrielson complied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where could we go?" he said. "Downtown wasn't yet on the art map, and the 
Valley was too far from anything that counted. Pasadena was a nice place, with 
an interesting circle of decay in the middle. Once a year, you'd have that 
grotesquerie, the Rose Parade, when all of the wealth of Pasadena would rear 
its head. And then it'd be gone. The new Pasadena Museum had opened about the 
time we moved there, and I was surprised at the number of artists who were 
working around us: Don Sorenson, Shiro Ikegawa, Ben Sakoguchi, Doug Bond, Hap 
Tivey, Karen Carson, Peter Lodato, Scott Greiger, Helen Pashgian, Denise Gale, 
Nauman and even Charles White in his weird studio at the Green Hotel. For a 
while, it was cookin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Nauman had the top floor in a nondescript two-story building a few doors west 
of Walter and me on Union. (I have a slide somewhere of Nauman leaning out his 
window taking a picture of me as I was taking a picture of his building.) It 
contained a desk and a beat-up office chair, a 6-foot stack of old L.A. Times 
and a lot of empty deli cups. In all the time I knew Nauman in Pasadena, I 
ventured up there maybe only a couple of times. That wasn't because (I'm sure) 
I wrote a negative piece in Artforum on his (I thought) premature retrospective 
at the L.A. County Museum of Art in 1972 and didn't want to face his reaction. 
It was because I was afraid he'd be working on something totally 
incomprehensible (what, I don't know -- perhaps his name enlarged 100 times, or 
a blue light corridor) that would make me want to give up abstract painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen says Nauman once told him that an art idea took almost two weeks of 
pacing, reading mysteries and boring himself to death. But there was always the 
chance that real life might interfere. If the two weeks were interrupted, 
Nauman said, he'd have to start all over. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change Pasadena wrought on Nauman was his switch from wingtips to 
the cowboy boots he bought out at Nudie's in the Valley. "The major 
conversational topics between us in the 1970s," Owen says, laughing, "were Paul 
Bond boots and the relative merits of rhino over elephant. Maybe now if I could 
get rid of my sneakers and get some wingtips, I could become a rich investment 
banker." Whether the wardrobe had anything to do with it or not, Nauman became 
the neighborhood famous artist. One day I'd see him on Union Street, in his 
assumed uniform of grubby jeans and white T-shirt, and the next I'd run into 
him at the airport -- me catching a PSA flight for some $300 lecture gig, and 
Bruce in a 5X felt cowboy hat, just back from a Kunsthalle show in Italy or 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Gabrielson says, "I never saw any sign of Bruce wearing his fame. He was 
very good at not letting you know how good he was. He didn't have a need to 
show you that he had a personality that was hip and cool. A lot of artists wear 
their careers on their sleeves. But Bruce didn't waste his material on small 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, whose close friendship with Nauman all through the '70s survived their 
being on opposite coasts, concurs as to Nauman's genuineness: "Every time Bruce 
came to New York, he'd bring these novel house gifts. For instance, one day in 
July, 1968, we spent a whole day trying to dam a rivulet up at my place in the 
country. Afterwards, we spent a couple of hours trying to skip unskippable 
rocks across a pond. A few years later, Bruce trudged up five flights of stairs 
to our loft with 40 pounds of perfect Stanislaus River skipping rocks that he'd 
bagged up and put in the overhead compartment on the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the difference between Owen's anecdote, and something that Billy Al 
Bengston said to me during roughly the same time. I was on my way into Riko 
Mizuno's gallery on La Cienega Boulevard. The gallery was in the rear, 
connected to the street by a narrow driveway, filled to near capacity, in this 
instance, by Bengston's big, shiny, bronze Cadillac. As I tried to wedge 
between it and an exterior gallery wall, Bengston emerged from the gallery. 
Attempting to make a joke, or something, I nodded at the car and said to Billy, 
"Sure do keep it up nice." Bengston answered, "They have men who do that sort 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The story illustrates not just the difference between Nauman, the democratic 
Duchampian who became a favorite of European collectors with titles like Count 
(Panza), and Bengston, the automotive aristocrat whose reputation remained, in 
the end, firmly local. It also delineates the difference between the two major 
L.A. artistic sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 One (the "L.A. Look") was on the wane -- at least as far as techno-crafted art 
objects were concerned -- by the mid-'70s. The other (Nauman's ur-grunge) was, 
to borrow the title of one of his early works, "Waxing Hot." The fading Venice 
sensibility was all about stylistic consistency, product polish, professional 
salesmanship (on the part of the artists, not just their dealers) and a 
quasi-mystical regional pride (artists turning their backs on that all Euro-New 
York modernist landfill and gazing out instead into the Pacific Rim's tequila 
sunsets). Nauman's take was just the opposite; deliberate inconsistency, 
avoiding cocktail parties and letting Konrad Fischer or Leo Castelli worry 
about selling art, and happily rummaging through modernism as if it were a flea 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be convenient to be able to extend the point, and say that Nauman's 
sensibility (which, blended with Andy Warhol's and Joseph Beuys', has carried 
the day in the art world during the past 20 years) represented Pasadena as a 
whole. But, truth be told, there was probably a lot more Venice-aping in the 
rickety lofts of Crown City than Nauman-imitating. But indirectly, Bruce did 
give Walter and me spiritual sustenance in our internal battle with the 
prevailing dichotomous distinction of art world legitimacy, that between "real" 
artists and "teaching" artists. 
</P>
<P>
 From the mid-'60s to the mid-'70s, teaching jobs were easier to come by than 
sales. Demographics, you-gotta-have-art liberalism and the proliferation of 
state college art departments were on the side of the young artist who wanted 
the security of a teaching job. Consequently, there seemed to be more artists 
of that bent than ambitious tyros who wanted the fleeting glamour of an 
affiliation with a hot gallery. "Real" artists -- while they might have had 
what Owen calls a "scut" job (art hauling, drywalling, etc.), or might have 
taken a visiting artist's gig for an infrequent semester at most -- lived 
mostly or entirely from selling their work. "Real" artists lived mostly in 
Venice, and aspiring "real" artists tried to come up with the scratch to move 
to Venice to be around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter and I, however, were teaching artists, at Cal State Northridge. Often, 
talking to some silk-shirt, suede-jacket Venetian at one opening or another, 
we'd get hit with, "Oh, that's right. You teach, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although Walter and I (and Karen Carson, who shared a Northridge office with 
us) were pretty good teachers, we also had enough art world ambition to know 
that the teaching job could suck us dry. Inquiring young minds wanted blood, 
and administrative old minds wanted lesson-plan automatons. We fought like hell 
to keep the system from bogging us down. We did defiant little things like 
labeling every drawer of our file cabinets "Job Security," and telling students 
sardonically that letters of recommendation to grad schools had to be purchased 
from a catalogue of standard models. We knew that the only way for our artistic 
spirits to survive was, as Gabrielson puts it, "to teach yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, Nauman was a low-frequency inspiration, a constant buzz in 
Pasadena that reminded us that an artist could not only pry himself free from 
teaching but actually prosper, worldwide, by being himself as much as it was 
humanly possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabrielson remembers the role model: "Nauman was that weird thing, a humanist 
artist and a formalist at the same time. He made art jokes that didn't get by 
on just being funny, which is what too many artists do today -- they have only 
the gag, and that's it. Nauman figured it out early, nailed it down and got on 
with it. Very few people have that, and that's the whole game; finding out who 
you are, what part of yourself you can make art out of, and doing it with 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Nauman had what seemed like nine simultaneous shows in New 
York, a handful of them downtown. I told Bruce that there should have been a 
banner across West Broadway proclaiming "Bruce Nauman Days in SoHo." 
</P>
<P>
 I went to the opening of one of those shows, at 65 Thompson Street, with 
Merwin Belin, who was visiting from Washington, D.C., where his version of a 
"scut" job had taken him. The place was packed to the rafters with stubbled 
gentlemen with moussed ponytails and Armani suits, willowy blond ladies with 
Italian accents and famous artists of all stripes. (Everybody comes out for 
Nauman.) "Bruce is at Leo's. He'll be here in about 20 minutes. Bruce'll be 
here in five." Well, when Nauman walked in, he immediately spotted Merwin, an 
old basketball buddy and conceptual artist whose career hasn't yet propelled 
him beyond the American Gallery at Al's Bar in downtown L.A. Hovering suits and 
blondes be damned; Bruce spent the first 20 minutes of his opening talking to 
Merwin. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen says incidents like that aren't charity on Nauman's part. "Bruce knows 
Merwin," he says. "Bruce likes Merwin. Bruce is comfortable with Merwin. He's 
kept things that way, so he can be just who he is, so he can be clear about 
that, and clear about making art." Right, but I'll bet he still can't go to his 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Bruce Nauman" opens today and runs through Sept. 25 at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art, 250 S. Grand Ave., (213) 621-6222). Tuesdays to Sundays, 11 
a.m.- 5 p.m.; Thursdays, 11 a.m.-8 p.m. Admission is $6, free on Thursdays 
after 5 p.m. The show was organized by the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, in 
association with the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Smithsonian 
Institution, Washington, D.C.

THEATER; UNTANGLING THE WEB; WITH 'KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN,' VANESSA WILLIAMS 
CAN ADD 'BROADWAY STAR' TO A RESUME ONCE MOST NOTABLE FOR THE TERM 'DEPOSED 
MISS AMERICA.' WHICH IS NOT TO SAY SHE'S FINISHED SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a yearbook picture of Vanessa Williams -- Horace Greeley High School, 
Class of 1981, Chappaqua, N.Y. -- the caption reads, "Follow your dream and 
I'll see you on Broadway." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen years later, the dream has finally come true. Vanessa Williams, in 
top hat, tails and a big grin, is on Broadway through Labor Day starring in the 
musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman," having taken over the title role from Chita 
Rivera. As both a '40s movie queen and an angel of death, Williams spins a web 
of menace and fantasy over this tale of two men sharing a cell in a South 
American prison -- one a Marxist revolutionary, the other a gay window-dresser. 
(Critics will start re-reviewing the show this week, and, according to a 
spokeswoman for the show, ticket sales already are strong.) 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a few unexpected detours along Williams' way, and the 
31-year-old pop star, former beauty queen and mother of two daughters and one 
son arrives on the Great White Way with, as she herself puts it, "more excess 
baggage" than most newcomers. The intervening years of celebrity -- and one 
bout of unexpected notoriety -- have left her with a few scars. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, the big grin is not much in evidence offstage. Despite her fawn-like 
appearance, Williams is all business when she sits down for an interview 
between matinee and evening performances in a dressing room crowded with floral 
tributes. Dressed in a simple white blouse and short ruffled skirt and perched 
on a divan, the green-eyed beauty is remarkably steely and self-contained, 
speaking safely in platitudes. Even when discussing difficult emotional moments 
in her life, she is unnervingly detached, as though the betrayal of any real 
feeling might somehow leave her endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I guess I was probably a little nervous," she says coolly, speaking of 
her audition for "Kiss" director Harold Prince and composer John Kander. "I 
mean, these guys are heavyweights of the musical theater, and it obviously 
meant a lot to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress's reticence around the press is understandable. Williams, after 
all, is married to a former publicist, Ramon Hervey, who is now her manager and 
who, no doubt, over the years has given her endless tips on how to handle the 
Fourth Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vanessa's not an easy person to get to know," says her husband of seven 
years. "She has a few really good friends that she's open with, but she 
considers publicity both an intrusion and a necessary evil. It's not a fear, 
but I think she feels she has to protect certain aspects of her life." 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, handsome and 13 years her senior, Hervey came into Williams' life at a 
crucial juncture. Almost 10 years ago to the day, in July, 1984, she was 
embroiled in a media scandal that ended with her abdication as the first black 
Miss America after nude photos of her surfaced in Penthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I advised her to be honest, to be real," Hervey recalls. "It was something 
that was going to stay with her for the rest of her life. She was very young 
and wasn't in any way emotionally prepared for the onslaught of media 
attention. She's become far less vulnerable and wiser in the maturing of her 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was only 21 at the time, and the euphoria that greeted her 
trailblazing ascension to the beauty crown was equaled by the dismay that met 
her precipitous fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "What got me through it?" she says, not too pleased the topic has surfaced 
again. "Oh, a sense of humor and detaching oneself from the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did I learn from it?" she adds, idly playing with a loose strand of her 
tawny-streaked hair. "At that point, I was cruising. So you realize . . . that 
life has a lot of ups and downs, peaks and valleys, and you've got to forge 
ahead. I knew it was just a momentary thing. I knew that my life wouldn't end, 
my career wouldn't be over. After all the dust settled, I knew that I'd get my 
chance to prove myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Broadway is just the latest front in Williams' determined drive to 
prove herself, one that has taken her from occasional guest stints on 
television shows, to a featured role in a 1985 Off Broadway musical, "One Man 
Band," to forgettable cameos in films (1991's "Harley Davidson & the Marlboro 
Man") and to breakthrough success as a top-selling pop recording artist with 
"The Right Stuff" in 1988 and "The Comfort Zone" in 1991. (Her third album, on 
Mercury, will be released this fall in conjunction with a concert tour.) 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to make her Broadway debut came late last year, when she 
traveled to Toronto to audition to replace Lonette McKee as Julie in Harold 
Prince's revival of "Show Boat." Garth Drabinsky, the Canadian producer of both 
the Broadway-bound "Show Boat" and "Kiss of the Spider Woman," suggested 
Williams might be more comfortable in a limited summer run as the replacement 
for Chita Rivera. That way she would not have to uproot her family from their 
Westchester County home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When she auditioned for Julie, I saw that Vanessa had a strong vocal prowess 
that could blow an audience away," Drabinsky said. "Vanessa has a youthful 
elegance in contrast to Chita's maturity and command, and she represents a 
different demographic to the theater. She also brings her own very sexy and 
sensual quality to the role." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging a certain trepidation in taking over the role from a 
musical legend like Rivera, Williams says she saw it as her "perfect showcase," 
with none of the pressure of opening in a Broadway show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It combines Las Vegas glitz with songs of drama and suspense as well as 
traditional Broadway top-hat-and-tail routines," she says. "It's everything 
I've ever wanted to do in theater." 
</P>
<P>
 She betrays a rare vulnerability in talking about her first performance June 
27, observing that she was more nervous than she had ever been. "Singing on the 
Grammys was just another gig compared to this," she says. Even her deli-counter 
man in Westchester called to wish her luck. "My mother, who never cries, got 
teary-eyed backstage afterward. Friends were sobbing. It was an unbelievable 
night because I knew I was living a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having seen Hector Babenco's 1985 film "Kiss of the Spider Woman" or read 
Manuel Puig's 1976 book on which the musical is based, Williams says, she was 
less worried about the emotional subtext of the role than "falling on my face 
out there." Indeed, a scab just below her knee is the result of one of the 
bone-banging crawls she must make across the metal-mesh webbing of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really think about the role being Latin at all," Williams says. "I 
think the music takes you there. And I didn't want to go Carmen Miranda with 
the '40s glamour stuff. That would've been too camp." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as playing the angel of death, she adds, "I thought her presence should 
be so still that it made you uncomfortable. Not menacing, not stalking, not 
overly dramatic but also with lots of power. So she's a little scary but not as 
gloomy or dark as she could be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds of Williams' own disciplined presence were planted early in the 
environment in which she grew up, as the only daughter of Helen and Milton 
Williams, both of whom taught music. Her mother performed in amateur 
theatricals and took the family often into Manhattan to see the latest Broadway 
musicals or dance performances, like those of Alvin Ailey's company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a happy time for me," Williams says. Although she and her brother, 
Chris, were raised in the small, predominantly white Westchester community of 
Millwood, the actress says, she experienced hardly any racism in her youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were taught to be the classic overachievers," Williams says. "My mother 
always said we'd have to be 100% better than anybody else just to be considered 
equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams studied French horn, piano, modern dance and voice, and she uses her 
classically trained command of music in the meticulous way she approaches her 
work today. "When you have a brain, people listen," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she entered the theater arts department at Syracuse University, 
she was single-minded about pursuing a Broadway career. Even before she would 
break the beauty queen color barrier, she had auditioned for the 1981 Broadway 
musical "Oh, Brother," which later flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 She makes clear that entering the series of pageants that would make her 
famous was an afterthought, which occurred when "Cyrano de Bergerac," an Equity 
production on the college campus she was set to play in, was canceled. She 
never went back to college, and now, she says, she misses finishing her degree 
and "beating the streets" with her college buddies, many of whom are still 
close friends and who were present at her first performance of "Kiss." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sheer fate, luck," she says. Thinking it over, she corrects herself. 
"Well, I don't know about . . . , " she adds with a grimace. "Happenstance, 
maybe." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During her nine-month reign as Miss America, Williams was quite outspoken, 
supporting abortion rights and denigrating pageants as "exploitative meat 
shows." (Today, she wouldn't allow her daughters to enter a pageant. "They 
wouldn't have a choice," she says.) Her comments hardly endeared her to pageant 
officials, who were distinctly unsupportive when the scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family and close friends, however, stood staunchly by her. And some in the 
media observed that the incident had revealed her to be "more human" and far 
more appealing than the Barbie-doll perfectionism of most beauty queens. 
Furthermore, when Williams met Hervey, she found a champion who could not only 
help her navigate the Penthouse controversy but also pick up the pieces 
afterward in a shared vision of what her career could be. They faced quite a 
few closed doors at first, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating knowing that you had the talent but that people couldn't 
see past all the excess baggage," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Williams was ready to make her Broadway debut in 1984 replacing 
Twiggy in the Gershwin musical "My One and Only." "Tommy Tune, everyone was in 
my corner," she recalls, "but Lee Gershwin, Ira's wife, vetoed the idea because 
she thought I was not appropriate theater material." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when "Checkmates," a play in which she appeared in Los Angeles, moved to 
Broadway, Williams was not taken along. And she was also considered briefly for 
a role in the musical "Carrie" but dropped when the producers decided not to 
"go black with the role," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it was a disappointment at the time," she says. "I wasn't jaded at 
that point. It hurts for a couple of days and then you move on. You can't dwell 
on the negative aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says she was never sure whether she was being rejected because of the 
past scandal, because she is black or because she simply didn't fit the 
requirements of the role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago when I auditioned for a Disney project that is out now ("The 
Lion King"), the head of the animation department said I wouldn't be 
appropriate for Disney animation but that I was fine for Touchstone," she says, 
referring to the Disney Co. label geared toward more adult fare. "That was 
probably the last blatant conflict between my talent and my past." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Peter Schneider, president of feature animation for Disney, says he 
has no recollection of such an exchange with Williams, he says, "We would never 
exclude a person based on his or her past history. If she was right for a role, 
we would certainly cast her." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Williams concedes that she now is far less bitter and vindictive about the 
ridicule she endured at the hands of talk-show hosts like Joan Rivers and David 
Letterman. That is partly because of her success and partly because her strong 
family orientation supersedes career. One reason she and her husband moved from 
Los Angeles back to suburban New York was so they could give their children a 
more traditional upbringing away from the what she calls the "hype and the 
wealth" of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't travel in elite circles," Williams says. "I just show up and do my 
job and leave. I don't live in that world. I don't care if my makeup is perfect 
when I go out on the street by myself. I enjoy my life and my independence too 
much to let fame or the industry ruin it for me. So much of my life is taken up 
with baking cakes, Brownie meetings, meeting the bus that takes them to public 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Williams' ambitions still cut a wide swath. She says she's eager 
to demonstrate she can manage light comedy in feature films as well as more 
dramatic fare. The life story of Dorothy Dandridge appeals to her because she 
was the "black Marilyn Monroe" -- a talented, beautiful but tragically insecure 
movie star who eventually took her own life. Like Williams, she was a 
trailblazer, the first black woman to be nominated for a best actress Oscar 
(for the 1954 film "Carmen Jones"). But unlike the assertive and forthright 
Williams, Dandridge had little reinforcement for her sense of self-worth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I speak to groups of troubled teens," Williams says, "I tell them the 
story of my life. This is what happened to me, this is how I fought through it. 
What made me strong was believing in myself. If you believe in yourself, you 
can endure anything."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: PICO-UNION; CHURCH PROGRAM IS A SAFE BET FOR YOUTHS 
</P>

 The Rev. Carlos Paiva finds it difficult to get any desk work done these days. 
Instead of peering down a quiet parking lot, the pastor of Angelica Lutheran 
Church now looks out his window every afternoon to see exuberant youngsters 
playing basketball and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very hard to read," the Peruvian-born Paiva said over the din. With a 
broad smile, he added: "Isn't it wonderful?" 
</P>
<P>
 The church is hosting Angelican Safe Summer, a new youth program that provides 
area parents with a free place to take their children for supervised 
recreation, tutoring and seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, modeled after the Safe Haven projects, is desperately needed, 
Director Martin Flores said. With few places for children to go after school in 
the densely populated neighborhood, he said, many wind up in front of a 
television or on a street corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real park around here for them, no libraries, no community pool, 
and the people who live here have real transportation problems," Flores said. 
"These kids need things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The program is offering a variety of activities to its 170 participants. 
Children can play outdoor sports, learn martial arts, work with arts and 
crafts, use computers or take drama classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores said the program is also reaching out to parents through Tuesday and 
Thursday workshops on issues such as AIDS, family planning, first aid and 
parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important, because where do the kids go when they leave here?" Flores 
said. "Parents are the main role models, and in some cases the only role 
models." 
</P>
<P>
 The program works closely with the Blazers Safe Haven home in South-Central, 
sharing teaching resources and splitting a $70,000 federal grant that led to 
the birth of the Angelican program. Organizers of the Angelican Safe Summer 
hope that their fledgling project, like the Blazers home, can become a fixture 
in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dream of a community center, and a new school there," Paiva said, pointing 
to properties around the church.  
</P>
<P>
 Finances and the future weren't on the mind of 10-year-old Cesar Sierra last 
week as he spent the afternoon on an Angelican-sponsored field trip to 
SoccerFest before returning to the church's busy playground. "I like it here 
because I met a lot of new friends," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Angelican Lutheran Church is at 1345 S. Burlington Ave., just south of 
Pico Avenue. The Safe Summer program is open from 1 to 7 p.m. weekdays, and 
will run through Aug. 26.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY AREA; U.S. TO FUND JOBS PROGRAM FOR YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Young people in three Mid-City communities will be the principal beneficiaries 
beginning this fall of an innovative job training and apprenticeship program 
funded by the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is one of 16 cities nationwide selected to participate in the 
Youth Fair Chance program.The city will receive $3 million over the next 18 
months plus an additional $1 million annually for three more years if the 
program is successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's application, initiated by Councilman Mike Hernandez, targets 
residents who are 14 to 30 and live in portions of Pico-Union, Westlake and 
Temple-Beaudry. The application cited high rates of crime, poverty, teen 
pregnancy and high school dropouts in the three communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no doubt that on a national scale, these communities are unique in 
many ways," Hernandez said. "The federal government recognized that and agreed 
that we needed this funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that people are just beginning to understand that if you focus 
resources where they are most needed, and then you change those needs, then you 
can change entire communities," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Community Development Department will begin compiling a waiting 
list of interested applicants this month. Successful applicants will 
participate in job training, school-to-work transition programs and 
apprenticeship programs. Participants will also help rehabilitate housing.  
</P>
<P>
 The program's organizers hope to serve about 1,000 youths over a four-year 
period, said Tony Perez, press deputy for Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating agencies include the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, RLA, 
Ketchum Downtown YMCA, the Carpenters Union and Belmont High School.

 Chul Ho Lee, 72, has received his high school diploma from Belmont Community 
Adult School, but he has no intention of resting on his laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 His next step? "Study more, of course," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking scholarly in his blue cap and gown, Lee flashed a wide smile when 
asked how he felt about his accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very exciting," he said. "It's not easy to learn English at my age. 
My children can't believe it. They never considered it possible, but they are 
very happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the Lees' eight children were able to attend the June graduation 
ceremony, including four who made the trip from South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know he's the oldest student we've had," said Maria Kahler, 
assistant principal for adult community services. "Mr. Lee has been a real 
inspiration to his class. He encourages youngsters to just buckle down."  
</P>
<P>
 Not long after Lee, who earned a college degree in South Korea, and his wife, 
Young Sun, immigrated to the United States in 1987, he began helping out at a 
friend's market.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I couldn't communicate with the customers so I decided to give up that 
job and just study English," Lee said. After a few years of English study, he 
enrolled in the Belmont adult school classes in April, 1992, and earned more 
than enough credits for his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 A devoted student, Lee said he rises each day at 4:30 to study English. But 
mathematics is his favorite subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Lee promised to come back to help tutor students in our math lab," said 
Keith Stovall, one of his teachers. "He was a math teacher in Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 After a vacation on the East Coast, Lee will resume his studies at a community 
college.  
</P>
<P>
 "I will never give up studying," he said. JAKE DOHERTY

POP MUSIC; IN SEARCH OF SUPERUNKNOWN SEATTLE; SINK THE STEREOTYPES. 
SOUNDGARDEN'S CHRIS CORNELL REMEMBERS HIS CITY'S VARIETY -- NOT SIMPLY A VISION 
OF BROKEN GUITARS WITH KISS STICKERS. HE REMEMBERS BANDS WHO INFLUENCED THE 
BANDS -- AND THE PITFALLS HE AVOIDED.

 Pop quiz: Of the four bands that embody the Seattle rock sound in the public 
mind -- Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains and Soundgarden -- which was there 
first? 
</P>
<P>
 You win a ratty wool hat if you said Soundgarden. The quartet predated the 
others and has outlasted nearly all its original cohorts from the mid-'80s, 
when it was gathering its audience in a music scene that was energized, diverse 
and undiscovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, seven years after its first record, with the "Seattle sound" a dominant 
force in rock, Soundgarden is finally partaking in the commercial success of 
the movement it spearheaded. Its fourth album, "Superunknown," is by far its 
best-selling, entering the sales charts at No. 1 in March and remaining in the 
Top 10, with total sales near 2 million. The group headlines the 6,000-seat 
Grand Olympic Auditorium tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Soundgarden -- singer Chris Cornell, guitarist Kim Thayil, drummer Matt 
Cameron and bassist Ben Shepherd -- voices the mood of apocalyptic dread that 
has been embraced by rock's new generation, but with an individuality and 
invention that have made it the most critically favored of the Seattle bands 
through the years (this side of Nirvana) 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent phone interview, Cornell, 29, assessed the evolution of a Seattle 
music scene that he believes has lost its diversity and cohesion, and told how 
he has avoided the pitfalls that have ensnared many of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What do you remember about those early days in the Seattle clubs? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I know that there are plenty of misconceptions about what it was like. 
'Cause, really, out of the four main bands that people base the Seattle scene 
on, three of them weren't actually bands at all during the period of time when 
it was a real scene, when no one outside of Seattle knew anything about it. 
Bands like Alice in Chains and Nirvana came out of that. They were influenced 
by that. They weren't in the middle of it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle scene at the time wasn't at all anywhere near what it's perceived 
as. There were a lot of different styles of music happening that weren't 
totally guitar-based or male-based. It was a large variety. There were as many 
effeminate, almost European-influenced bands as there were bands with broken 
guitars with KISS stickers on them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has that changed now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I still live there, but we're not playing shows in clubs with other bands 
every month, so I really don't know where it's at. 
</P>
<P>
 I do know with Soundgarden and Green River (a progenitor of Pearl Jam and 
Mudhoney), we had real good luck with audiences with selling out shows and that 
kind of thing. I think a lot of other bands at the time started kind of trading 
whatever it was about them that was really unique and started to drift more 
toward this guitar-rock kind of thing because it was working, or because all of 
a sudden we're getting good reviews, or all of a sudden someone from a record 
label is coming to look at us. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of the end really, I guess some sort of weird greed or 
jealousy thing, where people either started to dislike us because we were 
getting attention, or people were trying to sound like us because we were 
getting attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: A lot of reviews of your new album mention a Beatles influence, and Led 
Zeppelin and Black Sabbath are constantly brought up. Is that a fair summation 
of your influences? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most of our influences have never been cited in the press, because most of 
their readers don't have any idea who those bands are. Usually in a situation 
where somebody says Beatles or Led Zeppelin or Black Sabbath, they're stepping 
over like 15 other bands that I listened to way more than those. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Like who? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Like the entire post-punk movement of music. . . . In the U.S., Black Flag, 
the Minutemen, Meat Puppets, Husker Du, Scratch Acid, Big Black, Butthole 
Surfers, that kind of thing. . . . Or some of the British stuff that was 
happening around the same time or a little bit earlier, like Wire and Killing 
Joke, Bauhaus, Joy Division. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What was it about that music that you responded to? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I never heard anything like it before. And aside from the fact that you 
could see those bands in small clubs all the time in Seattle when they'd come 
through, they were putting out records all the time. It was really exciting 
because you could go out and buy a new record and bring it home and it was 
really vital, it wasn't a reissue of some (expletive) or a record you'd heard 
on AOR radio 3 million times. . . . It was sort of a constant for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the emotional tone of your new album? Is it fair to characterize 
it as dark, despairing, apocalyptic? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you'd be overlooking some songs if you said that. I mean, there are 
songs that are lighter-hearted than anything we've ever done before, like 
"Spoonman," "Kickstand," "Superunknown." So considering that, in some ways it's 
less dark overall, as a package. Previous to this, it seemed like lyrically 
everything was sort of that way. 
</P>
<P>
 I think sometimes people take aggression in music as being like visceral and 
almost celebratory or something, regardless of what the lyrics are saying. And 
the impression now, since it's not as aggressive, is that it's dark and gloomy 
because it doesn't have that visceral edge to it. But I'm not trying to say 
there isn't a bunch of dark and gloomy lyrics, 'cause I suppose there is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: That tone and those sentiments have obviously struck a chord with a young 
audience. Is that a generational thing? Are you sharing experiences you've all 
grown up with? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hard to tell. It could be. I'm sure it's partly a generational thing. 
And then I'm sure there's more of a human part of it where it doesn't matter 
really what age you are. Probably what would keep it generational is that 
someone's interest in really loud or really aggressive music is gonna change as 
they get older. But lyrically I don't feel as though I'm a representative of a 
generation particularly. I mean I think it goes a little bit broader in terms 
of the human experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you want to be an important band -- the kind that helps an audience 
define itself and its outlook? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That's always by accident. The ones that try never seem to do a damn thing, 
and the ones that seem to wish it wasn't happening are the ones that make all 
the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel any pressure to be a spokesman? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know where that pressure would come from. I'm not sponsoring 
Gatorade or anything. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: From the media? You constantly read about Eddie Vedder feeling the pressure 
of that role. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, but that's an entirely different case. That's somebody who's thrown 
into that position and basically titled that. If you called me that tomorrow 
and everyone said, "He's our man," then I'd probably feel some kind of 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When you see him struggling with that role, and then consider Kurt Cobain's 
suicide and see other colleagues of yours going through drug and other 
problems, how do you explain your ability to carry on without succumbing to any 
of that? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the core of it has to be at some point as a kid probably I became 
sort of defiant and sort of unwilling to be directed by anybody for any reason. 
I don't really listen to anything anyone says. . . . I just don't feel any 
pressure. Why don't I feel any pressure? I think the reason is because I don't 
care or even really know what other people think or expect of me, because it's 
never really concerned me much.*

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: WEST ADAMS; ARSENIO'S HAUL SMALL BUT 'EMPOWERING' 
</P>

 The atmosphere in the parking lot of the First African Methodist Episcopal 
Church resembled a summer carnival, with bunches of metallic balloons 
decorating posts, banners hand-colored by children draped across a stair rail, 
and a parade of speakers enthusiastically cheered by onlookers nibbling ice 
cream bars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the message on the banners was serious: "Increase the Peace. Thanks for 
Your Guns." 
</P>
<P>
 The sobering purpose of the Monday event was to raise awareness of urban 
violence and persuade illegal gun owners in South-Central to turn in their 
arms, no questions asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over the daylong "gun drive" was a man who hoped his high profile 
could help achieve that goal: actor and comedian Arsenio Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 By Hall's measure, he succeeded. The drive produced a rifle, three handguns, a 
machete, a pellet gun and several small knives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said when I started this thing, if I get one gun, save one life, that's a 
great thing," he said. "One woman came up to me, gave me her knife and said, 
'Here, take it. I'm afraid I might use it on somebody.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hall made a two-hour appearance along with First AME Pastor Cecil Murray and a 
host of community and youth leaders. All emphatically called for the end of gun 
warfare in the inner city. Though some spectators who braved the hot sun were 
more interested in meeting Hall, most turned up to support the anti-violence 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig X said he came from Compton to see if Hall's campaign was, in his words, 
the real deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The homeys are kind of wondering about this, they're a little leery," said 
the 24-year-old member of the Nation of Islam. "This is a good beginning. 
Practically everybody I know carries illegal guns. I hope things like this 
won't just stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The rally turned up a sight rarely seen on central Los Angeles streets: an 
LAPD officer and his former nemesis touting the value of police and the 
community working together to increase public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Joe Walker of the DARE anti-drug program, who has repeatedly arrested 
Leon Gullett on drug charges, said that police and residents must feel they are 
working on the same side if the violence is to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to get past this us-against-them mentality," Walker said. "Turning in 
weapons is a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Gullett said he is happy to be out of jail and has no intention 
of going back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help the kids where I come from, not deal them drugs," said the 
28-year-old resident of the Pueblo del Rio housing projects in South-Central. 
"We need to show young people that we care. That's what Arsenio's doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray lauded his famous parishioner's effort as a significant offensive in 
the war on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's empowering," he said. "What he's doing is allowing people to feel like 
they've contributed something to the good of the community. You don't need 15 
minutes of fame, just a minute or so, to feel like a hero and turn your 
attitude around." 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by the response to his call for disarmament, Hall said he intends to 
turn the one-day drive into a continuing program at the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is good in the 'hood; the media just doesn't report it," he said. "If 
there were as much coverage about efforts like this one as there is about O.J. 
(Simpson), things might be different." ERIN J. AUBRY

 Standing on a makeshift stage, the two would-be actors gamely tried to 
improvise a scene under the watchful gaze of teacher Monica Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 Stifling self-conscious giggles and averting their eyes from fellow students, 
the two boys played out a situation in which both were drivers trying to decide 
who was at fault in a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
 After the pair rushed the scene to its conclusion and took their seats, 
Calhoun and the 12-member class praised the effort and just as quickly pointed 
out its weaknesses: poor articulation, not playing to the audience, unclear 
motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the exercise served its purpose, and soon other actors, ranging in age 
from 5 to 13, clamored to take the stage with sudden inspirations. It was the 
kind of enthusiastic response Calhoun and her mother, Lorine, hope to generate 
more of in their at-home youth drama camp launched last month in the Crenshaw 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is giving kids a creative outlet and introduce them to the 
life of acting," Lorine Calhoun said. "There are things about discipline and 
self-esteem they need to learn. We want to catch them before they get off into 
drugs or gangbanging." 
</P>
<P>
 John Whitfield, 10, a camp newcomer and one of the morning's performers, said 
he's hooked. "It's kind of scary but fun," he said. "And you can be on TV later 
on, be a star maybe."  
</P>
<P>
 The camp operates five days a week out of Calhoun's four-bedroom home on 
Brynhurst Avenue and offers basic instruction in acting, dance and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents pay $10 a day, or whatever they can afford, for classes; those who can 
afford little pitch in and help Calhoun by bringing food for participants, 
shuttling them to class each morning and otherwise assisting Calhoun. The 
shoestring budget has meant that Calhoun is hard-pressed for rehearsal space. 
She uses her den for acting rehearsals, her mirrored dining room for dance 
classes and is casting about for rehearsal space for a group production next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 But fostering a sense of an "acting family" among students and parents and 
making such training accessible has made the camp worth the trouble, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are going through so much these days, they need something like this," 
she said. "They can get things here they can't get in Hollywood workshops. We 
teach the three R's -- respect for home, family and theater." 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun manages the career of her 22-year-old daughter, Monica, whose acting 
credits include featured roles in the film "Baghdad Cafe" and the subsequent 
television series. Monica Calhoun got her start in a Santa Monica youth drama 
camp 10 years ago and says she wants to pass the benefit of that experience on 
to other young people in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to learn about themselves, as well as learn to observe others," 
she said of her students. "It's not just about everybody being stars. Working 
with each other through improvisations, they can learn how to deal with similar 
situations later in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Though novices at acting, many students admitted to already harboring dreams 
of making it big. "I like the camp because when I do make it as an actress, 
I'll know how to do things on stage. I'll also be making big bucks as a star," 
11-year-old Taipei Laleau said.  
</P>
<P>
 Keith Everage, 10, said he is more intrigued by acting than he thought he 
would be. "I was nervous but I'm starting to relax and enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorine Calhoun is adamant that all can excel if they put their minds to it. 
She points out that her 20-year-old son, Eric, who is blind, has also worked in 
several movie and television projects.

A MECCA IS REBORN; PADUA HILLS FESTIVAL ISN'T IN PADUA NOW, BUT EVEN IN BURBANK 
IT'S STILL AN IDYLLIC SPOT FOR PLAYWRIGHTS WHO WANT TO DO NEW WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodbury University is hidden from view, tucked alongside the northbound I-5 
freeway near Burbank Airport. It's one of many tiny campuses that dot the Los 
Angeles landscape -- and hardly the place you expect to find a nationally known 
theater mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 But home it now is to the reborn Padua Hills Playwrights Festival, the West's 
highly respected, artist-run workshop for emerging dramatists -- a group that's 
known for such luminary past and present faculty as Sam Shepard, Maria Irene 
Fornes and David Henry Hwang. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor festival, held in conjunction with the workshop, presents eight 
new plays, from Thursday through Aug. 14. Included this year are works by 
Fornes, John O'Keefe, John Steppling, Padua founder-artistic director Murray 
Mednick and others. 
</P>
<P>
 A fixture of the Southland summer arts scene since 1978, the Padua Festival 
went dormant two seasons ago, due to financial and organizational troubles. But 
thanks to a $25,000 Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre challenge grant and a new 
board of directors, it's making a comeback with this, its 15th season. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least it's going to try. 
</P>
<P>
 For as venerated as Padua may be, it has yet to solve the conundrum that vexes 
so many artist-run endeavors. Nurturing artists, it seems, isn't the same as 
having an administrative knack. The bottom line is the bottom line -- and 
minding it is not necessarily the forte of artist-administrators like Mednick. 
"Fund-raising has always been a big hassle, because I'm not good at it, I don't 
have the time for it and I'm not that interested in it," he admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, playwrights come first. Mednick has excelled at fostering a learning 
environment in which writers thrive. "I'd say there was a Padua attitude toward 
theater as a fine art, with the playwright's role emphasized," he says. "We've 
been able to refine the discourse about the art of playwriting." 
</P>
<P>
 The proof is in the full evenings of new works that are presented at the end 
of every year's workshop, set alfresco at various locations around the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the outdoor festival presents eight new plays, on two separate bills 
of four works each. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a chance for outsiders to catch a glimpse of what makes Padua 
distinctive. "This really is a playwrights' organization, run by a playwright, 
and that's unique," Mednick says. "We have this reputation of being radical in 
our non-careerism. A lot of people have this attitude that we're a wild kind of 
day camp. Not true. We're very serious." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old Padua Hills Press has published "Best of the West," an 
anthology of eight works staged in 1989-1990. A second anthology, featuring 
plays from the 1991 festival, is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 There really is no such thing as a "Padua script." Yet there is a mystique 
that perpetuates the idea that Padua writers are more similar than they 
actually are. 
</P>
<P>
 Stylistically, Padua is often thought of as spawning edgy work that features 
short, filmic scenes or poetically minimalist dialogue. But the writing is 
actually more varied than legend would have it. About all that one won't see is 
long-winded kitchen-sink realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick says that there isn't a Padua play per se but that there is a Padua 
mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis is on creative exploration for its own sake. "There is a premium 
on making certain kinds of inquiries," he says. "We don't rely on psychological 
motivation in a naturalistic sense, but on language in relation to the space." 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular assumption that the Padua approach is solely experimental, 
the workshop and festival stress a solid grounding in theatrical history. 
"Because there is seriousness -- and a high valuation of what theater can mean 
in the community -- there is respect for certain kinds of tradition of theater 
from the Greeks on," Mednick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, it's an approach -- at least as outlined by Mednick -- that flies 
in the face of Padua's maverick reputation. "That's a traditional, not a 
political-radical approach," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This is partly why Mednick is able to retain high-caliber instructors such as 
the New York-based Fornes, who has been with Padua since its inception, and 
L.A.'s own John Steppling. "I teach a great deal at universities," Fornes says, 
"but Padua is the only place where playwriting is taught through exercises that 
help the writers stretch their imagination and to write, through different 
approaches to reaching one's creative reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most places, the teaching is more like editing, and that doesn't help the 
writer in a lasting way," adds Fornes, who has premiered a number of her new 
works at Padua. "It may help them put together a play, but it doesn't help them 
develop their muscles. They just teach them certain tricks to get them on the 
loop rather than developing a mechanism in the person." 
</P>
<P>
 The Padua students come from L.A. and across the country, chosen through an 
application process by Mednick and members of the faculty -- Jon Robin Baitz is 
among the more famous alumni. The students share a willingness to pursue 
matters of craft apart from job market concerns. "They know what they're 
getting into," Mednick says. "The ones who can't keep up and (don't) have a 
truly interested approach don't stick." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there's nothing particularly exotic about the workshop. It's a sequence of 
intensive classes, which typically include both lecture-discussions and writing 
exercises, with each teacher holding forth as he or she sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 There is method even in the lack of regimentation. "We have the students 
exposed to each of us in turn, and they're also attached to a playwright in 
terms of the festival," Mednick explains. "There's a dynamic that begins to 
work. (The teachers) are all veterans and they know the routine." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a method that's not easy to describe. "It's difficult to explain to 
people an approach that isn't career-oriented and that is grounded in a 
philosophy of asking real questions about theater and the intellectual reward 
of it," Mednick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick was shaped by a decade spent with New York's Theater Genesis, from 
1964 to 1974. There he was exposed to a hotbed of the then-burgeoning Off Off 
Broadway movement, and also to a group that valued literary and theatrical 
experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble was essential. "It was that approach to playwriting -- making 
long-term commitments to adults and taking the emphasis off 'What have you 
written lately?' -- that I valued," Mednick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this is also the Padua ethos. "In a different way, I do that 
with Padua," says Mednick, who has been at the helm every year except 1988, 
when he took a year off to refocus on his own writing, and director Roxanne 
Rogers took the helm. "I try and stay with people, keeping a continuity, and I 
don't act like an artistic director." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he's never been particularly autocratic. Mednick felt a need for a 
change of venue when he moved to California in the mid-'70s. Yet he soon found 
himself wanting to re-create the ambience he had known in New York. "It was a 
peculiar reaction to the fact that I felt isolated out here," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Living in La Verne at the time, Mednick was approached by La Verne University, 
another of L.A.'s tiny outposts of academia, where he first met playwright 
Kelly Stuart, now a Padua fixture. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a major perk that went with this faculty position. "One day, the 
semi-retired chair of the theater department took me up to Padua Hills," 
Mednick recalls. "He said, 'Why don't you have a workshop here? We'll pay for 
it. Invite your friends.' So I did." 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1978. The place was Padua Hills, a picturesque, if decaying, 
estate in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains. "We had no idea of having 
an outdoor festival, but we couldn't use the theater there," says Mednick of 
how it became known as a festival of site-specific works. "It had a lot of nice 
outdoor spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mednick didn't initially conceive of the workshop -- whose initial 
participants included both Fornes and Sam Shepard -- as a production-oriented 
event. "We had students come, and the work became so interesting that we 
decided to hire some actors for one weekend," he says. "Initially, I thought 
that was going to be it." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. "It went so well that they wanted it back for another year. And 
then Pomona College (took it over) for four years. We did get Rockefeller 
Foundation support too, which was crucial for about four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after those early years, Padua had enough of a following that it was 
able to sustain itself -- albeit precariously -- without a university. The 
group has always relied heavily on a combination of tuition ($1,000) and box 
office, although it's never been stable enough to plan more than one year at a 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The semi-itinerant nature of the festival hasn't helped. After the original 
site, Padua began to migrate to a series of locations, including, most 
recently, three years at Cal State Northridge's Art and Design Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Padua suspended operations, citing financial troubles. It was also 
acknowledged at the time that the group lost out on an anticipated $20,000 
grant, due to a perception on the part of the granting body that Padua didn't 
have its administrative act together. 
</P>
<P>
 Padua also began to lose out on other grants, in part because it was not able 
to come up with the kind of community outreach programming that has been in 
favor in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet administration has always been the pivotal issue. And that was still the 
case almost two years ago when Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre first considered 
giving support to Padua. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends had told Mednick he should approach Skirball-Kenis -- and 
Skirball-Kenis had also been aware of Padua's reputation -- before they 
actually got around to discussing a relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, neither remembers who made the first contact. But the two groups 
approached each other at nearly the same time. "We really wanted to ask Murray 
(Mednick) to do some strategizing, to explain the two-year hiatus, to ensure 
(us) that the festival would be run well," says Skirball-Kenis Producing 
Director Lisa Sanman. "He also wanted to make some changes, and it took some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to look at restructuring the board and to try and come up with some 
different financial resources, and we wanted to encourage that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick's take on the process is only slightly different. "It took a while to 
convince them that we were worthwhile," he says. "I'm hoping it will be 
ongoing." He put together a 12-member board and was able to persuade 
Skirball-Kenis that he was serious about runninga tighter administrative ship. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the challenge grant from Skirball-Kenis, and as part of its 
awards and fellowship program, Skirball-Kenis is providing one full student 
scholarship for the 1994 workshop-festival. It sees this support as a way of 
bolstering both individual artists and the theater community. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a huge community of artists here," says Sanman. "(Padua) provides 
opportunity and training for playwrights and we need that around." 
</P>
<P>
 Mednick sits in a lawn chair, smoking and drinking a Coke as he concentrates 
on giving precise answers to an interviewer's questions. He is as focused as 
anyone could be -- anyone faced with the daunting task of juggling the dual 
commitments of a playwright and an administrator. Like many in his position, he 
must weigh competing demands, without letting the organization he has created 
usurp his primary identity as an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's no mean feat. "It takes a year to prepare for (the 
workshop-festival), and I need a staff of at least one or two people working 
with me during the year to raise the money for it, organize it and getting it 
on," he says. "It's not something that I want to do full time. The (size) that 
the festival is now, I can oversee it without it stopping me from being a 
playwright." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he continues -- perhaps because an artist isn't always best off 
sequestered in the garret. He needs lively minds with which to interact, and 
that's what Mednick wants Padua to provide. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's a long way from the heady beginnings of Off Off Broadway during 
the late 1960s and early 1970s. "I don't think it's analogous to what I felt in 
New York, but New York was special then," Mednick says. "The tradition of 
inviting people, as opposed to having a kind of script contest, has evolved 
from that. We have created a community here and had an influence on the theater 
community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 And that influence extends beyond what will be seen onstage this summer. "I'm 
very interested in an approach that has to do with a system of values, and 
that's what we teach here as much as anything," Mednick says. "It's about being 
able to be straightforward with each other, and the feeling that there is 
something to be in search of that has value and relevance outside of us."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; DAY CAMP PROGRAM STRAPPED FOR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after Jahaziel Diaz of 9th Street School finished crafting his Styrofoam 
World Cup trophy, the 10-year-old started sweeping the unused scraps and papers 
from his desk into a box -- not a trash can. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's 10 classes and they need materials," said the boy, who earlier had 
brushed some heart- and star-shaped pieces of paper into the cardboard 
container. "We leave what we didn't use for the other classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Though such a drill has become a norm at most financially strapped Los Angeles 
Unified School District campuses, it is the first time that Para Los Ninos' 
Summer Day Camp program has experienced a shortage in funds and supplies, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The local day-care group, which offers children's services to 9th Street 
School, is trying to raise $30,000 for its 10-week day camp at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Para Los Ninos officials said the unexpected need for money arose after they 
learned from district officials in April that the year-round 9th Street School 
will go back to a traditional September-to-June schedule this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Because school would not be in session during the summer, Para Los Ninos 
officials said they were forced to scramble and put together a program for 300 
children, most from homeless or latch-key families. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children really need to have a place to spend their summer because if 
they don't have a summer camp to go to, they will be left alone -- left 
unsupervised in a very bad part of Los Angeles," said Shannon Coleman, who is 
coordinating Para Los Ninos' fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive itself has been further complicated because Coleman no longer has 
access to a list of previous summer camp donors. 
</P>
<P>
 That list was among the items stolen during a burglary last year at the 
day-care group's 6th Street office, said Jorge Armendariz, Para Los Ninos 
associate director. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "we're going to foundations and corporations," Armendariz said. 
"We're writing proposals, trying to see who wants to fund the program." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Para Los Ninos has raised $35,000 for a $65,000 bare-bones program, 
which started July 5 and ends Sept. 2, he said. Most of the funds were donated 
from charitable foundations and through a letter-writing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 But without the remaining $30,000, the program will only have enough to cover 
salaries for the 26 staff workers and a limited amount of arts and reading 
supplies. Already, day camp officials have had to reduce classroom field trips 
from four times a month in past summers when year-round school was not in 
session to once a month because of the high cost of bus rental. 
</P>
<P>
 Materials and supplies, such as books, scissors and glue, have to be shared 
among students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have record players for them to hear a song," said Eva Contreras, 
program coordinator. "Especially art supplies, we don't have enough for all the 
children to participate in one activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Donors for the fund-raising drive can contact Para Los Ninos at (213) 
623-8446. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; HOTEL LAUNCHES NEW JAPANESE-STYLE BAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Californians can adopt sushi and karaoke into their eating and 
entertainment habits, then Akira Yuhara is hoping they'll drink to his version 
of a Japanese beer garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Otani Hotel's food and beverage director has set up a bar at one end 
of the building's half-acre, third-floor rooftop garden, which had only been 
used before as a reception area. 
</P>
<P>
 To capture the look of a Japanese beer garden, Yuhara surrounded the bar with 
white banners and overhanging red-and-white electric lanterns. 
</P>
<P>
 He also placed 13 round tables and 50 square stumps used as chairs along the 
edges of the garden's walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing different from a traditional Japanese beer garden is the garden 
scenery itself, Yuhara said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, beer gardens are normally staged during the summer atop corporate 
buildings or on the ground, he explained. The after-work event is often 
sponsored by beer companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Japanese beer drinkers see it as a summer tradition mainly because it 
helps them cope with the humid climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody gets thirsty," Yuhara said. "They want to go outside and have a 
beer. . . . They are groggy. They need stamina." 
</P>
<P>
 To liven up the atmosphere, sponsors over the years have developed party 
themes, such as disco or Hawaiian nights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the New Otani's beer garden -- believed to be the first of its kind in 
Southern California -- Yuhara has adopted a jin-ya theme in recognition of the 
Japanese samurai headquarters where warriors would often drink together the 
night before a major battle. 
</P>
<P>
 He sees his garden as a jin-ya because it is a place where today's Downtown 
executives can gather in the evenings to prepare for corporate battles ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening June 23, the beer garden has averaged 60 customers a day and has 
netted $10,000 in beer and appetizer sales, $4,000 more than average summer 
sales at the hotel's regular 40-seat Genji Bar, Yuhara said. It's open from 6 
to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday and is scheduled to close Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucy Hosokawa, 30, of Pasadena and her co-workers were among the first to show 
up Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It looks interesting," said Hosokawa, a manager at the nearby Sanwa Health 
Spa. "It's a nice atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has visited beer gardens in Japan and enjoys the opportunity to 
sip beer with friends and co-workers at a place other than a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 80% of his customers have been Japanese workers and 10% have been 
hotel guests, Yuhara said he hopes to attract more American clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, we arranged Japanese-style," he said. "Maybe next year, we arrange 
American-style." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: LITTLE TOKYO; HOUSING PROJECT DESIGN SCALED BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a need to find additional financing to build a proposed 100-unit 
low-income housing project, a developer has decided to cut back on some 
one-bedroom spaces and build more family-size rooms, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Tokyo Service Center, a nonprofit community group, opted for the change 
in Casa Heiwa's design after failing to obtain federal tax credits last month 
from a state committee, said Lisa Sugino, project manager for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is trying to finance the $16.8-million project on 3rd Street, 
between Los Angeles and San Pedro streets. It had hoped to raise between $5 
million and $6 million by selling tax credits to businesses, Sugino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the setback, center officials plan to reapply for the credits next 
month. To do so, they have to redesign the six-story complex, adding 600 square 
feet of space to the original 97,500-square-foot building, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of the children's sandlot and a courtyard would be shaved to 
accommodate the extra space. The complex would still include a child-care 
center, a basketball court, underground parking and social services run by the 
developer's partner in the project, Pacific Asian Consortium in Employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugino said the mix of studios and one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units 
is also expected to change, with more two- and four-bedroom spaces inside Casa 
Heiwa -- a name that combines the Spanish word for "house" with the Japanese 
word for "peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have 100 units," she said, "we just made some of the one-bedrooms 
into two-bedrooms." 
</P>
<P>
 The modifications, if approved by the Community Redevelopment Agency and the 
Los Angeles City Council, would affect senior citizens the most -- though Casa 
Heiwa is also intended to house low-income workers and their families, Sugino 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, 160 people -- mainly Japanese-speaking senior citizens -- 
have called Little Tokyo Service Center to ask for housing applications before 
the complex has been built, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since there's no way we can accommodate all the seniors who are interested in 
living there, we're hoping that they will double up and live in some of the 
two-bedroom units," Sugino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Tokyo Service Center has overcome bureaucratic hurdles before. In 
February, it finally reached a financing agreement with the CRA, which has 
committed to lending $6.1 million to the center. In exchange, the developer 
will pay $2.25 million for the property, now used as a parking lot for Caltrans 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected is $4 million from the Century (105) Freeway housing replacement 
program, created to make up for housing demolished during freeway construction, 
Sugino said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the question of receiving tax credits is up in the air, construction 
is expected to begin next spring as scheduled. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; T-SHIRT ARTISTS HAVE DESIGNS ON FUTURE 
</P>

<P>
 Barbed wire seems to figure in artist Jaime Watter's designs that have made 
their way onto T-shirts sold under the Street Wize label from Seattle to San 
Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 The private company, founded in February, recruits artists and others from the 
Central City to create designs, and market, publicize and distribute its 
products. The company hopes to convey inner-city images to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbed wire is, to me, the inner-city," said Watter, 25, who is also a 
sculptor and recently had one of his works exhibited at a Downtown museum. "It 
seems we're in a prison. We're able to walk around and everything, but we're in 
a prison. What I draw is what I feel. It's what I see."  
</P>
<P>
 Although small and still unprofitable, Street Wize has sold hundreds of shirts 
that retail for $18. Some of the original members of the company have left for 
other interests while new ones have come on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Street Wize was started by Kyle Kazan, 26, a former special-education 
elementary schoolteacher who has left the company and is training at the Police 
Academy, and his assistant, Joey Pallares, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine remaining partners meet twice a week at Hollenbeck Youth Center to 
share their designs and decide which ones will be printed on their shirts. The 
process, which takes about a month for each design, takes the artists and 
others involved in the project into the printing company to observe their work 
as it goes through the photography, printing and pressing processes. 
</P>
<P>
 They even fold the T-shirts coming out of the hot oven. Then marketing 
decisions and sales plans are made. Street Wize has a contract with Hot Topic, 
a store with outlets on the West Coast.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talent in the inner-city," Pallares said. "A lot of 
(talented youths) are lost in the inner-city because they don't get exposed. We 
offer them an opportunity to get their artwork on a T-shirt."  
</P>
<P>
 Watter and artist Edgar Adame, 15, the company's original artists, receive a 
percentage of the company's profits. Others are paid $100 to $150 for a T-shirt 
design and $25 to $50 for a sticker design. 
</P>
<P>
 Adame designed a shirt that has the continents on a globe forming an eyeball, 
a design his friends call "Mad World." 
</P>
<P>
 "The eye is looking back at you, like saying, 'Look at what you're doing,' " 
said Adame, a student at Roosevelt High School. "Also you have to be watching 
your back all the time. You need an eyeball."  
</P>
<P>
 One problem the designers face is the misconception that being streetwise 
connotes something negative. Their work is sometimes wrongly labeled as tagwear 
, designs created by graffiti taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know there's graffiti out there. We know there's gangbangers out there. 
But when we say streetwise, a lot of people have thought that has to do with 
all that," Pallares said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in Estrada Courts and I consider myself streetwise, yet we're not 
criminals. You never do get out of the inner-city because it's a state of 
being."

<P>
 PUENTE Learning Center, which has offered free language and job-training 
classes to Eastside residents since 1985, will has scheduled a July 28 grand 
opening for its new center in South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center, at 10000 Western Ave., is a former Arco station damaged in the 
1992 riots and converted into classrooms.Arco awarded PUENTE a $1-million grant 
to buy the land, erect mobile classroom units and operate the program for about 
two years.  
</P>
<P>
 The opening comes in the midst of a fund-raising campaign to help PUENTE build 
a permanent, 40,000-square-foot center at its Boyle Heights location, at 501 S. 
Boyle Ave. PUENTE, which stands for People United to Enrich the Neighborhood 
Through Education, was started in 1985 by Sister Jennie Lechtenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Having raised $5.5 million toward its $9.5-million goal, Lechtenberg hopes to 
have the new center built within a year. Classes and offices are now in mobile 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 Although PUENTE had not planned to expand beyond East Los Angeles, the offer 
from Arco was too good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, there's such a need in South-Central for this type of center," 
Lechtenberg said. The Arco grant enables PUENTE to start classes without having 
to immediately raise money to run the programs. 
</P>
<P>
 PUENTE enrolls 1,400 students a day. They include preschoolers who learn 
computer skills as well as adults who learn English and job skills. PUENTE 
South will enroll about 300 adults, with a focus on English as a second 
language, computer literacy and Spanish.  
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening will begin at 10 a.m. MARY ANNE PEREZ

 Parents of children enrolled at Jardin de los Ninos have scheduled a Saturday 
lunch fund-raiser for the family of a teacher who was killed last month while 
saving a child from a rolling school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Quezada died June 24 at Griffith Park after the preschool students she 
had supervised finished a trip to the Los Angeles Zoo.The children were 
boarding their bus when it began to roll, and Quezada, 50, pulled one of the 
children who was falling in its path toward her. The bus rolled over them, but 
Quezada shielded 3-year-old C.J. Keith with her body and saved his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents want to show their appreciation," said Deborah Fowler, a parent 
who serves as president of the preschool class. "We loved her and we cared for 
her and we know this isn't going to bring her back, but we want to show that we 
loved her." 
</P>
<P>
 The $4 carne asada lunch and a puppet show will run from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at 
Jardin de los Ninos, 2422 Manitou Ave., where Quezada worked for four years.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WATTS; LATINO PARENTS LEARN TO BE LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caged in one's own neighborhood; afraid to speak out because no one will 
listen. These are but two of the feelings many Latino parents have about their 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Solutions to concerns like these were addressed in a free, four-month 
leadership program that recently graduated 50 parents, teaching them how to 
become leaders in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent Leadership Program was sponsored by the nation's leading Latino 
civil rights organization, the Los Angeles-based Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program has opened our eyes because, for the most part, we've lived 
marginalized lives for being Spanish-speakers," graduate Sonia Morningstar said 
in Spanish. "So many doors have been shut because of the language barrier." 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is designed to teach parents organizational skills, to become 
active in the community and to develop political empowerment," said Marta 
Samano, director of leadership development at MALDEF. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also designed to teach parents the ins and outs of the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, how to guide their children toward college, how to 
build community-based groups to help themselves, how to deal with immigration 
issues, and how to relate to African Americans, who have a long history in 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from the school district and leaders from community 
organizations such as One-Stop Immigration and the Watts/Century Latino 
Organization conducted the weekly two-hour workshops at each school. The 
program is at the start of a five-year run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very grass roots, primarily for monolingual Latino parents," said 
Samano, who also wants to prepare parents for roles in parent councils, such as 
the Parent-Teacher Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program is something that we have been needing for a long time," said 
graduate Jaime Simon Zeledon, a father of four children who attend area 
schools. "When the mass media talk about Watts, people think that it's made up 
of mostly African Americans, when in fact it's mostly Latino." 
</P>
<P>
 Samano said student bodies at several area schools are largely Latino, but 
because the number of Latino teachers is notably smaller, Latino parents and 
their children believe they are underrepresented. According to a fall survey by 
the school district, for example, 44.7% of the 1,075 students at 102nd Street 
Elementary School are Latino, as are six of 58 teachers. Markham Middle School, 
with 1,475 students, is 55% Latino, with five Latino teachers out of 69. 
</P>
<P>
 A low number of Spanish-speaking staff employees, a lack of programs that 
focus on Latino culture and history and minute representation in parent 
councils are some of the grievances parents and students have. 
</P>
<P>
 A Mexican national who is married to a Native American, Morningstar is a PTA 
volunteer at John Muir Middle School, which one of her daughters attends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice to be able to communicate among parents, our children and the 
teachers," she said. Now Morningstar is starting to get involved in the PTA at 
Manual Arts High School, where another daughter is enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 For Martha E. Obregon, a mother of three Markham students, the program has 
taught her more about her rights as a parent: "Watts is a community that has 
many services and organizations. What happened is that because we didn't feel 
empowered, we didn't take advantage of what was out there. Now we feel we can 
go out and tell other parents to join the same cause . . . so they can help 
their children too."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH-CENTRAL; SOFTBALL TEAMS WILL GO TO BAT FOR UNITY

<P>
 In an effort to strengthen ties established between residents of South-Central 
and Simi Valley after the 1992 civil unrest, the two communities will square 
off in the third America's Games softball tournament Saturday at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the two years since we started, we've set up a lot of communication 
between the kids of both communities," said Jan Hardy, a South-Central resident 
and one of the organizers of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Community All Stars and the Simi Valley All Stars will play at 
Rancho Santa Susana Park beginning at 1:30 p.m. The festivities begin at 10:30 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a softball game at 11:30 a.m. between children from Foshay 
Junior High in West Adams and students from Valley View Junior High. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Simi Valley adult team won, 15-4, at Jesse Owens Park, while 
the year before South-Central won 6-1.  
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 are expected to attend the festivities, which will include game 
booths, a children's pavilion, free food and free transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 17 buses filled already. We don't charge because most of the people 
that go don't have the money to spend," said Hardy. "But we are going to have 
some T-shirts for sale with the America's Games logo and a big purple ribbon on 
it for urban peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The games' motto: "Urban vs. suburban softball . . . One world, one people . . 
. It's got to start somewhere."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; POLICE ASKED TO CURB TRAFFIC NEAR SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The way Alberto Guijarro sees it, a potential disaster lurks just outside 
Bryson Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just seen conditions get worse and worse, and it's about time the 
authorities do something about it," Guijarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guijarro, who has lived across the street from the school for four years, and 
his neighbors say children's lives are endangered each day when parents drive 
down Hunt Street to pick up their children at Bryson. Drivers double-park and 
clog up the two-way artery in front of the school, they say, inviting a serious 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The daily jam fills the block of Hunt Street just off the busy intersection 
with Tweedy Boulevard. Because parking is not regulated on the 30-foot-wide 
street, visitors' vehicles quickly join residents' cars parked along the sides 
of the street. The air fills with a barrage of honking horns and squealing 
tires. Dangerous blind spots abound between cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen cars back up 80 to 100 feet and hit other cars. We've seen cars 
jump over curbs and drive over lawns," said resident Jim Anderson, who has 
complained to the City Council about the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately for the kids at Bryson, about the only thing we haven't seen is 
an accident in which one of them is hit by a car." 
</P>
<P>
 Guijarro and Anderson met with Vice Mayor Henry Gonzales and Police Chief 
Ronald George last week to find solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryson Principal Don Fisher attributes part of the problem to overcrowding in 
the city's schools. Bryson, a school with 1,400 students, was built for 600 to 
700. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Don George said he would beef up police presence around Bryson 
and ask his officers to step up writing of traffic citations to clear Hunt 
Street of double-parking and blind spots between parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want anyone to expect miracles . . . but we will do the best we can," 
George said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guijarro agrees with George's initiative: "The best thing to do is to get some 
more cops over here enforcing the law. That's all we're asking for." SIMON 
ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: BELL; INDIAN AID GROUP NEEDS HELP ITSELF 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A warehouse full of clothes, furniture, distilled water and other household 
items -- relief for Native American reservations in Arizona and New Mexico -- 
is in need of assistance itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Help is needed in the form of big-rig trucks, said Mel Cook of the nonprofit 
American Indian Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 American Indian Ministries, which has made 50 to 60 such trips before, has two 
full trailers ready to make the trek across the Mojave. What's needed now are 
drivers, gas money and the rigs themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hopis are doing fairly well, but the Navajos are still very poor," said 
Cook, who has worked with American Indian Ministries since it was founded in 
1977 to assist Native Americans nationwide. "I don't see the economic 
well-being on the reservations improving very much." 
</P>
<P>
 With that need now as great as ever, the organization is making three or four 
deliveries each year to the Navajo and Hopi reservations in northeast Arizona 
and northwest New Mexico from its warehouse at 5600 Rickenbacker Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The 60,000-square-foot facility is filled to capacity with items collected 
from charitable organizations from throughout Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (American Indian Ministries) have a need, we'll help them out. This 
facility has provided all types of non-perishable food," said Roger Maberto of 
World Opportunities in Hollywood, whose group collects non-perishable food and 
donates it to organizations such as American Indian Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said that local Native Americans are also welcome to browse through the 
warehouse for items or clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are about 78,000 Indians in the L.A. area, and all of them are 
welcome," Cook said. "One young man came in the other day from Minnesota, a 
Chippewa. It just goes to show the large variety of tribes represented in Los 
Angeles."

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; WATTS; IT HAS BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR GUTTER POLITICS, 
AN EASY SOURCE FOR EXPLOITABLE LABOR AND GROUND ZERO FOR A RACIAL EXPLOSION. 
TODAY, WATTS REMAINS IN THE GRIP OF ITS TROUBLED PAST, THE PLACE THAT HAS 
'ALWAYS BEEN LEFT BEHIND.'

 Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The name is synonymous with urban despair. As a result of six rage-filled days 
in 1965, it became a lasting symbol for much of what is wrong in America's 
inner cities. 
</P>
<P>
 All the major problems that exploded into violence on that hot summer evening 
nearly 29 years ago and plague Watts to this day had been simmering from its 
earliest days. For much of its history -- first as an incorporated city, then 
as part of Los Angeles -- Watts has suffered from poverty, racism and squalid 
living conditions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Watts has always been left behind. It's always had to fight for everything 
it's gotten," says longtime community leader Davis Rodgers, 72, president of 
the Watts branch of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1907 to 1926, Watts was a freewheeling city known for incessant political 
infighting among the predominantly white community that ran local affairs. Its 
politics became increasingly troubled by the 1920s, when the community was 
split by recall campaigns and the Ku Klux Klan sought to exploit that breach 
and control city government. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Watts' Mexican American and African American residents 
lived apart from their white neighbors. Mexican Americans were largely confined 
to the southeast end of the city, where they had moved at the turn of the 
century to provide cheap labor to build rail lines. Blacks, whose port of entry 
to Los Angeles was Watts, lived south of 103rd Street in an area known as 
"Mudtown" because of its shabby homes and muddy streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming part of the city of Los Angeles did nothing to improve the livelihood 
of most black and Latino residents. Their living conditions continued to 
deteriorate as whites moved out of Watts. Time and again, from the 1930s to the 
1950s, reports by government and private agencies called attention to many of 
the economic and social conditions that would lead to the 1965 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no urban planning was conducted for Watts until after the unrest because 
city officials said they had focused their planning efforts on newer 
subdivisions elsewhere, documents show. Even now, change has come slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 19 years to build a shopping center. A proposed greenbelt near the 
landmark Watts Towers has been 28 years in the planning, and the community is 
still among the most impoverished in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The area that now comprises Watts was in the 19th Century part of a large 
Mexican land grant called El Rancho Tajuata. Like the rest of California's 
ranchos, Tajuata was subdivided and sold to white developers in the late 1800s 
and early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Electric railroad, seeking to lay tracks for its Los Angeles to 
Long Beach route, acquired ranch property from several landowners. Among them 
was Julia A. Watts, who owned the parcel where the railroad built its station 
in 1904 at what is now 103rd Street and Grandee Avenue. The original depot was 
restored with the help of a Community Redevelopment Agency grant and is now the 
103rd Street station for the Blue Line. 
</P>
<P>
 The railroad workers called the area Watts Junction, and the town that 
sprouted up became unofficially known as Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the construction of the railroads came a Mexican immigrant labor force. 
"They first lived in boxcars with their families, later in tents, and finally 
in four-room houses called the 'Latin Camp,' furnished by the P.E. railroad," 
historian MaryEllen Ray Bell wrote in her 1985 book, "City of Watts." That area 
came to be known as "La Colonia" and is still heavily Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 When Watts incorporated as a city in 1907, stores, a restaurant, a post 
office, a pool hall and a bar had branched out from the station along Main 
Street, which is now 103rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other cities near rail lines, such as Oakland and Chicago, Southern 
blacks moved to Watts seeking jobs as train porters and dining car waiters. 
They either remained in Watts or moved north to another burgeoning African 
American community along the Central Avenue corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1920s, a substantial black community was developing in the Mudtown area 
of south Watts. "Mudtown was like a section of the Deep South literally 
transplanted," said distinguished African American writer Arna Bontemps in "God 
Sends Sunday," a 1931 novel tracing black life in early Los Angeles. "The 
streets of Mudtown were three or four dusty wagon paths. . . . Ducks were 
sleeping on the weeds, and there was on the air a suggestion of pigs and slime 
holes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Watts grew, political disputes erupted. Two factions battled over whether 
saloons should be allowed within city limits, documents show. Recall campaigns 
and initiatives were mounted by "drys," or those who favored banning the 
drinking establishments, against City Council members who supported the 
saloons. The drys ultimately won when Prohibition went into effect in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a troubling pattern that would remain throughout the years emerged: 
alleged police brutality. In a 1923 letter to the council, 66 black and Latino 
residents living on Watts' south side called for the dismissal of the white 
police chief "due to his ceaseless harassment." He remained on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most ominous was the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great treat is in store for those who would like to hear what Klanscraft 
means," said a Feb. 6, 1925, article in the Watts Advertiser. "At the Old 
Fellows Hall, there is to be an open meeting by the Ku Klux Klan of the State, 
when one of their most able speakers, Rev. Berger of Pasadena, will address the 
audience on what the K.K.K. means to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, the secret organization -- seeking to expand its power base 
from then-white Compton -- tried to split Watts' black vote and engineer a 
recall of Catholic City Council members by using black and Catholic operatives 
to create dissent in those communities. The plot was exposed by The California 
Eagle, a newspaper that served the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The white people of Watts are tired of being run by people who are not 100% 
Americans. So it will be necessary to corral the Negro vote," wrote a 
high-level Klan official in a letter that was obtained and published by the 
Eagle on April 10, 1925. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot failed, but the political squabbling continued. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, tired of the infighting and unable to raise money for infrastructure 
improvements, Watts residents held an election and voted overwhelmingly to 
become part of Los Angeles on April 2, 1926. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by the prospect of economic opportunity, African Americans continued to 
flock to Watts in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from everywhere wanted to come to Los Angeles," said Ollie La More, 
68, whose father was a porter on the Santa Fe Railway's Chicago-to-Los Angeles 
line. He brought his family to Watts in the mid-1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, 103rd Street was thriving. For 25 cents, adults could see Tom 
Mix or Hoot Gibson cowboy movies at the Largo, Yeager or Palace theaters. There 
were grocery stores, a car dealer and banks that were used by all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was a sense of community. Rodgers, who came to Watts from Texas in 
1939, recalls how neighbors looked out for one another. "We didn't have to lock 
our doors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet serious problems persisted. 
</P>
<P>
 For Latino and black residents -- surrounded by white communities in Lynwood, 
Compton and South Gate -- an unwritten rule prevailed: Do not travel east of 
the railroad tracks on Alameda Street or south of El Segundo Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just didn't do that. . . . You'd get your behind kicked," said Ignacio 
Baiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiz, 72, who was born and raised in Watts, said African Americans and Latinos 
were expected to stay in their own neighborhoods. Residents of color feared the 
police in the southeast cities, he and others recalled, and it was not uncommon 
for youths to be pulled over for seemingly no reason -- a complaint that 
persists to this day. 
</P>
<P>
 And living conditions in Watts' poorest neighborhoods festered. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1937 county government report on housing and juvenile delinquency in Los 
Angeles warned that a study area that included Watts would, "if allowed to 
continue in its present degenerative course, be the future slums of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the 1940s, Watts' population was about equally divided among 
whites, blacks and Latinos. But it changed quickly with "the impact of World 
War II finally transforming it from a multiracial community to a black ghetto," 
wrote UCLA Prof. Paul Bullock in his 1969 book, "Watts: The Aftermath." 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, the population of Los Angeles boomed as new arrivals came to 
work in war-industry factories. Many of them were blacks who settled in Watts. 
Whites, meanwhile, moved out. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1950, African Americans would make up 71.2% of Watts' 36,744 residents and 
Latinos 19.1%, according to a 1955 report by the private Welfare Planning 
Council, a think tank. Figures for other groups are not in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1940s and '50s, black families who had decent jobs purchased tidy 
homes, many of which are still there. La More and her husband, Mitchel, bought 
their Spanish-tiled stucco home near Will Rogers Memorial Park for $3,000 in 
1946 and still live there. Mitchel La More is a retired postal worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very, very nice neighborhood," said La More, who complains that the 
area has gone downhill because of crime and a change from a homeowner to renter 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Watts suffered from low property values and high disease and 
delinquency rates. A 1947 report by the city Planning Commission said Watts was 
an "an obsolescent area in which all the social and physical weaknesses of 
urban living were to be found." 
</P>
<P>
 It also noted increasing tensions between blacks and whites, saying that "some 
of the worst interracial conflicts occurring in the past decade were in this 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 Social and economic problems continued to be documented. In 1959, the Welfare 
Planning Council noted that there was still no urban planning for parks, public 
transportation and schools in Watts. And racial tensions and police brutality 
became more common, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The years of pent-up frustrations exploded on a hot evening on Aug. 11, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 A scuffle broke out after a white Highway Patrol officer tried to arrest a 
black man for speeding and reckless driving near Avalon Boulevard and 116th 
Street. The spark had been lit, and the riot raged for six days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers remembers driving down Central Avenue that first evening and seeing a 
black boy heave a rock through a store window. La More recalls standing on a 
wall in her back yard. In the distance, 103rd Street -- the infamous "charcoal 
alley" -- was nothing but giant billows of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, 34 people were dead, 1,036 injured, and $200 million worth 
of property was damaged or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I drove down the street, I just cried," said Ernestine Wilson, 60, a 
Watts resident who had to drive several miles north to Slauson Avenue to find a 
store to buy a loaf of bread. "I couldn't believe that everything was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The McCone Commission, assembled eight days after the riots by then-Gov. 
Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, later issued a 101-page report recommending remedies for 
Watts' ills: job-training projects, literacy programs, improved transportation, 
better health-care facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials formed a resident committee to help bureaucrats develop an 
urban plan for Watts. That effort led to a 44-page plan in 1966 that called for 
a shopping mall on 103rd Street, a county hospital facility in the area and a 
greenbelt linking the historic train station with the Watts Towers, among other 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, no planning had been done in Watts because city planners, strapped 
for resources, had decided to focus their efforts on newer subdivisions that 
sprouted up after World War II, said a May 23, 1967, letter to a council 
committee from then-Planning Commission Director Calvin Hamilton. "As a 
result," Hamilton wrote, "older areas, including the southeast section of the 
city, were neglected so far as planning was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 That legacy of neglect has borne bitter fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reaping the harvest of political decisions made years ago," said 
Leonard L. Robinette, chairman and executive director of the Watts Labor 
Community Action Committee, a service organization that formed several months 
before the 1965 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Watts' 33,918 residents, 66% are on welfare. The per capita income is 
$4,469 -- about one-fourth the countywide average of $16,149. And 66.2% of the 
19,086 residents 18 and over have less than three years of high school. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other challenges: 43.3% of the residents are Latinos, many of them 
recent immigrants whose limited English skills make it difficult to assimilate. 
</P>
<P>
 On a hot afternoon, an angry Bobby Thomas reflected on Watts' current state as 
he stood with several unemployed men at Del's Hamburger Haven on Compton 
Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 "Look around you," said Thomas, 23, a high school dropout who lives with a 
single mother and five brothers and sisters in a small home on Zamora Avenue. 
"People here have been forgotten. . . . We only get attention (from officials 
and the media) when something negative happens." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 After the riots, more than a decade passed before many major improvements were 
made in the Watts area. Among them were the Martin Luther King Jr. Shopping 
Center, additional bus lines and several low-income housing developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center and housing developments are part of the Community 
Redevelopment Agency's plan known as the Watts redevelopment project, which 
replaced the 1966 plan and is scheduled for completion on Jan. 1, 2009. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which so far has spent about $50 million in the area, is helping 
to finance a new civic center complex across from the King shopping center and 
a new library as part of its master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also expects to start building a cultural marketplace in about 
three months near the towers that will employ local artists and entrepreneurs. 
It will be the first phase of the long-awaited greenbelt, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are working as hard as we can to get things done for the community," said 
Roy Willis, director of operations for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other city officials cite various reasons for the projects taking so 
long to develop in the area: battles among community factions in reaching a 
consensus on plans; developers unwilling to invest in the area; plans stalled 
in normal bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., whose 15th District includes Watts, said he 
will form a community nonprofit organization over the next several months that 
will devise strategies to attract new businesses and help those in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, community leaders are skeptical about economic renewal in such an 
impoverished area. Parker Anderson, general manager of the city's Community 
Development Department, says Watts will always have a certain level of poverty 
because it is home to four housing projects and has always been a community 
many residents leave if they can afford to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see it changing in the short term," Robinette said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have not gone that far since 1965. . . . It's going to take some time 
before real results occur." 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORY: Page 3 Watts: By the Numbers 
</P>
<P>
 First as a city, then as part of Los Angeles, Watts suffered from the poverty, 
squalid living conditions and racism that exploded into six days of rage in 
1965. Since then, the community has seen the construction of a shopping center 
and housing developments in riot-torn areas and an influx of Latino immigrants. 
But many in the area point to rampant poverty as evidence that little has 
changed in the overall quality of life for Watts residents.

FOR YATES, IT WAS A SNAP DECISION; QUARTERBACK HEADS DOWN UNDER SO HE CAN KEEP 
THROWING PASSES INSTEAD OF KNOCKING THEM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 William Yates Jr. cut a dashing figure during a photo shoot at Norman O. 
Houston Park near Baldwin Hills. Wearing a khaki safari outfit, the former 
Fremont High quarterback jumped in the air, cocked back his left arm and faked 
a pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle drew the attention of passing motorists on La Brea Avenue, much 
to Yates' amusement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cars were stopping by and people were asking 'Who does he play for?' " Yates 
said. " 'What pro team does he play for? Who is he? I've never heard of him.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But fans in Australia and New Zealand will soon hear all about Yates, who is 
headed to the South Pacific nations for the sixth annual Down Under Bowl. 
Eighteen teams from the United States will compete in the two-week tournament 
starting Monday and running through July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates will start at quarterback for the California All-Stars, who will play 
the Arizona All-Stars Saturday and either the Washington All-Stars or Indian 
Nations, a team of Native Americans from throughout the United States, on July 
26 in Auckland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Although inner-city football players are often overlooked by postseason 
all-star football games, it was hard to ignore Yates and his flamboyant style. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates, a 6-foot, 185-pound senior, gained notoriety with his throwing and 
scrambling ability. He passed for 1,540 yards and 17 touchdowns, and rushed for 
666 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named City Times' 1993 Back of the Year, 
and was selected to the City Section 3-A Division team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw him on film and knew I wanted him as my quarterback," said Jerry Ralph, 
an assistant football coach at University High of San Diego who arranged the 
overseas trip and will coach the 28-man all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to playing two football games, the Californians will get a chance 
to play touch rugby, go jet boating and white-water rafting down the rivers in 
Rotorura in New Zealand and try bungee jumping. The team will also make a 
stopover in Hawaii on their return trip. The adventure costs $2,250 per player, 
but Food 4 Less has agreed to pay Yates' expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph also selected Notre Dame-bound Leon Blunt of San Fernando, USC-bound 
Darrell Russell of San Diego St. Augustine, Jamal Brooks of Granada Hills and 
Vincent Carthron of Granada Hills Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recommendations I received from coaches and recruiting coordinators from 
colleges compared Yates to a young Randall Cunningham," Ralph said. "I'm really 
impressed with his character." 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph wasn't alone in his evaluation of the versatile athlete. Nevada Las 
Vegas, where Cunningham played before starring for the Philadelphia Eagles, has 
given a scholarship to Yates. Yates was selected to play in the Shrine 
North-South All-Star Game on Saturday at Cerritos College, but he declined the 
invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to travel out of the United States," Yates said. "I also wanted to 
play my position. In the Shrine Game, I would have to play defensive back." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback, as Yates proved last season, is where he shines. He orchestrated 
the veer offense and led Fremont to a school-record 11 wins and its first 
appearance in a championship game since 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pathfinders were badly outclassed, losing to San Pedro, 31-7, in the 3-A 
final. But it turned out that Yates had suffered a back injury during the final 
regular season game and had trouble throwing the ball more than 40 yards. He 
completed only four of 16 passes for 66 yards with two interceptions, and 
rushed 12 times for 20 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates did not mention his injury after the title game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to make excuses," Yates said. "Me and my coach were the only 
ones who knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a six-month layoff, Yates' back is healthy and he will be bigger and 
stronger after working out this summer. While practicing with the Fremont team, 
Yates was throwing close to 70 yards in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be fun playing in front of a crowd that really doesn't know 
much about football," Yates said. "People in New Zealand probably don't know 
what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 For Yates, it will be another day in the park.

 The East Los Angeles College baseball team has retired No. 44 in memory of 
former player Rick Perez, who died July 2 in a hiking accident in the Angeles 
National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Perez, 20, lost his footing while taking a shortcut and fell 
about 75 feet. He was flown to a Pasadena hospital, where he died later. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who played at East L.A. in 1992 and 1993, was an All-Southern 
California Athletic Conference second-team selection in 1992 and helped the 
Huskies advance to the quarterfinals in the 1992 State junior college playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez's number will be embroidered on the Huskies' caps next season. East L.A. 
Coach Al Cone also plans to establish an annual memorial award in Perez's name 
for the East L.A. player who best typifies the El Monte High graduate's desire 
and enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Perez played at Upper Iowa, an NCAA Division III university in 
Fayette. He had a .401 batting average and a school record 57 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Aaron Magdaleno and infielder Ramon Ruiz of East L.A. have been 
selected to the SCAC first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz and the USC-bound Magdaleno helped the Huskies (22-20) to their fourth 
consecutive State playoff berth and a second-place finish at 15-9. 
</P>
<P>
 David Pina, Mando Santa Anna and Peter Cervantes were second-team selections 
for East L.A. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Janet Hill of Cal State L.A. is a finalist for the Honda Track and Field award 
given to the outstanding women's collegiate athlete. Hill, the only Division II 
nominee, won the shotput and the discus at the Division II national meet in May 
for the second year in a row.

 Lorenzo Garcia, the City Times' Central City girls' basketball Coach of the 
Year, has resigned as coach at Roosevelt High to pursue a master's degree in 
educational administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia led the Roughriders to the 1991 City 3-A title and five conference 
titles, amassing a 111-22 record in six seasons. Roosevelt (21-2) advanced to 
the 4-A final in March.

INNER-CITY GAMES GETS $100,000 GIFT FROM NIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The Inner-City Games has its first winner before the event begins -- the games 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nike presented Inner-City Games founder Danny Hernandez with a check for 
$100,000 on Wednesday to help support the sports festival created to give 
inner-city children an alternative to drugs and gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 120,000 children and 2,000 volunteers are expected to compete in 14 
sports during the fourth annual games, which will be held at USC and other 
sites around the Southland starting Saturday and ending Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The games are hosted by the Hollenbeck Youth Center in East Los Angeles. 
Hernandez, executive director of the center, founded the games in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 The games emphasize the importance of education, fitness and fair competition. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The sports apparel company's sponsorship of the games is part of Participate 
in the Lives of America's Youth, or PLAY, Nike's $10-million national youth 
sports initiative designed to give them more opportunities to play. In the 
three months since Nike launched the PLAY campaign with ads featuring Michael 
Jordan and Jackie Joyner-Kersee, more than 200,000 people have called a 
toll-free number -- (800) 929-PLAY -- to find out how they can help youths get 
involved in recreation and fitness programs, a Nike spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day Inner-City Games include baseball, basketball, water skiing, 
boxing, tennis, volleyball, flag football, karate and track. The games end with 
a celebrity golf tournament. The games will kick off with a torch-lighting 
during opening ceremonies at USC. Celebrities, flag-bearers, athletes and 
dancers will perform at the fountain outside Bovard Hall at 2 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the games don't officially start until Saturday, activities have been 
plentiful.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 6, the Los Angeles Dodgers hosted a baseball clinic at Dymally Park in 
Lynwood. Among the Dodgers present was hitting coach Manny Mota.  
</P>
<P>
 "We need to spend more time with the kids," Mota said. "The whole point of 
this is to get the message across for them to stay in school and to help them 
become good citizens. This is a great feeling for me to be with the kids."

EX-HIGH SCHOOL RIVALS MAKE HAPPY FOOTBALL CAMPERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorsey High graduate Kirby Wilson and Manual Arts High graduate Tracy Adkins, 
helped by several longtime friends and coaches, spent last weekend with about 
200 youths at their third annual Inner City Football Camp at West Los Angeles 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day camp attracted youths between the sixth and 12th grades, most of 
whom attended junior high and high schools in Southweat Los Angeles, 
South-Central, Southeast Los Angeles and Northeast Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This camp is for the kids," said Wilson, an All-City Section tailback at 
Dorsey in 1978. "Tracy and I have had a lot of help from coaches, parents and 
other people in the community to make the camp go. Without the kids and people 
like Robert (Chief) Simmons, Joe Simmons, "Papa" Malaki, Nate Wilson and Gerald 
Richardson, there's no camp." 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins, who was also named to the All-City football team in 1978, virtually 
grew up with Wilson. Although they were rivals on the field while competing in 
the original Southern League (Dorsey, Manual Arts, Fremont, Washington, Los 
Angeles and Jefferson), they eventually met through each other's friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They played together at Pasadena City College before going their separate 
ways. Wilson, now an assistant football coach at the University of Wyoming, 
went on to the University of Illinois and played with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 
of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 Adkins, a detention officer at Los Padrinos in Downey, went to Washington 
State as a defensive back, but despite not making it into pro football, he 
still loved the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea for the camp came up when Kirby and I were at an Offense-Defense 
football camp in Riverside." Adkins said. "We thought, 'Let's get one for the 
inner-city kids.' "

MOVIES; SHE'S HER OWN BEST COUNSEL; SUSAN SARANDON HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN 
ACTRESS-ADVOCATE. NOTHING DIFFERENT WITH 'THE CLIENT.' BUT THE BEST PART FOR 
HER: IT WAS SHOT DURING SUMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE SEYMOUR, Gene Seymour is a writer for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Day-care emergencies can do to a parent's plans what flash floods can do to a 
car's brakes. And this particular squall must be a doozy for Susan Sarandon 
because even her publicist is walking into the sunlit back room of a Greenwich 
Village Italian restaurant on an unspeakably hot afternoon carrying disposable 
diapers. Somewhere out front is the youngest of Sarandon's three children, 
2-year-old Miles, waiting -- calmly, one hopes -- for a backup baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out the nanny canceled because someone in her family had a serious 
accident, thus pitching into potential chaos a carefully orchestrated day of 
interviews and photo sessions publicizing Sarandon's latest film, "The Client," 
which opens Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But watching Sarandon coolly give the maitre d' detailed instructions on what 
to do when the new sitter arrives, one senses it won't take long for matters to 
achieve, at the very least, an exquisite simulation of stability. 
</P>
<P>
 With everything in place, she saunters over to a waiting table, her smile 
glowing as brightly as the sunlight engulfing the dining room. She seizes a 
reporter's hand with a grip steely enough to make one reconsider using words 
like silky or willowy to characterize her physical presence. Sugar-cane 
tautness is more like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Which isn't to say she lacks magic. Far from it. It's hard not to be impressed 
by those perfectly sculpted cheekbones, deep-dish hazel eyes and the expressive 
mouth that, whether at rest or in motion, conveys both sultry worldliness and 
wry intelligence. If anything, Sarandon's casually worn composure in the midst 
of her dog-day child-care hassles only makes her more magnetic. And this is 
before she puts on her makeup for a photo shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without makeup, Susan Sarandon, at 47, remains as alluring as she was 
in the 1980 film, "Atlantic City," with its evocative sequence of Burt 
Lancaster's gangster manque gazing longingly through his window at Sarandon's 
oyster-bartender as she languidly squeezed lemons over her nude torso to kill 
the fish smell. 
</P>
<P>
 In the presence of such mythic power, who could blame director Joel Schumacher 
("Falling Down" and the upcoming "Batman" sequel) for getting on one knee in 
the middle of a power lunch with Sarandon in New York, pleading with her to 
play "The Client's" dauntless, overmatched attorney-heroine? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in love with her for years," Schumacher says. "It wasn't just a 
stunt. I wanted her badly. There were no second choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarandon was both embarrassed and charmed by Schumacher's public display of 
wretched excess. Yet, as someone who covets candor in personal transactions, 
Sarandon was more beguiled by the rest of Schumacher's rap, which he says went 
something like this: "I've got a lot to learn as a director, but I can cast a 
movie better than anyone. You'll be cast well. You'll be treated with respect. 
And you'll have a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I have to say that spoke to me," laughs Sarandon, who had taken a few 
years off from movie-making for Miles' sake. "I liked the idea of working 
during the summer, which is when I prefer to work anyway so I don't disrupt 
school for the other kids. I was in Memphis. Tim was filming in Ohio. So we 
were able to get together easily for time off. It worked out just the way Joel 
said it would." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim," by the way, is actor Tim Robbins, who's been Sarandon's Significant 
Other since they met on the set of 1988's "Bull Durham" and is the father of 
both Miles and Jack Henry, 5. Her Eva, 9, was fathered by Italian director 
Franco Amurri, and lives in lower Manhattan with Robbins, Sarandon and the 
other two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Client" is Hollywood's third attempt to make as much money off a John 
Grisham legal thriller as the books themselves have made. It's also the 
riskiest since, unlike last year's "The Firm" and "The Pelican Brief," it isn't 
being ridden into the multiplexes by box-office powerhouses like Tom Cruise or 
Julia Roberts.  
</P>
<P>
 Industry pundits will be watching to see whether Sarandon, playing the central 
character in this, her 32nd feature film, can carry a movie on her own. But 
even with her credentials and presence, Sarandon may be too highly evolved a 
talent, to have real clout in today's Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If pictures were made with interesting women as protaganists, she would have 
the same rank and commercial appeal as Bette Davis enjoyed for decades," says 
author Gore Vidal, a close friend of Sarandon, whose 1972 satire, "An Evening 
With Richard Nixon" provided her first Broadway credit. "But movies now are 
mostly about boys and toys. And women stand or lie around in the margins." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Client" is about an 11-year-old boy (Brad Renfro) who hears more than he 
should about the mob-related murder of a U.S. senator. A flamboyant federal 
prosecutor (Tommy Lee Jones) wants testimony from the frightened boy, who hires 
Sarandon, playing a recovering drug addict, estranged parent and struggling 
lawyer, to keep the feds and the Mob at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarandon's comfort level with the project was enhanced by the way Schumacher 
welcomed her input. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I've worked is to throw out lots of suggestions and I don't expect 
all of them to be taken," she says. "On ("Client"), I was listened to, 
probably, more than I'd ever been. Joel gave me so much creative license that 
by the time the film was over, my only anxiety was that I'd hung myself in 
self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I thought, 'My God! He actually let me stand on a window sill in my 
stocking feet when I make my first appearance! I actually pull a tape cassette 
from behind Tommy Lee's ear. . . . All this stuff I would think of that wasn't 
in the book. And I thought at any moment, Joel'll tell me, 'Stop it!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher, for his part, was happy to have the help. "She wanted the audience 
to see what kind of inner life this woman had before the boy comes to see her. 
The thing with the window sill where you see her struggling with this broken 
down air-conditioner was something she thought up to show how hot, tired and 
frustrated she was with her whole life. It was more vivid than the alternative: 
watering plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Other directors, notably Paul Mazursky on "Tempest" (1982) and Ridley Scott on 
"Thelma & Louise" (1991), have been just as appreciative of Sarandon's input. 
For instance, the haunting nighttime desert stroll in "Thelma & Louise" was 
Sarandon's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't always been so lucky. She cites a dispute over a line of dialogue 
in "White Palace" (1990), the May-December love story in which she plays a 
fortysomething fast-food waitress romancing James Spader's twentysomething 
yuppie ad man. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this scene when she's having Thanksgiving dinner with his friends. 
And she says, at one point, that Presidents don't make poor people happen . I 
refused to say that line because it didn't fit the character. She knew the 
minimum wage. She knew perfectly well that no President's ever felt beholden to 
a constituency that's poor. So I knew she didn't care who was in the White 
House. And I was adamant about not saying that line. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Well, Susan, she doesn't have your politics.' I said, 'Well, 
clearly not from the way she lives her life, she doesn't have my politics.' But 
that wasn't the point. The point was that the line wasn't true to who she was. 
In that instance, not only wasn't I listened to, I got into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics is an unavoidable subject in dealing with Sarandon, one of the more 
committed, passionate and knowledgeable activists in the film community. She 
works with the Center for Constitutional Rights in fighting First Amendment 
violations and has campaigned against the AIDS epidemic and homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarandon wears her politics so conspicuously that she often hears her 
challenges to a film's purpose described as attempts to be "politically 
correct," an expression she believes is "a really brilliant way to demean 
people who have been struggling for the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time they want to be dismissive, say, when you tell them that more 
African Americans should be cast in movies as lawyers, they say it's 
'politically correct.' And the fact is that there are a lot of people of color 
who are not drug dealers or hookers. It's correct storytelling , not correct 
politics. But they don't want to hear anything that goes against stereotypical 
thinking because if they go against it, they'll be risking their profits." 
</P>
<P>
 It's partly because of the warped values she sees in the film industry that 
Sarandon is especially picky about the roles she accepts. She's just finished 
playing Marmee in an adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's "Little Women" and will 
be seen later this year in "Safe Passage," in which she plays the mother of a 
soldier missing in action. She's also been talking with Jane Campion ("The 
Piano") about a part in the director's adaptation of Henry James' "Portrait of 
a Lady." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other, bigger reasons for being vigilant about her film career. 
Specifically, three of them, growing up together in her New York apartment. In 
fact, she agreed to do "Safe Passage" because it allowed her to work close to 
home during the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids," she says, "are so much more interesting than most of the scripts I 
read that it's certainly not even tempting to spend more time chasing more 
work. My problem lies in finding enough people who feel passionately about what 
they do, that are trying to do something that's different. Not political, but 
something that has its own voice . I'm not tempted that often. So real life to 
me is so much more compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a big part of Sarandon's allure, on-screen and off, is that she seems 
so deeply engaged by all aspects of life, even those pertaining to her beloved 
New York Rangers. While working on "Little Women" in Vancouver, she, Robbins 
and a couple of other Ranger fans ventured deep into enemy territory to cheer 
their team on in Game 6 of their championship series against the Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real . . . interesting sitting in the middle of all those guys while 
wearing a blue Ranger jersey. If we hadn't lost that game, we wouldn't have 
been allowed to leave the stadium alive." 
</P>
<P>
 She has fun. She's got kids she likes. She's near the top of her profession. 
(Did we mention the three Oscar nominations?) What more could anyone want? 
</P>
<P>
 Well . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There are those like director George Miller, with whom Sarandon has worked on 
"The Witches of Eastwick" (1987) and "Lorenzo's Oil" (1992), who suggest that 
Sarandon, for all her accomplishments, is something of an underachiever. 
Sarandon, Miller once told an interviewer, personifies perfectly an Oscar Wilde 
dictum: "Put talent in your craft and genius in your life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee," Sarandon says when told of the quote. "I don't think I'm always a 
genius with my life. But it's nice to hear somebody else say so. Thank you, 
George." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, it is suggested that buried in Miller's praise is the implication 
that Sarandon could accomplish even greater things if. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't have a life?" Sarandon says, completing the thought. "I don't 
know if that's true. . . . I think life is so much bigger than my craft that I 
would rather invest my genius in my life. It has many more challenges, many 
more surprises. It may even demand more from the imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, I don't know how full a cup you can bring to a project if you're not 
living a life. If you're not drawing from real life, then all you're doing is 
rehashing images you've seen in films. Even the images of yourself. And all 
that doesn't interest me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose if I were saving lives every day or close to a vaccine for AIDS, 
yeah, I would definitely put my genius in my work. But I don't know if my work 
could contain my genius that I have in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "And anyway," she adds, "even from the time I started, I've always said that 
the work was always a means to a life. Not the life itself. I'm very grateful 
to be able to make a living this way. It keeps me on my toes, helps me overcome 
inertia. . . . I've been blessed with this ability to have no expectations, but 
to follow something through when it crosses my path. Like my children. Every 
one of them was a surprise, but an absolute gift and without hesitation I 
embrace each one of them."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: 'TO WONG FOO,' TOO; SURE 
HE CAN WEAR A DRESS, BUT CAN HE LOOK CUTE IN IT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Robin Williams made such a convincing woman playing the divorcee who goes 
undercover as an elderly British nanny in last year's $218-million-grossing 
comedy "Mrs. Doubtfire" that it's not surprising he would consider playing a 
drag queen as his next major screen role. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, that's exactly what the actor thought after reading Douglas Carter 
Beane's comedy "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar." The hot 
script is about three New York City transvestites who get stranded in a 
Midwestern town, where they spice up the otherwise quiet lives of the locals. 
</P>
<P>
 But after doing his own make-up test for the role of Vida Boheme -- winner of 
the Drag Queen of the Year contest -- sources say Williams called up his close 
pal Steven Spielberg, whose Amblin Productions is producing the movie for 
Universal Pictures, and conceded that he wasn't pretty enough to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
 The role in the movie -- which began filming Monday in New York under the 
direction of Beeban Kidron ("Used People") -- ultimately went to Patrick Swayze 
after being coveted by dozens of established Hollywood actors including Robert 
Downey Jr., Billy Baldwin, Gary Oldman, Matthew Broderick, James Spader and 
John Cusack, among many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Snipes also stars in the ensemble piece as drag queen Noxeema Jackson, 
and John Leguizamo portrays Chi Chi Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 But audiences shouldn't fret. Though Williams won't be seen in a dress this 
time out, the star will have an unbilled cameo in the movie. His character, 
John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt, is described as an eccentric "jack of all 
trades" or "a walking pawn shop who buys and sells things," who hangs out at a 
kitschy New York restaurant called the China Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is reportedly in just one scene, in which he brokers a deal for 
Swayze and Snipes, who want to cash in their winning beauty contest airline 
tickets to buy a car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to screenwriter Beane's agent, Mary Meagher of the William Morris 
Agency in New York, Williams is one of the first actors Spielberg showed the 
"To Wong Foo" script. "He thought it would amuse him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams could not be reached for comment and Amblin officials declined 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because his is an uncredited, minor role, Williams has reportedly instructed 
the movie company and Universal not to use his name to publicize their film. 
Surely they won't. This, after all, is the guy who still refuses to work again 
at Disney (where he made the hits "Good Morning, Vietnam" and "Dead Poets 
Society") because he's still angry over the studio's use of his voice as the 
wisecracking Genie in "Aladdin" to promote the animated blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 As for other cameos, Williams also had an unbilled quickie in Kenneth 
Branagh's 1991 movie "Dead Again," a past-lives thriller in which he played the 
sinister Dr. Cozy Carlisle. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal plans an early 1995 release for "To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, 
Julie Newmar," whose title refers to the autograph inscription on a celebrity 
photo of the real-life B-movie actress, which the drag queens carry with them 
as a good-luck charm.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: PIZZA PRANK; THESE TWO 
DELIVER, BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE TIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "Let's do lunch" has taken on a whole new meaning for Warner Bros.' top brass 
Robert Daly and Terry Semel. It seems the co-chairmen of the entertainment 
giant have gone into the pizza business -- at least on the big screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe it? Check out director Joel Schumacher's film adaptation of John 
Grisham's novel "The Client," which Warners opens nationwide Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Daly and Semel's big moment comes about a third of the way into the thriller, 
when the movie's 11-year-old lead character (Brad Renfro) is detained by police 
and snatches one of the cop's credit cards. He says he needs to call his mom. 
Instead, he scopes out the Yellow Pages for a pizza parlor that delivers and 
his finger zooms right to Brother's Pizza. There, in all their glory (for a few 
seconds, anyway), are Semel and Daly, tucked under billowy chef hats with Daly 
dashing off with the pizza box and Semel tossing the flying flour dough and 
tomato pie in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In the movie, the boy rings the number and orders up $200 worth of pizza to be 
delivered to the cops as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real joke is on Semel and Daly. (The happy chefs, by the way, are also 
on the cover of the pizza boxes, but that's hard to catch in the film.) It 
seems the Warners chiefs didn't know a thing about the surprise insert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I confess, I did it in Memphis (where the story is set)," says Schumacher, 
snickering. When asked about the pair's reaction, the director said, "Oh, they 
are just pretending it's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 So, would the bon vivants talk about it? Nope. They may not be camera shy, but 
they are comment shy.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: AN EDUCATED RITA RETURNS; 
BRITISH ACTRESS JULIE WALTERS CAPTURED AN OSCAR NOMINATION, THEN PUT HER CAREER 
ON HOLD TO CARE FOR A SICK DAUGHTER. BUT SHE'S BACK IN TWO NEW FILMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID GRITTEN, David Gritten, a frequent contributor to Calendar, is based 
in London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's 10 years ago now since Julie Walters first entered the consciousness of 
American filmgoers in "Educating Rita," playing a young working-class housewife 
who wants to improve herself by studying literature. She was hugely endearing 
in the role, which won her an Oscar nomination, and Walters charmed America in 
person with her refreshingly down-to-earth and comic honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went on the Johnny Carson show, and he invited me back while we were still 
on air," says Walters, now 44. "I did a huge tour of the States, I was driven 
around in limos that were bigger than my flat in London. It was great fun." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like a terrific film career as a comic actress might be budding, but 
instead Walters returned to England and stuck to stage work and TV. As a 
collaborator of comedian, singer-songwriter and playwright Victoria Wood, 
Walters has become one of British TV's best-known faces. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason she seems to have been out of the public eye, to Americans 
at least. But there is another: Almost four years ago Walters' daughter, 
Maisie, then 2 1/2 years old, was diagnosed as suffering from leukemia. The 
actress immediately stopped work for six months to care for her daughter, and 
worked only sporadically for the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Only now is Walters starting to emerge from the trauma that enveloped her 
daughter, herself and Maisie's father, Grant Roffey. Her film "The Summer 
House" with Jeanne Moreau was well-received when it opened in Stateside 
theaters last Christmas; this summer she stars in two new movies, both of which 
open Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is "Just Like a Woman," in which Walters plays a divorced London 
housewife who takes in a lodger, an American merchant banker called Gerald 
(Adrian Pasdar). They embark upon an affair, but then it transpires that Gerald 
is a transvestite. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is "The Wedding Gift," a BBC TV film based on a true story. Walters 
plays Diana Longden, a middle-aged woman almost immobilized by a mysterious 
disease that doctors cannot diagnose. She relies on the moral support of her 
compulsively wisecracking husband, Derick (Jim Broadbent), but, sensing her own 
mortality, encourages him to fall in love with a blind female novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 The two films were actually shot a year apart, but their simultaneous release 
confirms that Walters is back to work in earnest.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maisie's great," says Walters with a broad grin. She has arranged this 
interview at a restaurant and hotel near her home in the Sussex countryside, 
some 40 miles south of London. It's typical of her unpretentious manner that 
she starts the conversation by apologizing for her hair being wet; it's 10 
a.m., and she has only just jumped out of the shower.  
</P>
<P>
 She is a dream to interview -- friendly, talkative, totally without 
affectation and fond of digressing with anecdotes for which she lapses into a 
variety of accents. A trim, bouncy woman with sharp features and an alert, 
almost bird-like manner, she laughs loud and often.  
</P>
<P>
 Walters explains that her daughter has just completed her last appointment for 
blood tests at the Royal Marsden Hospital, a center for cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's 6 years old now, and she's really well. She couldn't have more energy. 
The doctors say the chance of this recurring are about the same as her having a 
road accident. Leukemia's a cancer that responds to long-term chemotherapy, and 
she's been on it for three years. Every weekend she would be tired and washed 
out because of it, but Grant and I were still happy, because it was better than 
her having leukemia." 
</P>
<P>
 There was one setback -- Maisie had a relapse when she was 4. "We thought, 
that's it, we have to face her death," Walters says. "It was a terrible time 
for us all." 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably the British tabloid press played the story to the hilt, and 
Walters and Roffey became accustomed to reporters and photographers camped out 
on their lawn. "They'd take pictures of Maisie's empty swing, they fabricated 
stories without talking to us, it was incredible," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Walters decided to go public about Maisie's illness and auctioned 
an exclusive interview for which a London newspaper paid 20,000 ($30,000); the 
fee went straight to the Royal Marsden's children's unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters was already one of Britain's best-loved personalities, but when the 
story about Maisie broke, the outpouring of sympathy was extraordinary: "We got 
so many letters from people, many of whom had been in the same boat. There was 
this huge wave of warmth. It was lovely. Around this time I met Princess Diana, 
and even she said: 'How is she?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Walters admits her tribulations may have helped in her portrayal in "The 
Wedding Gift." "I'd been through that experience, except I was playing the 
victim of an illness," she says. "But I know that feeling of getting through 
each day, and of that being a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly puts another dimension on your feelings, but I'm frightened of 
tapping the Maisie area in my sense memory. I worry that once I unleash it, the 
feelings would just never stop. It's plumbing the depths of feelings, and I 
feel in a way it's not right to." 
</P>
<P>
 She is enthusiastic about "The Wedding Gift," which was known in Britain as 
"Wide Eyed and Legless" -- the title of a pop song by British group Amen Corner 
that Derick and Diana used to sing rowdily. "I think 'The Wedding Gift' is a 
strange title," says Walters, "but I suppose 'Wide Eyed and Legless' (British 
slang meaning drunk) doesn't mean much in the States. It would make people 
think of amputees or something.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm pleased with that work, doubly so because it was so lovely to do. I 
was sent the script while I was making 'Just Like a Woman,' and I found it so 
touching and funny it made me cry -- which scripts rarely do. On set I thought 
all of us did our absolute best." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters has less to say about "Just Like a Woman," which opened in Britain in 
1992 to lukewarm reviews and did indifferent business: "I'm glad I did it. I 
thought it was good to do a middle-of-the-road film about a subject like that, 
because they're usually art house," she pauses slyly for effect. "Of course, 
not many people saw it anyhow, so it might as well have been art house. I liked 
my character. Her responses to Gerald were good and honorable and right. But 
the film didn't tell me anything more about transvestitism, which is a 
fascinating subject." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite winning an Oscar nomination for her first major film role, Walters 
never saw herself as an actress with a movie career based in America. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to Los Angeles for the Oscars, I was taken around for meetings. 
And I was offered a Burt Reynolds picture called 'Stick.' But I thought, no. I 
was taken along by Columbia Pictures to CAA and they got me an agent. Everyone 
was shocked I didn't want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, come on, it's a big American picture, don't you want to? And I 
said no, it's crap. I can't understand why they're offering me this part. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "They offered me a couple of other things, but I could sense they didn't 
really know what to do with me. I could tell that the things that really 
interested me, the really good scripts, were going to come from England.  
</P>
<P>
 "I could have stayed in L.A. and tried to make something happen. But what was 
the point? No one was going to say, look, you can play a lead role opposite 
Jack Nicholson. Why would they? There are enough American actresses to do that. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I had great fun, but I was visiting, so I was free to say what I liked and go 
home. But I couldn't take the glitz and lip gloss and shoulder pads, and the 
fact that people felt they have to look gorgeous all the time. I'd hate to be 
an actress in L.A. I couldn't stand the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters was born and raised in Smethwick, an unlovely suburb of Birmingham, 
England. (When she discovers this writer lived within a mile of her around the 
same time, she becomes genuinely gleeful, and the interview is suspended for 
serious reminiscing about the area and mutual friends from school.) Her mother 
was an Irish housewife, her father a builder and decorator. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither parent encouraged an acting career, so she entered nursing instead, 
then took the plunge and enrolled for a drama course at a college in 
Manchester: "My mother said, acting? No good will come of it, she'll be in the 
gutter before she's 20. Which on occasions turned out to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 She went on to join the company at Liverpool Everyman Theatre, which brought 
her into contact with playwrights like Willy Russell ("Educating Rita") and 
Alan Bleasdale ("GBH," the British miniseries in which she was seen last year.) 
Respected actors like Jonathan Pryce and Anthony Sher were also at the 
Everyman; she sees her period there as a career turning point. 
</P>
<P>
 Though comic acting seems to be her forte, she has tackled serious stage roles 
too: She won rave reviews as Serafina, the ranting Sicilian widow in Tennessee 
Williams' "The Rose Tattoo," wearing an enormous latex overlay beneath her 
clothes to fill out her trim figure. This was after a six-month break from work 
to tend to Maisie, and the strain of returning to such a physically demanding 
role caused a bout of labyrinthitis, an inflammation of the inner ear that left 
her dizzy, nauseous, fatigued and unsure of her balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the worst seems to be over for Walters and her family. She is filming a 
comic play by Victoria Wood called "Pat and Margaret." Walters plays a British 
actress who becomes a star on an American TV soap and returns to Britain to 
find skeletons in her family's closet. Then she will start work on a miniseries 
by Bleasdale, "Jake's Progress," in which she is the mother of a hyperactive 
child with behavioral disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Things are looking up, then? "Yes," she says cheerfully. "Everything's a lot 
better than it was. When we look back and realize how stressed out we were over 
Maisie, it's incredible. We were just exhausted and that became the norm, 
really. It's only now we're through the worst that we realize how bad things 
were."

 First there was a live-action movie version of the popular cartoon TV series 
"The Flintstones." Now there's a live-action version of a Disney animated 
classic in the works -- "Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 But the master pulling the strings on the latest version of the fairy tale 
about the puppet-turned-boy is not in the Disney camp. It's Francis Ford 
Coppola, the maestro of "The Godfather" trilogy, "Bram Stoker's Dracula" and 
the upcoming Nov. 4 release "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 While Coppola's associates and executives at Columbia Pictures, which would be 
the film's likely distributor, are downplaying the immediacy of the project, 
sources close to the director say it could be his next endeavor. They point to 
a recent story meeting with writers and an anticipated January start date, with 
filming in London. 
</P>
<P>
 Coppola did not return phone calls. But Fred Fuchs, president of Coppola's 
American Zoetrope Studio, insists that the director's "lifelong dream" to film 
the fairy tale is only in the embryonic stage at this point. "This is not a 
picture with a start date or really even in pre-production. But it is true that 
Francis is working on the story and that there have been creative sessions with 
writers." 
</P>
<P>
 To be specific, Coppola called an impromptu meeting with writers Randi Mayem 
Singer ("Mrs. Doubtfire"), Michael Tolkin ("The Player"), Helen Childress 
("Reality Bites"), Ed Solomon ("Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure") and TV 
writers Lisa Marie Radano and John Ridley the first weekend in June. When the 
writers were told to show up at the filmmaker's Los Angeles home the next day, 
they weren't told why. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty cool, a very spontaneous thing," said one of the writers. "He 
wanted people who knew how to write for kids' roles." All of the writers were 
sworn to secrecy and none was reportedly assured of a callback. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs said it was just another "one of Francis' brainstorming sessions. He 
loves this story dearly, always has, but it will be a screenplay he's writing 
himself." At one point, Coppola apparently even considered casting Michael 
Jackson in the lead role. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, Coppola will incorporate various adaptations of the fable, the 
best known of course being Disney's timeless 1940 animated classic, into his 
own version. Because Collodi's fairy tale, first published in 1883, is in the 
public domain, Disney doesn't have a say about how the filmmaker portrays the 
Pinocchio characters unless he makes them look like those in its movie version. 
Only then would there be trademark infringement, a Disney spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Columbia source said the studio was a bit concerned that Coppola's plans 
might be swallowed up in a dispute with Warner Bros., which several years ago 
had expressed interest in doing its own live-action "Pinocchio." But Fuchs 
said, "it really didn't go anywhere. . . . There was no deal with Warner Bros. 
regarding Francis' script or this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs noted there's a chance the project could be jointly financed by Columbia 
and another party, possibly a foreign investor. A Columbia source said 
Coppola's hoped-for January production start is a fairy tale and that the 
earliest cameras could begin rolling is the spring.

POP MUSIC; SURVIVAL OF THE RAWEST; DEATH HAS TOUCHED 7 YEAR BITCH SEVERAL TIMES 
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, BUT THE GROUP HAS TURNED ITS GRIEF AND ANGER INTO 
INTENSE SONGS THAT HAVE ATTRACTED A LOYAL FOLLOWING IN ALTERNATIVE CIRCLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With everything that's happened to 7 Year Bitch during the past two years, the 
Seattle quartet should out-gloom the most notoriously downcast rock bands, from 
England's landmark Joy Division to Seattle's Alice in Chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The first trauma for the band was the drug-related death in 1992 of original 
guitarist Stefanie Sargent. A year later, fellow musician and band mentor Mia 
Zapata was raped and murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 With the suicide of Seattle cohort Kurt Cobain in April and the overdose death 
last month of the band's friend Kristin Pfaff, bassist for the group Hole, you 
couldn't blame the members of 7 Year Bitch if they wanted to hang it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really hard sometimes to keep going and keep in a good frame of mind 
when everybody's dropping away," says singer Selene Vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 But the band has fought back. The group's gruff new album, "Viva Zapata," is 
defiantly celebratory and very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have my cake and eat it too, just like you," Vigil rails in "The 
Scratch." In "M.I.A.," a response to Zapata's murder, she seethes, "Does 
society have justice for you? Well if not, then I do." 
</P>
<P>
 That ability to balance the dark with the hopeful has combined with the band's 
strong survival instinct to gain 7 Year Bitch a loyal following in the world of 
alternative/college rock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to 7 Year Bitch, most bands seem wimpy," says Jennifer Fischer, 
publicist at Seattle's C/Z Records, the independent label that 7 Year Bitch has 
been on for two years. "The band has a (defiant) attitude, and I think that a 
lot of people relate to that. You know, just that pure and driven anger." 
</P>
<P>
 The music and attitude attracted major record labels' interest, and the group 
recently signed with Atlantic Records, which will release the group's next 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's just starting to feel like it did right before Stefanie died, when 
everything was starting to come together," says Vigil, whose husky speaking 
voice reflects the wear of belting the songs on tour. The 27-year-old singer is 
small and compact, and her bleached hair contrasts sharply with her olive skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were at this super peak when we really felt we knew what we were doing -- 
we had a grip on it and felt it. I thought, 'God, it's never gonna be like that 
again,' but in the past couple months it has been. It's starting to click and 
gel musically and friendship-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the grief and rage that 7 Year Bitch felt over the murder of Zapata, 
leader of the group the Gits, is reflected on the album. When talking about it, 
Elizabeth Davis' voice quavers with intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stunned us," says Bitch's 29-year-old bassist and songwriter. "It's 
something we feel and deal with every day because (the killer) still hasn't 
been caught. It's something still very much in the forefront of our heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Agnew, 25, the group's drummer, was so moved by the death that she 
founded a nonprofit organization, Home Alive, that promotes self-defense 
courses and other safeguards against rape. With increasing participation from 
other musicians, Home Alive also stages benefit shows and is currently working 
on a compilation album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mia was also an extremely big influence on me -- just the way she sang, and 
her honesty," Vigil explains. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the first person who made me feel like I could sing. She was also a 
big help to our band when we started. They (the Gits) would let us practice in 
their space and helped us get shows. They were totally behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Vigil grew up in Spokane, Wash., as one of six children, all of whom were 
exposed to a wide range of contemporary music. Her father, a hairdresser, loved 
Motown, blues, reggae and soul music. Her mom, a housewife, listened to country 
music, especially Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Attracted to the youth scene in Seattle, she moved to the city soon after 
graduating from high school and got a job at a health food store. There she met 
Agnew, a fellow employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I first seriously started thinking about having a band," Vigil 
says. "Val and I thought, 'Yeah, we should do it.' We finally got up and did 
it, and it was terrifying. We sucked, but it was so fun I wanted to do it again 
and again." 
</P>
<P>
 They hooked up with Davis, a transplanted Southern Californian who worked in 
the same open market. Sargent, a well-known figure on the Seattle scene, 
completed the original 7 Year Bitch lineup in 1990, and the group eventually 
shared stages with such touted area bands as Pearl Jam. The group was signed in 
early 1992 by C/Z Records, but Sargent died five months later, while the band 
was recording its first full album. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't even talk about the band after that," Vigil recalls. "It was more 
like 'Our best friend's gone.' First and foremost, we missed Stefanie. It 
wasn't until a couple weeks later we were able to sit down and talk about what 
we were gonna do with the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our guts, all three of us knew we wanted to stay together and keep 
playing. We just went into the process of figuring out 'How are we going to do 
that? Should we keep the name?' All that stuff. After a few weeks, we finally 
put out the word we were looking for a guitarist, but it was even a couple 
months after that when we actually got into it and started looking." 
</P>
<P>
 After completing the debut album, "Sick 'Em," by adding old singles and some 
other tracks they had recorded earlier, 7 Year Bitch went almost six months 
before hiring guitarist Roisin Dunne, now 28. That's when the group also 
resumed touring, starting the momentum that has brought it acclaim and major 
record-company support. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's a female band from Washington that sings raw, abrasive lyrics, 7 
Year Bitch is often mistaken for a member of the highly publicized "riot grrrl" 
movement. That underground scene, based in Olympia and led by the group Bikini 
Kill is characterized by pop-punk music with a radical feminist thrust and is 
accompanied by a whole network of fanzines and telephone hot lines. 
</P>
<P>
 It's disheartening for 7 Year Bitch to find that its feelings -- formed in the 
intensity of personal tragedy -- are being perceived as part of an easily 
categorized political agenda. For Vigil, it's just pure, individual expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think our last album was political at all," she says. "That's a term 
that gets shoved on us. We are all against war, so we wrote (a song about it). 
It was something that came out in about five minutes. 'Dead Men Don't Rape' is 
about rape, and 'Chow Down' is about abortion. Those are all personal issues. 
Everyone thinks we're taking this big stand, but it's stuff that happens to 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the anger, 7 Year Bitch displays a subtle, sarcastic humor -- 
but not enough to keep the members from being portrayed as the scariest women 
to set foot on man's Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extremely irritating when people call us male-bashers," says Vigil, who 
plans to get married soon. "It's just a totally false and narrow-minded thing 
to say about us. . . . Just because we have intense songs about relationships, 
it's not like I'm a male-basher. Like 'Dead Men Don't Rape' is not a song about 
men, it's about rapists." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the misconceptions and misfortunes that the members of 7 Year 
Bitch have been through have made them stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess through all of this," Davis says, "we've become really close and turn 
to each other a lot. We're all very aware that what we're doing is a rare 
opportunity and we are all really fortunate to have each other. It's like a 
dream. I never want to take it for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . I know it sounds cliched, but when people die, it really makes you 
realize that you don't know how much time you have. You realize that life is 
hard and beautiful and horrible, and you just have to jump into it. It makes 
you live harder. I've never lived this hard before."*

WILL HER FANS FORGIVE ATONING O'CONNOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Levine 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We're probably going to see lots of pop stars record Kurt Cobain songs over 
the next few years, but who ever expected super-rebel Sinead O'Connor to be the 
first? 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish spitfire has recorded a haunting version of Cobain's "All Apologies" 
for her first collection of primarily original material since 1990's 
2-million-selling "I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got." The new album, titled 
"Universal Mother," is due Sept. 15 -- Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean that O'Connor is apologizing for some of the controversial 
things she's done in the past -- most notoriously tearing up a picture of the 
Pope during her performance on "Saturday Night Live." That outburst got her 
booed off the stage shortly afterward, at the October, 1992, Bob Dylan tribute 
concert at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Apology might be too strong a word, says O'Connor spokeswoman Elaine Schock. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you listen to the record, it doesn't sound like an apology," Schock says. 
"She's always strong in her beliefs, and that's never going to change. She's 
anything but predictable."  
</P>
<P>
 Schock does say, though, that O'Connor deliberately chose the Day of Atonement 
as the release date. 
</P>
<P>
 Will fans forgive her? 
</P>
<P>
 Many seemed to have done so when she was greeted warmly while appearing with 
Peter Gabriel during the WOMAD tour last summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Album sales may give a clue -- her last album, the 1992 standards collection 
"Am I Not Your Girl?," was not a big sales success. But the real test will come 
when she gives her first U.S. concerts since the Dylan fiasco -- a tour is 
being planned for October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to forecast (the demand for tickets)," says Gary Bongiovanni, 
editor of the concert trade magazine Pollstar. "If radio embraces the record, I 
suppose there's a significant market for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Schock says that O'Connor is realistic about how fans will react to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's going to get some boos. But she knows that." Robert Levine

 ROCKY SESSION: For Wednesday's 25th anniversary of the first moon walk, the 
San Juan Institute plans to celebrate in fitting style -- by showing off its 
moon rocks (B1). The scientific think tank will hold a free lecture that night 
about the historic landing. You can also view the moon through its telescopes, 
and see moon samples from all six Apollo landings. . . . Says its director, 
Douglas Nash: "People find moon rocks fascinating, but some expect them to be 
made of gold."

 TWO DOZEN WALLYS? Wally George, Orange County's staunchly conservative host of 
TV's syndicated "Hot Seat," tapes his 12th anniversary show later this month. 
This year, he's had to concentrate on a series of medical problems more than 
the targets of his usual weekly barbs. George recently overcame a serious bout 
of kidney trouble and will face surgery for prostate cancer in August. . . . 
But he's optimistic: "I'm looking forward to doing 12 more years here." 
</P>
<P>
 HIT IT: Jury duty doesn't have to be a pain. When Superior Court Judge William 
R. Froeberg steps off the bench to briefly meet with lawyers, the music is 
turned on. . . . The judge has ordered early rock or easy listening songs for 
jurors during such breaks in the action. He also permits jurors to have snacks 
and sends his bailiff and clerk to chat with them when they can. (No talking 
about the case, of course.) Says Froeberg: "Court is tense enough, why add more 
stress?" Declares one juror: "I have to say, it's been nice serving in this 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 BADGERING THE POLICE: In Fullerton, the police will soon be wearing new 
badges: oval-shaped plates with the city logo and picture of the police 
building. The old badges showed the state seal. Councilman Don Bankhead, a 
former police captain, says it's to boost police morale: "The officers work for 
a city agency and this badge represents that city." They cost almost $11,000, 
but part will be offset by officers buying their old badges as keepsakes. No 
price has been set yet.

 A WHOLE NEW WORLD: If you've always wanted to step into a Disney cartoon, get 
ready for your chance. This fall, guests at Disney's Epcot Center in Florida 
will be able to take a virtual reality trip through the world of "Aladdin" and 
witness a re-creation of the Glendale studio where the film was created. . . . 
"Our long-term goal is to have virtual reality attractions at all our parks," 
said John Dreyer, spokesman for the Burbank-based company. 
</P>
<P>
 PERFECT PASTA: Call the travel agent, and cancel that trip to Italy. You don't 
have to cross the ocean to find the perfect pasta. Sherman Oaks will do just as 
well. The restaurant is Posto, and the chef, Luciano Pellegrini, comes from 
northern Italy. . . . Check out the rigatoni with tomato and basil, or the 
linguine with fresh clams. Magazine, Page 27.

 COMEBACK: After two seasons in the dark, the Padua Hills Playwrights Festival 
will return this week. From Thursday through Aug. 14, eight new plays will be 
presented at Woodbury University in Burbank. . . . The festival, a fixture 
since 1978, had big money problems, and fund-raising remains an issue. But it 
got a $25,000 grant and a new board of directors to get it back on track.

 FLEA MARKET: That's what one courtroom at the Van Nuys courthouse has become 
after an infestation of fleas that refuse to be exterminated. . . . The 
courtroom is actually a trailer pressed into service after the Northridge 
earthquake, and the fleas are "everywhere," clerk Christopher Koch said. 
"Absolutely, positively disgusting." B1

A CALL IN THE NIGHT: SHE TOOK THEIR CHILD; FAMILY: JON RAMIREZ'S EX-WIFE 
BROUGHT DAUGHTER TO THE NETHERLANDS. SIMILAR CASES ARE INCREASINGLY COMMON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL GRANBERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Friday evening in July of last year, Jon M. Ramirez drove to the home of 
his ex-wife to pick up their 2-year-old daughter for the weekend. But neither 
the girl nor her mother was there, and for 48 hours, a panicked Ramirez heard 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the restless quiet of a Sunday night, the phone call finally came. The 
voice on the other end was that of Roswita Olejniczak, the mother of their 
daughter, Tanyta. She told him she had flown to her native country, the 
Netherlands, and would not be returning to California. And neither, she said, 
would their child. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus began a harrowing and expensive ordeal for Ramirez, 33, an insurance 
underwriter whose mission to bring back his daughter, now 3, has taken him from 
the Orange County district attorney's office -- which has kidnaping charges 
pending against the mother -- to the U.S. State Department to the Dutch courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with a foreign government is maddening enough, he said, but "when the 
fate of your 3-year-old girl hangs in the balance, the fear and frustration -- 
the terror -- take on a whole new meaning. Suddenly, your life comes apart, and 
you feel incredibly hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 As the international divorce rate rises, cases like that of Ramirez multiply 
almost exponentially. There are at least 50 like it in Orange County alone, 
according to the district attorney's office. Some have been on the books more 
than 20 years, while some of the "children" involved are now in their 30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from the State Department show that 441 children were taken unlawfully 
from homes in the United States in 1993 to the 32 countries that honor the 
Hague Convention, a 1988 treaty designed to create a worldwide standard in 
mitigating such cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The treaty stipulates that, when a child is wrongfully removed from one member 
nation to another, "the child should be immediately returned to the place of 
habitual residence" -- meaning the country from which the child was taken, said 
State Department spokesman Gary Sheaffer. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials say the Ramirez case points up obvious flaws in a treaty that at 
times seem to defeat its very purpose. The situation is complicated by the ways 
in which member countries interpret the treaty, Sheaffer said, which leads to 
the heart of the predicament involving Tanyta Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, a U.S. custody order has no legal grounds outside the United 
States," despite the existence of the treaty, he said. "And generally, you end 
up fighting an all-new custody battle in another country just to get the child 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign courts have the option of granting an exception to the treaty if, in 
their view, it would be "psychologically or physically harmful to return the 
child" -- which is why Tanyta remains in the Netherlands, even though Ramirez 
was granted sole physical custody of her by a California court after she was 
taken by her mother. . 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts there ruled that it would be damaging to return the child to the 
U.S.," because state and federal kidnaping charges are pending against the 
mother, Sheaffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that a Dutch courts made its ruling "only because it feared that the 
mother's arrest would do lasting damage to the child." Tanyta has lived with 
her mother since birth.  
</P>
<P>
 Statistics bear out the point that the Hague Convention has stopped short of 
accomplishing its desired objective. The numbers show an increase in child 
abductions each year since the pact was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 268 children were taken from the United States to Hague Convention 
countries and 247 were taken to countries that haven't signed the treaty. The 
preceding year, 207 were removed from the United States to other Hague 
countries, with 245 going to non-Hague countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The flow of children from Hague countries to the United States is even higher, 
with 357 ending up here in 1993, compared to 178 in 1992 and 148 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Parental child abduction occurring within the United States alone has become a 
staggering problem, according to a recent Department of Justice study that says 
such abductions reach 350,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most children are returned to their homes within a week or so, as 
many as 160,000 remain missing for longer periods of time, according to the 
study. The longer a child is missing, the less likely he or she will be 
returned to the custodial parent. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ramirez, the seemingly endless hours of phone-calling, letter-writing and 
lobbying -- and more than $9,000 in legal and travel expenses -- have failed to 
reunite father and daughter. At the time she was taken, Tanyta lived with her 
mother and saw her father on weekends. But both parents shared joint legal 
custody, meaning the law required them to agree on all major decisions. Ramirez 
said he had "no inkling" his ex-wife would flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has written to President Clinton, U.S. Sens. Dianne Feinstein 
and Barbara Boxer, Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside), Queen Beatrix of the 
Netherlands and the Dutch Ministry of Justice. No one, he said, has offered 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts in the Netherlands -- including its Supreme Court -- have ruled against 
Ramirez and in favor of the mother, citing the welfare of the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at her home in Land-graaf, the Netherlands, Olejniczak, 31, said she 
left the United States because she feared her temporary green card, which 
expired in June, 1993, would not be renewed. And if she had been deported, "I 
felt I might never see my daughter again," she said. "Tanyta . . . she's my 
everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Olejniczak met Ramirez in 1987 in the Netherlands, where he was stationed in 
the Army and she worked for the American military. They were married in August, 
1990, celebrated the birth of Tanyta in March, 1991, separated in October, 
1991, and were divorced by July, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She said it was a difficult and often volatile marriage and life afterward was 
even harder. Ramirez paid $385 a month in child support, but no alimony. Having 
trouble making ends meet, Olejniczak approached county welfare authorities for 
assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 She received $627 for one month, just before expiration of her green card, but 
said welfare officials told her that, without a valid visa, she could no longer 
qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here were these welfare people telling me I was an illegal alien," she said, 
"so I thought, 'I better get out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez disputes her version of events, saying her green card had been 
extended to last December. Olejniczak claims to have learned about the 
extension only recently. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to resolve the matter, Olejniczak says she would allow Tanyta to 
return to the United States, but only for a visit and only if all criminal 
charges are dropped and the courts award her sole physical custody. Neither 
appears likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just an emptiness," a tearful Ramirez said recently at his home here. 
"At night, I look up at the sky and wonder if Tanyta sees the same stars I do 
-- and misses me as much as I miss her. It's just a feeling of doom I have, 
wondering if anyone will ever expend the effort to help me bring my daughter 
home. How can you explain losing your child?" 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is, such cases often drag on for years, and many are never 
resolved, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Kelly MacEachern, who handles the Ramirez 
case and more than 50 "just like it" in Orange County. Many of the children 
involved are now in their 20s and 30s and often don't see the abandoned parent 
until they make the effort themselves as adults, MacEachern said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he wants only "reasonable contact" with his daughter, who he says 
is losing the ability to speak English in favor of Dutch. He recently sought to 
have criminal charges dropped in an effort to bring about her return, but 
prosecutors declined. Only an order from the U.S. attorney general would erase 
the outstanding warrants, and, officials say, that isn't likely to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last year, Ramirez has been allowed to see Tanyta only once, in a 
supervised visit in April, after a contentious hearing in the Netherlands. 
Olejniczak's brother, father and uncle huddled nearby, Ramirez said, apparently 
concerned that he, too, might try to take her away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell into the same sweet routines," he said. "Watching TV, she put her 
arms around me, held me tight and called me Daddy. Having to leave her there 
was gut-wrenching. She looked out the window and blew kisses at me. She waved 
that little wave of hers . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, his eyes filled with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, I feel I just can't go on," he said. "You have no idea how awful 
this is. It's the scariest nightmare I could possibly imagine. It consumes your 
life. I'd give anything to see it end and have her back in my arms again."

STATE TEACHERS UNION ENDORSES BROWN FOR GOVERNOR; EDUCATION: ACTION COMES AS 
NATIONAL CONVENTION GETS UNDERWAY IN ANAHEIM, WITH AL GORE TO SPEAK TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The 40,000-member California Federation of Teachers endorsed gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown here Saturday as the parent American Federation of 
Teachers' 73rd convention got underway, with leaders introducing the issues 
that will occupy the union's delegates through Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Kathleen Brown cares deeply about kids -- big kids and little 
kids -- at all levels," said California Federation of Teachers President Mary 
Bergan, a vice president of the national organization. "We are very proud to 
endorse her." 
</P>
<P>
 The state organization, which had endorsed state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi in the gubernatorial primary in June, has had some differences with 
Brown in the past, in part regarding her support for charter schools. But Brown 
vowed Saturday to focus on a common goal: improving the state's public school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to focus on the areas where we can work together," she said at a 
news conference held before the union's national president, Albert Shanker, and 
U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley welcomed 4,000 delegates to the 
Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown promised to implement a job training program for high school students, 
pump $100 million in technology into the schools and work to achieve campus 
safety. She also took a jab at Gov. Pete Wilson, echoing her campaign 
television commercial, which accuses him of reducing funds for education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has had his chance, and he gets a failing grade," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the convention center, more than 50 members of the African United 
Front of Los Angeles and the Coalition Against Black Exploitation protested the 
convention, criticizing the AFT for refusing to consider the merits of an 
Afrocentric curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFT has been unwilling to engage in scholarly debate about moving away 
from a Eurocentric focus on history in public education and highlighting 
African contributions to history and world civilization, community activist 
Nzinga Heru said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the protesters are asking for an opportunity to present their views 
and have them published in American Teacher, the AFT publication. They also 
want the AFT to assemble a committee of Afrocentrists to provide the union with 
a book list, and they ask that the union hold local seminars on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFT issued a statement Saturday in response to the protest, saying that it 
"respects the heritage and value of every child" but does not endorse 
"Afrocentrism or any other educational approach based on ideology." 
</P>
<P>
 Delegates from the 852,000-member American Federation of Teachers, whose 
convention opened Friday, began formal sessions Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention, which runs through Tuesday, features an address today by Vice 
President Al Gore. In addition to Brown and Riley, state Rep. Tom Umberg 
(D-Garden Grove), a candidate for attorney general, welcomed delegates 
Saturday, along with state Rep. Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), who is running for 
superintendent of public instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, Umberg and Eastin all issued impassioned pleas for the defeat of the 
"Save Our State" initiative on the November ballot, which would deny health and 
educational benefits to illegal immigrants and their children, whether or not 
they were born in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a 'Save Our State' initiative. It is a 'Separate the People of Our 
State' initiative," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would force teachers to police their students rather than teach 
them, she said. Umberg said the measure would pose a public safety hazard by 
placing thousands of schoolchildren out on the streets with nothing to do.

PROMISING THE MOON; LUNAR ROCKS TO BE STARS OF PROGRAM BY FORMER NASA SCIENTIST 
ON ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA and JEFFREY BEAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1969, after global fascination with the first manned lunar landing had 
cooled, the scientific community still needed a few things explained. 
</P>
<P>
 There were questions, legends and myths about the moon that had existed ever 
since human beings first stood erect and stared in awe at the strange, bright 
orb hanging in the night sky. How did it get there? Is life on the moon 
possible? Green cheese or igneous rock? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was intense, worldwide interest in the answers held by the moon rocks. 
It was an extremely exciting time," said Douglas Nash, 61, who was part of an 
elite group of NASA scientists assigned to answer age-old scientific questions 
about the moon. "It's amazing what heroes our scientists were back then." 
</P>
<P>
 As the 25th anniversary of Neil Armstrong's historic moon walk is observed 
around the globe this week, Nash, who now directs the San Juan Institute, a San 
Juan Capistrano-based think tank, clearly remembers the excitement of waiting 
for the first crate of moon rocks to be released from quarantine in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he also shakes his head and wonders where in the cosmos has Washington's 
support for space exploration gone in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't convince me 25 years ago that we wouldn't be back to the moon 
several times," Nash said. "The tragedy is that generations of scientists who 
have all that knowledge from the early Apollo era are about to retire. All that 
knowledge will be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 With the July 20 anniversary approaching, however, Nash doesn't have time for 
bittersweet memories. He is busy preparing a special, free program at the San 
Juan Institute for Wednesday that will include a display of moon samples from 
all six Apollo missions. The daylong event will feature lectures from 
scientists about lunar exploration and a telescopic peek at the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 For Nash, the program will be a chance to share his experiences during one of 
the most historic and significant chapters in space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a big, big event for us," he said. "The Apollo 11 mission was the 
first to bring back lunar samples, and security was tight. Where the rocks were 
kept we had motion detectors, special locks and closed circuit television." 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Nash took the lunar specimens on a trip, it was like a page 
from a bad spy novel. "I had escorts," he said. "The moon rocks were in a 
suitcase with a chain shackled to my wrist." 
</P>
<P>
 George Mueller, an administrator in NASA's Manned Space Flight division at the 
time, said the Apollo 11 launch was the zenith of the country's technological 
achievements. He hopes the anniversary will rekindle public interest in the 
space program, but Mueller wonders if elected officials in Washington would 
commit more money. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's interesting that we've been consigning our space exploration to 
history before we've started," said the 71-year-old Santa Barbara resident, who 
is now president of the International Academy of Astronautics. "That first step 
is a very small first step when you think of space exploration." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much mystery still surrounds the moon, Nash and his fellow NASA 
scientists solved many moon riddles just a few weeks after getting their hands 
on the lunar samples. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of the major questions were answered very quickly, such as how old 
the moon is," Nash said. "Through radioactive dating techniques, we determined 
that the moon is about 4 1/2 billion years old." 
</P>
<P>
 As to where the moon came from, studies of lunar rocks have contributed to the 
theory that the planet was produced by a collision involving primitive Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 When Earth was still a seething mixture of semi-solid rock and magma, Nash 
said, a very large object, maybe a tenth of the size of the globe, probably 
crashed into it, ejecting enough material to form the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The moon samples themselves are a mix of orthosite, a type of stone found in 
the Earth's mantle, and basaltic rock, a volcanic material similar to that 
commonly seen in Hawaii and Iceland. 
</P>
<P>
 One major difference, though, between Earth and moon rock is that, unlike 
their terrane counterparts, moon stones are completely devoid of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moon samples were found to be degassed, missing all volatile material 
such as water," Nash said. "It probably happened during the impact that formed 
the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young scientist working for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, 
Nash submitted a proposal to NASA along with hundreds of other researchers in 
hopes of being considered for the moon project. 
</P>
<P>
 To his delight, NASA chose him to be one of about 100 scientists assigned to 
the high profile Apollo 11 program. His project: Find out why the moon appears 
so luminescent, despite studies indicating that the earthly satellite is 
basically a dark object.  
</P>
<P>
 Nash soon found out that billions of years of bombardment by microscopic 
meteorites had caused rock on the moon's surface to vitrify. The heat caused by 
innumerable meteor impacts melted the stone over time, turning it glassy and 
highly reflective. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw that the rocks had little 'zap' pits in them," he said. "It was the 
first direct evidence of micrometeor impacts. Immense heat energy was caused by 
these impacts because these tiny meteors, which would normally burn up in our 
atmosphere, were landing at extremely high velocities of 10 to 20 kilometers 
per second." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after being plucked from the lunar surface, the moon rocks 
are still helping Nash understand the cosmos with the help of new technology 
that was unavailable during the height of the Apollo program. One of them is 
infrared testing to determine what elements a rock is composed of. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will help us map the moon's surface in more detail than ever before," Nash 
said. "This is important because more than 95% of the moon's surface is 
unexplored."

'SOMETHING OUT OF THIS WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Tweten was hoping Saturday he would run into some old friends who worked 
on the Apollo 11 project so he could reminisce about the craziness leading up 
to the mission that mesmerized the world 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tweten, 82, worked as an assistant foreman at McDonnell Douglas, where he 
helped inspect parts for Apollo 11, and made sure they were tested and put 
through a special cleaning process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was so critical," he said. "But it was worth watching something 
you worked so hard on go up and come back down. It was very special because it 
was something out of this world." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Tweten came to the McDonnell Douglas plant here with his three 
grandchildren, joining 700 other former and current employees who came to 
celebrate their part in the mission that put the first person on the moon July 
20, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration was a chance to see old colleagues, watch highlights of the 
mission and remember the time when they were are part of history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been trying to find people I know so that I could reminisce, but it 
seems I have had a tough time," Tweten said. "I think I outlived them." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd filtered into a room covered with enlarged photographs of the 
historic landing, the view from mission control and some pre-flight events. 
There were speeches, including one by former Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
 People glanced at old newspaper and magazine clippings and walked through a 
full-scale lab module. They also glimpsed at the future of space travel, 
watching a video of test flights for the Delta Clipper experiment, which 
engineers hope will make missions more affordable and quicker by creating the 
first fully reusable rocket. 
</P>
<P>
 But for some, the only thing on their minds was the 195-hour-long mission that 
spellbound more than 600 million Americans, who were riveted to television sets 
and radios, as astronaut Neil Armstrong took his first steps on the lunar 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Patelski was 39 when he talked Armstrong and Edwin (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. 
through the first part of the mission, informing them of their flight path, 
capsule temperature and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember it like it was yesterday," said Patelski, the mission control 
Houston manager for McDonnell Douglas at the time. "I still know every move I 
made and every thought I had. (The mission) was so impressive and everyone 
after that was just as impressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Patelski spent much of Saturday afternoon signing autographs and shaking hands 
with teen-agers and old friends.  
</P>
<P>
 "This has been fantastic," he said. "It was an important time and knowing you 
participated in something that was key in history is a wonderful feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 But to some it was no more spectacular than other space explorations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen so many rockets launch that by the time the Apollo 11 went up, to 
me, it was just some rocket in the air," said 72-year-old Maxwell Hunter, who 
was the chief design engineer for the Apollo 11 and currently works on the 
Delta Clipper project. "I am not saying it wasn't stunning, but so were all the 
other missions before and after Apollo 11."

CAR RACE ENDS IN DEATH OF TEEN-AGER; ACCIDENT: FOUR OTHERS ARE INJURED IN CRASH 
AS AUTO GOES OUT OF CONTROL AND STRIKES A LIGHT POLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 An early morning street race Saturday by two young motorists left a 
16-year-old girl dead and four other teen-agers with major injuries when the 
speeding car they were in spun out of control and sheared a concrete light pole 
on Brookhurst Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred about 12:18 a.m. when a 17-year-old Anaheim girl driving a 
1994 Honda Civic and a 16-year-old Pomona boy driving a 1974 Datsun 240Z were 
racing southbound on Brookhurst, Anaheim police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Hartman, 53, who lives in an apartment about a block away, said the Honda 
"looked like it fell from the sky." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was unbelievable. It looked more like an airline crash than a car 
accident," Hartman said. "I knew whoever was in that car was dead or close to 
it. I figured they had to be going 100 miles per hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Police were unable to say how fast the cars were going but they were traveling 
at "a high rate of speed." 
</P>
<P>
 The frightening impact was heard several blocks away by sleeping residents, 
who rushed from their homes to the scene. They arrived to find the Honda, 
crumpled and crushed, with the light pole lying across the rear of the vehicle. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Two victims were trapped inside. One, Stefanie Russo, 16, a Loara High School 
student, was pronounced dead at Martin Luther Hospital in Anaheim. She died of 
multiple traumatic injuries, a spokesman for the Orange County coroner's office 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had to cut through the mangled car to extricate Russo and a 
teen-age boy. The Anaheim Fire Department sent 29 firefighters, four paramedic 
engines and one emergency medical technician engine to the scene, where it took 
15 minutes to remove the two trapped in the car. All of the victims were rushed 
to area hospitals. An unidentified teen-age boy was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana with a severe spinal injury, two collapsed lungs and head 
injuries. The teen-ager, who police said is from Huntington Beach, was listed 
in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Honda, Natalie Espinosa, who graduated from Loara High 
School this year, was in critical condition with major head injuries. The other 
two passengers, both 16-year-old Anaheim boys, were in serious condition with 
broken bones and internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara Principal Barry Escoe described Espinosa and Russo, who would have 
graduated next year, as good kids. "We are very saddened by what has happened," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Datsun that police said was racing with Espinosa's car was not damaged. 
Police said nobody in the Datsun was hurt, and the driver stopped and gave 
investigators a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the Honda began to spin at Brookmore Avenue, just north of Ball 
Road, and crashed into the light pole with such intensity that the driver and 
two passengers were ejected into the street, and the two other teen-agers were 
trapped inside the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda jumped the curb in front of the New Horizons Senior Center and then 
slammed into the light pole in front of the China Ball restaurant at 875 S. 
Brookhurst St. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene McKee, 65, who lives in the senior center, said she had just turned out 
her lights to go to sleep when she heard "a God awful crash."  
</P>
<P>
 "It scared the life out of me," McKee said. She ran outside to her 
second-story balcony and saw the aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could hear music coming from a boom box and some young people talking, 
something about a fire. Then I heard all the sirens, from the police cars and 
the firemen," McKee said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Honda was on the street facing north on Brookhurst, exactly 
opposite from the direction police said it was traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started praying for the people inside. There wasn't anything else I could 
do," McKee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vicki Henkes, who lives in a condominium a block west of the crash site, said 
she was in bed watching television when she heard the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we heard was a horrible crash," said Henkes, 48, a 15-year Anaheim 
resident and mother of a daughter. "You couldn't avoid hearing it. It was 
horrible. There was so much crashing metal and glass, it sounded like a bridge 
collapsing." 
</P>
<P>
 Henkes said the Honda may have hit the light pole at full speed because there 
was no screeching of brakes, just the crash into the light pole. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very bad street," Henkes said. "This is not the first time we've 
had an accident here." 
</P>
<P>
 Brookhurst Street is a major traffic artery running north and south, almost 
the length of Orange County, and is up to six lanes wide in some places.

 More than 12 hours after the crash, bloodstains were visible on the sidewalk 
and street. Broken glass, a broken tree branch and car parts were strewn as far 
as 50 feet away. Friends of the victims visited the crash site throughout the 
day, and some left small bouquets of flowers on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of the injured teen-ager who was taken to Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana said he had been invited by the group to join them "in hanging 
out" Friday night. The friend, who asked that his name be withheld, said he 
turned down the invitation because he already had plans for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was awakened by a phone call about 2:30 a.m. from a friend who told 
him about the crash.

CONCERN GROWS OVER EROSION OF COUNTY PARKS; RECREATION: MAINTENANCE, SECURITY 
AND ACTIVITIES FOR RESIDENTS HAVE BEEN REDUCED. FRUSTRATED OFFICIALS CONSIDER 
USER FEES, SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS AND FUND-RAISERS.

<P>
 Los Angeles County's park and recreation system has long been a jewel in the 
firmament of county government. 
</P>
<P>
 Carefully acquired since the end of World War II, the 68,000 acres of hiking 
and riding trails, golf courses, gardens, lakes, pools, tennis courts and other 
open spaces have proved a haven for nearly every segment of Los Angeles 
County's diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
 But concern is growing among park lovers that budget cutbacks and other 
constraints are slowly eroding what is the nation's largest urban park 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions at county parks were given scrutiny recently after a spate of 
attacks on lifeguards at a county-owned public swimming pool in South-Central 
Los Angeles. The violence raised concern about security, and exposed a well of 
community frustration at recently imposed pool fees that have caused a dive in 
attendance at pools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Park advocates now express concern that the county's budget problems are 
beginning to limit access to the residents that the parks were designed to 
serve and that a general deterioration of the parks will result in a lower 
quality of life for the county's urban dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time this park system was looked on as among the top five in the 
nation; it was a system that worked efficiently and served thousands," said 
Douglas Washington, a member for 13 years of the county's Parks and Recreation 
Commission and vice president of the nonprofit People for Parks. "We're very 
concerned with the erosion. County government doesn't seem to have the answer 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county's parks have changed in ways both obvious and subtle as a result of 
declining resources over the last two decades. In the last two years, the 
operating budget for the Parks and Recreation Department has decreased about 
40%, standing today at about $60 million. 
</P>
<P>
 To contend with shrinking budgets, fees gradually have been attached to a 
range of activities that residents once enjoyed for free, and the parks and 
recreation work force, once 2,200 strong, has dwindled to about 800 since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the department's maintenance work has been contracted out to private 
firms. Lawns, gardens and sports fields that once were tended daily now are 
cared for only a few days a week. Maintenance crews are hard-pressed to keep up 
with graffiti that blights park pavements and fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the county was forced to relinquish control of nine community parks 
to cities or other jurisdictions because it could not afford to operate them. 
Two more such deals are in the works this year and the trend is likely to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Less noticeable but perhaps of more importance is the loss of permanent park 
attendants. Part coach, baby-sitter, mentor, counselor and gardening adviser, 
park attendants were -- and in some cases still are -- looked on almost as 
family members by neighborhood youths and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a Los Angeles native and I remember when you used to go to a county park 
and there was always a recreation specialist there to loan toys and games to 
neighborhood kids," said Tony Yakimowich, who heads the budget division of the 
parks department. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Yakimowich said, there are 74 recreation specialists countywide to 
cover about 120 parks and pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, one rec specialist may supervise three to four parks, spending a 
few hours a day here, a few hours there," Yakimowich said. "It doesn't provide 
adequate coverage, but it's the best we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems and the hopes of county parks are reflected at Loma Alta Park, an 
oasis of green nestled in the brown hillsides of Altadena. There, residents can 
enjoy tennis, softball and volleyball, picnicking, hiking, swimming and tending 
community gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation supervisor Penny Daniels has been able to forge a close 
relationship with neighborhood youths. But Daniels is troubled by the changes 
in park services. She had to cancel the popular after-school teen dance 
programs because budget cutbacks have reduced the number of park police 
available to patrol the events. 
</P>
<P>
 She has seen an increase in the numbers of young people who, with fewer youth 
activities to occupy their time, come to the park just to hang out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are no activities or programs at parks, that's the only thing to do 
and the local gangs will welcome them in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Markus Carter is a 68-year-old retired businessman who has coached baseball 
teams at county parks, including Loma Alta, for nearly 30 years. He is proud of 
his efforts, but is frustrated these days because he cannot get the county to 
lay brick dust on the popular T-ball field. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no budget for it," said Carter, surveying the dusty brown lot. "We 
need new bases. There are seven lights that are out now, but we can't get 
anybody out to do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Yakimowich ran down a list of programs that used to be: physical fitness 
programs for senior citizens; a rehabilitation unit that specialized in 
developing activities for disabled residents; music education classes; a sports 
division that organized competitive team activities and the Community and 
Recreation Safety after-school program, which specialized in gang intervention 
with the schools, law enforcement agencies and business community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county does still offer many recreation programs, but at a price. Entrance 
fees at recreation areas and regional parks range from $3 to $6 per vehicle; 
lawn bowling at Arcadia Park costs $10 a month; admission to one of the 
county's four arboretums, $5 for an adult. Golf fees range from as little as $1 
to $21 for weekend or holiday play at an 18-hole course. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, fees were imposed for the first time on visits to county 
nature centers ($3 per vehicle), hiking trails ($6 per person daily, $23 per 
year) and pools ($1 for kids, $2 for adults.) 
</P>
<P>
 An outcry over the pool fees led Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke to 
organize a fund-raising drive to eliminate the fees in her district, which 
includes some of the county's lowest-income communities. Burke said she hopes 
to raise enough money to eliminate the pool fees countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials say they have pushed user fees about as far as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are beginning to disenfranchise people if we go any further," 
Parks and Recreation Director Rod Cooper said. "We were raising golf fees at a 
pretty good rate and experienced a 10% drop in usage. We avoided increasing the 
fees this year to allow play to get back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of last week's budget deliberations, Parks and Recreation will be 
able to maintain current levels of service for now. But following the trend of 
other county departments, park officials are looking for ways to generate 
revenue and become more self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ideas include renting out county facilities for organized bingo, small 
concerts and outdoor theater, and concession and advertising agreements that 
would allow companies to put their logos on basketball backboards and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials are also hoping to gain approval from the Board of Supervisors 
for a new park tax, which would assess a $24 fee on all homeowners who live in 
unincorporated areas of the county. The tax would raise about $9 million 
annually to keep the department afloat. Last year, voters approved Proposition 
A, which created a $540-million countywide assessment aimed at improving parks 
and beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Park advocates say the county will have to depend increasingly on private help 
if it is to keep its parks and recreation heritage intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future we are going to have to have a partnership on a massive scale 
in L.A. County between the public and private sector," said Washington of the 
Parks and Recreation Commission. "This is something people should be concerned 
about. Nobody would argue that food, clothing and shelter are essential to 
life, but recreation is right behind."

MTA STRIKE DELAYED FOR AT LEAST A WEEK; BOARD, UNION TO MEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A threatened strike by bus and train drivers of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority has been put off for at least a week, MTA officials 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA made its announcement after Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and 
other MTA board members agreed to hold an unusual face-to-face meeting with 
union leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldy Norton, a United Transportation Union spokesman, confirmed the 
postponement but would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came less than 36 hours before a walkout that had been 
scheduled for 12:01 a.m. Monday and would have stranded 1.2 million riders. 
</P>
<P>
 After an emergency three-hour, closed-door meeting, MTA board members 
announced that Riordan, county Supervisor Ed Edelman and Glendale Councilman 
Larry Zarian would meet with union leaders representing 6,400 drivers, 
mechanics and clerks. No date has been set for the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, chairman of the MTA board, said the meeting will not be a negotiating 
session but an effort to hear union leaders' concerns about issues on the 
bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result of the board commitment to meet next week, the leadership of the 
unions told the MTA negotiating team that they will not strike Monday at 12:01 
a.m.," Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am optimistic, although I cannot be certain we will get the right results," 
Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA Executive Officer Franklin White said: "The meetings involving our board 
members and the union leaders will not be negotiating sessions. This will, 
however, give the union leaders an opportunity to express their concerns 
directly to our board officers. Then we will seek contract solutions at the 
bargaining table." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA and its unions are said to be close to an agreement on a pay raise. 
But they are still arguing over proposed changes in work rules and 
subcontracting. The MTA has proposed a change in scheduling that would make it 
more difficult for drivers to claim overtime pay. Union officials denounce the 
proposals, which they contend could cost members $1,000 a month in lost wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Union spokesman Norton said last week that the union had made a "bottom line" 
proposal to management "which addressed their budgetary problems, providing 
them with a possibility for saving millions of dollars." He declined to provide 
specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials contend that many full-time bus and train operators earn an 
average of $50,000 annually with overtime, making them among the highest paid 
transit operators in the nation. "The general rule is that 25% of the drivers' 
annual income is overtime, and overtime is done at management's request," 
Norton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers on the job for 42 months earn the top rate of $18.37 an hour, 
according to the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a strike, it would be a double whammy for bus and train riders who 
last week were hit with a fare increase. A strike would be the first shutdown 
of the nation's second-largest transit system since 1982, when drivers walked 
off the job for five days. There was a 68-day walkout in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike transit workers in some East Coast cities, California bus and train 
operators are not prohibited from striking. 
</P>
<P>
 A strike would not include Metrolink or municipal or private operators such as 
the Los Angeles city Commuter Express and DASH shuttle buses, the Long Beach, 
Montebello and Santa Monica municipal lines and Foothill Transit.

KILLER BEES ON BOARD; SHIP DOCKS IN L.A. WITH STOWAWAY SWARM, BUT OFFICIALS SAY 
PESTS WERE SENT PACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Bee calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the first swarm of killer bees ever detected in Los Angeles County landed 
at the harbor last week. Yes, a bee or two could have escaped the 90 minutes of 
spraying by county officials. And yes, the body of the fearsome queen was not 
among those collected by the Department of Food and Agriculture after the 
port-side massacre, so there is an outside chance she survived. 
</P>
<P>
 But bee experts say it is unlikely that there is really a killer queen on the 
loose, or that there is any danger from the bees who hitchhiked into port on a 
Dutch freighter, which has sailed off to the San Francisco Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel at this time there's no threat," said Robert Donley, chief of the 
county Department of Agriculture's environmental protection bureau. "We're sure 
that 99.99% were killed," said Donley, who did some of the spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 A queen on the loose in Southern California could mate with local bees to 
create a new killer bee colony. But even if the queen somehow escaped the ship, 
Donley said, "the chances for her survival would not be very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, eight bee traps were put up around the docks as a precautionary 
measure. Experts have been preparing for a migration of killer bees, also known 
as Africanized honeybees, across the Arizona border, but this swarm came from 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch cargo ship Ned Lloyd Van Dieman left Guatemala on July 7 with the 
swarm stowed away in a latch hole. The captain alerted U.S. agricultural 
officials that he had bees on board as he prepared to dock Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two members of the Department of Food and Agriculture met the ship as it 
docked at Berth 136 -- fittingly, just off B Street in Wilmington. They suited 
up in protective garb, boarded and started spraying.  
</P>
<P>
 Donley said he was surprised at how mellow the bees were. "A few were flying 
around," he said. "We were divebombed by a couple, but normal bees will do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 minutes of spraying, the bees were "drenched" and dead, Donley said. 
He and the county's bee expert bagged several insects for examination. The 
remaining corpses were left in the latch hole on the boat because, Donley said, 
it was impossible to reach into the narrow space. 
</P>
<P>
 Donley said the assumption was that this was a swarm of ordinary European bees 
because of their docility. But the next day a county entomologist identified 
the bees as Africanized honeybees. On Thursday a state entomologist confirmed 
this identification, and the bee traps went up. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen was not among the bees taken, but Donley said he assumes she is 
among the corpses left in the latch hole. Queens usually sit in the middle of a 
swarm, so her body would be buried under those of other bees, Donley said.  
</P>
<P>
 The reason the bees did not get vicious, Donley said, was because they had no 
hive to protect. "They were just huddled down there," Donley said. 
</P>
<P>
 If a few bees did escape, Donley said, they will not be dangerous on their 
own. And if the queen somehow escaped, she would not be able to fly very far, 
or even feed herself. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time killer bees have hitchhiked into the country, 
Donley said. A swarm stowed away on a freighter that landed in San Francisco in 
January, 1992. And several southern states, including Texas and Louisiana, have 
reported stowaway killer bees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles area had not detected this mode of bee immigration 
before last week, experts say it may be happening all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is if one ship came in with a swarm on it, there are probably 
five that go in undetected," said Ron Neese, a member of the Western 
Apicultural Society, a group of beekeepers from western states. 
</P>
<P>
 But Neese said isolated swarms slipping into the country in boats pose little 
threat. It is large migrations, such as the one experts expect to hit the Los 
Angeles area in the fall, that could cause problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Neese said, it is easy to overestimate the dangers posed by killer 
bees. "The threat to us is minimal," Neese said. "But it makes great copy."

COUNTY REPORT / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; BRICK BY BRICK; QUAKE-TORN COMMUNITIES 
CONTINUE BATTLE TO REBUILD SHATTERED HOMES AND LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Today, six months after the violent Northridge earthquake, Ventura County's 
fault-line communities are still struggling to restore broken shops and 
shattered homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage has been counted, catalogued and hammered into pleas for aid. 
Governments, charities and neighborhoods have poured millions of dollars and 
months of labor into the worst-hit communities: Simi Valley, Fillmore and Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 People are working as if to erase the day that shook their very lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while carpenters bang crooked roofs back into shape and therapists coax 
nightmare-stricken children back to sleep, many agree: Ventura County will 
never be exactly the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think that it's a pretty desperate time," said Marty Robinson, the 
county's deputy chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "People's lives were totally turned upside down," she said. "Their houses have 
been messed up, and their children have been frightened, and their businesses 
have been affected. . . . It's amazing the impact on people's lives this kind 
of tragedy has." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake killed no one in Ventura County, but it broke some 
communities almost as severely as it did ground-zero Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley -- where many buildings were built in the past 20 years under 
increasingly tough seismic standards -- suffered damage estimated between $400 
million and $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore lost use of one-third of its business district. 
</P>
<P>
 Piru's tiny downtown of fewer than a dozen shops remains fenced and dark to 
this day. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremor also disrupted public services that took days, weeks, even months 
to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Parts of Simi Valley were without water for 3 1/2 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to Simi Valley High School forced its students to squeeze into Royal 
High School for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Fillmore's sidewalks remain cracked and skewed, and much of Main 
Street is fenced off because of unstable storefronts. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Thousand Oaks Library -- where the entire ceiling plunged to the 
floor and broken sprinklers soaked hundreds of books -- was idled for two 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 And an emergency concrete patch job is the only thing preventing the man-made 
lining of the Arroyo Simi -- Simi Valley's main drainage canal and one of the 
county's largest -- from washing away in the next flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the full $3-million repair job will have to wait for the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency's approval, said county Public Works Director Art 
Goulet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken some emergency action to keep it from washing out," Goulet said 
recently. "That'll work under ordinary circumstances, but if a great flood 
comes, that section of the channel is history." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, signs of the quake are still visible, from plaster cracks in 
some Thousand Oaks tract houses to jagged fissures in Simi Valley's quiet 
east-end neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley schools suffered at least $5 million in damages, officials 
estimated. And Conejo Valley Unified School District officials have upped their 
earthquake repair estimate to $8 million, citing "hundreds of quake-related 
repairs needed at 31 school district sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8-magnitude earthquake's jackhammer thrust knocked several thousand 
homes and businesses askew across eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet while hundreds have been rebuilt, hundreds more still wait for money from 
insurance companies or government agencies. Some owners are grappling with 
repair bills reaching six figures, and weighing whether they should fix the 
cracks or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst damage in Simi Valley hit the city's east end, where the buildings 
are the oldest and nearest to the fault line, said city building official 
Gaddis Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing to us is that no one lost their lives in this 
thing," Farmer said. "The buildings appeared to perform well enough to allow 
people to exit, and to protect them in the wee hours when the earthquake hit." 
</P>
<P>
 The city quickly offered help by waiving permit and plan-check fees that 
could, for example, have cost a homeowner with $50,000 damage more than $700. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has continued to give support, bolstering FEMA grants and Small 
Business Administration loans by splitting a federal aid package into $5,000 
grants to the poor and $20,000 repair loans to low- and moderate-income 
homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also reopened a free debris disposal site recently on Alamo Street 
just west of Tapo Canyon Road so homeowners will not have to pay to dispose of 
quake rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But with damage ranging from simple stucco cracks to collapsed roofs and 
broken structural joints, there is still much work to be done, Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore, with just one-eighth the population of Simi Valley has suffered 
proportionately more damage. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-February, engineers there had red-tagged 329 buildings and trailers, 
compared with 101 in Simi Valley. Yellow tags hung on 350 Fillmore buildings 
compared with 555 in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to Fillmore's public and private property was estimated at $250 
million, and the city's business district suffered losses that could have 
permanently crippled it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Fillmore has bootstrapped itself back toward economic health through an 
extraordinary symbiosis between the city's officials and its merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The city quickly cashed in on an aid offer from former Laker basketball star 
A.C. Green, erecting an 11,000-square-foot tent and trailers as a makeshift 
business district for displaced shops. 
</P>
<P>
 It bought the partly collapsed 1915-era theater for $75,000 and is chasing a 
half-million-dollar state and federal grant to restore and strengthen it 
against future earthquakes, Payne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore also is working with Central Avenue merchants to save many of the 
badly damaged masonry buildings that could help reshape the city into the 
historic tourist attraction that merchants and officials dream of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that the downtown is the heart and soul of Fillmore," City Manager 
Roy Payne said. "It's important not only to the livelihood of these properties 
and businesses, but to the overall viability of this community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is still grappling with a damaged infrastructure, ranging 
from cracked sidewalks to a breached million-gallon water tank. The emptied 
reservoir left the city with an emergency water supply good for only two days 
in the event of another system failure and power outage. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said the city is seeking FEMA money to buy emergency generators for the 
city water pumps, while trying to decide whether to repair the old tank or 
build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said he cannot compare Fillmore to other fault-line cities of different 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you're talking about one-third of your downtown that was hit, on a 
relative scale, one-third is one-third," he said. "I think we got hit pretty 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Piru's tiny downtown was hit even harder. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclone fencing and yellow tags still enclose the bulk of the business 
district, two rows of fractured brick buildings barely 100 yards long in the 
center of the tiny community of about 1,100 just east of Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake yanked out two of the community's cornerstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens State Bank, badly broken when its bricks moved and its massive vault 
did not, probably will stay closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's officers decided to pull out of Piru, stranding hundreds of farm 
workers who used to snake in long lines from the bank door on payday, said Al 
Gaitan, president of the Piru Neighborhood Council. Now, he said, they must 
cash their paychecks elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Also closed is Guevara's Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a popular stop for boaters headed to Lake Piru, the store has been 
shoehorned into a faceless donated trailer one-third the original size. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary and Ignacio (Nacho) Guevara still sell produce, canned goods and the only 
fresh meat in town out of the trailer. But perhaps not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might close the doors," said Mary Guevara, selling food last week to a mere 
trickle of midday customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sales are nothing compared to what they were, and the electric bill's 
$400," she said. "Nobody comes by, nobody knows we're here." 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA denied the couple a loan to repair the brick building because the 
store earns too little, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disgusted, Nacho Guevara said he is arguing over the mortgage with the man who 
sold him the building in October. The former owner, Guevara said, failed to 
show him a year-old letter from the county ordering the building be 
strengthened against earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara said he sank $20,000 in repairs into the building before the quake and 
now faces repair costs estimated at $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I don't want nothing," he added. "I just want the man to pay my money 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 The town needs help, but none seems forthcoming, council President Gaitan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just don't get the attention that all the other big communities get," he 
said. "But look at our buildings. What business do we have? They (merchants) 
can't stay down there in those trailers for the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said most of Piru's businesses either failed to qualify or 
refused to apply for federal earthquake aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal rebuilding loans might be available, said Nancy Bocovich, a program 
assistant to the county chief administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the repairs must wait for an engineering study, which in turn is awaiting 
approval of a $50,000 federal historic preservation grant, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scary proposition for these people that have been in Piru for 
generations," said Bocovich, describing Piruvians as hard-working and 
self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Al Gaitan said they have three jars: one jar for necessities and food, one 
for entertainment and movies and a third jar for a car," she added. "They don't 
have a jar for an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 As hard as the earthquake hit Ventura County's property, it also battered the 
people's psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Children were especially hard-hit, said Sue Zeller, a family therapist working 
with earthquake victims in a federally funded psychotherapy program. 
</P>
<P>
 Therapists fanned out, trying to help parents calm anxious children who were 
losing sleep at home and misbehaving at school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the youngest who understood what happened, those ages 4 or 5, suffered 
nightmares and behavior disorders. Some have slept fitfully for months, while 
others have been unable to bear leaving their parents' sides, Zeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers also suffered anxiety, sleeplessness and behavior problems. Despite 
adults' reassurances, the teen-age quake victims stayed stressed, she said, 
asking: " 'Oh my gosh, is this going to happen again? Is it going to get 
worse?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Children ages 6 to 12 seemed to recover the swiftest, she said, because they 
were old enough to have faith in their parents' advice that the worst was past. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, parents of sleepless kids still call for help, and 
therapists have begun focusing on a different anxiety -- getting used to new 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with people who have to go into new homes because their home 
was destroyed," Zeller said. "Now it's working with kids and getting their 
comfort level up in their new homes and environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Some elderly earthquake victims still need psychological care too, said Kenny 
Aragon, a county mental health worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still seeing quite a few people, and some of them are just starting to 
deal with their feelings," she said. "It takes a long time to get over the 
trauma. Some are very angry, some are still depressed, some are very, very 
sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, FEMA gave the county Department of Mental Health a $4.2-million 
aid grant to hire more counselors to help quell the anxieties of earthquake 
victims. While some argued the money would be better spent on bricks-and-lumber 
repairs, department Director Randall Feltman insisted the program would help 
"normal people get back to their normal lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the tears and debris, for all the homes burst open and knickknacks 
smashed, the earthquake actually did some good. 
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses rebounded quickly and began to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors said that their worries of a housing market paralyzed by damage and 
fear never came true. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear was that we couldn't repair everything, and who'd want to buy houses 
in the rubble?" said Shanon Wolf, president of the Simi Valley-Moorpark Assn. 
of Realtors. 
</P>
<P>
 "About a week and a half after, we started getting calls from buyers in the 
San Fernando Valley," who quickly followed through and closed escrows on 
numerous homes, Wolf said. "Even now, when I move through certain areas of 
Simi, we're repairing and moving on. It just sort of shows how resilient human 
beings are." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies fleeing shattered headquarters in the Valley settled in Thousand 
Oaks, including firms such as Packard Bell, Vivitar and Applied Compression 
Technologies. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also put Fillmore on the map, said Steve McKinnon, owner of Fillmore 
Real Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "People saw it on TV, and they saw how beautiful it was with all the orange 
groves and the mountains," he said. "If there's a house that was listed and 
came through the earthquake and got a green tag, they figure, what better proof 
can you get that it's a good buy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore City Manager Roy Payne said, "For the first time in the five years 
I've been here, we've got developers knocking on our door." 
</P>
<P>
 It also gave the sluggish building trades a much needed push. 
</P>
<P>
 Before, Dave Hall was thinking about chucking it all and going back to school 
to become a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the Simi Valley carpenter is doing earthquake repairs six 10-hour days a 
week and working nights at home to prepare for the new jobs that are piling up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, all I've been able to do is demolish stuff that was dangerous (at 
home) and grab as much work as I can," he said. "When the earthquake happened, 
I didn't even have to look for work. People all around me needed work, and 
(I'd) get done and then their neighbors would need more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the earthquake gave Ventura County -- particularly the governments 
and emergency agencies everyone relies on in case of disaster -- a taste of 
true havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 This was no drill. 
</P>
<P>
 It pushed all systems to the max and spurred better planning for future 
disasters, said Simi Valley City Manager Lin Koester. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will be buying a more earthquake-resistant internal telephone system 
and possibly buying more radios and cellular phones for key emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be considering putting the Emergency Operations Center into a hardened 
structure that will not drop its ceiling all over the command center in an 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 And it will be consolidating telephone lists from the YMCA, fraternal 
organizations and other community groups that helped city officials spread word 
of aid efforts quickly throughout the city, Koester said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we learned by going through an actual incident is things that don't 
occur to you when you're going through an exercise for four hours," Koester 
said. "One of the things we found out in the earthquake is we're going to have 
to be more self-sufficient for a longer time." Earthquake Aid

FLEA FOR ALL; VAN NUYS: STAFFERS AND JUDGES ARE ITCHING FOR A SOLUTION TO THE 
INFESTATION OF COURTHOUSE TRAILERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Koch was minding his own business, doing the chores that fill a 
courtroom clerk's day, when he sensed the swirl about his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 He peeked under his desk. Fleas were sampling his shoes. Fleas were dining on 
his socks. Fleas were nipping at his pants. Incredible numbers of fleas were in 
the air, swarming about like a cyclone, leaping up through a hole in the 
courtroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw fleas everywhere," Koch said. "It was absolutely, positively 
disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was the Van Nuys Superior Court transformed -- into the Court of Common 
Fleas. Why, the courthouse is abuzz with flea bargaining. Anyone want to cop a 
flea? 
</P>
<P>
 The jokes keep coming -- but so do the fleas. In trailers just north of the 
main seven-story courthouse -- structures pressed into service as make-do 
courtrooms because of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake -- there exists what an 
internal memo concedes is a "severe infestation of fleas." 
</P>
<P>
 No cases have been scratched from the dockets, court officials said. But court 
staffers and judges are itching for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch was the first to notice the "pest problem," as the July 8 memo terms it, 
when he became a flea feast earlier this month. "I couldn't believe it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trailers, about the size of mobile homes, are semi-permanent fixtures on 
the court landscape. In a previous incarnation, they did Juvenile Court duty. 
That ended about two years ago and, for many months, they stood empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the earthquake, which put the San Fernando Superior Court out of 
commission until at least next spring. San Fernando judges moved into the Van 
Nuys courthouse; to make room, judges were farmed out to the seven courtrooms 
in the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like mobile homes taken off the road, the trailers do not sit directly on the 
ground. Instead, they are perched a few inches off the soil, fixed on blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement creates a crawl space -- perfect for cats, rats, possums, 
squirrels and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, some of these animals do have a tendency to take refuge under 
a trailer or a house, any structure, because they want to have their own hiding 
places," said Frank Hall, chief of the county Health Department's Vector-Borne 
Disease Program, which oversees the fight against such disease transmitters -- 
or "vectors" -- as fleas, ticks, rats and mites. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, well, these animals do tend to have flea problems, especially in the 
summer, because the reproduction cycle increases as the temperature rises." 
</P>
<P>
 In early July, Koch, a clerk for Superior Court Judge John Farrell, saw the 
swarm beneath his desk, coming up through a hole cut in the floor for an 
electrical cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to assess the damage, Koch said, he took off his shoe and rolled up his 
cuff. He found fleas "all the way across" the top of his sock. 
</P>
<P>
 In another room in the trailers, attorney Mary Sauve also began encountering 
fleas. She suffered 30 bites. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard in the hallway, R.F. James, topped that -- 42 bites.  
</P>
<P>
 Koch, meanwhile, got ticked off. He trapped seven fleas and taped them to a 
sheet of paper from a telephone message pad. He presented the evidence to 
Farrell, who quickly called for help from court administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made the rest of us start scratching, just thinking about it," Bailiff 
Howard Yaras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, according to the July 8 memo written by court administrator Timothy 
Adams, it was believed that stray cats were the source of the fleas. It was 
thought that strays had crawled under the trailers, produced a litter or two, 
and that, in the heat, mothers and kittens had perished, Adams wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 An "unpleasant odor emanating through the trailer space" fueled that concern, 
Adams wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guard James said the crawl space has yielded six dead kittens and two 
dead possums but no mother cats. But, James said, he saw a baby possum Thursday 
night and figures "there have got to be more animals underneath there." 
</P>
<P>
 A first blast of fumigation, last weekend, was apparently not enough to kill 
all the fleas, Adams said. It also left behind a chemical stench so strong that 
most of the trailer courtrooms doors were open throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the doors open, the noise and fumes of buses lurching down the street, 
just a few paces away from the front entrance to the trailers, roared regularly 
into the courtrooms. Occasionally, trucks from the fire station down the block 
contributed more fumes and sirens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very loud. Very hard to hear," said Judge William MacLaughlin. "But it's 
preferable to (the fumigation) odor." Jurors have not registered any 
complaints, at least officially, bailiffs and clerks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams promises that fumigation will continue until "the problem with the fleas 
no longer exists." He also vowed to board up the crawl spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the flea-eradication campaign, Adams said, is still to be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not an earthquake, it's fleas," Koch said in a burst of biting social 
commentary. "It's always something."

STRUGGLE IS STAGED OVER CONTROL OF ARTS PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: COMMUNITY 
ACTIVISTS AND DONORS VIE FOR A VOICE IN GOVERNING THE SOON-TO-OPEN AUDITORIUM 
AND THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks taxpayers bought the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Wealthy donors will fund its operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But who's going to control it? 
</P>
<P>
 That question, increasingly urgent as the building receives its finishing 
flourishes, has touched off an unusual power struggle among Thousand Oaks' 
civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side, skilled fund-raisers and rich donors lobby for a voice in 
governing the 1,800-seat auditorium and 400-seat forum theater. 
</P>
<P>
 They want to vote on policy issues, from serving liquor at intermission to 
presenting Native American dance troupes to spending money on newspaper ads. 
And they want to reel in new contributions by promising potential donors some 
clout. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing them, community activists fight to keep the cultural center in the 
hands of politicians, or at least, political appointees. They want all 
decisions to be made by people accountable to voters. And they want local 
citizens, not out-of-town bigwigs, to set the policies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In short, they want to retain the existing structure of the Civic Theaters 
Commission, with seven members appointed by the City Council for their 
fund-raising, business, or cultural expertise. Three of the current 
commissioners have turned out to be major donors: Larry Janss, whose family 
contributed $250,000; Harry Selvin, who gave $50,000; and Larry Sparrow, a 
regional president of GTE California, which kicked in $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Planning Commissioner Virginia Davis, professional fund-raiser Julian 
Macdonald, retired public relations director Mary Hekhuis, and retired GTE 
executive Gib Poiry also sit on the theater panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Both supporters and opponents of the existing commission structure plan to 
press their case before the Thousand Oaks City Council later this month. And 
both plan to press hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the most interesting and important decisions the council 
has to make," predicted Tom Mitze, executive director of the theaters. "It will 
determine a lot about our future." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal before the council calls for expanding the existing Civic 
Theaters Commission by adding five seats for donors, two for local arts 
organizations, and one for the nonprofit Alliance for the Arts fund-raising 
cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance members would select the five donors to serve on the governing board, 
giving preference to those who have contributed at least $50,000. The arts 
groups and the alliance would designate their own representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, the Civic Theaters Commission has reached unanimous 
decisions on most issues, such as charging patrons for parking and sponsoring 
shows by magician David Copperfield. For such non-controversial items, the 
addition of donor votes would probably make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Civic Arts Plaza gains regional prominence, the governing board 
will increasingly be called upon to make key decisions about programming, 
budgeting and staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 So the issue of control has taken on great weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Those in favor of expanding the Civic Theaters Commission contend that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Donors like to oversee their investments. Several potential contributors 
have been skittish about pouring money into an endowment fund controlled by 
political appointees. They would be more likely to open their wallets if donors 
were well represented on the theater commission. 
</P>
<P>
 * The current system is unstable. Each City Council member makes one 
appointment to the commission, and the entire council selects two at-large 
commissioners. The makeup of the theater commission could change with each 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many theaters around the country operate under private, nonprofit boards 
composed mainly of fund-raisers or donors. These directors keep a sharp eye on 
the bottom line and reassure other contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even with six seats controlled by the Alliance for the Arts, the City 
Council would appoint a majority of commissioners, and thus speak with the 
loudest voice. 
</P>
<P>
 * An expanded theater commission would still have to abide by open-meeting 
laws, posting agendas and inviting public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Summing up these arguments, alliance Chairman Stephen Woodworth said: "The 
private sector is leery of investing dollars into an endowment governed wholly 
by the public, political sector. The only time we do that is when we pay taxes 
-- and then, only with reluctance." 
</P>
<P>
 In rebuttal, opponents offer their own series of reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Taxpayers poured $86 million into buying the land and building the Civic 
Arts Plaza. They deserve to control the cultural center, through their elected 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * The reorganization would grant undue power to the Alliance for the Arts, a 
private nonprofit group that does not have to hold open meetings or test its 
decisions at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
 * The current theater commission, although appointed by a bitterly divided 
council, does not appear to be swayed by city politics. Commissioners have not 
splintered into factions, disregarding the feuding among their political 
sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate donors, if given a chance to steer programming, might be unwilling 
to allow experimental shows into the Civic Arts Plaza, for fear of being linked 
to controversial or poorly received programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The proposal smacks of elitism, of pandering to big money. Donors already 
enjoy perks, including a first crack at tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 As former Mayor Larry Horner explained: "People have seen so much negativism 
about this project that they're suspicious. We don't want to give the public 
the perception that they're shut out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To dramatize their arguments, each faction has conjured up a rallying image. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance members speak longingly of raising enough money to sponsor a full 
schedule of children's programs. They envision a flotilla of yellow school 
buses outside the Civic Arts Plaza, unloading joyful children for a free puppet 
show or interactive theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Their opponents hint darkly at a coterie of ultra-rich moguls stomping into 
town to dictate how the theater should be run. They suggest that such a move 
would alienate many residents and cement the long-running rift between foes and 
fans of the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of these images have sparked angry, emotional rebuttals. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance consultant Esther Wachtell dismisses the view of donors as 
out-of-town elite. Although the city has pushed the Civic Arts Plaza as a 
regional cultural center, the premiere theater between Los Angeles and San 
Francisco, most of the donors have come from the Conejo Valley or the northern 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Wachtell says: "I wouldn't call them corporate-executive types. 
They're just community guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, theater commissioner Macdonald brushes off the alliance 
sound-bites: "They talk of wondrous things, of yellow school buses and all, but 
that's just rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 In fighting the proposal, Macdonald and others have urged the alliance to 
focus on raising funds, rather than winning power. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of work, the alliance has gathered $4.8 million in cash, pledges 
and in-kind contributions. But so far, the group has collected only about $1 
million for deposit in interest-bearing accounts. The rest will trickle in over 
the next five to 10 years, or be paid with in-kind services like free 
advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boosting the endowment is critical, because the fund is supposed to pay for 
the hefty day-to-day costs of running the theater. From the stage hands' 
salaries to the dressing-room toilet paper, every operating expense will come 
from either ticket sales or private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 If the endowment falls short, the cultural center could go broke -- or the 
council could be forced to bail it out with taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwilling to put up city funds, council members have urged the alliance to 
continue aggressively seeking endowment funds. If adding donor seats would 
help, several said they are willing to consider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the council members are equally sensitive to voters. They 
want to be sure the theaters are run by people accountable to the City Council 
and the public at large. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really have mixed emotions," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. "I don't know 
how I'm going to vote." 
</P>
<P>
 As they lobby the undecided politicians, both factions have sought support 
from theater directors in other California cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps one likely place to look is the California Center for the Arts in 
Escondido, which includes a 1,500-seat auditorium and 400-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Thousand Oaks, the city of Escondido built the cultural center with 
taxpayer money. But the City Council will subsidize only part of the operating 
costs, relying on ticket sales and private donations to plug the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 To manage the cultural center, which will open in the fall, politicians and 
fund-raisers have compromised by creating a 40-member nonprofit board. 
Escondido council members can appoint about one-third of the members, and the 
board itself can select another third. The final group will be elected from the 
performing arts center's general membership -- open to anyone who contributes 
$50 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the public-private structure is as yet untested, the Escondido 
center's vice president, Robert Freedman, said he expects political appointees 
and wealthy donors to share a "joint vision" for the theaters. "I think it will 
work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman advised Thousand Oaks council members to follow the same route -- or, 
even better, to cede total control of the theaters to a private, nonprofit 
foundation. If the city doesn't contribute operating money, he said, council 
members don't deserve to manage the cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to govern it, you have to supply the funds," Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further bolstering the alliance proposal, the executive director of the 
McCallum Theater in Palm Desert said she believes that key fund-raisers and 
major donors should be allowed to govern -- if only because they will keep the 
cash flowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money begets money," Nancy Dolensek said. "We need people who travel in the 
right circles (to generate operating funds), and that's generally not 
politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Orange County Center for the Performing Arts, which is funded 
exclusively by private donations, spokesman Greg Patterson disagreed. His 
theater relies entirely on the private sector, but he has seen various 
organizational structures at work. And he's convinced that keeping a theater 
under political control does not hamstring fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not -- that's a complete fallacy," Patterson said. "Most often, 
the reason (donors) give is purely philanthropic or (because) the company gets 
a spin-off benefit from marketing or investing in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even one of the Civic Arts Plaza's biggest donors, GTE California, rejected 
the notion that contributors should take a major role in running the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GTE California gave $150,000, company executives did not expect to 
steer policy-making at the Civic Arts Plaza, according to Anthony Hurtado, the 
local director for external programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of GTE West won a political appointment to the Civic Theaters 
Commission, but he is being transferred to Texas this summer and will soon 
resign. Even without representation, company officials trust the commission, 
Hurtado said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rely on and respect the judgment of the council," Hurtado said, "to 
appoint responsible people to control the endowment."

SIMI VALLEY; RESIDENTS SEE THINGS GETTING BETTER, SLOWLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A red tag still flaps on the blond wood door of Mike Hernandez's broken Simi 
Valley house. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months of sun have faded the red dye to tan, but the bad news remains the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to knock it down and rebuild it, that's already been told to me," 
said Hernandez, straddling a 2-inch crack in the concrete floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Overhead, the kitchen ceiling splits jaggedly from the walls, and a hole in 
the living room ceiling yawns 3 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez is like so many other Simi Valley residents -- still recovering from 
the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the Simi Country Mobile Home Park, Victory Stewart worries that her 
insurance company will never pay back the cost of righting her toppled trailer 
and repairing its broken pipes. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Golf Meadows Court, Mickey Norihiro looked at his parents' gutted living 
room, where half-finished windows gape and stacks of wallboard wait, and 
sighed: "It's mind-boggling. Of the 13 homes on this cul-de-sac, 13 had 
damage."  
</P>
<P>
 * Carpenter Dave Hall -- when he gets a minute free from the repair jobs that 
land in his lap almost faster than he can handle them -- would really like to 
repair the 250-foot gas line to his Cochran Street house. The cold showers, he 
said, are getting old. Yet many businesses and homes in Simi Valley are well on 
the way to recovery or are fully rebuilt, thanks to strong infusions of cash 
and sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 The three huge Whittaker Electronics buildings on Voyager Avenue -- one of the 
county's largest defense contractors -- got shaken hard. 
</P>
<P>
 The tremor knocked thick concrete pillars loose. It toppled heavy machines. 
And it dropped the ceiling in chunks to the floor, where water from a broken 
underground main dissolved it to mush and damaged underground wiring, said 
Joseph R. Botta , vice president of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing hard deadlines from buyers who wanted battleship electronics and 
high-temperature cables delivered on time, he said, the company set to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really had a lot of work to do inside," Botta said. "We almost had to gut 
the entire building." 
</P>
<P>
 With up to 60 workers at a time pulling double shifts, Whittaker shoveled out 
the debris, bolted in reinforcement beams and restarted its assembly 
operations, Botta said. It took just two months and $12 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Without help from the city -- such as inspectors who were willing to check 
plans and work on their time off -- it would never have come off in time, Botta 
said. "It seemed like it was taking forever when we were doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Whittaker had insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Many others did not, and some are still waiting to repair their homes until 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Small Business Administration 
process their federal aid checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Simi Valley finally announced Friday that people can take down the 
faded green tags from buildings that passed initial inspection. But those with 
yellow or red tags must wait for visits by city building inspectors, who will 
remove the tags as repairs are made and inspections conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For every swift recovery in Simi Valley, another creeps along, hindered by 
shriveled bank accounts, crooked builders or broken spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-hit east end, many residents also are awaiting soil tests that the 
city requires before it will issue rebuilding permits. 
</P>
<P>
 Some homeowners complained after a state geologist said the earth had stopped 
moving. The soil beneath their homes was still settling, they insisted, and 
cracks in their floors and walls were widening by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to do a more focused soil stability study within about two 
months, but homeowners still must provide test results on their individual lots 
to win approval to rebuild, said Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Stevens owns two houses on Sabine Circle in the hard-hit east end. 
Together, they need $165,000 in repairs, Stevens said, and she may just start 
work without waiting for the city study. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of homeowners have left, others who own red-tagged homes are awaiting 
word on the soil, she said, and "most of us here in the neighborhood want to 
get on with our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Hernandez, the man with a red-tagged home, is sanguine. "To be honest 
with you, nobody lost their lives here," he said. "Everybody got out safe. This 
is a house, it can be rebuilt." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, daughter, sister and her two children have finally moved out of 
their parents' house in western Simi Valley to a rental home, and they are 
awaiting a city-funded soil study before planning to rebuild.  
</P>
<P>
 "It sucks," Hernandez said. "But like I said, we're healthy."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Golf Meadows Court, where all 13 homes sustained earthquake damage, repairs 
are moving slowly but steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norihiro family shares a builder with six other damaged homes around Simi 
Valley, including the one owned by cul-de-sac neighbor Mithilesh Amin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (original) construction was lousy," said Amin, standing on a layer of 
plastic film shielding his carpets from three months worth of wallboard dust. 
"I went to the city to get a copy of the plans for the house, and they were 
completely different." 
</P>
<P>
 The carpenters had nailed horizontal braces between the studs 8 feet apart 
instead of the required 4 feet in 1988, and they did not even attach the frame 
to the foundation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without anchoring, the house danced and twisted in the earthquake, splitting 
the joints in its living room walls from floor to cathedral ceiling, Amin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another month of work lies ahead before he can move his wife and two children 
back home from the cramped three-bedroom house they have been sharing with four 
relatives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unpleasant, but we can manage," Amin said. "I've never had this kind of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's trailer parks proved to be even more unstable. The quake knocked 
hundreds of light mobile homes off their metal jacks -- even destroying some. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen and Josephine Smith had to buy a new mobile home and scrap their old 
home of 25 years at the Crest Mobile Home Park. In the quake, said Josephine, 
76, "it went 4 feet in the air and then came down and shook to pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny black earthquake braces provided by FEMA shore up the mobile home of the 
Smiths' neighbor, Kay Larson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how I happened to be such a cool cat getting out of here, but it 
hit me later," said Larson, who remembers she hurriedly grabbed a coat and 
blanket and then spent nearly four months living with her daughter while 
waiting for the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her contractors treated her well, she said, but other mobile home owners have 
been beset by dishonest workers, whom she called "scum" and "vultures." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory (Vickie) Stewart said that one such crook visited her double-wide 
trailer at the Simi Country Mobile Home Park during repairs that lasted until 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 He barged into the trailer, announcing he wanted to fix her home. Then he 
began pulling family pictures down off the wall and smashing them with his 
bootheel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What are you doing?' and he says, 'Trying to get you a new carpet,' 
" recalled Stewart, 75, pointing to a still-broken family portrait. "I said, 
'Get out of my house!' " 
</P>
<P>
 He finally left when she threatened to call her son, she said. "I have cut 
myself two times on glass where he broke it." 
</P>
<P>
 Remembering how she slept for 2 1/2 months on her daughter's floor awaiting 
repairs, she cried a little. Then she said, "Everybody has their own problems."

FILLMORE; ROOTED IN PAST, TOWN REACHES FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chain-link still guards a stretch of downtown Fillmore, preserving the precise 
moment six months ago when the earth shook and crippled the city's commercial 
core. 
</P>
<P>
 Heaps of red brick and mortar are piled high on the sidewalk that lines this 
slice of the historic business district. Canopies dangle from the row of 
turn-of-the-century buildings, most so badly fractured that they can't be 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a part of Fillmore frozen in time, a crumbling testament to the 
savagery of nature and to the vulnerability of buildings put up a long time 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this oil-and-farm town of 13,000, it is one of the few places where 
time stands still. Across the street, Central Market is rising from the ground, 
the first business resurrected since the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen shops have reopened along Central Avenue, the 
still-beating heart of Fillmore's showcase shopping strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Work crews have been busy demolishing the old to make way for the new, leaving 
a checkerboard of empty lots citywide while preparing the land for buildings 
stronger and more earthquake-safe than before the Jan. 17 shaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the theater marquee -- which for weeks after the quake continued to 
promote a film about a mischievous St. Bernard -- has finally been changed. It 
now reads: "The Best Town Ever." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty tight community," said hardware store owner Harvey Patterson, 
marveling at a recovery unmatched by any other earthquake-ravaged city. 
"There's a whole lot of people left who say, 'This is our town!' They are 
making sure that it comes back to life." 
</P>
<P>
 No Ventura County city was shaken more violently than Fillmore six months ago 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 About one-third of the merchants in the city's downtown business district were 
displaced. Nearly 700 structures, more than in any other city in the county, 
were declared off limits or unsafe to enter right after the quake. About 50 of 
those were jolted so badly that they have had to be demolished.  
</P>
<P>
 The quake tested Fillmore's small-town grit, causing an estimated $250 million 
in damage and prompting many here to wonder how the city would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has survived. And it's moving forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Working together like never before, the city government and the business 
community wasted little time fashioning a plan to revive the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after the quake, 18 displaced merchants set up shop in a billowy 
metal tent and a row of trailers just south of the downtown district. The city 
poured about $135,000 into the relocation effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The city bought the 77-year-old Fillmore Theater in April, sparing the 
facility from the wrecking ball. Renovation of the movie house is key because 
it shares common walls with several neighboring businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city has waived about $30,000 in fees for property owners 
repairing or rebuilding earthquake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has even realized some opportunities nonexistent before the quake. 
Officials plan to use a disaster assistance grant of more than $1 million to 
build a new City Hall, which will house displaced merchants for a year before 
city staff members move in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore's rapid recovery has been hailed by dignitaries brought in to survey 
the damage, including California first lady Gayle Wilson. And it has helped 
ease concerns that folks would abandon the city, leaving it to dry up and 
wither away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to work more on a one-to-one basis with individual property 
owners and provide them with a level of service you can't get anyplace else," 
said Jack DeJong, the city building official. "I would hate to be in L. A. and 
have to sit there for six months before anyone would even talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say, however, that Fillmore will be the same as before the quake 
or that concern about the city's future has vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it is a town deeply rooted in its past. It is a pocket of 
small-town America in an era of shopping malls and housing tracts. It is a 
place where family roots grow deep, and where downtown shops have been handed 
down from one generation to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 So for many longtime residents, troubling questions remain about starting from 
scratch with reconstruction projects that just don't pencil out financially. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Chapman (Chappy) Morris is wondering what to do about the automobile 
dealership his father founded in 1929. The earthquake caused more than $2 
million in damage to the business, forcing Morris to demolish significant 
chunks of his downtown building. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris said he is deciding whether to rebuild at the current location, rebuild 
on property the family owns off California 126 or leave Fillmore altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's paralysis by analysis, really," said the 64-year-old Fillmore native. 
"In some ways, I feel that after six months, I'm not really much further ahead 
than I was on Jan. 18." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Balden's old brick buildings on Central Avenue housed a shoe store, a 
hair salon and a variety of boutiques. The top floor of one building was host 
to the all-male Fillmore Club, which is reputed to have met for cards every 
second Monday of every month since World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake hit, Balden lost everything. So much, in fact, that the 
91-year-old never bothered to tally his losses. Balden's buildings have been 
torn down and he doesn't plan to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the people think we should rebuild," he said, noting that it doesn't 
make economic sense for him to borrow the $500,000 to $1 million it would take 
to start over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to lease it. They can build what they want to build." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, Ron Stewart has chosen to rebuild the furniture store 
started by his grandfather 58 years ago. He is pondering a $400,000 loan from 
the U. S. Small Business Administration, even though he is certain that the 
reconstruction will last only until the next earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially, I would probably be better off just dumping the building, 
leveling it and moving out of town," he said. "But I've lived here all of my 
life, and I want to continue living here. This is my home." 
</P>
<P>
 In large part, it is that small-town spirit that keeps Fillmore going. 
</P>
<P>
 The city -- destroyed by fire in 1903, swamped by a flood in 1928 and rocked 
by at least three strong earthquakes this century -- is being pushed into the 
future by the same folks who have worked so hard to preserve its past. 
</P>
<P>
 While residents fled other cities hit hard by the quake, there was no such 
exodus in Fillmore. Only three businesses have relocated outside of the city, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Foy, who runs the local U-Haul rental, said few residents have packed 
up and moved out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here have survived floods, they've survived fires, and they've 
survived other earthquakes," he said. "They're not going to move out of here 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even while waiting for the sun to come up six months ago inside her broken 
central Fillmore home, Henrietta Zamaripa said she never thought of leaving the 
city in which she was born and reared. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake snapped her home in two, trapping Zamaripa and her husband, 
Andrew, inside. They were so flustered that they didn't even think of opening a 
window and slipping out. They stayed in the house until daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Rebuild: Hand to Hand, a nonprofit group dedicated to 
repairing or rebuilding earthquake-damaged homes in Fillmore and Piru, the 
Zamaripas are getting their place repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the direction of the housing group, the Mennonite Disaster Service is 
rebuilding the couple's bedroom and doing other work to make the home livable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They fixed it so even a hurricane won't take it," Henrietta Zamaripa said. "I 
try not to get too excited, but I'm already looking for carpeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The city has earmarked $525,000 in federal block grant money toward the 
reconstruction effort, which relies on volunteers such as the Mennonites to 
whip broken homes back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are Christian folk, and it's kind of our duty to do it," said Wes 
Heinrichs, chairman of the California unit of the Mennonite Disaster Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In much the same way, the folks in downtown Fillmore have helped one another 
out. They have lifted each other up, united in a struggle to bring the 
commercial area back to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with other family members, grocer Jesse Segovia has reopened a pool 
hall on Central Avenue closed just after the quake. Segovia, whose 1911 corner 
market greets visitors as they enter the one-block downtown core, said he could 
not stand to see another empty storefront on the main drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought another empty building is not going to help us or anyone else," 
Segovia said. "I see the downtown coming back, but like anything else it will 
be kind of a long process." 
</P>
<P>
 For the same reason, Janet Foy last month became the first since the quake to 
open a new business in the downtown district. Foy, longtime owner of the 
Fillmore Flower Shop on Central Avenue, opened a clothing store down the 
street. 
</P>
<P>
 Her goal was to spur others to invest in downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have a shaking up once in a while," she said. "It makes you 
realize what you've got."

QUAKE AFTERSHOCKS ON THE HOME FRONT; INSURANCE: WITH FEWER COMPANIES OFFERING 
NEW POLICIES ON HOUSES IN WAKE OF STATE LAW, MANY SALES HAVE BEEN STALLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home buyers and sellers are beginning to feel the pinch of California's 
shrinking homeowners insurance market. 
</P>
<P>
 Realtors in the San Fernando Valley, where the problem is especially acute, 
say the crisis that was widely predicted after January's devastating earthquake 
is now in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 With many insurance companies no longer issuing new homeowners policies 
because under state law they would also have to offer earthquake coverage, it 
is often taking home buyers several weeks to line up insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The catch is, without insurance, they can't get a mortgage, and without a 
mortgage, they can't buy the house. 
</P>
<P>
 People trying to buy or sell houses damaged in last January's earthquake are 
even more frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Even insurance companies that are accepting new customers won't insure those 
homes until the present owners settle any open claims with their former 
insurers. After that, the owners must have their damage repaired and, then, 
wait another two weeks or more for an insurance company inspector to come out 
and verify that the repairs were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Some real estate industry leaders, fearing the insurance problem will slow 
down or reverse the long-awaited recovery in the sluggish home sales market, 
are minimizing the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say their business is definitely more difficult because of the 
shortage of insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 These brokers accuse insurance carriers of using strong-arm tactics on 
homeowners, buyers and realtors. The companies are hoping that those people, in 
turn, will pressure state insurance officials to abandon the state regulation 
that requires companies that sell homeowners policies to also offer earthquake 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the insurance companies have a political argument they want 
addressed," said Pat Neal, president of the 104,000-member California Assn. of 
Realtors. "We empathize with their problem, but this isn't the way to handle 
it. They're trying to panic the real estate market." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many insurance companies, fearing they will be wiped out by claims in the next 
major earthquake, want to get out of the quake insurance business altogether, 
but are hindered by the state law tying quake policies to overall homeowner 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies are refusing to take on new customers to avoid that 
requirement, continuing coverage only for their present customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are phasing out of the homeowners business entirely, notably 20th 
Century Insurance Co. of Woodland Hills, which was especially hard hit by 
claims from the Northridge quake. Under a special exemption from state 
insurance authorities, 20th Century will issue no new quake coverage, even to 
its present customers, and withdraw from the homeowners insurance market as 
policies expire over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, real estate brokers in the Valley say the crunch hasn't prevented any 
home sales from eventually going through. But the difficulties many people are 
having are starting to hold up escrow closings, causing headaches for everyone 
concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say it's created a problem with at least a third of our transactions 
in the past two weeks," said Donna Beebe, regional sales manager in the 
Northridge office of Brentwood-based Fred Sands Realtors. The office averages 
about 100 sales a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're scheduled to close escrow on a certain date, and suddenly you learn 
it's going to be three or four weeks before the buyer can obtain another 
policy, you can imagine the hardship," Beebe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It causes a chain reaction. You have a buyer poised to move into the seller's 
home, the seller poised to move somewhere else, people ordering moving vans and 
all the rest of it. Their lives are really very disrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, "there's a concern that the few companies that are still writing 
homeowners insurance will become saturated," increasing their risks and driving 
them out of the business as well, Beebe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Her fears are shared by Alice McCain, president of the San Fernando Valley 
Assn. of Realtors. "It's a serious problem. I just hope it doesn't get to be 
monumental." 
</P>
<P>
 Reeling from $6 billion in claims from January's temblor, home insurers have 
been fleeing California since the shaking stopped. Lately, the pace appears to 
have accelerated. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the state Insurance Department can't say how many companies are 
either limiting the number of new policies they will write or not writing them 
at all. "We're having trouble pinning it down," said Bill Schultz, a department 
spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The department's best guess is that more than half the carriers that were 
doing business in California before the Northridge quake have backed off at 
least somewhat, and the figure may well be higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, executive director of the Proposition 103 Enforcement 
Project, a nonprofit Los Angeles consumer group, said that Farmers, Allstate 
and State Farm insurance companies are seeking safer ground by limiting their 
exposure to California quake claims. Those three companies are responsible for 
61% of California homeowner policies, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance executives say they won't go back to doing business as usual in 
California until Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi drops the regulation 
obliging them to offer earthquake insurance if they sell homeowner policies. 
</P>
<P>
 After witnessing the destruction wrought by the Northridge quake, "insurance 
companies now believe they have a much greater exposure to the Big One," 
Schultz said, referring to the even-stronger quake that many seismologists are 
convinced will shake Southern California at some undeterminable time in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very serious situation and it is the commissioners' top priority," 
Schultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "Garamendi is fundamentally opposed to any action that would 
de-link homeowners and earthquake insurance or otherwise make earthquake 
insurance unavailable. Homeowners ought to be able to protect themselves in the 
event of an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz added that, as a long-range solution, Garamendi supports a federal 
disaster insurance system that would cover earthquakes and other major natural 
disasters, spreading the risk among insurance companies across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Garamendi recently ordered the state's insurer of last resort, 
known as the California Fair Plan, to begin providing fire and earthquake 
insurance for homeowners statewide through an industry-financed pool. Real 
estate agents say that is cold comfort, because Fair Plan policies generally 
cost more for less coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're stressing to everybody: When you buy a house, start shopping for home 
insurance that day because you can't get it in the last hour when escrow is 
closing," said Michael Glanfield, assistant manager of the Sherman Oaks realty 
office of Jon Douglas Co.  
</P>
<P>
 "The main problem is that insurance companies want to know if there's quake 
damage," Glanfield said. "They'll insure the house if it is fixed, and it's 
mostly little things. A wall finished, a gate fixed, maybe $300 or $400 of 
work, but they want it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Neal, president of the California Realtors Assn., admitted that the insurance 
issue was a hot topic at a meeting of 1,000 of the group's brokers in Monterey 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been lots of talk, lots of rumors and people saying there are 
problems," said Neal, whose office is in Garden Grove. "But so far, I have seen 
no transactions falling out or canceling because of problems getting homeowners 
insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 "The big delays are only because buyers didn't start looking in time," Neal 
said. "We have been cautioning brokers to tell their people they might have to 
look to a number of carriers and might have to dig deeper to find the policy 
they want." 
</P>
<P>
 But a lengthy search can be expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortgage maker's commitment to lend a home buyer money at a specified 
interest rate is "only good for so long, 10 days usually," said Glanfield. 
"Then they want to review the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, "if interest rates go up, it could end up costing you a lot of 
money."

QUAKE AFTERSHOCKS ON THE HOME FRONT; MOBILE HOMES: GOV. WILSON IS CONSIDERING 
LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE STRUCTURES TO BE BOLTED TO THE GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after the Northridge earthquake bounced thousands of mobile homes 
from their foundations, Gov. Pete Wilson is considering a bill passed by the 
Legislature which would require the structures to be bolted to the ground for 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Long opposed by owners, the measure reflects a broad new consensus inspired by 
the extraordinary toll the quake inflicted on mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was shaken out of their traditional positions," said Assemblyman 
Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who co-authored the bill. "So many mobile homes fell, 
everyone recognized the problem. All it took was a 6.8-magnitude earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Within seconds on the morning of Jan. 17, more than 10% of the 51,062 mobile 
homes in Los Angeles County parks were rendered uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those were shifted or flung completely from their supports. Another 
184 burned to the ground in fires fueled by ruptured gas lines, one of which 
killed a 92-year-old Chatsworth woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, more than 1,700 of the severely damaged mobile homes are 
still considered uninhabitable, said John Frith, spokesman for the California 
Department of Housing and Community Development, the agency responsible for 
safety inspections of mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mobile home owners and tenants who were either uninsured or too 
frightened to return have abandoned their dwellings for other types of housing, 
Frith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Top O' Topanga Mobile Home Park resident James Britton was one of the lucky 
ones. His insurance paid for about $30,000 worth of repairs to the home where 
he lives with his wife and three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the Britton family lived part time with friends in Culver City until 
late May, when most of the major work was complete. Many smaller repair jobs 
remain unfinished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is changed up here," Britton said. "It's been complete turmoil. 
And there are a lot of empty spaces where neighbors once lived." 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, manufacturers and mobile home owners hope required anchoring 
of mobile homes to cement moorings will help prevent such widespread damage in 
case of another quake of such force. 
</P>
<P>
 Tie-downs are required on mobile homes in more than half the states 
nationwide, including wide regions in the windy Midwest and South. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the opinion of most engineers, tie-downs help keep houses from going 
sideways," said Jess Maxcy, president of the California Manufactured Housing 
Institute, an industry group. "We didn't realize we needed that. We've been 
through many earthquakes, but never like the one in Northridge, where 
everything went up and down and sideways all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 If Wilson signs the legislation, anchoring devices will be required within 60 
days on all manufactured homes. There are many varieties, some costing as 
little as $600, Maxcy said. 
</P>
<P>
 As approved by the state Assembly on July 9, the measure -- part of a stampede 
of safety-related legislation proposed after the Jan. 17 earthquake -- would 
require tie-downs for both new and retrofitted mobile homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was studying the bill over the weekend, an aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mobile home owners had opposed mandatory bracing or tie-downs proposed by 
Frith's agency for years because of the costs involved. Manufacturers also had 
been cool to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Office of 
Emergency Services have begun installing steel, sawhorse-style seismic bracing, 
which costs between $2,500 and $3,000 per home, on earthquake-damaged mobile 
homes, free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 OES technical adviser Rick Ranous said the more expensive type of restraint 
was chosen because FEMA and OES officials believed they work better during an 
earthquake. No comprehensive comparison between the tie-down and seismic 
bracing systems has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 The profusion of more than a dozen types of anchoring systems on the market 
might also be confusing to mobile home residents if the pending bill is signed, 
said Dave Hennessy, president of the Golden State Mobilehome Owners League. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Community Development would issue guidelines for 
tie-down devices, Frith said. Hennessy, however, said he would continue to ask 
the department to recommend specific models to consumers, to help avoid 
confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're going to require us to install these systems, they should give us 
something to go by," Hennessy said. "The bill was a rush job. But I think 
everyone felt the same way: We had to do something."

VALLEY BRIEFING: RISING FROM THE ASHES; BALBOA BOULEVARD RECOVERING FROM QUAKE 
AND FIRE DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One of the most horrific images of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake was the 
double-whammy that hit a stretch of Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills. The 
moment the earth violently shook, two water mains broke, causing an explosion 
that propelled a 300-pound chunk of asphalt through the roof of the home of 
Joseph and Zetella Partlow and creating a river that ran south to Rinaldi 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the turn of the ignition key of a stalled pickup truck at 
Balboa and Rinaldi ignited a broken gas line that exploded, creating a 
10-foot-deep crater and spewing flames 100 feet high. Five homes in the 11600 
block of Balboa Boulevard burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, President Clinton paid a brief visit to the site, listening to 
stories of homes destroyed, lives rescued and families disrupted. In a speech 
he gave later about providing aid, he said, "We have a national responsibility. 
This is something we intend to stay with until the job is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, the rebuilding continues. The water and gas lines have been 
repaired and a patch of new asphalt on the street marks the spot where the 
craters once were. 
</P>
<P>
 The five lots remain empty, with at least two for sale. The owners of a third 
lot plan to rebuild starting next month.

 A Survivor's Tale 
</P>
<P>
 An hour after the quake, Jimmy Menzi, a Simi Valley mechanic, was headed to 
check on his mother in Santa Clarita. His pickup truck stalled in the flooded 
intersection of Balboa and Rinaldi and with a turn of the key, the broken gas 
line exploded in flames. Menzi's pickup truck was immediately engulfed in 
flames. Though Menzi survived, his truck and his tools were lost to the fire. 
He was hospitalized for two weeks with burns to 30% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, his burns are still healing. A friend loaned him a truck 
until he was able to buy a new one in March. Some tools were replaced through 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi had his two dogs with him when his truck was caught in the flames. One 
dog died in the fire, but Bimbo, the other dog, escaped and was eventually 
found by passersby who took the dog to a pet hospital. Bimbo's $50,000 surgery 
made her a minor celebrity before she succumbed to her injuries. Menzi has 
since adopted a new dog from the animal shelter and appropriately named it 
Quake.

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
DORNAN DENIES FARBER'S CHARGE OF ERRATIC RECORD ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by Times political writer Gebe Martinez. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tough talk: Joining the chorus of politicians who are focusing on the issue of 
domestic violence in light of the O.J. Simpson case, Mike Farber, the 
Democratic candidate in the 46th Congressional District, claims his opponent, 
Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove, has an "erratic voting record" on 
legislation dealing with violence against women. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan says Farber does not know what he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber offers as proof Dornan's recent vote against the anti-crime bill, which 
included the Violence Against Women Act, designed to improve law enforcement 
and prosecution of domestic violence crimes, training of police and judges on 
the issue, establishment of a national domestic violence hot line and making 
"gender-motivated" crime a civil rights violation. The anti-crime package is 
currently pending in House-Senate conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Dornan claims to be tough on crime, but his aggressive public statements 
contradict his erratic voting record," Farber charges in a statement. A 
campaign spokesman says some of the Republican sponsors of a similar bill 
Dornan supported in 1993 have signed off on the latest crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan responds that "all the best anti-crime fighters in the House didn't 
vote for the crime bill," that he registered a protest vote because the bill is 
"milquetoast and phony," that it "bogs down some tough anti-crime approaches 
with civil rights approaches" and that it is "weak and counterproductive." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Sexual Assault Prevention Act, which Dornan supported, is more 
comprehensive on the issue of violence against women, Dornan adds. "When 
someone batters his wife, he should be treated worse than if he battered a 
stranger on the street or someone who came out of a bar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bedeebadeebadee, that's all folks: Dornan says the only reason he is 
responding to Farber's allegation is because of the O.J. Simpson case and the 
sensitivity of the domestic violence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But the debate you have just read will be the last one Dornan engages in with 
Farber before the Nov. 8 election. The incumbent says that from this point on, 
he is disregarding Farber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no respect for an opponent who takes money from a pornographer," 
Dornan says, referring to a $1,000 campaign contribution that the Farber 
campaign acknowledges it received but returned to the donor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never met Farber, I hope I never do," Dornan says. He adds that 
pornography is a major cause of violence against women, so "what the hell kind 
of a hypocrite is Farber . . . a Catholic, to take money from a pornographer?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Farber campaign says it received a contribution in February from a Santa 
Ana computer businessman who had a contract to produce an interactive video 
that contained sexually explicit material. Even though the businessman had no 
control over the content, the Farber campaign says it immediately returned the 
donation to avoid controversy. Not until Dornan raised the issue did the Farber 
camp realize that the businessman's wife also contributed $1,000, and that 
money was returned on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber also responds that Dornan's challenge of his faith is "not only 
preposterous but typical of Dornan's past issue-dodging." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two house cleanings: State political pundits, meanwhile, aren't giving Farber 
much of a chance of defeating Dornan. But, hoping for a fresh start, Farber has 
installed a new campaign organization, including campaign director Diane Gould, 
a fund-raiser based in Washington, whose past clients include U.S. Sen. Ben 
Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.) and Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va.). 
</P>
<P>
 In another key race, supervisorial candidate Linda Moulton Patterson has 
replaced political consultant Jeff Adler with Harvey Englander, whose former 
firm represented Moulton Patterson's June primary opponent, Haydee V. 
Tillotson. Englander also led the successful campaign of Marilyn C. Brewer, the 
70th Assembly District Republican nominee. Moulton Patterson, a Democrat who is 
facing a tough fight against Republican Jim Silva in a Nov. 8 runoff election, 
says Englander's involvement underscores the "nonpartisan nature" of her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>

 School tests: County school board members who are up for reelection in 
November recently received questionnaires from the Orange County Pro-Family 
Candidate Campaign asking for their positions on abortion rights, sex education 
and other issues traditionally watch-dogged by conservatives. The questionnaire 
raised some eyebrows because it asked about issues that school board members 
don't vote on, such as abortion and laws banning euthanasia. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike two years ago, when similar groups surveyed the candidates closer 
to Election Day, the incumbent school board members were asked to respond by 
July 6, a dozen days before the start of the candidate filing period. Some 
school officials see the move as an effort by the conservative group to target 
incumbents who disagree with its positions so that more conservative candidates 
can be recruited. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul E. Black Jr., a member of the group, says there is no concerted effort to 
find opponents for the school board members, only an attempt to know the views 
of the incumbents in case they pick up opponents. The questions about 
non-school-related issues are "part of the world we live in," Black says. "The 
school board member now may become a city council person, and somewhere down 
the line may be an Assembly person. You give them an opportunity to get 
educated early in their career." UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: This is the first day for candidates to file nomination papers for 
election to city offices, some school districts and special districts. The 
filing period runs through Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday. U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) will be the special guest at a 
reception sponsored by the Orange County chapter of the California Republican 
League, at the Yorba Linda home of Judith Ryan, from 4 to 6 p.m.

BANK HELPS RAISE FUNDS FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS PATIENT; MEDICINE: PARENTS ARE 
PREPARED TO DONATE LOBES OF THEIR LUNGS TO DAUGHTER, BUT FAMILY NEEDS TO DEFRAY 
COSTS OF $250,000 SURGERY. 
</P>

 Saturday was another day in the hospital for 21-year-old Renee Lee, a day like 
many of the 247 others she has spent in medical facilities over the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who is fighting the rapidly worsening effects of cystic fibrosis, has 
seen her weight drop, her lung capacity decline dramatically and her 
once-active lifestyle destroyed. In the past two weeks she has developed 
pancreatitis, a painful side effect of her disease that makes it impossible to 
eat solid foods. Four different intravenous tubes drip liquid food and 
painkillers into her body. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, doctors say, hope for the former high school cheerleader's recovery 
depend on a costly lung transplant operation that will require her receiving 
lobes of her mother's and father's lungs. The expensive surgery will cost the 
family about $250,000, and the family does not know how much its insurance will 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by the San Juan Capistrano branch of Farmers & Merchants Bank, Lee's 
parents, Jenny and Mike Lee, have launched a fund-raiser to provide the 
operation Renee requires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have insurance, but we don't know how much the insurance will pay, if 
anything," said Jenny Lee, 44. "We decided we should get on the stick and start 
raising money. We believe we need a minimum of $50,000 and a maximum of 
$250,000, depending on how much the insurance will cover." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees are longtime customers of the bank and Renee Lee has her own personal 
account there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been incredibly nice," Jenny Lee said Sunday from her daughter's 
bedside at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. "A couple of Renee's classmates work 
there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanee Knisely, a bank spokeswoman, said Farmers & Merchants Bank has taken 
on the Lees' cause as a community project. Payments can be mailed directly to 
the bank and employees will help Jenny Lee with thank-you cards, Knisely said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will also be passing around a donation envelope to our employees and will 
probably send a flyer to the other 16 branches," Knisely said. 
</P>
<P>
 Life for Renee and Jenny Lee has lately been relegated to trips back and forth 
from her San Juan Capistrano home to the hospital. She last returned home July 
6, only to develop the pancreatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to say I was a housewife. Now I call myself a hospital wife," Jenny 
Lee said. "I tried working for about a year, but I just can't do it under these 
circumstances." Mike Lee is a captain in the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cystic fibrosis is an incurable, degenerative disease in which the cells of 
certain glands of the body secrete large amounts of abnormally thick mucus. 
Damage most often occurs to the lungs, pancreas and liver. It has been part of 
Renee Lee's life since birth, but it has gotten worse since she graduated from 
Capistrano Valley Christian School in San Juan Capistrano in 1991, her mother 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Lee managed to take two classes at Saddleback College, but 
had to drop out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her doctors told us in February that she has less than 20% lung capacity and 
probably had two years or less to live without the transplant," Jenny Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The operation will require doctors to remove both of Renee Lee's diseased 
lungs and replace them with one part of Mike Lee's lung and another part of 
Jenny Lee's lung. If all goes as planned, Renee's lungs and her parents' lungs 
will heal and regenerate to full size within six months, Jenny Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lees have another daughter, 18-year-old Rebecca, who also suffers from 
cystic fibrosis, an inherited disease that is passed on by parents who do not 
know they are carriers, Jenny Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rebecca is doing very well. She has never had the problems Renee has," Jenny 
Lee said. Donations can be made to the Renee Lee Trust Fund, c/o Farmers & 
Merchants Bank, 31873 Del Obispo St., San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675.

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS

 Two candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 45th 
Congressional District. They are Democrat Brett Williamson of Costa Mesa and 
Republican Dana Rohrabacher, the incumbent, of Huntington Beach. Where they 
stand on four issues: Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson: "Any health care legislation must provide for universal coverage. 
(I) support an employer-funded program to replace the huge insurance premiums 
currently being paid out by both employers and employees alike. I will not 
support any plan unless it provides full coverage for those already on Medicare 
and for children, including immunizations and preventive care. I support 
managed health care networks that allow individuals to select from multiple 
plans, at least one of which must give all participants the option to choose 
their own doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher: "I support reorienting tax benefits for health insurance from 
employers to individuals for their choice of approved, universally available 
plans, assisting the poor as necessary. This would encourage individual choice 
and responsibility, which I believe is preferable to keeping employees tied to 
employers for the sake of their health insurance or turning health care over to 
the government. I also support tort reform, particularly in the medical area, 
to try to reduce the portion of medical costs which are caused by the legal 
system. Unjustified and frivolous lawsuits are a major contributor to increased 
health costs." Education and Health Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson: "I favor reducing illegal immigration by stricter control of our 
borders, increasing the number of Border Patrol agents, cracking down on visa 
violators, imposing sanctions on those who knowingly hire undocumented workers. 
Curtailing health care and education benefits will not solve the immigration 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher: "We will never get our illegal immigration problems under control 
as long as we continue to offer a generous package of federal, state and local 
benefits to anyone in the world who can make it across our border. I intend to 
take every available opportunity to offer amendments to federal spending bills, 
restricting the funds in those bills from going to illegal aliens. . . . The 
only health care that should be provided to an illegal alien is immediate 
emergency care, after which the illegal alien should be immediately deported." 
Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson: "I favor increasing the number of police on the streets and 
community policing programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher: Opposed anti-crime bill approved by the House earlier this year 
that is now pending before a House-Senate conference committee. "The way to 
address our problems with crime is to reform the criminal justice system so 
that criminals can count on receiving swift and sure punishment. The 
'exclusionary rule' (which prohibits the admission of illegally seized evidence 
in criminal cases) needs to be reformed so that all relevant evidence can be 
used to put the guilty in jail. And we need habeas corpus reform so that our 
courts are not tied up with interminable appeals from convicted criminals." El 
Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson: Favors development of a commercial airport at El Toro "provided it 
is economically feasible and it poses no environmental threats." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher: "It is essential for Orange County's economy to have sufficient 
airport capacity. El Toro MCAS is nearly ideally located to provide that 
capacity and represents a valuable asset that Orange County cannot afford to 
lose. I strongly support the county initiative that will be on the November 
ballot to require the use of El Toro as a commercial airport."

OFFICER ACQUITTED OF BEATING KING IS FIRED FROM L.A. POLICE FORCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A police officer who kicked Rodney G. King has been fired, a month after a 
disciplinary panel ruled he used excessive force during the videotaped beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams signed the order firing Theodore J. Briseno on 
Thursday.The 12-year veteran was suspended without pay after the March 3, 1991, 
beating of King. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry for Ted; he's been through hell," said Harland Braun, one of 
Briseno's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno and the other three officers who beat King were acquitted of nearly 
all state charges, a decision that sparked the riots in 1992. He was later 
acquitted in federal court as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Briseno, 41, testified during the state trial that his fellow officers were 
"out of control" during the beating. He has said he kicked King to keep him on 
the ground so he could be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 His testimony was used in the federal civil rights trial that led to the 
convictions of former Sgt. Stacey C. Koon and former Officer Laurence M. 
Powell. The fourth officer, Timothy E. Wind, was fired two months after King's 
beating. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun said he was fired in retaliation for testifying against fellow officers.

NEW PLAN HAMMERS OUT AID FOR QUAKE VICTIMS; AFTERMATH: PACOIMA WIDOW IS THE 
FIRST SOUTHERN CALIFORNIAN TO BENEFIT FROM THE $5-MILLION PRIVATE-PUBLIC 
PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When a Southern California Gas Co. truck pulled up to her home two months ago, 
Angela Rubalcava was afraid to answer the door. She had not paid her bills 
since the Northridge earthquake ravaged her Pacoima home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a bill collector," said the 47-year-old widow, who shares 
her home with six other family members. "Then I decided, 'Well, I'm here. I'm 
not going to hide. Whatever's going to happen, I'll face it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of getting chewed out by a bill collector, Rubalcava was greeted 
by gas company officials interviewing quake victims for a new aid program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Rubalcava was rewarded for her open-door welcome when she became 
the first Southern Californian to benefit from the new, $5-million program -- a 
private-public effort that sends workers out to cracked and damaged homes to 
hammer out up to $1,500 in quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a dream," said Rubalcava, whose home was transformed by the 
temblor into a jigsaw of cracks, some big enough to fit a fist through. "I had 
spent all $3,000 that FEMA gave me to pay for a new water heater and re-tile 
the bathroom floor. I was rejected by the Small Business Administration. I had 
no money at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Community Partnership for Earthquake Repair, the program is aimed 
at hundreds of people like Rubalcava who have exhausted their Federal Emergency 
Management Agency relief benefits and were denied SBA loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's filling a void for a lot of people in the San Fernando Valley who need 
to have repairs made and who are primarily low income, disabled or seniors who 
don't have the resources available to them," Gas Co. Chief Executive Officer 
Dick Farman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is sponsored by a variety of state and local agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, applicants must have an annual income that meets federal poverty 
level standards -- for example, $22,100 for a family of four and $29,500 for 
seniors or the permanently disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs include damaged doors, windows and walls; minor roof repair; tearing 
down damaged chimneys; strapping water heaters; debris removal, and repairs to 
plumbing, heating, water, electrical and gas systems. 
</P>
<P>
 To mark Saturday's kickoff, about 40 members of the sponsoring agencies 
descended upon Rubalcava's three-bedroom home with hammers in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubalcava, an office clerk who lives with her three sons, two grandsons and 
daughter-in-law, watched as a work crew spent less than an hour installing a 
back door missing since the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, a work crew of California Conservation Corps members will return to 
patch the cracks that have haunted her since January. The repairs are expected 
to take less than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear will never go away, but at least I won't have these cracks to remind 
me of that day," she said.

TEACHERS PUT ASIDE PAST DIFFERENCES, SUPPORT BROWN IN GUBERNATORIAL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 40,000-member California Federation of Teachers endorsed gubernatorial 
candidate Kathleen Brown on Saturday as the parent American Federation of 
Teachers' 73rd convention opened here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Kathleen Brown cares deeply about kids -- big kids and little 
kids -- at all levels," said California Federation of Teachers President Mary 
Bergan, a vicepresident of the national organization."We are very proud to 
endorse her." 
</P>
<P>
 The state organization, which had endorsed state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi in the gubernatorial primary in June, has had some differences with 
Brown in the past. But Brown vowed Saturday to focus on a common goal: 
improving the state's public school system. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown promised to implement a job training program for high school students, 
pump $100 million in technology into the schools and work to achieve campus 
safety. She also took a jab at Gov. Pete Wilson, echoing her campaign 
television advertisement that accuses him of reducing funds for education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete Wilson has had his chance and he gets a failing grade," Brown said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CROSSE WILL SEEK REELECTION TO SCHOOL BOARD IN 
NOVEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley Unified School District board member Doug Crosse has announced 
that he will seek a second term on the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Sharon Hushka has also announced her intention to run for 
one of two open seats on the board.Positions held by Crosse and board President 
Carla Kurachi are up for election in November. Kurachi has not said whether she 
will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Crosse and Hushka have stressed campus violence and school funding as key 
issues in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I continue to push for the inclusion of morals and ethics instruction . . . 
in all grade levels and the implementation of stricter standards of behavior 
and discipline," Crosse said in an address announcing his candidacy Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old businessman said the biggest issue facing the Simi Valley 
school board is dwindling finances. Crosse said he will continue to fight for 
adequate school funding from the state, while pursuing new revenue sources, 
such as business and education partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 Hushka, a 36-year-old author of children's books, has served on various 
community committees, including most recently the School Safety Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been very much an advocate for conflict resolution programs," Hushka 
said. She also supports implementing cultural diversity awareness programs to 
address campus violence, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to teach students to make moral decisions," she said, adding 
that she thinks it is inappropriate to preach a particular set of morals to 
public school students. TRACY WILSON

VALLEY FAIR'S FINANCIAL FOOTING IS IMPROVING; EVENT: LONG-STANDING DEFICIT HAS 
BEEN REDUCED. NEGOTIATIONS ARE IN THE WORKS TO MAKE EQUESTRIAN CENTER THE 
PERMANENT SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, officials of the San Fernando Valley Fair 
-- which begins Thursday -- say they are getting back on their feet 
financially. 
</P>
<P>
 A long-standing $300,000 deficit has been reduced to $50,000 and negotiations 
are in the works to make the Los Angeles Equestrian Center in Burbank the 
permanent site for the annual fair, a stabilizing move that is crucial to a 
fair's financial survival, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a transition period after we left CSUN," said the fair's general 
manager, Dale Coons, about the 1988 loss of the fair's previous permanent 
location at Cal State Northridge. "But we will end that debt. . .by the end of 
this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Coons estimates the fair will generate $100,000 this year in admissions and 
more than $100,000 in carnival and concession revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not out of the woods," Coons said, "but so far we are well on our 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley Fair board met its goal for 1994 by staying within its 
budget of $500,000. A public relations firm headed a program that attracted 
large corporate sponsors -- including local media outlets, a beer company and a 
cellular phone company -- and the state Department of Food and Agriculture 
funded $140,000 of the fair. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract more exhibitors, board members waived competition exhibit fees for 
this year's fair, yet preserved prize money and awards. Coons said the cost of 
administrating the fees was more than the $4,000 they generated. "And we wanted 
to make it as easy as possible for young people to enter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, more than 51,000 people attended the fair at the Equestrian Center, 
and officials expect 65,000 this year for the 48th annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 But a current state proposal by Gov. Pete Wilson, which would turn over the 
operation of all state fairs to the private sector, could hinder the financial 
progress of the fair, said Stan Wirth, financial officer for the state Division 
of Fairs and Expositions. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal could end some or all state funding of fairs, although the costs 
of adhering to state rules and regulations also would be eliminated. The 
proposal is still being studied, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the San Fernando Valley Fair is one of the smallest fairs in 
California, it receives more money from the state than larger fairs such as the 
Los Angeles County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smaller fairs usually don't have a facility and they need more help with 
resources," Wirth said. "They don't have a big base of income to draw from." 
</P>
<P>
 Not having a permanent site for five years added to the San Fernando Valley 
Fair's financial losses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the fair was evicted from its longtime home at CSUN's Devonshire 
Downs -- where the fair had some permanent facilities -- to make way for new 
developments by the university. It moved first to Hansen Dam Recreation Area, 
where it spent thousands of dollars on tent and equipment rentals, then, four 
years later, to the equestrian center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the fact that we lost our permanent home at CSUN and had to move to 
Hansen Dam cost us so much money," Coons said. "The revenue was not great 
enough to be able to rent tents at Hansen Dam and make money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Hansen Dam, the fair board was forced to rent equipment to house everything 
from exhibitions to ticket stands. The fair put down roots with the support of 
the community, but the prospect of eliminating many of the rental fees caused 
it to move on in 1991. When the fair moved to its current Burbank home the 
following year, it saved more than $100,000 in rental fees because the 
equestrian center has extensive facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's horse show, which had been held at locations away from the main 
site for years, finally could be consolidated and is self-supporting for the 
first time in the fair's history, Coons said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will run July 21-24 at the Los Angeles Equestrian Center with an old 
West theme titled "We've Got Your Fun Covered."

 A 63-year-old Camarillo man was killed after being struck by a flatbed truck 
at the Agoura rubbish company where he worked, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd Bahian Undag was walking across the junkyard at the Hillside Rubbish Co. 
on Friday evening when he was hit by a refuse truck, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Vincente Orroteza of Oxnard, had stopped his truck to speak to 
someone at the Agoura Road dump site, Smith said. As Orroteza began to drive 
away, he turned the truck and ran over Undag. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness tried to call out for the driver to stop, but Orroteza did not hear 
his cries, Smith said. JEANNETTE REGALADO

OXYGEN AIDS PATIENT WITH FLESH-EATING GERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pure oxygen treatments have begun to kill the virulent strep infection that 
was destroying the skin and tissue on a Fillmore woman's leg, according to 
officials at Los Robles Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Pulido, 63, was rushed to the Thousand Oaks hospital Friday for 
special therapy to treat a condition popularly known as "flesh-eating 
bacteria."What started as a pimple a week earlier had spread from her groin to 
her knee and across her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. J.B. Wilmeth, who runs the hospital's hyperbaric medicine department, 
described Pulido's condition Saturday as critical but definitely improving, 
said a nurse working with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido could be finished with the hyperbaric treatments within two days, but 
it is too early to tell what kind of follow-up treatment she will need, 
according to Wilmeth. Some victims require skin grafts, while others have 
enough healthy tissue that the sore can heal naturally, the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Wilmeth began treating Pulido in the hospital's hyperbaric chamber, 
a pressurized metallic cylinder that allows doctors to administer doses of 100% 
oxygen to patients. The oxygen helps kill the streptococcus bacteria and other 
germs causing the infection. It also makes the skin and tissue surrounding the 
open sore healthier and more resistant to the spread.

TRASH WORKER HIT, KILLED BY TRUCK

 "The witness apparently saw (Undag) carrying a pair of shoes in his hand and

Sheriff's Lt. Richard Moak. "That is when he started to yell out to the 
driver." 
</P>
<P>
 Moak said Cal/OSHA was notified and will be conducting its own investigation.

MCDONALD'S MASSACRE; TIME CAN'T HEAL ALL WOUNDS INFLICTED BY 21 SLAYINGS; 
CRIME: SAN YSIDRO LOST ITS INNOCENCE IN THE VIOLENCE 10 YEARS AGO. SURVIVORS 
COPE IN DIFFERENT WAYS.

<P>
 The image has come to epitomize that hot, sunny afternoon 10 years ago, when a 
41-year-old unemployed father of two named James Oliver Huberty walked into a 
McDonald's and began shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Three boys -- two of them dead -- lie sprawled on the sidewalk outside the 
restaurant, their bodies full of lead, their bikes fallen over their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving boy is a man now. Joshua Coleman is 21 years old, a mustachioed 
ironworker who helps build highway bridges and high rises. 
</P>
<P>
 The shadow of July 18, 1984 -- and of the 21 adults and children who died in 
Huberty's rampage -- haunts many who were there that day. But Coleman insists 
that he is not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly the day it happened and I think of my friends every time," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as feeling sorry for myself or anybody, I can't let that stop my life. 
Nothing bothers me. Death doesn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers it well: He and his two buddies, Omar Hernandez and David Flores, 
had gone to buy some doughnuts. But Joshua wanted ice cream, too, so they 
tooled their bicycles over to McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 They were on the sidewalk when 11-year-old Joshua heard the man yell. He 
turned and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lying on the broiling pavement, his right side riddled with shotgun pellets, 
his pals nearby and the gunman still shooting, Joshua had the presence of mind 
to play dead. 
</P>
<P>
 How? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got lucky. The fact he kept shooting at us. . . . You hear about an 
accident and sometimes you think, 'What would you do if you were there?' And I 
always thought I would play dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty's paroxysm ended after an hour and 17 minutes, when he was killed by a 
police sharpshooter. In the aftermath, Joshua Coleman's parents enrolled him at 
a new school for a year to avoid scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 He never saw a therapist. Neither he nor his parents believed he needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 He still keeps a big shoe box of letters from the hundreds of people who saw 
the picture of him lying on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of courage," they say. And "Be strong." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He could have been a hero. If he hadn't run, maybe -- just maybe -- Ken 
Dickey, a 20-year-old college student working behind the McDonald's counter, 
could have saved somebody's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember sitting in a chair for a long time, for days afterwards, and 
thinking, 'What could I have done?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I could easily have grabbed a metal object and bashed this guy across the 
head. That would have been the hero's route. I didn't feel I showed grace under 
pressure. I ran to a room in fear, hoping I didn't get shot." 
</P>
<P>
 When the shooting started, Dickey and a male co-worker fled to a basement 
utility room. Later, three female workers joined them. Eventually, a woman with 
a baby came down, and then a bleeding man. 
</P>
<P>
 They huddled in the hot, stale basement with gunfire sounding overhead. 
Finally, police knocked at the door and, though they were fearful, they opened 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers told them to put their hand on the shoulder of the person ahead, and 
to look only at the wall to their left as they exited. He remembers seeing the 
spatters of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dickey lives in the small town of Payette, Idaho, with his wife and 
their 2-year-old daughter. He teaches high school chemistry. He comes back to 
the San Diego area only to visit his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I go four or five months and I don't think of it at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Aurora Pena-Rivera couldn't talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
 About being shot in the jaw. About losing two friends and an aunt and a baby 
cousin. About them lying dead around her. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple things would trigger awful memories. "I remember I went to a restaurant 
and this man was drunk and he was yelling. He got mad with one of the waiters, 
and I just broke down. I thought about that other man." 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy made things worse. 
</P>
<P>
 No more doctors, she told her mother. On her own, she learned to accept the 
loss, the guilt, the unanswered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I used to ask, 'Why did it happen and why us?' I would say, 'Why her? 
Why the baby? She doesn't have any sins.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I see that I'm just being selfish. If it didn't happen to us, it 
would have happened to someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora was 11. Her aunt wanted a fish sandwich. The group of six relatives and 
friends was standing at the counter when Huberty walked in; four died. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurora lay on the restaurant floor, her eyes closed tight, afraid to look. 
Then, like all kids, she got curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I heard him far away, so I opened my eyes and he saw me. He walked 
to the trash can and he had some (guns) in there. He got his shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when he shot me." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Aurora is 21 and has a 9-month-old girl. An administrative assistant for 
the Navy, she has nieces and nephews who ask about the scars on her leg. 
Sometimes, she gets annoyed. She tells them she fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, at a K mart, Aurora saw Adelina Hernandez, mother of 
Joshua Coleman's friend Omar. 
</P>
<P>
 "She hugged me and kissed me and asked me how I was doing. I told her I got 
married and she's like, 'You got married already?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And my mom goes, 'Well, she's 21. She's the same age. . . .' She (Mrs. 
Hernandez) goes, 'Oh, yeah, he would have been 21 too.' 
</P>
<P>
 Adelina Hernandez is still surrounded by children -- she works at Sunset 
Elementary, the school Omar attended. The children remind her of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good therapy," she said. "It's my medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 The exuberance and vitality of the children who call her "Grandma" help Omar's 
mother each day. They help her forget the sight of her lifeless little boy, and 
of the hard days that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, the feelings are not so intense. She rarely gets depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it becomes unbearable, Hernandez, 63, finds comfort in a cassette 
tape she and Omar made when he was 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternately playing the roles of reporter and interviewee, they ask each other 
simple questions in Spanish: "What is your name?" "Where do you go to school?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tears clouding her eyes, Hernandez said: "It's hard for a mom." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were death threats. Etna Huberty's young daughters were taunted at 
school, and they moved twice within a year of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, at age 52, she lives with her two grown daughters in the working-class 
community of Spring Valley, 20 miles east of San Ysidro. Her home is a brown 
trailer on a quiet street. Broken-down cars and trucks clutter the driveway, 
next to an unkempt front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Etna Huberty filed an unsuccessful $5-million lawsuit against McDonald's, 
alleging that her husband's rampage was triggered in part by too many Chicken 
McNuggets. 
</P>
<P>
 And she tried to sell her story to a Hollywood producer. But the public outcry 
was so strong, the project was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Etna Huberty has graying hair, cropped short. Her face is drawn; her 
expression one of agitated exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 She works as an in-home nurse. She told a reporter in late June she hadn't yet 
paid her rent. She was willing to do an interview for $400, she said. (The 
reporter declined; paying for interviews violates Associated Press policy.) 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter Zelia was 14 at the time of the shootings, Cassandra 10. They had 
gone to school with many of their father's victims. After the shootings, they 
changed schools, enrolling under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're surviving," said Etna Huberty's friend, Ann Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the shootings, Etna Huberty apologized for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is wondering why he would do such a thing," she said in a statement. 
"He was always very sad and lonely." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty and his wife moved to San Diego just seven months before, after he 
lost his job as a welder in Massillon, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Huberty worked as a security guard. A week before the shootings, 
he was fired because of "a general instability . . . plus the fact that he was 
not performing his duties in a proper manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty was a loner, those who knew him say. He could be a troublemaker. He 
became loud and abusive to neighbors during a dispute. He let his two German 
shepherds run loose. He liked guns. He was something of a survivalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers just laughed at him, a former boss said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 17, he called a local mental health clinic asking for an appointment. 
A receptionist took his name, but he never got a call back. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of July 18, Huberty went to court to plead guilty to two 
traffic infractions. He and his wife and a daughter then ate at the McDonald's 
across from the courthouse, miles north of their apartment. Afterward, they 
went to the zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 They got home just before 4 p.m. Huberty kissed his wife goodby (she would 
later tell police that was unusual). Then, he told her he was going to hunt 
people -- just one of the crazy things he was always saying, she figured. 
</P>
<P>
 Huberty loaded his guns, got in his car, drove a block and parked. Toting an 
Uzi, a semiautomatic pistol and a shotgun, he strode to the McDonald's; 257 
rounds later, he was dead.

FIRE DEPARTMENT TO APPEAL REVERSAL OF PLAYBOY BAN; COURTS: THE LEGAL FIGHT WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE POLICY THAT FORBADE THE MAGAZINE IN ORDER TO PREVENT A 
'SEXUALLY CHARGED ENVIRONMENT.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles County Fire Department will appeal a judge's ruling that it is 
unconstitutional for the department to forbid firefighters to read Playboy 
magazine at work, a regulation meant to discourage sexism in firehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Tolnai, a senior deputy county counsel who last month unsuccessfully 
defended in court the Fire Department's right to enforce the ban, said he filed 
the notice of appeal last week with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials banned possession of Playboy and other magazines 
featuring pictures of nude or skimpily dressed women from all work locations in 
1992 in an effort to prevent a "sexually charged environment" for the 
department's 11 women firefighters, who work with about 2,400 men. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a one-day trial last month, U.S. District Court Judge Stephen V. 
Wilson issued an order barring the county from enforcing the ban on Fire Capt. 
Steven W. Johnson, who brought a lawsuit challenging the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, Wilson found that county officials had failed to prove that 
quiet reading of Playboy contributes to a sexually harassing atmosphere. The 
judge also found that the ban placed severe limitations on Johnson's First 
Amendment right to freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beyond my wildest belief that the fire chief and the county would want 
to waste more taxpayers' dollars," said Johnson, after learning the county had 
filed the notice of appeal. "I don't think they've got a snowball's chance in 
hell of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tolnai, the attorney for the county, said his office is still negotiating a 
possible compromise settlement with Johnson's attorneys. Johnson was 
represented by lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and Playboy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether county officials will apply Judge Wilson's ruling to 
other magazines covered by the ban and not just Playboy, the only magazine he 
specifically mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 A county official had testified during the trial that the ban would also apply 
not only to men's magazines, but to certain issues of Vanity Fair, Rolling 
Stone and Sports Illustrated that contained pictures of nude or partially nude 
women. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he has drafted a nine-page grievance, which argues that the 
judge's order should apply to all reading material covered under the First 
Amendment and not just Playboy. He said he plans to file the grievance with his 
department if the issue is not resolved.

A QUESTION OF HONOR; SURVIVORS OF A 1944 NAVAL TRAGEDY SAY THEY WERE WRONGED BY 
COURTS-MARTIAL -- AND RACISM OF THE ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mutineers are all old men now. Until recently, most of them have said 
little about their ordeal 50 years ago: the deadly explosion, the bigotry, and 
the time they spent in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, these survivors of the tragedy at Port Chicago -- the deadliest 
stateside disaster of World War II -- are part of a growing movement to 
repudiate the racism of the era and clear their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were charged with was just phony," Los Angeles resident Freddie 
Meeks, 74, one of 50 African American sailors convicted of mutiny, said 
bitterly. "We did not even commit mutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the 50th anniversary of the explosion at Port Chicago, the naval 
munitions base on Suisun Bay near Concord where black sailors in segregated 
units were assigned to load explosives onto ships around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast killed 320 people -- including more than 200 African American seamen 
-- and injured 390. It was so powerful that it destroyed two ships, maimed 
sailors in their barracks and broke windows in the St. Francis Hotel 35 miles 
away in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, 258 surviving African American seamen refused to resume loading 
munitions, seeking safer working conditions and leave to visit their families 
like white sailors had received. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty black seamen were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison terms of 
up to 15 years. The rest were court-martialed for disobeying orders and 
sentenced to short terms in the stockade. After the war, under pressure from 
NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, the Navy reduced the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, six Democratic members of Congress from California, contending that the 
convictions were tainted by prejudice, are calling on President Clinton to 
clear the names of the convicted men. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should put this sorry chapter in racial relations behind us, and allow 
these remaining men to complete their lives knowing that they have the esteem 
and regard of their countrymen for their service during World War II," the 
elected officials said in a letter to the President last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those signing the letter were Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer 
and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland). 
House Natural Resources Chairman George Miller (D-Martinez), who is leading the 
drive to expunge the convictions from the seamen's records, said the 258 men 
were the victims of bigotry and were unjustly found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court-martials would never have occurred if not for the issue of race," 
Miller said. "These men have lived with this scar on their record throughout 
their lives. They have been viewed as having less than honorable service, which 
they clearly did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, survivors of the disaster, Miller, Navy officials and the National Park 
Service will dedicate a memorial to the dead at Port Chicago, now a part of the 
Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 A new monument lists all of those who died in alphabetical order -- black and 
white side by side as they never were in life. A rusty, bent piece of metal 
recovered from one ship is mounted nearby, not far from the chunks of concrete 
and wood pilings that remain from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine was the biggest munitions 
depot on the West Coast. Crews of African American seamen, supervised by white 
officers, served as stevedores loading the explosives on ships bound for the 
Pacific Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The seamen never received training on how to handle munitions but were under 
heavy pressure to load the ships as quickly as possible. Munitions ranging from 
rifle rounds to 2,000-lb. shells were loaded by winch, slid down ramps or 
rolled on dollies. Some officers bet on which crew would load the fastest, and 
losing crews were punished with reduced liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of July 17, 1944, there were two explosions five seconds apart at 
the loading pier. The first was small. The second demolished two ships and the 
pier, killing everyone within 1,000 feet of the blast.  
</P>
<P>
 Both ships, the Bryan and the 11,000-ton Quinault Victory, were thrown into 
the air and broken into small pieces. Arms, legs, heads and other body parts 
were strewn among the rubble. Many of the dead were never found. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 4,600 tons of explosives packed into the Bryan, the blast was 
more than a third as large as the explosion caused by the atomic bomb dropped 
on Hiroshima a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 The detonation measured 3.4 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as 
Nevada. It caused heavy damage in the nearby town of Port Chicago and for miles 
around, prompting the filing of 10,000 claims by civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever determined what caused the explosion, but some survivors believe 
the rush to load the ships contributed to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loading pier destroyed, the surviving seamen were assigned to clear 
the debris and collect the body parts of their fellow seamen. While white 
officers and seamen were given leave to visit their families, the African 
American seamen were shipped to nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the explosion, Seaman Percy Robinson was in his bunk. He 
suffered lacerations on his face and arm and was hospitalized for a week. Less 
than a month after the explosion, he was among a group of 258 men told they 
would resume loading munitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset because I wasn't allowed to come home on leave after I got 
wounded," said Robinson, now 70 and living in Los Angeles. "I was still 
bandaged at the time I was ordered to go back to work. I knew other sailors on 
our base who got wounded and they went home. None of the blacks who were 
wounded were allowed to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and the other 257 men all refused to load munitions. But after the 
admiral in charge of the depot warned them they would be shot if they continued 
to refuse, he was among 208 seamen who agreed to go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of loading ships, however, they were sent to the stockade and 
court-martialed for disobeying orders. Robinson was sentenced to three months 
in the stockade and served 71 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he received an honorable discharge and went on to become a senior 
staff research engineer at Hughes Aircraft, but he could never be rid of the 
stain on his record. Until recently, he never mentioned it to his wife or 
children, but every time he applied for a security clearance he had to explain 
his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always there," he said, "but you learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Seaman Meeks was on liberty in San Francisco when the blast occurred. He heard 
on the radio that he was supposed to return to the base, but did not go back 
immediately. On his return, he was put in the brig and then assigned to guard 
the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, ordered to go back to work and facing the admiral's threat, Meeks 
joined 49 others and refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we would not go back and load the ships under those conditions," 
recalled Meeks, who went on to work for Los Angeles County and is now retired. 
"They only had the blacks loading and unloading the ammunition. The whites 
didn't have to touch it. It would scare you to death the way we had to handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 At their mutiny trial -- the Navy's largest ever -- the prosecutor argued that 
in time of war, the seamen's concern over unsafe conditions and fear of another 
explosion were not sufficient grounds for refusing to obey an order. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a month of testimony, the Navy judges took 80 minutes to reach 
their verdict: All 50 were guilty of mutiny. The mutineers were sentenced to 
hard labor and imprisoned on Terminal Island in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurgood Marshall, an NAACP attorney who was later appointed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, spent weeks observing the trial and protested that the men were 
charged "solely because of their race and color." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand why whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order it is 
mutiny," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Roosevelt joined with Marshall in urging the Navy to be more lenient. 
In 1946, the Navy reduced the mutineers' sentences and released them after they 
had served about 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the men were reassigned to other Navy duties and given a chance to 
redeem themselves. Most of the mutineers received a discharge "under honorable 
conditions," which gave them some veterans benefits but fell short of the 
coveted honorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Chicago case prompted the Navy to overhaul its procedures for 
handling ammunition -- and to begin ending segregation even before President 
Harry S. Truman ordered the military's integration in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, a book by Robert Allen titled "The Port Chicago Mutiny" and a 
subsequent documentary by KRON-TV in San Francisco revived the memory of the 
mutiny and called into question the treatment the men received. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under orders from Congress to review the case, the Navy issued a report this 
year concluding that racial discrimination played a part in the seamen's work 
assignments and living conditions. But the Navy found that racial prejudice did 
not affect the courts-martial, convictions or sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (review) panel concluded that there was nothing unfair or unjust in the 
final outcome of any of the Port Chicago court-martials," the Navy said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the effort to expunge the record of the mutineers has the backing of Port 
Chicago survivors who obeyed orders and went back to work, such as Morris 
Soublet, then a second-class bosun's mate who supervised loading of the ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the men had signed up to fight the enemy and found themselves working 
as laborers without proper training and in unsafe conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't afraid of getting on a ship and getting shot at," said Soublet, 
73, who lives in Oakland. "They just didn't want to handle ammunition."

WORRIED WESTSIDERS GO ON THE DEFENSIVE; SAFETY: RISING FEAR OF CRIME FUELS A 
BOOM IN SECURITY ITEMS -- EVEN IN PLACES THAT ARE NOT ESSENTIALLY DANGEROUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judging by the security measures its residents take, the Westside might seem 
one of the most dangerous places in Los Angeles, if not the entire state. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the kudzu-like proliferation of signs warning of armed response from 
home security services, plus the fleets of silently cruising private patrol 
cars, the homes rigged with motion detectors and security lights, and the 
omnipresent oinking of auto alarms.  
</P>
<P>
 That's not to mention the proliferation of portable security devices: 
restraining clubs locked across steering wheels, canisters of pepper spray, 
palm-sized stun guns and hand-activated personal alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Given this, an out-of-towner might assume that crime runs rampant in such 
usually quiet neighborhoods as Malibu, Brentwood and the Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, of course, what most of the Westside's more affluent residents are 
doing is what they do best -- placing themselves at the leading edge of a 
nationwide trend. In this case, it's the boom in spending on auto, home and 
personal security. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Americans spent more than $400 million on safety equipment and 
services, double the amount of 15 years ago, according to American Demographics 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 As the fear of violent and once-unheard-of crimes such as carjackings and 
follow-home robberies permeate the consciousness of suburban America, a world 
of items such as blindness-inducing flashlights, life-sized, latex "Safe-T-Men" 
(for people who live or drive alone) and keychain-attached batons are becoming 
increasingly popular. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Westside, the call to arms has been particularly strong. Jon Cobb, vice 
president at Westec, perhaps the most recognizable of the home security 
agencies that patrol the area, said sales of the service are up 20% to 25% this 
year for homes in and around West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, at Security 20/20 in Beverly Hills, consultant Mike Peterson said 
sales of pepper spray have been "very favorable" since the company began 
selling the item in May after its legalization by the state. "We're getting 
people from all over West Los Angeles," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Underlying the surge in security purchases are anxious suburbanites concerned 
about crime in their neighborhoods. In a Time magazine/CNN poll taken last 
year, in fact, 30% of those surveyed nationwide said they believed that crime 
is just as prevalent in the suburbs as it is in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Paty Lancaster, whose Mar Vista house was burglarized in March, says that in 
talking to neighbors after the break-in, she was surprised to learn how many 
people in the area had also experienced crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until people talk to each other, you don't hear about it, but it turns out 
it's been happening a lot," said Lancaster, who helped form a Neighborhood 
Watch group on her block. "We're just more aware of it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood resident Richard Kjeldsen, who has lived in the area for more than 
two decades, says he does not personally feel at greater risk. But concern 
about crime, he adds, has nevertheless increased dramatically among neighbors. 
"A lot of my friends are frantic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality of crime, though, is not so clear-cut. Though pockets of Venice 
and Hollywood do suffer from high crime, the areas of the Westside where the 
most is spent on security are usually the safest.  
</P>
<P>
 And although violent crime has risen in suburban areas, according to FBI 
statistics, murder rates in 1992 were still 81% lower in the suburbs than in 
large central cities, rates of robbery were 88% lower and rates of rape were 
56% lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Los Angeles, which has the second-highest rate of suburban crime among 
major American cities (behind only Miami), suburban crime still lags far behind 
that of the central city area. 
</P>
<P>
 Security experts attribute the public's rising concern as much to media 
reports as to crime rates. On a daily basis, people are exposed to more 
accounts of crime than ever before, a phenomenon noted recently by the Tyndall 
Report, a magazine that monitors television news. 
</P>
<P>
 A February article in the magazine stated that "violent crime has become more 
newsworthy because . . . the news media have chosen to make it so." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at the crime statistics, crime is not necessarily up . . . (but) 
it's a lot more visible in the media," concurred Jon Cobb. "People are more 
aware of what's going on in and around their communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Hemsworth: "A lot of it is perception. Crime is up in certain areas and 
it's down in certain areas."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, for West Los Angeles, where the local boom in security is perhaps most 
evident, the crime picture is a mixed one. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of robberies increased 110, about 8%, from 1992 to 1993, but the 
number of homicides and rapes declined during that period. Overall, crime is 
down in the area, said Capt. Constance Dial, patrol commanding officer of the 
West Los Angeles Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In sheer numbers, the biggest crime in West Los Angeles remains that of 
auto-related theft. According to police statistics, last year there were 4,083 
thefts from and burglaries of autos in West Los Angeles and 3,403 stolen 
vehicles, in both cases a slight decline from 1992 figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Many stolen cars are subsequently dispatched to so-called chop shops, 
officials say, where a $20,000 auto can be quickly broken down into $40,000 
worth of illegally sold parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very, very desirable area for auto thieves to steal cars from," said 
John Raber of LoJack, which markets a device that allows police to track 
vehicles after they are taken. In the Los Angeles area, Raber says, the highest 
percentage of stolen cars equipped with LoJack are from the Westside. "There's 
a real good selection of cars to choose from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the Westside's biggest threat is auto theft and break-ins does 
little to assuage residents who consider personal crime their No. 1 worry. 
Regardless of whether their fears are well-founded, residents say they feel 
that such crimes as violent attacks and home break-ins are rising sharply, and 
that they are more random than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crime used to be in the 'bad' parts of town," said Ken Hudson, president of 
Front Line, a Torrance-based business that offers courses in personal security 
and disaster preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people see it happening everywhere and they feel more vulnerable." Brian 
Hemsworth, managing editor of Safe and Secure Living magazine, agreed: "Most 
people we talk to, they're scared." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which has resulted in a surge in sales of security goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Counter Spy Shop in Beverly Hills, which sells an array of corporate 
and personal security equipment, manager Judy Fish says that all types of 
customers now walk through the door, from those who want to spend a few 
thousand dollars for covert video cameras planted in toy animals to those who 
want a standard stun gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are selling pepper spray to 75-year-old women," Fish said. "There are 
people who would absolutely not leave their house without it." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Maria Bugarin. Last week, Bugarin, who works in Brentwood at a 
property management firm, bought her first canister of pepper spray. It now 
hangs from her key chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (automated teller machine) robberies influenced my decision, and hearing 
about carjacking and all the assaults at night," said Bugarin, who is single 
and in her 30s. "That got the best of me."

CALL OF THE WILD; TIRED OF BUDGET CUTS, NATURE CENTER OFFICIAL STEPS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a child, Frank Hovore would capture wasps off flowers and spend hours 
poring over his field guide book to identify them. 
</P>
<P>
 He never quite outgrew the fascination. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovore and a friend earned money after school by charging peers a quarter to 
look at their traveling mini-zoo of tarantulas, scorpions and snakes. He also 
caught rattlesnakes in the Mojave Desert and sold their venom. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old Canyon Country resident retired Friday as the county's natural 
areas administrator after working 23 years out of an office at the Placerita 
Nature Center. Much of his time has also been spent outdoors in the rain 
forests of Latin and South America where he's been bitten, electrocuted and 
faced a variety of other hazards in the course of observing nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovore said he is stepping down because he is tired of repetitive 
administrative duties and fighting county budget cutbacks every year. He 
predicts the centers "will chug along with 10% cuts in various things year 
after year" until dramatic measures are needed, such as a new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the county facilities have had few, if any, repairs and revisions 
during his career, Hovore said. He said recent government actions -- such as 
deeming recreational facilities nonessential in favor of preserving funds for 
law enforcement -- are complicating the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take away all the opportunities for people to do constructive things 
with their lives, what do you think people are going to do instead?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, Hovore said, he feels more secure in the wilderness than in the 
jungle of urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather walk through the rain forest barefoot at night without a 
flashlight than Downtown Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovore, a Burbank native, graduated from Cal State Northridge in 1971 and 
became one of the nature center's original employees when it opened later that 
year. His responsibilities have grown through the years -- he eventually 
supervised the county's 18 nature centers -- but still led hikes and trains 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 He planned to continue volunteering after he retires, and will run a 
biological consulting business out of his home and teach a tropical biology 
class at CSUN. The class includes a two-week trip to Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I really were leaving in the sense of never returning I would be pretty 
stressed out and traumatized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovore said the most profound memory he has of his work at the center is from 
1979, when it was nearly destroyed by a wildfire. Despite his efforts to fight 
the fire, the wind overpowered him and blew the flames to one of the outer 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to turn and run because of the fire," said Hovore, who won a county 
Valor Award for fighting the blaze. "I had flaming rabbits streaking by me and 
deer running past me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the wind changed direction unexpectedly, pushing the fire back onto 
already burned ground, Hovore said.

JIM MURRAY: NINE PLUS ONE? ODD NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than 100 years, baseball has been a function of the number nine. "The 
outlook wasn't good for the Mudville nine that day," starts the definitive poem 
about the game, "Casey at the Bat." 
</P>
<P>
 The home nine, or the visiting nine are part of the literature of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Casey wasn't a designated hitter when he stepped to the plate, he was 
batting cleanup. The designated hitter made the grand old game a multiple of 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 Also gave it a split personality. One league's a game of 10, the other still 
nine.  
</P>
<P>
 It prompts the question, are designated hitters part of the team? Are they 
really a part of the game? Should they dress with the regulars? Should they 
even bring gloves to the ballpark? Or are they like field-goal kickers in the 
NFL? They don't bring shoulder pads or need their arms taped. They touch the 
ball only with their feet. Designated hitters touch it only with their bats. 
The National League pretends they don't exist. Even the American League seems 
only to tolerate them. And to the game's purists, they are pariahs, outcasts, 
despoilers of the purity of the game, gremlins who tamper with its continuity.  
</P>
<P>
 The game barely acknowledges them. There is no most valuable DH, no rookie DH 
of the year, and, naturally, no DH Gold Glove awards. They are one-dimensional 
individuals, ultimate platoonists in a game that only recently accommodated 
itself to the specialization of relief pitching. Baseball until the '30s 
expected a starting pitcher to be the finishing pitcher too. And it provided 
only for a "mop-up" pitcher for games hopelessly lost.  
</P>
<P>
 For Charles Theodore (Chili) Davis, No. 44 of the California Angels, holding 
designated hitters to be second-class citizens is a galling piece of snobbery 
that calls for redressing. Davis is more than a DH, he is, in some ways, the 
DH. Paul Molitor has a point or two higher average, but Chili has more home 
runs and several more runs batted in. Jose Canseco has more home runs, but 
Davis has a 40-point average bulge.  
</P>
<P>
 Chili gets apoplectic at the designated haters of the designated hitters.  
</P>
<P>
 "I suppose they would rather see the pitcher come to the plate and pop up!" he 
explodes.  
</P>
<P>
 Well, er, ah, yes, Chili, they would. The traditionalists cover their eyes and 
shudder when the DH, which they consider an abomination, comes to the plate. 
They regard it as an unconscionable soiling of the national pastime.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the pitchers are ambivalent abut it. It's not that they object to having 
somebody bat for them. Pitchers know they can't hit and regard a time at bat as 
an interval that can only be a danger to them. But they also would rather pitch 
to otherwise futile pitchers, a la the National League, than have a canny 
slugger like the DH to get out. Of course, if there had been the DH in his 
league in his day, Sandy Koufax would never have been taken out of a game.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, nobody loves a designated hitter. Even those who don't see it as a blot 
on the game's sacred statistics resent the DH's never having to crash into a 
fence, track down a line drive, face the waist-high spikes of a sliding, 
stealing baserunner or risk rotator-cuff damage firing to the cut-off man.  
</P>
<P>
 The DH is accounted for in Regulation 6:10 of the Official Game Rules, but it 
makes him sound like a complicated butler: "It is not mandatory that a club 
designate a hitter for the pitcher but failure to do so prior to the game 
precludes the use of a designated hitter for that game." They make him sound as 
if he is faintly unwholesome, a poor relation of sorts.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis resents it. He sees traditionalism as nothing more than a plot to 
interfere with his right to a livelihood.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people, when they see a person doing a certain thing and being a 
success, they try to bring that person down," he hints darkly.  
</P>
<P>
 Chili is not sure how he became a DH. The usual progression is to find someone 
who can manipulate the bat but is apt to need a helmet in the outfield. Davis 
thinks he was a more than adequate outfielder.  
</P>
<P>
 "I played center field for the Giants," he points out.  
</P>
<P>
 That is hardly a position for a guy pigeons perch on. A predecessor there was 
the right honorable Willie Mays.  
</P>
<P>
 It is true some players in antiquity could have used DH Rule 6:10. There was 
an American League player in the early '30s named Dale Alexander. He batted -- 
get this! -- .343, .326, .325 and finally a league-leading .367 in consecutive 
seasons. And he was out of baseball within a year because he couldn't field! 
</P>
<P>
 Designated hitters need a union. Chili is well paid -- $3 million a year -- 
but whereas the league keeps DH stats, it doesn't emphasize them any more than 
it does other fine-print achievements, such as sacrifice bunts or intentional 
bases on balls.  
</P>
<P>
 Chili is not only a premier DH, he is one of the few switch-hitters to 
practice the trade. He batted .280 as DH in 1992 with 11 home runs and 61 RBIs 
-- he batted .288 with 12 homers and 66 RBIs altogether. He batted .277 as DH 
in 1991 with 29 homers and 93 RBIs. Last year, he batted .243 as DH but had 27 
homers and 112 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an honorable profession so far as Chili, whose figures at the All-Star 
break were not only high for a DH but in the hunt for titles in the league as a 
whole, is concerned.  
</P>
<P>
 "They talk of preserving the integrity of the game, then they split it up into 
three divisions and a wild card," he snorts. "It's still baseball. They still 
curve 'em when you're at the plate. They haven't interfered with the great 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, they have. Concessionaires could tell you. When the pitcher 
came to bat in the old days, it was a good time to slip out for a hot dog. 
Chili at the bat is high drama. Casey would probably be a DH today. But not if 
he kept striking out.

WORLD CUP USA '94: THE FINALS; ITALY AND BAGGIO TRY TO GET LEG UP ON BRAZIL 
TODAY; SOCCER: HAMSTRING INJURY TO FORWARD COULD BE THE DECIDING FACTOR IN 
CLASSIC MATCHUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The heartbeat of a nation audible in his upper right leg, Roberto Baggio 
hobbled off a Loyola Marymount soccer field Saturday morning hoping to comfort 
his countrymen with an old Italian saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope is the last thing to die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Across town in Fullerton, the Brazilians smiled, strutted and hinted of a 
performance inspired by another traditional saying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outta our way!" 
</P>
<P>
 From these varied perspectives the two best soccer teams in the world will 
march onto the prettiest lawn in Pasadena today for a game watched by billions, 
celebrated and suffered by millions and survived by only 22. 
</P>
<P>
 At the site of the granddaddy of all college bowl games, it is the mother of 
all sports events, the 15th World Cup championship, at the Rose Bowl at 12:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 And the four-year wait has been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy vs. Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 European tradition vs. South American birthright. 
</P>
<P>
 Age-old chants of "Eee-tal-ya" vs. "Ohh ohh, ehh ehh, Bra-sil." 
</P>
<P>
 A belief in magic vs. a feeling of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope vs. haughtiness. 
</P>
<P>
 And Baggio vs. himself. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ponytailed wonder is unable to play because of his strained right 
hamstring, the Italians lose a man who has scored five of their six last goals. 
</P>
<P>
 They also probably lose the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians, whose scoring stars Romario and Bebeto have never been 
stronger or happier, know that. 
</P>
<P>
 And Baggio knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would feel a lot of anger, disillusion and desperation if I cannot play," 
Baggio said. "It is the dream of all the children of the world to play in the 
World Cup final. You can imagine how I feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who think Baggio is faking -- and you Brazilians know who you are -- 
should have seen him at practice Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not participate in team drills. He did not move faster than a jog 
during separate workouts. He was constantly using his hand to massage his upper 
right leg, wincing with each motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury was already serious enough to cause his removal with 20 minutes 
remaining in the semifinal game against Bulgaria, even though Italy led by only 
one goal. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been listed in the tentative starting lineup for today, but that can be 
changed up until an hour before the game. Giuseppe Signori, scoreless despite 
taking 14 shots in this tournament, will replace him if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrigo Sacchi, Italy's coach, has already announced that if Baggio doesn't 
start, he will not be brought in as one of two allowed substitutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Unspoken is Sacchi's belief that if Baggio doesn't start, by the time he comes 
in it will be too late. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am willing to take a risk," Baggio said of playing at less than full 
strength. "But I don't want to be an extra weight for the other 10 men." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians, who, like the Italians, are trying to become the first country 
to win four World Cup titles, don't seem to be feeling any weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do they have history on their side -- they defeated Italy, 4-1, in 
the 1970 World Cup final, and no European team has won a World Cup outside of 
Europe -- they have also had a great month. 
</P>
<P>
 After romping through preliminary bouts against mostly lightweights, 
outscoring opponents, 10-3, in six games with goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel 
making only 12 saves, Brazil practiced Saturday in a manner typical of its 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel played midfield and scored a goal. Romario didn't even show up. "We 
are feeling no pressure whatsoever," midfielder Mauro Silva said. "We will just 
play our normal game." 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean outstanding defense by fullbacks Aldair and Marcio Santos. And 
steady midfield play from Mazinho and Dunga. And about a goal each from Romario 
(he has five, equaling Baggio) and Bebeto (he has three). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Romario and Bebeto are the strongest pair of soccer players in the 
world today," Italian defender Luigi Apolloni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy doesn't remember what it's like to play a normal game. 
</P>
<P>
 Enduring much more difficult conditions and opponents on the East Coast than 
Brazil in the West and Midwest, Italy has reached this game only through 
opera-style dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians required a short-handed goal by Dino Baggio to defeat Norway and 
survive the first round. And two late goals by Roberto Baggio to overcome 
Nigeria in the second round. Then another last-minute goal by Roberto Baggio to 
defeat Spain in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 They have gone through 20 of their 22 players and now arrive at the finals 
without enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti are serving suspensions for 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Defender Franco Baresi hasn't played since the second game of the tournament 
because of arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Roberto Donadoni, who played one of his best games in the semifinal 
victory over Bulgaria, will play, despite a strained left hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have played against many odds," Sacchi said. "The strength of our 
character can bring out hidden forces from our players. This possibly will be 
the edge that will give us the win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians say they have plenty of other edges. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that if the Italians try to attack them as expected -- something no 
other team has done for 90 minutes in the tournament -- they are quick enough 
to run them out of the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people we've played against, it has been difficult for us to find space . 
. . but Italy will be trying to play, just like us," suspended defender 
Leonardo said. "And when they do, Romario and Bebeto will have the freedom to 
move." 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's best hope is that Brazil's most important defender, goalkeeper 
Taffarel, will choke against an offense capable of scoring twice, hitting the 
post once and forcing a great save in a span of six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only time Taffarel has faced a fast break, against the Netherlands in the 
quarterfinals, he gave up two goals in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will reach the end and there won't be a tie," Taffarel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians are hoping to simply survive until the end. And once there, that 
there will be a Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Baggio, a midfielder not related to Roberto, was certain the forward 
would start today's final even if not 100% ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only 50% of Baggio will be good enough for this team," he said.

MIKE DOWNEY: WORLD CUP USA '94: THE FINALS; IT MIGHT BE THE GAME THAT KEEPS ON 
GIVING

 Proclamation by Edward II, King of England, 1314: 
</P>
<P>
 "Forasmuch as there is a great noise in the City caused by a hustling over 
large balls, from which many evils may arise, which, God forbid, we command and 
forbid, on behalf of the King, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in 
the City in future."  
</P>
<P>
 Good afternoon, and welcome to World Cup Sunday. You are looking live at the 
beautiful Rose Bowl on a warm and pleasantly earthquake-free day here in 
Pasadena, where, in a few moments, Brazil and Italy will play before a crowd 
of, well, Brazil and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the final game of the World Cup '94 finals, finally, after an 
outstanding tournament that included 23 outstanding teams, plus Greece. We 
would like to take this moment to remind everyone that World Cup '98 qualifying 
matches will begin immediately following today's World Cup '94 championship 
matches, with England hoping to advance past the always pesky Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 And here come the Brazilians! Hand in hand, as always, led into the stadium by 
their great stars, Bebeto, Pinocchio, Romario and Julietto. Just look at these 
brave young men, so handsome in their bright blue shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Italians! Marching out in formation led by, as always, their great 
stars, Roberto Baggio, Dino Baggio, Gianluca Baggio, Giuseppe Baggio and their 
fine coach, Arrigo Baggio. Just look at these brave young men, so handsome in 
their . . . uh, wait a minute, their bright blue shirts? 
</P>
<P>
 Someone has obviously made a serious wardrobe error here today and we hope to 
correct this problem quickly, please stand by.  
</P>
<P>
 Ah, now the Brazilians peel off their blue shirts to reveal their yellow 
shirts underneath, and they offer their blue shirts to the Italians as a 
gesture of true and splendid sportsmanship. Well done! 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Italians look just a little confused, possibly because none of 
them has remembered to bring any gifts for the Brazilians in return. I can see 
the Brazil players down there now, tapping their feet impatiently, as if to 
say: "Where are our gifts, you cheap Europeans, you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, now Roberto Baggio is leafing through a little black book and handing each 
Brazilian player a slip of paper with the private home telephone number of 
Madonna. Well done! 
</P>
<P>
 Our national anthems today will be performed by Mr. Placido Domingo, still 
somewhat upset, we understand, over last night's controversial concert in which 
the great tenor Luciano Pavarotti shocked a sellout crowd with his renditions 
of Elvis Presley's "Blue Hawaii" and "Jailhouse Rock." I believe Mr. Domingo 
was outraged over this decision to sing popular music, particularly with no 
voice whatsoever in choosing the Presley compositions over Mr. Domingo's 
personal preferences for Julio Iglesias and Willie Nelson.  
</P>
<P>
 And the game begins! 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio over to Baggio, now back to Baggio, who heads it over to Baggio. Italy 
is playing cautiously at this moment, obviously saving its strength for the 
next 89 minutes and 50 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 And a yellow card goes to Leonardo of Brazil, who complains angrily that he is 
not even in the game. That's another bit of bad luck for Leonardo, who is one 
more yellow card away from another red card, which would make him ineligible to 
play soccer again until the Paraguay Bob Hope Pro-Am in late 1999.  
</P>
<P>
 Dunga steals the ball and finds Rai, who kicks it over to Bebeto, who runs 
down the field looking for Romario, who is taking a nap near that flag where 
they do the corner kicks. Bebeto kicks Romario and yells, "Wake up!" Romario 
waves Bebeto away and says, "Call me in the 80th minute if we need a goal." 
Romario rolls over and goes back to sleep.  
</P>
<P>
 Uh-oh. There goes Giuseppe Signori, one of the rare non-Baggio players on the 
Italian team, past the Snickers sign, past the Fuji sign, past the Gillette 
sign, slowing down now near the Budweiser sign, delayed for two hours by the 
American Airlines sign, now gaining new strength at the Energizer sign and 
sprinting alongside the Sprint sign.  
</P>
<P>
 Signori shoots! And scores! The ball goes past a very surprised Claudio 
Taffarel, the Brazil goalkeeper, who was leaning against a post eating a 
sandwich, not expecting anyone to shoot the ball in his direction, momentarily 
forgetting that he was not playing Sweden. Goooooooooool! 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, is hopping mad. Just look at that man 
hop. By reading his lips, I can see that Parreira is instructing his players: 
"Please, please, please, please, please score some goals so that when I go home 
everybody will like me!" Well done. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto shoots. Goooooooooool! 
</P>
<P>
 Romario shoots. Goooooooooool! 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga shoots. Goooooooooool! 
</P>
<P>
 Mazinho shoots. Goooooooooool! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that little talk by Parreira certainly did seem to help. Brazil seems 
well on its way to another World Cup championship, so much so that Romario has 
gone back into his corner for another short nap.  
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget, though, should Italy come back to tie the score in the second 
half, there will be a 30-minute overtime period to decide the winner, followed 
by penalty kicks, followed by a coin toss, followed by picking a number from 
one to 10, followed by the traditional ceremony in which the Italian men go up 
into the stands and kiss all the women.

GO SEE CAL; THERE IS NOTHING MINOR ABOUT ATTENDANCE AND PROFITABILITY OF THE 
CALIFORNIA LEAGUE'S THREE NEW STADIUMS IN RANCHO CUCAMONGA, LAKE ELSINORE AND 
ADELANTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the 1989 film, "Field of Dreams," main character Ray Kinsella hears a voice 
in his Iowa cornfield: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build it, he will come." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a baseball diamond. He was Kinsella's father. The voice was right. 
Kinsella built it, and his father's ghost did show up. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny thing is, the city fathers of Adelanto, Rancho Cucamonga and Lake 
Elsinore heard a similar voice a couple of years later. Only they heard it this 
way: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you build it, they will come." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, the voice was right.  
</P>
<P>
 They are record-breaking numbers of people who are storming the gates of three 
new ballparks on the edges of Southern California's urban sprawl. All three are 
in California League baseball towns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, it seemed, the California League was played out in a collection 
of old, tired parks in places such as Stockton, Salinas and Modesto.  
</P>
<P>
 The league's Northern Division still has old, traditional minor league parks, 
but not the Cal League's jazzed-up Southern Division. Maverick Stadium at 
Adelanto, home of the High Desert Mavericks; the Epicenter at Rancho Cucamonga 
and the Diamond at Lake Elsinore are the crown jewels of a renaissance league. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider:  
</P>
<P>
 -- In their first season in the 6,100-seat Epicenter last season, the Rancho 
Cucamonga Quakes set a Cal League attendance record of 331,005 with a last - 
place club. This year, the team is a contender and is on pace to draw 380,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Last season, the Quakes outdrew all but two Class-A teams in North America 
and all but one double-A team. Most triple-A teams would love to draw like the 
Quakes. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In its first season, the Lake Elsinore Storm is drawing just under 5,000 a 
game in its brand new Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Adelanto, in the oldest of the new Cal League parks, Maverick Stadium is 
in its fourth year and the Mavericks are drawing more than 2,500 fans a game. 
</P>
<P>
 The little parks are clean, spacious and comfortable. And they aren't cheap. 
Lake Elsinore's cost roughly $19 million, and the Epicenter, which is the main 
facility in a softball-baseball-soccer complex, cost $20 million.  
</P>
<P>
 The Diamond, with its 6,800 seats, features a sunken field, and its roofed 
concourse, in the style of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, evokes a 
turn-of-the century railroad station theme.  
</P>
<P>
 Maverick Stadium seats 5,800, has bright red and blue seats and an 
architectural style -- an above-the-seats concourse -- similar to Elsinore's 
Diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 And take note, Al Davis, all three of these minor league parks also have a 
feature the Coliseum doesn't -- suites. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent check showed Rancho Cucamonga averaging 5,700 a game, Elsinore 4,811 
and High Desert 2,591. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga, population 113,200, is in an area where 1.5 million live 
within 15 miles. Lake Elsinore, population 18,285, draws fans from southwestern 
Riverside, northern San Diego and eastern Orange counties. Adelanto, a hamlet 
of 8,517 in San Bernardino County, markets its team in the nearby high desert 
communities of Victorville, Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 And what marketing these teams do. Says Cal League President Joe Gagliardi: "I 
saw a stat that indicated 50% of the people who live in Elsinore have been to 
at least one Storm game, and that's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Crowds at all three parks show the teams and facilities are attracting every 
component of their communities, from Little Leaguers to dating teens to parents 
and grandparents.  
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, a stadium building boom is underway in minor league baseball, 
similar to that of the major leagues, where new parks have appeared in 
Arlington, Tex.; Baltimore, Chicago and Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1985, 55 new minor league 
</P>
<P>
 parks have been built," said Larry Wiederecht, information director for the 
National Assn. of Professional Baseball Leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening with attendance in those three Cal League cities is typical. 
A new Class-A league park went up in Hickory, N.C., in 1992 and attendance went 
up 577%. The lowest attendance increase we show for a team with a new park is 
19%." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Stickney bought the San Bernardino Spirit in 1986 for $250,000 and moved 
the team to Rancho Cucamonga last year. Today, he says, you couldn't buy his 
team for $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga made only one mistake with its new park -- it didn't build it 
big enough.  
</P>
<P>
 The original design was for 3,500 seats, but that was quickly raised to 6,100 
when season-ticket requests started pouring in before the park was completed. 
Now, playing regularly before capacity crowds, the Epicenter might be enlarged 
by 2,000 seats for next season.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three teams pays about $50,000 a season in rent to play in the new 
stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
 California League baseball is an owner's delight. Principal reason? Low 
overhead.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Class A is where young, newly signed players are sent to learn how to play 
professional baseball. The Quakes are a San Diego Padre affiliate, and the 
Padres pay Stickney's player salaries, which range from $1,000 to $1,200 a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of our division is that we have bare minimum travel expenses," he 
said. "Our longest road trip is an hour by bus, so we commute to all our away 
games. Our only true road trips are when we go to Northern Division cities." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal League Southern Division: Riverside, Rancho Cucamonga, San Bernardino, 
High Desert, Lake Elsinore. Northern Division: Modesto, San Jose, Bakersfield, 
Stockton, Central Valley (Visalia). 
</P>
<P>
 Stickney brags that a family can go to one of his games and spend less money 
than it would at the movies. Tickets are $3 to $6, parking $2. The team sold 
3,000 season tickets, at $225 to $350 each. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fans keep coming, win or lose.  
</P>
<P>
 "At the Class-A level, winning and losing doesn't seem to have much to do with 
attendance," said Stickney, who also owns the Las Vegas Stars of the triple-A 
Pacific Coast League. 
</P>
<P>
 "It matters at triple A, but not here," he said. "Fans here understand these 
are very young kids, just learning how to play. They see the kids playing hard, 
and they're forgiving. But at triple A, it's different. Players there are 
expected to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal with the Quakes this season is 380,000. We'll be lucky to do 380,000 
at Las Vegas, which is what we did last year and only Albuquerque (in the PCL) 
outdrew us." 
</P>
<P>
 Stickney said that besides player and staff salaries, the Padres pay for the 
Quakes' uniforms, bats and balls. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the formula for success in owning a minor league franchise is to find 
a city roughly an hour's drive from the nearest major league stadium and one 
that's eager to build a modern facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works because you're providing an alternative to a guy who doesn't want to 
drive his family 50 miles on the freeway near rush-hour time when he can see 
baseball in a place like this that's closer and much cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, I've always felt Thousand Oaks would be an ideal Cal League 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus: Class-A fans spend proportionately more money on souvenirs than 
do major league spectators, according to Stickney.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our fans are spending money on souvenirs (caps, shirts, jackets) 25% to 50% 
above their ticket costs, which is above the major league average," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gagliardi said other communities have seen the crowds at Rancho Cucamonga, 
Adelanto and Lake Elsinore, and have also heard the voice: "If you build it, 
they will come."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hearing from about a dozen groups now who are interested in obtaining 
franchises," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "A Camarillo-Oxnard group has money ready to build a park. So does 
Oceanside-Carlsbad." 
</P>
<P>
 The league's squeaky clean, new parks have suddenly endangered old, 
traditional parks.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've told some of our cities that if stadium improvements aren't made, we'll 
have to move some teams," Gagliardi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stockton's locker rooms are atrocious. Modesto's park is very old. San 
Bernardino has the same problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga's wildly successful romance with minor league baseball may 
spark ventures into other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga city officials are looking at a plan to build a 6,000-seat 
indoor arena near the Epicenter for recreational ice skating, but it would also 
serve as a venue for minor league basketball and hockey teams.  
</P>
<P>
 The Epicenter's horizons, too, are expanding. Crowds of 10,000 can be 
accommodated for concerts, and a plan is afoot to hold pro boxing shows there, 
too.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is really getting away from our plot line. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the voice in the cornfield didn't say anything about hockey.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: $1 MILLION PER YEAR IS ENOUGH; FREE ENTERPRISE? NOT 
MAJOR LEAGUE SPORTS; LET'S INVEST SOME OF THOSE BILLIONS IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the world's greatest ballplayer, Babe Ruth, got a raise one year during 
the Great Depression, his annual salary jumped to an outlandish total: $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president of the United States only makes $75,000," a hostile reporter 
reminded him one day at Yankee Stadium. "Why should you get more than Herbert 
Hoover?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruth: "I had a better year than he did." 
</P>
<P>
 All these decades later, it's a bit harder to understand why hundreds of 
athletes have begun to make not thousands but millions more than America's 
president -- whose annual salary, since 1969, has held at $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody contends that ballplayers deserve 10 or 20 times as much as a president 
-- or deserve 100 or 200 times as much as the country's many underpaid, 
hard-working teachers, nurses and others. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is it happening? 
</P>
<P>
 Why is Rafael Palmeiro getting $5,406,603 from the Baltimore Orioles for a 
six-month job? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the Dodgers handing over $2 million or more to each of eight players 
this season -- for working three hours a day -- and $3 million or more to each 
of four? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the nation's baseball, basketball and football teams paying the 
average athlete more than $1 million every year? 
</P>
<P>
 A simple, two-part answer covers all of the above: 
</P>
<P>
 * This is a sports-mad country whose many sports fans stand ready -- day and 
night -- to spend big money for tickets and for the products advertised on 
radio and TV by game sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sports teams are unusually profitable because their proprietors enjoy an 
unusual monopoly. With few exceptions, the men and women who own the 108 
National League, American League, NFL, NBA and NHL teams enjoy, in their sport, 
the only game in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Exempt from the kind of free-enterprise competition that constrains and 
disciplines other businesses, they have been able, as a result, to accumulate 
the millions of dollars that the courts have in recent years forced them to 
share with the help. 
</P>
<P>
 It follows that athletes who are skilled in the sports that fascinate America 
-- football, basketball and baseball -- are just cashing in. 
</P>
<P>
 They are no more talented than skilled volleyball players -- or 
schoolteachers. 
</P>
<P>
 They are simply cogs in the pastimes that are American passions. 
</P>
<P>
 And they should be paid accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Raise your hand if you agree: 
</P>
<P>
 No ballplayer is worth more than $1 million a year. A PLAN FOR THE '90s 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the least doubt, U.S. sports fans have cleared up two things. They will 
pay for big-league games -- paying a fortune for tickets -- but they are angry 
that so much of their money is going into the pockets of the players and 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a better idea: 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit annual salaries in team sports to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit each club's annual profits to $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Put the surplus into public education. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether accomplished as a result of fan boycotts or by governmental action 
or with the voluntary, altruistic approval of the players and owners, that is 
what ought to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 For the only time in the world's history, a nation has developed a large, 
inbred, highly trained class of high-salaried specialists -- athletes and their 
administrators -- who keep producing so much wealth that they can support 
themselves comfortably and still spare millions for the fight against 
humanity's greatest enemy: ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 Minus free-enterprise controls last year as usual, the sports industry 
generated $55 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The American scene is increasingly ironic: In an era of proportionately more 
and more money for sports, there has been proportionately less and less for 
schools, which, in so many districts, need funds for everything from 
instruction and counseling to construction and maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, in a word, a crisis calling to mind Thomas Jefferson's warning that 
the future of democracy depends on well-educated people. 
</P>
<P>
 And the choice is real: 
</P>
<P>
 Should the billions that sports generates be used, to the last dollar, to make 
the athletes and their administrators richer and richer? 
</P>
<P>
 Or should some of this vast sum -- all of it contributed by the public -- be 
used for a cause as priceless as the public's education? 
</P>
<P>
 One day, perhaps, it will be generally understood that all of the billions 
that Americans are willing to pay for sports events needn't be frittered away 
on overpaid infielders, and that a portion should be invested in America's 
under-educated school children. 
</P>
<P>
 And in time, perhaps, Americans will be able to identify major league sports 
as one of the saviors of the nation's future. SPORTS AS A LABORATORY 
</P>
<P>
 America in the '80s and '90s has been in the grip of a lie: that the basis for 
an ideal society is personal greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, that was demonstrably not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, U.S. voters kept a nice balance between individual rights and group 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 In those earlier generations, me-first people were always prominent, naturally 
-- but they weren't in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Those generations built streets and highways and schools and magnificent 
campus buildings that were the envy of the world. They launched municipal parks 
and national parks -- from Central Park to Yosemite -- that are still the envy 
of the world. And, among other group obligations, they accepted the 
responsibility for shelters, such as poor farms, where the homeless could work 
and live. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters of a more recent vintage, unhappily for America, have started to think 
of schools and parks as a burden. They have even been reluctant to repair the 
streets that others built -- or keep them clean if it costs too much -- 
although, they reason, the streets are good enough for the homeless, because, 
after all, the streets are paid for. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, America is capable of better than that. And conceivably, today's 
second basemen could show us the way to something better. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports could be the laboratory for a national experiment testing whether the 
real America is represented by the me-firsters of the '80s and '90s or by the 
kind of men and women who in the 19th and early 20th centuries built the 
schools and the nation's infrastructure in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 If it turns out that .300 hitters will hit .300 as readily for $1 million as 
for $5 million, they can help turn the tide against greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Would they play as hard -- try as hard -- for less money? It seems likely. 
Until recent years, big leaguers stood in line to play for $15,000, $17,000, 
sometimes $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Before greed changed the face of America with the ripening of the me-first 
generation in the 1980s, most ballplayers, though radically underpaid by 
today's standards, whistled while they worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in other fields have also often signaled that salary is hardly the first 
of their values. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one chief executive officer has confessed that he ranks money 
fourth, a distant fourth, to power, prestige and the fun of it all, and that he 
demanded $55 million only because he knows he's smarter than a pal getting $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one home run hitter has demanded $3.2 million only because he knows 
he's a better ballplayer than a pal getting $3.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always it turns out to be not money but pride of accomplishment, in 
combination with the thrill of the game, that drives CEOs and shortstops alike 
-- not to mention Hollywood directors, U.S. senators, managing editors, and 
other powerful or creative people. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the other day, Rickey Henderson of the Oakland A's, probably the best 
leadoff hitter of the century, said it again: "It's not the money. Ballplayers 
love the game. This is why we stick around." 
</P>
<P>
 A national experiment would doubtless show that for most people, in fact, 
money is just one of the values. SPORTS: WORLD OF CARTELS 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have suggested that rock stars, rappers and other entertainers 
ought to be grouped with pro athletes in the grossly overpaid department. 
</P>
<P>
 And many are overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a distinction to be made, though, between free-enterprise 
entrepreneurs and salaried employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most rappers are entrepreneurs. They may distress some, but their income, 
contrasted with that of a salaried employee, isn't automatic. They must please 
a number of listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 Any entertainment entrepreneur can be very good for the country. On tour, 
Madonna meets a multimillion-dollar payroll. It would be counterproductive to 
limit her income -- or to cripple any other enterprising businessman or woman 
whose vision in any field leads to more jobs for Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The history of the United States since about 1865 is conclusive that 
free-enterprise business entrepreneurs have made this the land it is. 
</P>
<P>
 But people in sports leagues are different. 
</P>
<P>
 A center fielder's salary, for example, compared to a rock star's income, 
isn't nearly as contingent on his own personal contribution. If baseball were 
as unproductive, financially, as volleyball, center fielders would be 
unrewarded, too, regardless of the richness of their talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is generally true of others on salary. An American reality is that 
even CEOs -- who, along with athletes, are so often vastly overpaid -- are 
company men. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more clearly, NFL and NBA club owners are just riding along. 
</P>
<P>
 To buy in today, they must be very rich. But once in, they make no original or 
unique contribution to the financial success of their clubs. Their role is 
simply to hire reasonably competitive talent. Their income is generated not by 
responsible business practices but by their seat in a monopoly game that 
fascinates the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Their financial success rests essentially on league membership. For, as 
business units, sports leagues are actually cartels. They are associations of 
financially non-competitive business firms maintaining similar pricing plans, 
making joint revenue arrangements, and accepting the other fruits of monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that is so, and because of the national public school crisis, would 
not America be a happier land if the pro clubs contributed some of their 
earnings to education? 
</P>
<P>
 That would work no real hardship on the teams' owners, who, in any case, earn 
a pittance at the gate compared to their clubs' annual appreciation. The 
American League's Baltimore Orioles, in a typical escalation, sold in 1979 for 
$12 million, in 1988 for $70 million, and recently for $173 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's Dallas Cowboys are already worth $50 million more than the record 
$140 million they cost in 1989, according to a Financial World survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's economists note that the value of most U.S. sports teams jumps 
about 15% a year, doubles every five years, and "will rise to unthinkable 
levels" in the next 10 years regardless of anything that their quarterback or 
shortstop or club president does. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a world, $2-million profits seem about right. 
</P>
<P>
 And in such a world, $1-million salaries are surely about right for America's 
finest athletes, most of whom, in their early 30s, must walk away -- giving it 
all up for life. 
</P>
<P>
 What's absent in such a world -- what's needed -- is a way of thinking and 
behaving that balances individual rights for Americans with group concerns for 
America. And the overriding concern is, or should be, the country's future.

 * The teams with no players making $4 million or more are the Dodgers, Angels, 
Colorado Rockies, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, San Diego Padres 
and Milwaukee Brewers. Highest paid Dodger: pitcher Tom Candiotti, $3,650,000. 
Highest paid Angel: pitcher Chuck Finley, $3,875,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * No fewer than 189 baseball players are making $2 million or more this season 
-- 100 in the American League, where the Detroit Tigers have the most, 10, and 
the Angels the fewest, three. Of the 89 National Leaguers in the $2 Million 
Club, 10 play for the Cincinnati Reds, but only two for the San Diego Padres, 
three for the Florida Marlins, and four each for the Pittsburgh Pirates, 
Montreal Expos, and Colorado Rockies.

ROMINGER, INDURAIN'S NO. 1 THREAT, WITHDRAWS FROM TOUR DE FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Indurain received a special 30th birthday present Saturday as the Tour 
de France rider billed as his toughest challenger, Tony Rominger, quit the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely able to keep up with the pack, the Swiss cyclist finally succumbed to 
diarrhea that had left him weak and dehydrated, team doctor Benjamin Fernandez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rominger got off his bicycle about 25 miles from the end of the 13th stage, 
from Bagneres de Bigorre to Albi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjarne Riis of Denmark, fifth in the Tour last year, won the stage on a late 
breakaway. The route covered a fairly flat 145 miles after two tough stages in 
the Pyrenees. 
</P>
<P>
 Indurain celebrated his birthday in the leader's yellow jersey he has become 
accustomed to wearing in three consecutive Tour victories. He kept it again 
Saturday, maintaining his overall lead although he came in nine seconds behind 
Riis in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all the standings remained unchanged, with everyone except Indurain 
moving up one place after Rominger, who was second at the start of the day, 
dropped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rominger had thought he was suffering from an intestinal virus since early 
last week and hoped the stage wouldn't be too fast and thus allow him some time 
for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 He never could get into the race. His Mapei teammates tried to lead him back 
when he was flagging, but Rominger finally spoke with his team director and got 
off his bike.

TENNIS / JERRY CROWE; TOP PLAYERS SLAM THE DOOR ON L.A.

<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's Grand Slam event winners -- Pete Sampras, Steffi Graf, Sergi 
Bruguera, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez -- have at least one 
other thing in common. 
</P>
<P>
 They all have left Los Angeles off their summer itineraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Sampras, winner of the Wimbledon and Australian Open championships, 
nor Bruguera, winner of the French Open, is entered in the Los Angeles Open 
Aug. 1-7 at the L.A. Tennis Center at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 And Graf, Sanchez Vicario and Martinez, winners of the Australian, French and 
Wimbledon titles, respectively, are passing up the Virginia Slims of Los 
Angeles Aug. 8-14 at Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' decision, made almost a year ago, to skip the only Los Angeles event 
on the ATP Tour is especially disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of four of the last five Grand Slam tournaments, including consecutive 
Wimbledon titles, Sampras, 22, is practically a native son. Although he was 
born in Washington, D.C., he grew up in the Southland, playing in Southern 
California Tennis Assn. junior tournaments and attending Palos Verdes High for 
two years before turning pro in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 An appearance this year in a tournament he won in 1991 and had entered in all 
but one year since he turned pro would have made for a triumphant homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Andre Agassi, who is entered in the L.A. Open along with, among others, 
Boris Becker, Michael Chang and two-time defending champion Richard Krajicek: 
"For one of the players not to think Pete's a level above everybody else, they 
must be hiding out somewhere and not watching any tennis at all. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "He's doing everything better than everybody else right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, scheduled to play in Washington this week and in Toronto next week, 
will take a week off before playing in two more tournaments before the U.S. 
Open, which starts Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great to have Pete, but Pete's played here so often," said Bob 
Kramer, tournament director for the L.A. Open. "Our thought is, if a guy like 
that plays every other year, it's going to be a huge deal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll work on Pete for '95." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly rivals: Agassi, asked to describe his relationship with Sampras: 
"We're just platonic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting game: Venus Williams, widely touted as the next great player in 
women's tennis, has changed her plans and will not make her WTA Tour debut in 
the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked Venus not to play and she agreed not to play," said her father, 
Richard. "She just turned 14 (on June 17). She needs to grow up a little bit 
and have time to be a little girl a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 6 feet 2 and 130 pounds, was born in Long Beach and grew up in 
Compton before moving to Florida almost three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father said she could play in the Manhattan Beach tournament if she 
maintained high marks in school, but he had second thoughts after Jennifer 
Capriati's recent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went far beyond the call of duty to secure those grades," Williams said 
of his daughter, "and I really feel (asking her not to play is) sort of unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time, once she goes out to play, even if it's as an amateur, 
her life will change. So, we want to make sure we don't change it too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his daughter probably won't make her WTA Tour debut until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Color man: Bud Collins, NBC commentator and Boston Globe columnist, didn't 
disappoint when he was enshrined this month in the International Tennis Hall of 
Fame at Newport, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 "His enshrinement wardrobe? In a word, splendid," reported Jim Greenidge of 
the Globe. "A white double-breasted sport jacket, a light blue shirt with 
contrasting tie, set off by ultra-bright orange pants, red slip-on cloth 
slippers . . . and no socks." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Collins: "The rule is that no socks should be worn between May 1 and Oct. 
1, except for the last two days of Wimbledon when I meet the Dutchess of Kent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who wears short shorts? Agassi doesn't wear short shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Agassi, asked about the baggies he and Sampras started wearing last 
month: "I think you're going to look back at tennis a few years from now and 
it's going to be like looking back at basketball when they used to wear those 
little shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look back and think, 'Wow, those don't look so good.' " Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Steffi Graf, Conchita Martinez and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario are entered in the 
Toshiba Tennis Classic Aug. 1-7 at La Costa Resort & Spa. . . . French Open 
finalist Mary Pierce has pulled out of the La Costa event and the Virginia 
Slims of Los Angeles, where Martina Navratilova will make her final Southland 
appearance. . . . Pete Sampras recently became the seventh player to pass the 
$10-million mark in career earnings, joining Ivan Lendl, Stefan Edberg, Boris 
Becker, John McEnroe, Navratilova and Graf.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; NOT MUCH CONSOLATION IN THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unleashing the offensive firepower they save for special occasions such as 
this, Sweden routed Bulgaria, 4-0, Saturday in the biggest explosion of goals 
in a World Cup third-place game since. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, let's see. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Encyclopedia of Soccer doesn't list final scores from World Cup 
third-place games. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does this massive manual on World Cup soccer entitled, well, "World 
Cup Soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Semifinal scores, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Championship final scores, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-place scores? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, serious soccer historians can't be bothered with such minutiae. Besides, 
the book deal called for 430 pages and not one page more. It was tough enough 
squeezing in the stuff about Zagalo, Zico and Dino Zoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-place games are the Michael Bolton music videos of the World Cup. Seen 
today, forgotten tomorrow. Millions of people claim to have had midfield-line 
seats for the 1986 World Cup final between Argentina and West Germany, but no 
one admits to being anywhere near the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustive research shows that France and Belgium played in that one. Played 
overtime, even -- the ultimate in windmill tilting. 
</P>
<P>
 After 120 minutes of purely scintillating soccer -- or absolutely dreadful 
soccer; no one seems to know for sure -- France won, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Parisians still rave about the wine-addled ticker-tape parade down the Champs 
Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy played in the 1990 third-place game. In Italy, the Italians won, 2-1, 
over England, and were hooted and jeered off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 For a sport so thoroughly obsessed with first place or nothing -- just ask 
Carlos Alberto Parreira, Brazil's beleaguered coach -- a match to decide who 
finishes third and who finishes fourth seems outlandishly frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, you happen to work for international soccer's governing 
body, FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA turned the stiles nearly 84,000 more times for Saturday's Sweden-Bulgaria 
game. That buys a lot of bronze medals. 
</P>
<P>
 So many, in fact, that both winners and losers received them. Same medal, same 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
 And they received them before the first ball was kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players were given their medals before the game," said Bulgaria Coach 
Dimitar Penev, who counts himself among the third-place game resistance 
movement. "Because of this, this is how they play. Four goals in 15 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria had yielded four goals in its last 480 World Cup minutes. But then, 
the World Cup was still the dream of every Bulgarian during every one of those 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the point couldn't be more moot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this game is not proper," Penev said. "It should not be. There are 
too many games to play in too short a time. There's too much stress." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Thomas Ravelli, the Swedish goalkeeper who called placing third in the 
World Cup "the greatest moment in my football career," paused to think when 
asked if the third-place game ought to be abolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say," Ravelli replied. "I mean, I think the Bulgarian team had a 
much harder match against Italy than our match with Brazil. And they had to 
play in New York, so they had jet lag and one less day to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard for them to play today. Bulgaria was not prepared for this 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, the Bulgarians face the prospect of a 9,500-mile flight home. That's 
3,000 more than it would have been had they left from New York in the first 
place, instead of from LAX in fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Bulgarians were able to put off the trip back to 
Bulgaria for three more days, so maybe the third-place game in the World Cup is 
a wonderful concept that ought to be chiseled in marble. 
</P>
<P>
 Poolside room service, Hristo. What a country.  
</P>
<P>
 They packaged the third-place game with the final, put them both inside the 
Rose Bowl and billed them as equal halves of the "Soccerfest" weekend 
extravaganza. 
</P>
<P>
 Was anybody buying it? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Swedish striker Kennet Andersson, third-place medalist, was lobbying 
hard to press onward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," he said. "Now we know that Sweden is third in the world and Bulgaria 
is fourth. We need this game to show we are better than Bulgaria." 
</P>
<P>
 Good to have that taken care of.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; ROUT BEGS QUESTION: DID SWEDES MISS WITH BRAZIL PLAN?; 
CONSOLATION: A 4-0 VICTORY OVER BULGARIA RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT TEAM'S DEFENSIVE 
STRATEGY IN SEMIFINAL LOSS.

 Coming to grips with the axiom that the best way to score is to shoot, Sweden 
loosened its tie at the Rose Bowl on Saturday and took target practice against 
road-weary Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 With no Romarios or Bebetos or Brazilian lore to intimidate them, the Swedes 
easily disposed of Bulgaria, 4-0, before a hushed crowd of 83,716 in the World 
Cup consolation match. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden returns triumphantly to Stockholm as the world's third-best team and 
the tournament's biggest paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation that has scored the most goals in the tournament, 15, was left to 
explain how it could be so aggressive on offense against Bulgaria after playing 
a shell game against Brazil in Wednesday's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes wanted the world to believe they employed the same tactics in both 
matches. The world wasn't buying it. With nothing to lose against Bulgaria, a 
carefree Sweden started four forwards, who forayed up and down the field like 
ballet dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Managing only three shots against Brazil, the Swedes pummeled the Bulgarian 
goal with 16. At the half, Sweden had built a 4-0 lead and driven goalkeeper 
Borislav Mihaylov from the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Mihaylov entered play with a 1.11 goals-against average and was a candidate 
for the Lev Yashin Award given to tournament's top goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eighth minute on Saturday, midfielder Tomas Brolin took a crossing pass 
from Klas Ingesson and headed it past Mihaylov. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 30th, after a Bulgarian foul, Brolin quick-rolled a free kick pass to 
Hakan Mild, who blew another shot past the goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37th minute, forward Henrik Larsson, Martin Dahlin's stand-in, scored 
on a breakaway made easier when Mihaylov left the box to challenge the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 39th minute, Kennet Andersson headed a crossing pass from Stefan 
Schwarz past the beleaguered Mihaylov. 
</P>
<P>
 Who were these guys? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an attacking coach, I like attacking football," a defensive Sweden Coach 
Tommy Svensson said afterward. "Scoring four goals in one half is a dream." 
</P>
<P>
 As marvelous as Sweden's run has been, questions kept returning to the Brazil 
game. If, indeed, Sweden was an attacking team, why did the gifted Larsson not 
start against Brazil? 
</P>
<P>
 "You think I am not an attacking coach?" Svensson retorted. "We are an 
attacking team." 
</P>
<P>
 If, indeed, Sweden could play this style against Bulgaria, why could it not 
against Brazil? 
</P>
<P>
 Was Sweden giving Brazil too much quarter, perhaps mistaking it as a 
powerhouse to rival Pele's 1970 World Cup championship squad? 
</P>
<P>
 "I must say that Brazil was too good for us," Brolin conceded. "When you play 
Brazil, you have to get the ball from them. It is normal that you are on the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson, seemingly reading from the same script, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil is a better team," he said. "We didn't play any different. When we got 
the ball today, we were able to expose their defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson was being kind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes dominated an obviously jet-lagged Bulgarian squad that had to fly 
cross-country Thursday from New Jersey after losing its semifinal match against 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those of us on the bench were shocked by those goals in the first 15 or 20 
minutes," Bulgaria Coach Dimitar Penev said. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was no second-half scoring, there was an exciting cat-and-mouse 
game between Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov and Thomas Ravelli, the Swedish 
goalkeeper. In a meeting of two of the best players at their positions in the 
tournament, Ravelli denied the feisty Stoitchkov time and again. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov entered the match tied with Russia's Oleg Salenko for the 
tournament goal-scoring lead, with six. Stoitchkov was bent on making the title 
his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov missed his best chance in the 85th minute, when only Ravelli stood 
in his way. But the Swede made a sliding leg save, leaving Stoitchkov to 
collapse on the field in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 Ravelli, who was playing to the crowd, offered Stoitchkov a hand up, but the 
brooding Bulgarian refused. Instead, he stormed off. 
</P>
<P>
 What could Ravelli say?. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not speak Spanish (Stoitchkov's language of preference Saturday) and he 
does not speak English," Ravelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goalkeeper had made his point. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, too, had Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a great offensive team," Andersson said. "We just met a great team in 
the semis, that's all. We showed the world today."

SECURITY IS PLAYING EVERY DAY; MCLEMORE HAS WITH ORIOLES WHAT HE DIDN'T WITH 
ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baltimore second baseman Mark McLemore returned to Anaheim Stadium last week 
with the kind of job security he wanted with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Secure with the job as the Orioles' everyday second baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 Secure with a one-year $1 million contract and the luxury of knowing he can 
test free agency after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 And secure playing for a team in the thick of the AL East race. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where McLemore is after a breakthrough season in 1993, in which he hit 
.284 with 72 runs batted in in 148 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't complain," he said sitting in the visitors' dugout at Anaheim Stadium 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been four seasons since McLemore was sitting in the other dugout. But 
now he plays without the pain in his wrist, elbow and right throwing arm that 
plagued him in three of his five seasons with the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last season, McLemore had not been a regular in the major leagues since 
early 1988, when he was the Angels' second baseman for 43 of the first 44 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 But injuries weakened his right arm, and when he failed to live up to the 
Angels' expectations in 1990, they assigned him outright from Palm Springs to 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the start of a pattern of setbacks for McLemore, who was released by 
the Indians and the Houston Astros within the next year. All told, he played 
with nine teams in four organizations in an 18-month span, including five minor 
league rehabilitation assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, I didn't really play for that many teams, considering that many 
of them were rehabilitation assignments," he said. "There were guys who were in 
the league a lot less time and had played for six or seven teams. I only played 
with three (major league) teams in that period." 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth was Baltimore, which bought his contract on July 5, 1991, shortly 
after Houston released him. The Orioles sent him to the minors, then re-signed 
him for the 1992 season as a non-roster player in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore played in 101 games that season, hitting .246 with a league-leading 
six runs batted in as a pinch hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when spring training began in 1993, McLemore, a lifetime .229 hitter, 
again had to make the team as a non-roster player. Again, he made it, and for 
the first time he could remember, he was playing everyday -- in the outfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orioles were set at second base with Harold Reynolds, so Manager Johnny 
Oates moved McLemore to right field. With the help of former Dodger Davey 
Lopes, who coaches the Oriole outfielders, McLemore became a solid defensive 
player, and his offensive marks were by far his career bests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Davey not only talks mechanics," McLemore said, "but he also helps me with 
the mental part of the game, developing the right attitude as an infielder, an 
outfielder and as a hitter. That's a big part of this game." 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore's performance last season was enough to earn a one-year deal worth 
more than $1 million, four times his 1993 salary. He becomes a free agent at 
the end of the season. Is the well-traveled McLemore ready to test the 
free-agent market? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like Baltimore," he said. "I like playing there, and I love playing 
at Camden Yards. But we'll see what happens in the next two or three months." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, McLemore returned to the infield during spring training. With 
outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds back from a neck injury this season, the Orioles 
moved McLemore back to the infield and let Reynolds leave via free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it clear who I wanted," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore was an enthusiastic volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like second base a lot more," he said. "More action." 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore said the work in the outfield last season helped strengthen his 
throwing arm. The knock on him as a second baseman is that he struggles turning 
the double play, a notion he's trying to dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know where that came from," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His offensive numbers have decreased somewhat this season. Batting mainly in 
the ninth spot, he was hitting .267 entering Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he has been particularly tough at the plate against his former team -- 
the Angels. Entering this season, he was batting .321 lifetime against them, 
and was two for four in Thursday night's game at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter feelings, perhaps? McLemore says no. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think about it much anymore because I've been through here a few 
times since I left," he said. "It was weird at first. A lot of people say I 
play harder against the Angels than I do against other teams. That's not true. 
I play hard against everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore arrived in Anaheim last Wednesday to some bad news -- he learned of 
the death of Jimmie Reese, the Angels' longtime conditioning coach and one of 
the most popular figures in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore attended Reese's memorial service Friday along with several other 
former Angels, including Nolan Ryan, Jim Abbott and Reggie Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many, many days when Jimmie got me out of a bad mood," McLemore 
said. "It wasn't just something he said or did. It was just being Jimmie. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best memory of Jimmie will always be the first thing he said to me, 
because I'll always remember how funny it was." 
</P>
<P>
 It was McLemore's first day with the Angels in 1986. Reese watched intently as 
McLemore took batting practice, then pulled the rookie aside as he headed to 
the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing he said was: "Hey Mo, come here. You know what? You look just 
like horse crap out there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reese turned and walked away. McLemore was stunned. Here was Reese, one of the 
nicest people in the game, ripping him on his first day at the office. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the punch line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmie took a few steps," McLemore said. "Then turned around and said, 'But 
you know what? You're all right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 McLemore looked toward the outfield fence at the stadium. Somebody asked him 
if Reese's jersey No. 50 should hang on the wall, along with Ryan's No. 30, Rod 
Carew's 29 and owner Gene Autry's 26, for being the team's 26th man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting it," McLemore said.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; SANTOS MAKES FOR HEAVENLY DEFENSE; BRAZIL: THE PREVIOUSLY 
UNHERALDED 24-YEAR-OLD EMERGES AS A STANDOUT ON STINGY UNIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcio Santos did not grow up in Brazil dreaming of playing defense. No one 
does. Boys in Brazil grow up wearing the No. 10 jersey, like Pele, or -- more 
fashionable this summer -- the No. 7 and No. 11, like forwards Bebeto and 
Romario. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Brazilian defenders might never become heroes in their own 
land, Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira continues to preach of their importance in 
his team's march to today's World Cup final at the Rose Bowl against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA, the international soccer federation, agrees with him. Of the four 
Brazilians named last week to its 11-man all-tournament team, two are 
defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 That one of them is Jorginho is hardly a revelation. From his professional 
base with Bayern Munich in Germany's Bundesliga, he already had emerged as one 
of the world's outstanding right backs.  
</P>
<P>
 That the other is Santos is evidence that FIFA voted based on performances in 
this tournament instead of reputations, because he did not have one. 
</P>
<P>
 The central defender from Bordeaux in France's first division did not even 
have a starting position for Brazil until Mozer and Ricardo Gomes were 
sidelined because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parreira said last week that Santos, 24, has emerged as Brazil's principle 
defender, one of the men most responsible for the fact that opponents have been 
able to place so little pressure on the team's goalkeeper, Claudio Taffarel. 
Facing only 42 shots in six games, he has been required to make only 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, it has always been thought that Brazil is suspect 
defensively," Santos said through an interpreter after a practice Saturday at 
Cal State Fullerton. "But we really believe that we wouldn't be in the final 
without the play of our back four." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 1, 169 pounds, Santos is not an intimidator. He is successful 
because of his agility, which enables him to take the ball away on the ground 
or in the air. Equally important, he is adept enough with the ball to initiate 
the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 That, he said, should not come as a surprise considering that he is Brazilian. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a young player, so I'm just happy to have a place on the team," he said. 
"I don't care who scores the goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, of course, I did start out as a midfielder." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone does in Brazil.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; TICKETS AVAILABLE, BUT . . . ; SOCCER: SEATS ALL OVER THE 
ROSE BOWL CAN BE BOUGHT FOR TODAY'S FINAL, BUT PRICES ARE GOING UP. 
</P>

<P>
 A survey of local ticket brokers on Saturday during the World Cup consolation 
game found tickets for today's final available at inflated rates and going 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest demand -- and biggest price hikes -- were for the Cup's least 
expensive tickets, Category III. 
</P>
<P>
 When contacted at about 1 p.m., a broker at Ticket Outlet's Pasadena store 
said its Category III tickets had sold out an hour earlier, selling for at 
least $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Musical Chairs tickets in Brentwood had sold out of Category III tickets 
"about five minutes ago," when contacted next, though Category II seats were 
available for $550 and two remaining Category I seats were $750. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills' Ticket Outlet location had the priciest listings, with top 
Category I tickets at $1,250. The cheapest Category I was $750. 
</P>
<P>
 The three categories of tickets for the final sold with face values of $475 
for Category I, the best seats, mostly between the goal lines; $300 for 
Category II in the Rose Bowl's corners; and $180 for Category III, primarily 
behind the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Applause Tickets in Encino had Category I beginning at $500, but was sold out 
of Category IIIs listed at $325. 
</P>
<P>
 And Good Time Tickets in Hollywood was asking $350 for Category III tickets -- 
almost double the face value -- but had Category I tickets beginning at face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices were similar at VIP tickets in Sherman Oaks, with Category I tickets 
selling for as little as $500, with IIIs beginning at $375. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Brooks ticket agency was sold out of Category I and II, but wanted $425 -- 
2 1/2 times face value -- for behind-the-goal Category III seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket Time in Los Angeles was asking a little less than most for III -- $325 
-- but had Category I in several places, with varying prices. 
</P>
<P>
 A near-list $525 could get tickets in the 60th row, but up-close seats between 
the penalty areas were $950. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Ticket Outlet, they of the $1,250 seat, wanted $450 for 
Category III. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County brokers were more likely to be sold out than L.A. brokers, 
possibly because of the heavy influx of ticket-hungry Brazilian fans into the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Night On The Town in Santa Ana was sold out, Ticket Outlet's Anaheim office 
had only Category III for $450 each or $800 for a pair, and Megan's Tickets in 
Irvine had only Category I seats remaining for $750.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; ITALIAN COACH SACCHI STAYS COOL WHILE QUELLING FIRES AROUND 
HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrigo Sacchi, Italy's shoe salesman turned coach, remembers the last World 
Cup final between Brazil and his beloved Azzurri. It was 1970 and Brazil won, 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi, then 24, was ill before the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an evening game, and in the afternoon I had a lunch of mussels and I 
got sick," he recalled Saturday. "So, I was sick in bed (during the match)." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years later, on the day before his biggest match, Sacchi was 
feeling better. As his players filed off the field at Loyola Marymount after a 
light midday workout, Sacchi stayed behind to do sit-ups and pushups. 
</P>
<P>
 Belying the building tensions of today's final, Sacchi and his players 
appeared loose during their hour training session, even as star forward Roberto 
Baggio stayed on the sidelines testing his right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very serene," Sacchi said. "We have done everything we have had to do to 
win this World Cup. We will be satisfied only with the final victory." 
</P>
<P>
 An Italian reporter wanted to know if Sacchi ever resorted to "pre-tactics," 
the practice of pregame subterfuge. In other words, is Baggio's injury a put 
on? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never done that," Sacchi declared. "I have definite plans on how we 
are going to proceed. Maybe a defensive team, or a team that is not that secure 
would try pre-tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the injuries and suspensions in Italy's lineup, the armchair 
midfielders also were talking about the return of defender Franco Baresi, who 
23 days ago had knee surgery. Baresi received rave reviews after Friday's 
practice, but Sacchi was not inclined to start him today.

EX-TITANS TAKE SHOT AT PRO BASEBALL; EXPERIENCES: COOMBES AND CLARK SAY THE 
SILVER BULLETS WOMEN'S TEAM CAME AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME FOR THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 K.C. Clark was working at a grocery store in Fullerton and Missy Coombes was 
teaching at Montclair High when they heard about the Colorado Silver Bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of them jumped at the chance to try out for the first women's 
professional baseball team to play against men. Both made the team, and now, 
halfway through the Silver Bullets' first 50-game season, they're calling this 
experience one of the best of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been anything quite like this since the All-American Girls 
Professional Baseball League of the World War II years, which was depicted in 
the 1992 movie "A League Of Their Own." And Coombes and Clark, two former Cal 
State Fullerton softball players, are enjoying being a part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 They say it has been tiring, a bit frustrating at times . . . but always fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The team already has traveled more than 21,000 miles, mostly by airplane, but 
with a few bus trips, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a great time," Clark said. "The only drawback is all the travel. 
It's probably more difficult for me than the other players because I really 
don't like to fly. If I had my choice I'd do it the John Madden way in a big 
mobile home bus." 
</P>
<P>
 Coombes echoed the woes of so much travel: "It does seem we've been living out 
of our suitcases at lot, and that's rough." 
</P>
<P>
 Any frustration comes from the fact that the team has won only twice in 25 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really been close in a lot of games, but just haven't won many," 
Coombes said. "When you come from a winning softball program at Fullerton the 
way I did, it's really hard to lose. We've lost something like seven games by 
only a run, and I know there were four games I pitched where we could have won 
with a break here or there." 
</P>
<P>
 The team is sponsored by the Coors Brewery Co. as a promotional venture. The 
Silver Bullets generally play semi-pro or all-star teams of former college and 
high school players in the area where the games are scheduled. On a couple of 
occasions, however, the Bullets came face to face with some former major 
leaguers. Oil Can Boyd pitched for one rival team and Jerry Reuss for another. 
</P>
<P>
 Coombes is enjoying her return to the mound after being away from pitching for 
11 years. She was an all-star pitcher in Little League and Pony League in her 
hometown of Arcadia. Later at Fullerton, she was an All-American softball 
player at first base, hitting .359 and driving in a team-leading 29 runs in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "My roots are really in baseball, not softball," Coombes said. "I started 
pitching to my father when I was just a little kid, and I really love baseball. 
But pitcher was never my position in softball. Softball provided me an 
opportunity to go to college and get an education, but I missed playing 
baseball. I felt a part of me was missing when I wasn't able to pitch for that 
long of a time." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Niekro, who won more than 300 games in the major leagues as a pitcher, is 
the Silver Bullets' manager. Coombes says he and his brother, Joe, the pitching 
coach, have helped her get back on track as a pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've helped me learn to set up batters with my pitches," Coombes said. "I 
knew some of that instinctively, but they've helped me refine it a lot. I've 
been throwing a slider, curve, changeup and fastball. Phil has helped me learn, 
too, that you don't have to have a lot of speed to get batters out." 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Niekro said Coombes has become one of the team's better pitchers. "We 
feel she's a solid hitter, too," he said. "We've used her as a pinch hitter 
occasionally, and once as our designated hitter." 
</P>
<P>
 Niekro also has been impressed with Clark's play defensively. "She's 
definitely our best outfielder from that standpoint," he said. Clark's problems 
have come mostly at bat. "But that's true of most of our players," Niekro said. 
"We've been doing a lot of things well, but we're having trouble getting the 
bat through the strike zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark agreed. "We've faced some nasty pitching," she said. "Hitting is more of 
an issue for us, but I think we'll do better from that standpoint with more 
game experience. This is the first year for us on this level of play, and we'll 
get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players are confident the Silver Bullets will be around for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've already told us that they'll have a team next year for sure, and 
there's been talk about maybe starting some farm teams," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said each player is being paid $20,000 for this season. "Several of the 
players on this team left jobs where they were making good money to play this 
season," she said. "They did it for the love of the game. I think there will 
always be players interested in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 There also has been some speculation that an entire women's league might 
emerge, but Coombes has her doubts that a women's league would gain as much 
interest as the women's team playing against men. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the time will come when there will be women playing on the regular 
pro teams," she said. "I don't see any reason why a woman can't be a successful 
pitcher in the regular pro leagues once they have the opportunity to develop. 
You don't have to throw the ball 90 miles per hour to be an effective pitcher." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players said they've been pleased by the reception from fans around the 
country, especially in Colorado. The Bullets have played in several major 
league stadiums before regularly scheduled games. But they've made most of 
their appearances in smaller cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has really been positive," Coombes said. "I think the fans have 
been cheering for us a lot more than for the guys. There were 33,000 fans at 
Mile High Stadium in Denver when we played a Colorado semi-pro team there on 
the Fourth of July night." 
</P>
<P>
 Both players said they've had no problems from fans or opposing players. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times the guys will come up to us after the game and tell us how 
well we played," Coombes said. "Or they'll just say something like: 'You guys 
can really play this game.' That's really been great."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; BAT TAKEN FROM BELLE MIGHT HAVE 
BEEN REPLACED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Major league security personnel Saturday investigated an apparent break-in in 
the umpires' locker room at Comiskey Park in Chicago -- one that might have 
involved a bat confiscated from slugger Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire crew chief Dave Phillips said the bat, confiscated at White Sox Manager 
Gene Lamont's request on Friday night so it could be checked for cork, was 
apparently switched and replaced with another bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a bat left, but in my opinion, it was not the bat we confiscated," 
said Phillips. He said the bat taken from Belle was cleaner and shinier than 
the one found later in the lockerroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont said after Saturday night's game that if someone did break into the 
umpire's dressing room, there must have been something wrong with the bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know if Albert Belle was corking his bat," Lamont said, "but now I 
know he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who is hitting .350 with 26 home runs and 78 runs batted in, was 0 for 
4 Saturday night with two strikeouts. He homered in Cleveland's 6-3 loss 
Thursday night, but is one for eight with four strikeouts since his bat was 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry to the umpire's locker room apparently was gained through ceiling tiles 
sometime during the sixth or seventh inning Friday night, Phillips said. The 
door was locked.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; BLYLEVEN TALKING ABOUT MAKING RETURN AS COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels had informal discussions with former All-Star pitcher Bert Blyleven 
about the possibility of bringing him back as a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven, among the Angels' most popular players during a four-year tenure, 
hopes to become a minor league pitching coach for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get back on the field," Blyleven said. "Deep down, my heart is in 
the game of baseball. And there's no place I'd rather be than here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect everybody in the front office here, and I think the future of this 
ballclub is very positive. What they need most right now is more pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Blyleven, who was providing color commentary on Saturday's telecast, was 
offered a job this year to be the Angels' roving instructor and join 
short-season Class-A Boise, but Blyleven wants to remain at one location. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to stay at one place where I can help somebody and see the 
benefits," he said. "I just love the game so much. I really enjoy teaching, and 
that's what I think I'd be best at. Then, maybe one day, I'd like to try my 
hand at managing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Andrew Lorraine, notified Friday that he would be joining the Angels 
for his first big league call-up, immediately telephoned his mother in 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he wished her a happy birthday. Then, after several more minutes, he 
casually asked when she was finally going to attend an Angel game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you come down tomorrow night?" he said. "I'll leave you tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lorraine, who graduated June 12 from Stanford with a degree in American 
Studies: "I don't think it can get much better than this.' 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine, 21, was 9-3 with a 3.24 earned-run average at triple-A Vancouver. He 
will pitch in middle relief for his first few outings, but is expected to join 
the rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel catcher Andy Allanson was informed that he must have surgery on his 
broken right index finger, and is expected to be sidelined the remainder of the 
season. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL STOPS TALKING AFTER QUESTIONING 
LASORDA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell -- who sometimes offers his opinion about how Manager Tom Lasorda 
uses him and the other relievers -- has refused to talk with reporters the last 
couple of days and said that while he is not angry, he doesn't want to talk 
anymore. Worrell did not give a reason, but his comments during the last home 
stand, when he questioned Lasorda's use of the bullpen, were not received well 
by Lasorda and, apparently, Executive Vice President Fred Claire. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he hadn't talked to Worrell about his recent comments, but offered 
a strong opinion about complaining to the media: "If a player has something to 
say, he ought to address it directly. We have a manager, a pitching coach and a 
player. They can all communicate together." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minor league report: Darren Dreifort, sidelined because of a strained right 
shoulder, is improved and is expected to throw off the mound today. . . . Chan 
Ho Park, who sat out a start because of stiffness in his back, is back in the 
rotation. Claire said he is pleased with the progress of both since they were 
sent to double-A San Antonio. Claire said Park is utilizing his fastball more 
and, though his walks are still high, is making progress. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / BOB NIGHTENGALE; NAMES AND NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * BELIEVE ME, I'VE HAD PRACTICE: Kansas City Royal starter David Cone, asked 
if he was tired when the team arrived at its hotel at 4 a.m. last week in 
Toronto: "Hey, it's not the first time I got in at 4 in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 * WELL, MAYBE FIGURATIVELY SPEAKING: Cincinnati owner Marge Schott posted a 
note in the Reds' clubhouse congratulating Barry Larkin and Jose Rijo for 
making the All-Star team, and included: " . . . As far as I'm concerned, each 
and every one of you guys on my team are All-Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Mitchell stopped, stared, and said: "If I'm an All-Star, where's my 
incentive bonus?" 
</P>
<P>
 * AND HOW WAS YOUR MONTH? Everything you wanted to know about the state of 
pitching was acutely exemplified in the last month by former Dodger Tim Leary. 
</P>
<P>
 Leary, 35, quit the triple-A Ottawa team on June 4 because the parent team, 
the Montreal Expos, wouldn't promote him. He was suspended June 7, released 
June 23, told Beverly Hills Sports Council publicist Ken Gurnick over lunch 
June 24 that he probably would retire, got a tryout with the Texas Rangers on 
June 26 at Anaheim Stadium, joined them on July 2, and was in the starting 
rotation July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Rangers are a first-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 * UH, WOULD YOU MIND COMING BACK? Oakland outfielder Geronimo Berroa, cast off 
by the Atlanta Braves and Florida Marlins, began the weekend with more RBIs, 
52, than David Justice, 45, or Gary Sheffield, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 * REVOLUTIONIZING THE GAME: The Rangers are trying to become the first team in 
history to win with pitching and defense as dreadful as theirs. They began the 
second half with a 5.51 ERA. No team has ever won a title with an ERA of more 
than 4.74. And the Rangers rank last in fielding percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've survived because of our division," Ranger General Manager Tom Grieve 
said. "We haven't survived for any other reason." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE CHEESEHEAD TRIANGLE: Milwaukee shortstop Pat Listach, the 1992 rookie of 
the year who has not played since April 24 because of tendinitis in his left 
knee, might be moved to center field when he returns. 
</P>
<P>
 He would become the seventh consecutive Brewer shortstop to lose his job 
because of an injury, joining an elite club: Robin Yount, Ernest Riles, Edgar 
Diaz, Dale Sveum, Gary Sheffield and Billy Spiers. 
</P>
<P>
 * OOPS: Yes, that John Hudek who was pitching in the All-Star game Tuesday was 
the same guy the Detroit Tigers dropped from their 40-man roster last year to 
make room for Storm Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 * GOING, GOING . . . New York Yankee starter Jim Abbott is telling friends 
that he wants to play next season for the Detroit Tigers or the Angels, not 
necessarily in that order. The Yankees know they don't have a prayer of keeping 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHY NOT GIVE IT A TRY? Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove on the best way to 
pitch to White Sox first baseman Frank Thomas: "Throw it 10 feet in front of 
the plate and hope he doesn't hit it on the first hop." 
</P>
<P>
 * NICE SCHEDULING: The Cleveland Indians and Chicago White Sox, the kingpins 
of the American League Central, are in midst of playing one another eight times 
in the next 11 days. But after July 24, they won't see each other again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish they were in September," White Sox Manager Gene Lamont said of the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 * EVERYONE CARES BUT ME: Ken Griffey Jr., asked about the importance of 
breaking Roger Maris' home run record: "I'd be proud to break the record, but 
when fans yell at me, 'You'll never break Maris' record, I'm like, 'Who cares?' 
When I was standing in the outfield in Yankee Stadium, the fans were chanting 
Marrr-isss, Marrr-isss, Marrr-isss. I just raised my hands as though to say, 
'It's out of my control.' "

BEST PART OF HIS SUCCESS STORY IS THAT GLENDENNING CAN READ IT; BASEBALL: AFTER 
LEARNING HE HAS DYSLEXIA, CRESPI HIGH GRADUATE IMPROVED HIS GRADES AND MAY LAND 
A SCHOLARSHIP.

<P>
 Mike Glendenning can thank Crespi High baseball Coach Scott Muckey for the 
guidance that has put him on the verge of receiving a baseball scholarship to 
the University of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 But Muckey's tip had nothing to do with baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning was enrolled in Muckey's physiology class during the spring of his 
junior year when the teacher noticed something seemed wrong, so he talked to 
Glendenning's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a comment something to the effect that he never saw a kid try so hard 
to do good on a test and still fail it," said Vikki Noblitt, Glendenning's 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 So Glendenning's parents had him tested for a learning disorder, and he was 
diagnosed as having a form of dyslexia. A year of tutoring later, Glendenning, 
17, has graduated from Crespi and is close to that Nevada scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hung in there," Muckey said. "That was kind of a nice success story, I 
guess you'd say." 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in four years, Glendenning is not in summer school. He is 
playing American Legion baseball for Woodland Hills West and Connie Mack ball 
for the Glendale-based Valley Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also waiting for a special permit to gain NCAA academic eligibility. He 
scored the NCAA-minimum 700 on his fifth try at the Scholastic Aptitude Test, 
but his cumulative grade-point average at Crespi was 1.9. The NCAA requires a 
2.0. 
</P>
<P>
 He is seeking the special permit based on the fact that he didn't learn he had 
dyslexia until after his junior year, and he maintained a 2.5 GPA throughout 
his senior year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning, a 6-foot, 205-pound catcher-infielder with exceptional power, 
said he expects to receive the permit within a week, and will consider Nevada's 
scholarship offer. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been hounded lately by area junior college coaches. If he chooses 
that route, he might be able to sign next spring with the St. Louis Cardinals, 
who drafted him last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning didn't have many a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 He was always a two-sport athlete, drawing attention as an All-Del Rey League 
tight end at Crespi. Glendenning considered baseball his primary sport, but 
football was the one he was able to play at Crespi. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer school each year would raise his GPA high enough in the fall to play 
football, but by spring, it had always dropped.  
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning played junior varsity baseball as a freshman, then was ineligible 
his sophomore and junior years. 
</P>
<P>
 His parents grew frustrated with his poor grades, and Glendenning grew 
frustrated with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Quit being lazy. Do your homework,' " Glendenning said. "They'd 
say, 'Go sit in your room and study for a few hours.' I'd tell them I did study 
and they'd say, 'No, you didn't because you didn't get a good grade on the 
test.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a back-and-forth thing. I'd tell them I was studying hard and 
they'd say I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Said his mother: "I thought he was just a lazy kid because if I would sit down 
with him and explain something to him, he understood and he would do well on 
the test. But if he would do his own studying, he wouldn't do well. But that 
was because he didn't understand what he was reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad now. He kept saying, 'Mom, I'm trying. I'm really trying,' and I 
wouldn't believe him." 
</P>
<P>
 As Glendenning explains it, he has trouble reading because the words sometimes 
seem out of order to him. He said he can read a paragraph fine, then the words 
in one sentence will appear out of order, and he will have to read it again. 
And again. And again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could read it, but I couldn't comprehend what I was reading," he said 
"That's why I didn't do so well on tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning's parents had him tested last spring, at a cost of nearly $1,000, 
his mother said. Once the diagnosis was made, he began hour-long tutoring 
sessions after school two or three times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the tutor's help, Glendenning became eligible to play baseball during his 
senior season at Crespi, but it wasn't all he expected. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .356 for the varsity with 11 runs batted in and one memorable home run. 
Although it was technically an inside-the-park homer because there is no fence 
in left field at North Torrance High, Muckey assures that Glendenning's shot 
"would have been out at any field. He crossed home plate before the cutoff man 
got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning's power is perhaps what impresses college coaches and scouts the 
most. This summer, he has nine homers, two in Legion ball and seven for the 
Valley Rangers. None were more important than the four he hit in six games at 
the Sierra Nevada Classic last month in Reno, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with the Rangers, Glendenning put on a power display in front of 
Nevada coaches, who had shown interest him last summer but seemed to lose it by 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did think they gave up on me," Glendenning said, "but when I went to the 
tournament they started talking to my coach and my dad. That's when things 
started happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendenning was named the tournament's most valuable player, but more 
important, he had an partial scholarship offer from the Wolf Pack, he said, 
pending his NCAA eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a kid who was lucky if he made it through a page in a book a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud that there's still a school interested," Glendenning said. "It 
shows that you shouldn't give up. No matter what, keep working hard because 
there are still opportunities."

RING MASTER; GARCIA TRAINS YOUNG BOXERS AFTER DAYS SPENT TOILING IN STRAWBERRY 
FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eduardo Garcia doesn't like his hectic schedule but he has learned to accept 
it. It's the only way for him to make a living and continue his passion for 
training young boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49-year-old father of seven and grandfather of six rises at 4:30 on 
weekday mornings and spends long, grueling days in the middle of a strawberry 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 He supervises fruit pickers and sees to it that they are productive enough to 
satisfy their employer. Garcia motivates his workers the same way he pushes 
young boxers at the La Colonia Youth Boxing Assn. each weekday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 When his day in the fields ends at about 4 p.m., Garcia hustles to the Oxnard 
Boys' Club where he runs the youth boxing program. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is old and rundown, with equipment more beat up than an old 
boxer. A couple of months ago, an insurance adjuster found that the building's 
roof was not up to code. The structure was temporarily deemed off-limits, so 
Garcia trained boxers in the back yard of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 kids participate in the program and all speak highly of Garcia, a 
heavyset man with gray hair and a mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best," said 12-year-old Fred Rodriguez. "He knows everything about 
boxing. He has taught me so much and he has really helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia participates in the training sessions, though he is physically drained 
after a day in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't speak English, but most of the boxers are Latino and understand 
what he yells in Spanish as they jab away at his padded hands. 
</P>
<P>
 During a break from the drills, Garcia knelt at ringside and watched a pair of 
sparring boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered the ring and stopped the activity to demonstrate, screaming over 
the din of punching bags and blaring Mexican music from a radio on the other 
side of the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not for him, I wouldn't be where I am right now," said 16-year-old 
Fernando Vargas of Oxnard, who earlier this year became the youngest U.S. 
National Amateur champion in the 132-pound division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody else has touched me. I've worked with him since I was 10. He molded me 
into what I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who earlier this month won a gold medal at the Olympic Festival and 
will compete in the Junior World Championships in Michigan next week, is 
considered one of the country's best hopes for a gold medal at the 1996 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 La Colonia paid Garcia's traveling expenses to the Olympic Festival, held in 
St. Louis, but he missed three days of work. The USA Amateur Boxing Federation 
will pay to send Garcia to Michigan, but once again he will not be compensated 
for missed income in the strawberry fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've won championships without him because he can't always travel, but when 
he's with me I feel unbeatable," Vargas said. "I don't know how he got that 
good, but he is good. He knows so much about boxing and he's so good at 
teaching it." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Ley, an official with the Southern California Assn. of USA Boxing, 
says Garcia is well-known among the hundreds of trainers throughout the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletes who work with him, she says, are well-disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is known as an excellent trainer," she said. "The kids he works with all 
seem to be top level." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia trains Vargas, his star pupil, six days a week for no extra pay. La 
Colonia pays him $8 an hour for a 20-hour week to run the program, but he 
spends an average of 30-to-35 hours with the boxers. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been times when the financially strapped organization, in its 35th 
year, has run out of funds and can't pay Garcia. But that has never interrupted 
his training schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of days a week, during his morning work break, Garcia picks up some 
of the kids in his truck and takes them to the beach to do roadwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who don't have a ride after the workouts often get one with Garcia. He 
says he just wants them to be the best they can in a sport he loves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money we give him doesn't begin to pay for the time he puts in," said La 
Colonia president Manuel Herrera, who boxed in the organization as a youth. 
"The kids just love him. He treats them like they are his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia got into training because of his sons. He learned to box as a 
15-year-old in Guadalajara and competed as an amateur for two years before 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I know so much about the sport, I think I would have been a pretty 
good fighter," Garcia said. "But I really didn't have the opportunities in 
Mexico that boxers have here. That's why I taught my sons." 
</P>
<P>
 He came to the United States in 1964 and found a job in a San Pedro fish 
cannery, where he saved money to bring the rest of the family to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 years later, he moved to Oxnard and in 1981 started training his two 
oldest sons at home. Garcia also has four daughters and a 6-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, 27, went 18-4 as a professional in the 135-pound division before 
retiring. Roberto, 19, a featherweight, is 13-0 and has 10 knockouts.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 29, Roberto will fight on the undercard of the Oscar De La Hoya-Jorge 
Paez World Boxing Organization lightweight title bout at the MGM Grand in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia will be ringside, as he has been for most of his sons' fights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did all the training at home, but I went to local gyms so that my sons 
could spar," Garcia said. "And that's when some of the young boxers asked if I 
could train them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've loved boxing since I was a kid. My goal now is to have a champion. I 
think Roberto can be a world champ. He has what it takes, and God willing, he 
can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia also has high hopes for Vargas, a Channel Islands High senior who has 
been compared to De La Hoya, the 1992 Olympic gold medalist. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the things Garcia hopes to gain from training a champion is the money 
to open a gym in Oxnard. Roberto often trains at De La Hoya's camp in Big Bear 
and Garcia has been offered work at a gym De La Hoya plans to open in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But he'd rather stay in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I could do that because these kids could never follow me 
there," Garcia said. "I would like my own gym so I can help some of them. A lot 
of them have great potential. I love to see that. . . . Just look at them." 
</P>
<P>
 So it appears Garcia will remain a busy man as long as he sees the fire in 
young boxers' eyes.

JEFFERSON WARNED AGAINST IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB OATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Third President Thomas Jefferson didn't live to see what some have called the 
intellectual deterioration of America -- as represented by such diverse 
indicators as fading support for the public schools, mandatory grades of B or 
better for average students in prestigious universities, and the national 
fondness for cheap television programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But he worried about it, noting that, minus a sustained commitment to a 
"scheme of education," the American democracy might not make it. 
</P>
<P>
 In our time, 200 years after Jefferson, the world's basic problem is still 
ignorance -- as caused, in part, by inadequate school funding: the area where 
financial contributions by America's professional sports leagues would help the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
 With intensive education for all, most other problems would disintegrate or 
disappear, as Jefferson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious human disputes, he observed, are in areas such as politics 
and religion, and, he said, the more knowledge that the common people have 
about either -- or about anything -- the more probable a common agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 What did Jefferson mean by education? 
</P>
<P>
 Not four years in college, necessarily. But he did insist on disciplined 
reading -- "chiefly historical" reading, he said, with some philosophy and some 
poetry. 
</P>
<P>
 "History, by apprizing (young students) of the past, will enable them to judge 
of the future," he wrote, warning that ignorance is the chief threat to life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson's study list is daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 To a student seeking particulars, he recommended, as a starter, Herodotus, 
Thucydides, Goldsmith's history of Greece, Plato's dialogues, Cicero's 
philosophies, Gibbon, Shakespeare and, among other works, Milton's "Paradise 
Lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best educated American yet, Jefferson, who lived to be 83, wasn't 
all study and no play. Two hours should be set aside each day for exercise, he 
said, suggesting a brisk 30-minute walk in the early morning and a hike of an 
hour and a half later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Games played with a ball are too violent for the body," he wrote a young 
friend. "There is no habit you will value so much as that of walking far 
without fatigue." BOB OATES

BRITISH OPEN / DAILY REPORT; PUTTER IS RETURNED, BUT CARELESS CADDIE REMAINS 
WITHOUT A JOB AT TURNBERRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news is that someone found American Greg Kraft's lost putter in time 
for him to shoot a four-under 66 Saturday at Turnberry in Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that no one has found Todd Blersch a new job. 
</P>
<P>
 Blersch was Kraft's caddie until he went out for lunch Tuesday and left the 
player's prized Arnold Palmer Wilson putter behind. The putter, at least 30 
years old, was a gift from Kraft's grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "How much is it worth?" said Kraft, who is playing in his first British Open. 
"About $2,000. I was prepared to pay anything to get it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Blersch spent the rest of Tuesday searching frantically for the putter, but 
came up empty handed. That's when Kraft decided to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it was an accident and accidents happen," Kraft said. "I know he feels 
bad, but it was so hard for me to deal with the fact that it was lost 
carelessly. I looked at him, he had puffy eyes and head down and he was 
embarrassed and hurt. But every time if I had missed a putt and looked at him, 
it wouldn't have worked. I felt it was best to put all that behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft, using a new Ping putter that he got at the Exhibition Tent, had a 69 
Thursday and a 74 Friday. He averaged more than 30 putts during each of those 
two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, after the last threesome completed play, someone handed the 
putter to a marshal on the first tee. Kraft was asked to return to the course, 
where deputy secretary George Wilson asked, "Is this the head cover to your 
putter?" Kraft said yes. "Is this your putter?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was holding back the tears," he said. "My putter is very important to my 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Blersch, his one-year tenure as Kraft's caddie appears finished. Kraft 
has hired a new caddie for the upcoming New England Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "To lose the putter two days before my first championship was devastating," 
Kraft said. "I said to Blersch I didn't know whether he would be back with me 
-- 'I'll talk to you down the road. Just now I can't bear to look at you.' " 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Scotland's Colin Montgomerie, who began Saturday one over, responded with a 65 
and now finds himself within range of the leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomerie, who set a U.S. Open record for most shirts drenched with sweat, 
birdied four of the last 10 holes on the sun-drenched, mostly windless Ailsa 
Course on Saturday. That done, Montgomerie wants to see rain and gales today, 
the more the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping for a bad day -- poor spectators -- because that's when things go 
wrong," said Montgomerie, who finished tied for second at the U.S. Open. "I 
need the weather to be very, very bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, he doesn't like his chances to win the Claret Jug. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off too far behind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a Tuesday practice round that included the foursome of Brad Faxon, Ben 
Crenshaw, Corey Pavin and Davis Love III, a bet was made. Whoever could shoot 
the first bogey-free round would win $1,000 from the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 Faxon won the wager. He has gone on to 41 consecutive holes without a bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crenshaw's the only one who's paid," Faxon said. "Print that." GENE

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; AT THE FORE ONCE AGAIN; ELY CALLAWAY HIT IT BIG WITH 
TEXTILES AND WINE. NOW IT'S GOLF. BUT THE MAKER OF THE WORLD'S BEST-SELLING 
CLUB SAYS IT'S TIME TO RETIRE AND WRITE HIS LIFE STORY. HOW CAN HE POSSIBLY 
SLOW DOWN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL DEAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Nicholson isn't talking. So the rumor lingers that he used a Callaway 
3-iron to pound his point and the windshield of a motorist's Mercedes during a 
recent traffic hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The club is probably still intact," says a laughing Jack Lemmon, who also 
swings Callaway clubs -- but in more conventional fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "God help the car." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton doesn't mind talking. He loves his Callaways. He even 
videotaped a 75th-birthday message for their creator, Ely Callaway, an unerring 
thinker with a lifelong gift for dreaming the unconceived -- and seeing his 
brainchildren uproot stuffy and disparate industries. 
</P>
<P>
 First textiles. Then wine. Now golf. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, while in his 40s and ascending at Burlington Industries, Callaway 
broke the worsted barrier. He helped introduce quality clothiers to blended 
fabrics that looked good, cost less and lasted longer. And he added personality 
and names. Like Viracle. 
</P>
<P>
 In a much more daring move for the times, Callaway hired a woman for an 
executive position. 
</P>
<P>
 Letitia Baldrige, etiquette author, columnist, and former social secretary and 
chief of staff for Jacqueline Kennedy, was that woman -- the company's first 
director of consumer affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ely charmed the socks off the grande dames of American society who were on 
the board of the Burlington House Interior Design Awards," she recalls. "When 
you consider the ladies included Nancy Reagan, Mary Lasker, Lady Bird Johnson 
and Dina Merrill, that was some group to impress." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, after being passed over for chief executive, Callaway quit the 
prestigious presidency of Burlington. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved from South Carolina to California and for a time looked like a member 
of the white-collar exodus from aerospace and computer industries headed for 
the supposed idyll of making wine. Or growing avocados. 
</P>
<P>
 This whispering Georgian, however, set his 150-acre vineyard facing a coastal 
saddle at Temecula in Southern California. Experts said fine grapes would never 
flourish there. That's the point, replied Callaway the contrarian. So when they 
do grow, the wine will be different and a guaranteed attention-getter. Within 
four years, Callaway wines -- marketed by another radical means, an all-woman 
sales force -- were receiving favorable reviews. They were sipped at the Four 
Seasons and Ma Maison and in 1976 were chosen for Queen Elizabeth's 
bicentennial luncheon at the Waldorf-Astoria. 
</P>
<P>
 Point proved and a large profit beckoning, Callaway sold his little vineyard 
in 1981 to Hiram Walker & Sons. For $14 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway -- a club championship golfer in earlier years and a distant nephew 
of legend Bobby Jones -- retired to country clubs and weekend tournaments 
around the region. The slow times didn't last. He stumbled upon a four-man 
company fumbling to stay alive making steel-core, hickory-shaft clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, it was one of the loveliest clubs I'd ever seen," he recalls. "Meant 
to look old, but performed like the best of modern clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway was fascinated. So he bought the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence Ely Reeves Callaway Jr.'s third and latest disruption of the way things 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish," begged Clinton on the birthday tape, "that you'd find a way to make 
my golf game as good as my golf clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, Callaway already has. It's in the bulbous, fat-faced Big Bertha 
metal woods this courtly, hard of hearing, Southern-canny CEO crafts at 
Callaway Golf in Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
 Lemmon, a 15-handicap hacker, says Big Bertha adds 20 yards to his tee shots 
and permits par fours that he failed in the past. When flagging tour veteran 
Johnny Miller won the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in January, he kissed 
his Callaways, then the check. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, these clubs don't make the game of golf one bit easier," Callaway says. 
As always, he is dressed in an alpaca pullover and cotton turtleneck. Almost as 
always, he is at work. "But these clubs are easier to play with, make the game 
more fun, and I call them the friendliest clubs on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, take a look at this." 
</P>
<P>
 He lifts a letter from the mid-morning mail. It carries a silver crest. It 
praises Callaway's clubs, expresses regret over a military schedule that 
interrupts golf, but also happily reports that "my handicap is now dropping to 
single figures." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter is signed "Andrew." 
</P>
<P>
 As in Andrew, Duke of York. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Callaway -- a wry rogue who travels by Concorde and Bentley Continental, 
an epicurean who prefers to rest wherever there is a Ritz, a friend of Bill's 
who attended the white-tie state banquet for Japanese Emperor Akihito and 
Empress Michiko -- is impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Andrew, of course, didn't send a manservant to Harrod's to purchase 
clubs. Clinton didn't buy his latest set. Nor did Sean Connery. All were 
freebies from Callaway, part of his endless pursuit for promotion through 
celebrity usage. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the record, the golf bag that went to Chicago before being impounded 
as potential evidence in the O.J. Simpson case was stuffed with Callaways. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it said Hertz on the bag," Callaway says. "That was part of the deal." 
</P>
<P>
 For some industry watchers, the intoxicating triumph of Callaway Golf belongs 
to a superb huckster whose marketing shtick may be more effective than his 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in love with the guy," says Robert Sauerhaft, equipment editor of 
Golf magazine. "Because Callaway's whole marketing and promotion . . . does get 
a little tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sauerhaft is among a majority of players, golf writers and equipment 
retailers who recognize Callaway clubs as the game's greatest innovation since 
balls stopped being stuffed with feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 To Callaway, there's nothing really amazing about his concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a merchant, someone who recognizes a need for an improved product, then 
creates it," he explains. "But it must be a consumer product that is 
demonstrably superior to the competition and pleasingly different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you market the hell out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 He drummed textiles. He pitched his own wines. 
</P>
<P>
 At 75, still showing a perfect corporate swing, the wry, much-married, 
sometimes impatient Callaway is now marketing the hell out of his original and 
expensive Big Bertha golf clubs, the second-generation War Birds and the newly 
released Big Bertha irons. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Bertha -- named after a World War I German cannon that tossed a shell 76 
miles -- is to golf what the oversize racquets of Head and Prince were to 
tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Yonex, a Japanese manufacturer, was first with the idea of the jumbo driver. 
But Callaway found it mushy, with room for development. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaced its graphite with stainless steel, specially forged to permit a 
hollow, stronger head with greater perimeter weighting. The result: Big Bertha 
with a head 25% larger than a conventional driver, and with a sweet spot the 
size of Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A ball gets airborne quicker. Any duffer can become a Long John Daly. 
Off-center smacks usually are forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since its birth, Bertha has become the world's best-selling 
club, with more than 3 million shipped. On the pro tours, 40% of the drivers 
are by Callaway. Since tee-off in 1983, Callaway Golf sales have gone from 
$364,000 to $255 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the operation has grown from five guys behind in the rent of one small 
plant to a 350,000-square-foot complex in a pristine industrial park -- with 
1,600 employees and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all these corporate holes in one, says Callaway, the most exhilarating 
occurred Feb. 27, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day Callaway Golf first traded as ELY -- at $20 a share -- on the New 
York Stock Exchange. Callaway sweated the opening minutes. No changes were 
posted. 
</P>
<P>
 "But 27 minutes after the market opened, the stock went up to $37," he says. 
"That thrill has been pretty damned hard to match." 
</P>
<P>
 Since its opening drive, Callaway stock has split once and hovers around $39. 
The company's market evaluation is $1.4 billion. And Ely Callaway is again a 
multimillionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funny thing is . . . there was no grand vision of three careers and big 
fortunes. I just started out one little step at a time and hoped it worked. 
Luck has a big piece of it. Not so much good luck, but the absence of bad 
luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Or the massaged luck that has brought Callaway the profit of personal 
celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Pediatric AIDS Foundation picnic last month -- Callaway is a new but 
major donor to the charity -- Goldie Hawn and Jimmy Connors sought out the 
clubmeister . Jay Leno stopped by. So did O.J. Simpson. It became clear why 
Callaway eschews publicists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, I'm Ely Callaway," says the man. "Do you play golf?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hawn plays; Connors says he is a beginner. Leno reports that he has yet to 
graduate from miniature golf. The actress and the tennis player should receive 
their clubs any day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway's office, all floor-to-ceiling windows and the right dabs of 
chrome and executive paneling, is still pretty much a family room. 
</P>
<P>
 The desk is an oaken business relic from the '50s. The captain's chair is from 
Emory University, where Callaway majored in American history because, he says, 
it was the easiest study. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever there is a corner, there are golf clubs leaning into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever there is a wall, there are framed covers and spreads from Forbes and 
Advertising Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever there is a shelf, there are color photos of Cindy, Callaway's fourth 
wife, and sepia prints of the clan Callaway of LaGrange, Ga., a two-hour drive 
southwest from Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway's favorite relative is Uncle Fuller Earle Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14th child of a twice-married, slave-owning Baptist minister, Fuller 
Callaway tasted business at age 10. He walked barefoot to town and bought six 
spools of thread for a nickel. He traipsed back into the country and resold the 
thread to farmers' wives. For a nickel a spool. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13, he was farming and selling cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 At 18, he opened Callaway's Mammoth Five and Ten Cent Store. 
</P>
<P>
 He died in 1928 after founding 23 cotton mills, banks, insurance agencies, 
department stores and development companies. 
</P>
<P>
 From such a gene pool came Ely Callaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Fuller did was great . . . and he did it in spades because in 1890 trade 
was not easy," Callaway says. "He also came from nowhere, so his is a typical, 
great, Horatio Alger story." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller was a man of homely wisdoms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man who succeeds almost always spends less than he makes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to love your work better than anything else in the world, if you 
want to make a big success." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely lives by similar one-liners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ethics is good business," he repeats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't look back because you can't do a thing about the past," is another 
favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 And: "Nepotism is a lousy way to run a business." 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway, however, knows precisely where he and Uncle Fuller differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "He built his business on principles the opposite of mine," he explains. "He 
bought as a retailer mass consumer items he knew somebody was going to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he sold them as cheaply as he could . . . so the attraction to come buy 
was price, as low as possible. And super good service." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway's paradigm was "a super, high-priced product . . . with special 
merit to offer the buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 "We sell mass-produced products to the masses in massive numbers at high 
price," he continues. Such as graphite-shafted Big Bertha clubs by the millions 
at $240 apiece. "That's the unique part." 
</P>
<P>
 It also helps to be shrewd, he believes, a risk-taker unafraid of losing and 
intolerant of excuses for not trying at business: "Costs too much . . . too 
risky . . . can't do it . . . don't know how." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Callaway is no different than the next chief executive. He is 
impatient with contemporaries who cannot match his mental pace, and he admits 
an excess of self-satisfaction. He has always been married to work, which 
explains the many wives. He drives himself from 8:30 a.m., through a chicken 
noodle soup, frozen yogurt and V-8 juice lunch at his desk, to whenever he 
decides the day is done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ely, better than most, has been able to assemble, at everything he 
has done, extremely good people," says John Marin, a founder of Sports 
Illustrated and senior adviser to Time Inc. "Then satisfy them, keep them, 
encourage them and financially reward them." 
</P>
<P>
 Flaws? 
</P>
<P>
 "He uses too much salt on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Roy Menninger, head of the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kan., 
knows Callaway as a major donor to the Menninger Foundation and as "a 
rough-hewn man whose plain-spoken bluntness has always been appealing. . . . 
There's little ceremony to him and very little pretension and pomp." 
</P>
<P>
 Flaws? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Ely would probably be every difficult to live with," Menninger 
continues. "He is . . . very much dismissive of other people or other 
attitudes. But it isn't contemptuous or disabling or negative. It's just a 
matter of: 'It's not for me and that's the end of it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To friends, colleagues, even competitors, Callaway and honesty are synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he declined to speak to UCLA's graduate school of business after 
swindler Michael Milken began lecturing there. And the university blinked. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a general feeling today that if it has to do with business, you 
don't have to apply normal standards of doing it honestly," he complains. "I 
say you don't go out and run a bunch of ads saying yours is the best product if 
it isn't. It is inexcusable to cut corners . . . and good ethics is good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Walking his plant, greeting long-termers by first names, asking a manager how 
much the company is spending on office supplies ("A half-million dollars on 
pencils and pens? I'm sorry I asked"), Callaway clearly is Boss Callaway. 
That's the way Fuller Callaway did it in the Old South. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of the first industrialists to be concerned with the social 
welfare of his workers, hence the Callaway Foundation, right there with the 
Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations," he says. "It probably has given 
something like $100 million to higher education in the state of Georgia." 
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway has given away about $15 million in his careers. His $250,000 
program to aid the development of golf in inner cities, his 40-year support of 
the United Negro College Fund, and a lump of Callaway stock now worth $8 
million donated to Emory University. 
</P>
<P>
 But the generosity is not limitless. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway denies, without exception, requests for free golf clubs for silent 
auctions, raffles or club prizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single village, hamlet and town in America has charities, 80% use golf 
tournaments to raise funds, which means thousands do it and Callaway is the 
target of all of 'em," he explains. "The moment we start donating to them, we'd 
literally have to give away everything we make. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we'd go broke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was a splendid, six-figure, surprise 75th-birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those invited to the dinner at Rancho Valencia resort, near Rancho Santa 
Fe, were Cabinet members and actors, a former wife and professional golfers, 
some of America's richest businessmen -- and Woodson Houze, 76, a classmate 
from LaGrange High School who knew Callaway as "head of everything . . . the 
school paper, the class, the debating society, all the activities." 
</P>
<P>
 And the clan Callaway, including two sons, a daughter and three grandchildren 
gathered from both coasts and several states. A hardcover book -- the First 
Book of Ely, joked a family member -- contained tributes from Vernon Jordan 
Jr., former president of the National Urban League, and portrait photographer 
Yousuf Karsh, whom Callaway once photographed. And Madonna penned an aria: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dump that Bertha, she is merely . . . a slut, a tart, an arriviste . . . give 
me an appellation and keep it classy . . . To wit: how 'bout 'Madonna's 
Mashie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It was a night of warm memories. Of a 25-year-old officer who in World War II 
became the youngest major in the history of Army procurement. Of a golf swing 
so perfect Callaway didn't need to wear spikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful thoughts were spoken. Of a first wife who attempted suicide, of a 
first daughter who lived only a few hours. Of Callaway's marriages and his 
sweet-talking mastery of the three-week romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway met it all with humor and rough dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the exception of three people, I love everyone here," Callaway told his 
guests. "When I'm gone, I'll leave you with a memo of the three names." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he asked the Ovation Orchestra to strike up "If Ever I Should Leave You" 
and made an announcement: "The B.S. may not be over, but the romancing is. 
Because I've found her." 
</P>
<P>
 He opened his arms to dance with Cindy Callaway, 45, his wife of 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he frankly discussed the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he simply chose the wrong woman, he says. Mostly he would do it all 
over again. Always he blames himself because "I was married to my job and that 
was unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he says, he was blessed -- or maybe cursed -- with a talent for 
leaving unhappy relationships before they became unhealthy. And never looking 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 And how feel the former Mrs. Callaways? 
</P>
<P>
 Says one relative: "The trail of ex-wives, to a woman, is a satisfied path." 
</P>
<P>
 Confirms second wife Jane Callaway of Darrien, Conn: "The only bad thing . . . 
he was so attractive to others. I have a tremendous affection for a very dear 
person who will always be a treasured memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing in the party talk surprised or disturbed Cindy Callaway. She knows her 
love for him, his for her, and that their only source of hostility is each 
other's driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a great match. . . . We got lucky," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve years ago, easy-mannered Cindy was a waitress at Reuben's in Orange. 
Because the restaurant sold Callaway wines, the employees were invited to a 
tour and a tasting at Temecula. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway -- then separated -- addressed the group. Cindy -- never married -- 
heard nothing but the humor, grace and knowledge of a very efficient mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was staring at me, and I said to myself: 'If he asks me out, no question I 
will go,' " she recalls. "The age difference didn't hit me at all. . . . He was 
just so much fun, so interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Callaway walked over and presented two business cards. One, he said, 
was for her to keep. The other was for her to return with her name and 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to call me," she says. "But I was home a good hour before 
he did." 
</P>
<P>
 They are a tight couple, she believes, because neither crowds the other. 
Callaway remains married to work. But she is a golfer married to a nine 
handicap and new interests in fly-fishing and skeet shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stands back while I do those things," she says. "I think we're close 
because we let each other go . . . and grow because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the Callaway name seems ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
 On wine, of course, and golf clubs. Soon, it will be the label on sporting 
apparel sold through Nordstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Callaway Editions Inc. of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 That's second son Nicholas Callaway, 41, founder and head of an upscale 
company whose publications cover fine arts, photography, travel and Madonna's 
foil-wrapped "Sex." 
</P>
<P>
 Like father, like son, Callaway Editions specializes in the improved and 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite periodic visitation after divorce ended a 17-year marriage, Nicholas 
Callaway has only "fond memories" of a childhood and adolescence with father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spiritually, emotionally, financially . . . Father was supportive in all 
those ways without being coddling," he continues. "He was always there to help 
if you needed it, but would gladly refuse something if he felt it was not 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Father paid for Harvard. But not for postgraduate studies at Yale Arts. Nor 
the cost of forming a business. "In the Callaway family," Nicholas adds, "you 
are expected to find your own path in life and pursue it on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 There is Callaway Cars of Old Lyme, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 That's first son Reeves Callaway, 47, founder and head of a specialized 
engineering firm that modifies Chevrolet Corvettes into collectibles worth 
$45,000 to $175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 There, again, the Callaway theme: Burnish and elevate a standard product into 
something exclusive and desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 Says this son of his father: "I learned from him the ability to look at the 
heart of a situation and say: 'Here is the essence, here is the kernel of what 
needs to be done. Concentrate on this. Be simple about it. And don't get bogged 
down in enormous complexities.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And one day, there may be fine writings carrying the name Lisa Callaway, 43, 
of Watertown, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa is an only daughter. She is challenged by multiple sclerosis. Despite her 
father's financial support, life among the male and high-achieving Callaways 
has always been a task. 
</P>
<P>
 She praises her father for his success, his focus and determination. Yet she 
remains wanting for some warmer communication with a parent she believes too 
often placed business before family. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always made the effort to be sensitive and affectionate . . . but the 
degree of success at that isn't always within our control," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 She understands but opposes the male privilege and patriarchal mentality 
inherent to Southern families. "Growing up as a woman in the Callaway family is 
not easy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Callaway men took France. 
</P>
<P>
 Their name was on a transporter, above a garage, on hats, jackets, polo shirts 
-- and on a Callaway Corvette entered in the famed 24 Hours of Le Mans, the 
world's longest endurance auto race. 
</P>
<P>
 The name was also all over European television and French newspapers eager to 
see what this rookie American team -- Reeves Callaway, three drivers and their 
silver, blue-striped 450-horsepower race car -- could do as the first Corvette 
entry in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ely Callaway, taking a rare break from his own business, was there to share 
his son's noisy, deadly business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really impressed about his being here," Reeves says. "Just the fact he 
said 'I'm coming' is important. He doesn't need to see us win. He doesn't need 
to see us lose. He does need to see us." 
</P>
<P>
 What Ely Callaway saw was a small automotive miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 His son's car -- built in 12 weeks and on a shoestring, given less odds than 
the San Diego Padres of reaching the World Series, certain to be overshadowed 
by Ferrari and Porsche -- won the pole in its Grand Tourisme class. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime between final practice and the start of the race, Ely Callaway began 
to understand the mystique of auto racing and its importance in elevating the 
prestige of a specialty-car builder. 
</P>
<P>
 With Reeves as his guide -- and in an arena where the son, not the father has 
eminence -- Ely met recent winners and old champions of Le Mans. He learned of 
$5-million budgets to field a factory team, of $20,000 to rent a box for the 
race, of French drivers, who believe it is bad luck to wish each other good 
luck. 
</P>
<P>
 When the race erupted, Ely Callaway toured the course by van to see cars 
become hot banshees through corners and thrash down the Mulsanne straight at 
220 m.p.h. It hurt his ears. It stirred the blood of this old risk-taker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing is that there is only a hairline between victory and your 
total destruction," he says. A Porsche hit oil in Indianapolis corner, spun, 
rammed dirt and its race was over. "You can be dead in a second. This is as 
exciting as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The Callaway Corvette did not win. But it led its class for almost 12 hours 
and there was jubilation among the team. Then, a single miscalculation -- and 
the car ran out of fuel on a dark course. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 12 hours, however, were victory enough for a father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the excellence Reeves creates in his cars, and the fame he has in this 
category," Ely Callaway says. "But it's nice to see it firsthand." 
</P>
<P>
 He also knew he encouraged his son to this. He knew he hammered home tenets of 
perseverance, honesty and self-focus. But he takes no credit for Le Mans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to see Reeves has affection for his team, and earn some rewards 
for playing everything straight," Callaway says. "He's worked hard and was 
willing to take the risk. But, God, what a risk. Much more risk than I've ever 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm damned proud that he's my son." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, believes Ely Callaway, is the time to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
 After Le Mans, he and Cindy flew to the French Riveria hideaway of 
Beaulieu-sur-Mer for their first vacation since their honeymoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway wants to write his autobiography while health and faculties are full. 
A Rancho Valencia home, a 7,000-square-foot Italian-Mediterranean villa by 
Thomas Jakway, is almost finished: all fireplaces and marble and with a 
practice green for her, a vegetable garden and orchid house for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Callaway is resuming photography -- a passionate hobby that many years ago 
placed Karsh and John F. Kennedy in front of his Hasselblad. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has built an "able, resourceful, intelligent" executive team that 
will continue, even better his work at Callaway Golf. 
</P>
<P>
 In retirement, in retrospect, has his contribution been demonstrably superior 
and pleasingly different? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I can demonstrate it to me," he says with a grin. "Although I may not 
have been pleasingly different, I guarantee you I've been different." Ely 
Callaway 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 75 
</P>
<P>
 Native: No. Born in LaGrange, Ga. Lived in New York before moving to Temecula, 
Rancho Santa Fe and Palm Springs. Building homes at Vail and Rancho Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married his fourth wife, Cindy Villa, in 1983. Two sons and one 
daughter from his first marriage. Three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics: Votes for the candidate, not the party. Supports legal abortion, 
equal-opportunity employment and physician-assisted suicide. Has been labeled a 
protectionist, but he prefers to call it "economic nationalism." 
</P>
<P>
 How he tells friends from acquaintances: Friends call him "Eee-lee"; 
acquaintances say "Ee-lie." 
</P>
<P>
 People admired: Winston Churchill for his wit, Sam Walton for rising from 
nothing, Bobby Jones for his Grand Slam golf swing and President Clinton for 
being in favor of "freedom instead of slavery, prosperity instead of poverty, 
peace instead of war . . . and his personal transgressions are in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 People disliked: Richard Nixon ("fundamentally a bad man . . . mean, petty"), 
Lee Iacocca ("vulgar and crude") and Ross Perot ("a fake, but sharp"). 
</P>
<P>
 On putting personal names on products: "It makes you try hard because you've 
got more at stake. In the case of Callaway wines, it was a plus because most 
names on wine were French or Italian." 
</P>
<P>
 On corporate public relations: "I don't need anybody. If you take the time and 
effort to make the product better than the competition, it's a publicity 
factory." 
</P>
<P>
 On learning at his father's knee: "What is good in life is good in business: 
Treat everybody right and tell the truth. No matter what you do, do your best 
and don't give up. Just try, try, try. Then try again."

LIGHTEN UP: LET YOUR INNER CHILD HAVE A NIGHT OFF; BOOKS: BARBARA GRAHAM THINKS 
THE SELF-HELP SOCIETY SHOULD RELAX. HENCE HER SATIRICAL LOOK AT NEW AGE 
CULTURE, 'WOMEN WHO RUN WITH POODLES.'

<P>
 Let's see now. 
</P>
<P>
 You've gotten in touch with your shadow, but it keeps abandoning you.  
</P>
<P>
 You've reclaimed your inner child, but your inner mom is still nagging you. 
</P>
<P>
 You've done so many past lives workshops you don't know whether you're Anne 
Boleyn or Eleanor Roosevelt or Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you start shrieking your truth, is it possible you've been overdoing 
the self-help thing? That your quest to become whole has become, well . . . an 
addiction? Consider these warning signs from Barbara Graham's book, "Women Who 
Run With the Poodles," published in June by Avon: 
</P>
<P>
 1. You think shopping is a disease. 
</P>
<P>
 2. You've fallen head over heels in love with yourself and think you make the 
cutest couple. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Most of the time you feel like a she-criminal for being too fat, short, 
smart for your own good, stupid, tall, beautiful, ugly for words. (Fill in the 
blank.) 
</P>
<P>
 4. You're sure happiness is just a Sex-for-One, Ecstatic-Shaman or 
Hugging-Your-Inner-Werewolf workshop away.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing you can do that's OK anymore," says Graham, a 46-year-old 
playwright and writer from New York, whose essays and articles have appeared in 
magazines from Self to New Age Journal. "Everything is a disease. You've got to 
exercise; you've got to go to yoga; you've got to have a low-fat diet. You have 
to go to a weekend workshop. Everybody's running around telling us what's wrong 
with us."  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" is a satirical look at what Graham calls "the New-Age 
psychoculture." For women who have had enough, Graham offers her own brand of 
self-help in chapters such as "Reclaiming Your Sacred Inner Bitch" and "Killing 
the Inner Nazi."  
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sample question from Graham's little quiz to see who's in charge:  
</P>
<P>
 When Mel Gibson got married, did you A) feel really bummed and rejected 
because you knew that if only you had visualized yourself married to Mel, today 
you would be the much-envied Mrs. G? B) think the reason he didn't marry any of 
your friends either is because they're lousy at visualizing too? C) consider 
that one reason Mel married the woman he did was because he had actually met 
her?  
</P>
<P>
 If you answered anything but C you've got a problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" has been excerpted in People and reviewed in Entertainment Weekly, 
and Graham has been appearing on dozens of morning radio and TV talk shows. 
With an initial first run of nearly 40,000 copies, the book is expected to go 
into a second printing soon.  
</P>
<P>
 She has done most of the things she parodies in her book -- yoga, dream 
workshops, growth workshops. She's always been interested in self-exploration 
and the spiritual.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so much a product of the '60s," the former hippie says. "I feel I was one 
of those people searching for the cosmic big bang of healing. Then one day I 
realized there was no big bang of healing."  
</P>
<P>
 Graham, in Los Angeles on a national book tour, is sitting in a posh suite at 
the Beverly Prescott Hotel. Dressed in a pale green T-shirt, khaki slacks and 
very expensive Joan and David suede flats, her short hair cut stylishly, she 
looks nothing like her previous counterculture self. Pinned to her jacket lapel 
is a poodle decorated with tiny rhinestones, made by a cousin for her book 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 So why poodles and not, say, Persian cats? She offers this explanation: 
"Poodles are descended from wolves, but they progress. They know the importance 
of a good haircut."  
</P>
<P>
 "Poodles" was channeled by Ethel, a lounge singer in Atlantis 50,000 years 
ago, she goes on. "When I finished a chapter, I never knew what I was going to 
write next. My only explanation is Ethel."  
</P>
<P>
 What drove Graham over the edge into clarity and the book was a workshop, she 
says. In the winter of '93, on a story assignment for Self, Graham attended a 
past lives workshop.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a scene out of Marat/de Sade. There were 26 people, and we split 
into pairs, and we're all supposed to relive a death. There's all these people 
lying on the floor, screaming and wailing. On one side this woman is being 
gang-raped by a pack of 15th-Century infidels. Then across the room a man is 
vomiting into a white plastic grocery bag. I was in medieval England, about to 
be hung. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman who's leading me is much more caught up in my story than I am. And 
she's supposed to be leading me but she's weeping hysterically." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the guide was so overcome by emotion she had to be relieved by an 
assistant. "It was ludicrous," Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graham came up with her title while joking with an editor from HarperCollins 
San Francisco, home to many New-Age authors, about Clarissa Pinkola Estes' 
best-selling 1992 book, "Women Who Run With the Wolves." Graham didn't have a 
book in mind, but when the editor asked Graham to submit a proposal, she did, 
and the book was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source at the publisher, when Estes learned about the title 
of Graham's book, she put in an angry call to Tom Grady, HarperCollins San 
Francisco's publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the publishing house was flooded with faxes and phone calls from some of 
its feminist authors. In a message to one staffer, a writer accused "Poodles" 
of "undoing the 20 years of work we've spent trying to empower women." 
</P>
<P>
 Deena Metzger, a Los Angeles therapist and prominent Harper San Francisco 
author, was one of the protesters. She says Graham not only ridicules Estes' 
book, but women in general. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take that title, and you go from wolves to poodles, implying dogs that 
are very far from wild, that are denied their essential nature in the interest 
of fashion, you are then talking about women who are the same." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every movement needs humor," says Peggy Taylor, editor of the New Age 
Journal, whose magazine ran a story on the "Poodle" controversy in its June 
issue. "What I like about Barbara's book is it's not mean humor. She's done all 
this stuff. She's adding some levity to the crazy trips we all go on."  
</P>
<P>
 But Harper San Francisco apparently didn't see the levity. Under pressure from 
what a staffer calls "the PC police" and threats that some women authors might 
bolt, the publisher demanded that Graham change the title. Graham refused, and 
Avon snapped up "Poodles" soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Grady nor Estes will discuss the affair. Estes' agent, Ned Leavitt, 
says he has nothing to say beyond what he'd told New Age Journal, which is 
this: "Why not satirize someone whose work is truly harmful instead of publicly 
making fun of a valuable healer like Dr. Estes, whose work needs and deserves 
our support?"  
</P>
<P>
 The flap has only fueled publicity for Graham's book. "Clarissa and I have 
become like the Tonya and Nancy of the New Age, only I'm not sure who's who," 
Graham says. 
</P>
<P>
 But Graham is upset by the negative reaction from Estes and other spirituality 
authors, whose work she respects. "I see this as a trickster book," she says, 
referring to an archetype in Native American culture, which Estes and many 
others revere. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're losing sight of the role of the trickster, who keeps things from 
getting too sanctimonious."  
</P>
<P>
 For all its excesses, "the New-Age psychoculture is very valuable. I have 
personally benefited from it enormously," she says. "My book is trying to get 
across a message that, run with the wolves, bleat with the sheep, but also 
value yourself the way you are."

HOT PROPERTY: SLUGGER JOINS DESERT LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Dodgers outfielder DARRYL STRAWBERRY, who joined the San Francisco 
Giants earlier this month, and his wife, Charisse, have purchased a home in 
Rancho Mirage for $1.2 million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 "He bought here because when he finished up at the Betty Ford Center he felt 
very positive about them and other people in the desert community," said 
selling agent Bill Waring of Tarbell Realtors in Palm Desert. Waring is the son 
of the late bandleader Fred Waring. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry, 32, had been living in the desert since April, when he entered a 
drug rehab program at the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage. A few days 
earlier, he announced his substance abuse problem and was put on the disabled 
list by the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 By May, his attorney, Robert Shapiro (who also represents O.J. Simpson), said 
that Strawberry, the National League's 1983 Rookie of the Year, needed to go 
somewhere away from Los Angeles, his hometown, "where some people from his past 
may not support the new direction he is trying to take." 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry and the Dodgers reached a financial settlement of about $4.86 
million on the final one-plus years of his five-year, $20.25-million contract, 
and he signed to play the remainder of the season for the Giants at what is 
believed to be the major league minimum of $109,000, prorated to about $63,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl and Charisse Strawberry were married last December despite his arrest 
in September for allegedly striking her when she was his live-in girlfriend. 
She didn't press charges and the district attorney's office determined that no 
charges were warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Strawberrys' new home had been on the market for a couple of years, 
originally at $2.2 million. The newly built house, in a gated community, has 
four bedrooms in about 5,700 square feet, with an indoor-outdoor reflection 
pond in the home's entry. There is also a sunken tennis court framed by African 
sumac trees. Last April, Strawberry's former wife, Lisa, listed her Encino home 
at just under $1 million. She and the baseball star bought the home in 1989, 
just before she filed for divorce. Eva Welsh and Bill Bennett of the Eva Welsh 
Co., Rancho Mirage, shared the listing on the house that Darryl Strawberry and 
his current wife just purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DINAH SHORE'S longtime Beverly Hills residence has come on the market at $4.2 
million. The entertainer, who died in the home last February at the age of 76, 
had owned the property for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1949, the 10,000-square-foot, seven-bedroom home has a tennis court 
on the nearly one-acre grounds, behind the Beverly Hills Hotel. There is also a 
two-bedroom guest house, gym and office on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is listed by Carole Gaba of Jon Douglas Co.'s Brentwood office. 
</P>
<P>
 Shore also had a Malibu retreat that came on the market in May. It is now 
co-listed, at $4.5 million, by Carol Rapf and Jack Pritchett of the newly 
consolidated Malibu firm of Pritchett/Rapf & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 VILLA CASABLANCA, a 16-acre Malibu estate originally listed at $20 million in 
the 1980s, has come back on the market, this time at $6.85 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned and built by Burt Burton, founder of Casablanca Fan Co., and his 
ex-wife, Marilyn, the 12,000-square-foot, five-bedroom villa is connected to an 
eight-car garage by a 125-foot-long tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also a pair of two-bedroom guest houses, a tennis court, 
entertainment pavilion, stables and motor court that can accommodate 75 cars on 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvester Stallone came close to buying the estate in 1986. He had put the 
home in escrow at $9 million but canceled the deal, due to marital problems, 
one day before it was to close, a source said. Stallone and Brigitte Nielsen, 
who were married in 1985, divorced in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Rappaport and Victoria Risko of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, 
have the listing.

GOING HOME AGAIN; SOUTHLAND RESIDENTS STICK WITH THE FAMILIAR AND BUY THE HOMES 
THEY WERE RAISED IN. 
</P>

<BYLINE>
<P>

writer and editor.

<P>
 Lionel and Pam Ochoa didn't sleep well the night they moved into their El 
Monte home. Like many new buyers, the young couple felt out of place, homesick. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't the house that upset them. The Ochoas knew it very well -- Pam 
Ochoa had grown up there. What felt strange was their new bedroom -- the same 
one Pam's mother had slept in for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we walked into the bedroom, all we could think of was Mom," Pam Ochoa 
said. "I didn't think we should be (there)." 
</P>
<P>
 "Not the best atmosphere for romance," added Lionel Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to adult life in your childhood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Southland residents who bought the house they were raised in, Pam 
Ochoa, 26, lives with warm memories of her family every day. "I liked the fact 
that we were moving into a home -- not just a house," the fourth-grade teacher 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 A childhood home, unlike other houses, comes with a built-in persona -- one 
that exudes either heartening or haunting memories. Some buyers who go home 
again feel empowered by their reminiscences and want to honor those memories by 
maintaining the family homestead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other owners say their enjoyment is tempered by guilt over adapting the house 
to their needs as well as the fear of returning to what they've outgrown. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether it's been a positive or negative experience, most family home 
buyers would agree that never before has a real estate transaction taught them 
so much about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Jacobson knew what he was getting into when he purchased his 
grandmother's Westchester home in June, 1993. After years of Sunday dinners 
there, the house was familiar territory. In Southern California, that's 
especially important: 
</P>
<P>
 When the Northridge earthquake hit "it was pitch dark, but I knew this place 
back and forth," said Jacobson, 36, who grew up just around the corner. While 
the neighbors were stumbling around without lights, Jacobson knew the house's 
layout by heart, after years of playing "Hot Wheels" along the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the earth shook, the Los Angeles Kings account executive could 
pinpoint the home's strengths and weaknesses; there was no hiding of the home's 
defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Other childhood-home purchasers echo Jacobson's relief at not having to deal 
with sellers who may mislead buyers about the condition of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are family-home buyers intimately familiar with the house's flaws, 
they know the closest supermarkets and movie theaters, the quickest way to the 
freeway. And the next-door neighbors may not need an introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal to be said for living in a community you know," said 
psychologist Dr. Irene Goldenberg, a professor at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric 
Institute. "There's a lot of stress and pressure in our society, and living in 
a familiar place can lessen those strains." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldenberg said living in a family home can inspire a sense of history, of 
belonging, which can be especially refreshing in Southern California's 
peripatetic lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Walker, a prominent community relations professional (she did not want 
her real name used), appreciated the intergenerational lesson -- the sense of 
being rooted -- that her four children received while living in their father's 
childhood home in the Fairfax district. 
</P>
<P>
 "In California, it's so rare to live in the same community, let alone the same 
house, as your grandparents," she said. "My children saw their grandparents all 
around them -- it was a very positive experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathie Swanson, who is renting her parents' Encino home, marvels that her 
2-year-old son, Evan, finds the same hiding places she did as a child. Swanson, 
34, enjoys telling Evan about his grandparents' carefully tended garden. "My 
parents' sweat is in this house, and even if we did buy it, it would always be 
their house," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson and her husband have talked about renovating the 1950s home, but so 
far they've resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson's desire to put her own mark on a house in which she was once the 
dutiful daughter illustrates what is for many family-home buyers the most 
significant challenge. "(Buying a childhood home) is similar to moving into the 
first wife's house," Goldenberg said. "You feel haunted by the way someone else 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
 Freda Garbose, 58, remembers being "afraid of losing (herself)" when she and 
her husband bought his parents' 4,500-square-foot Georgian Colonial house in 
the small Massachusetts town of Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbose had already selected a site and an architect to design her "dream 
home" when a family-business opportunity prompted a relocation in the early 
1960s. "I wanted what was mine, not someone else's. I didn't want to become my 
in-laws," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbose painted every room in the house white, updated the kitchen and added a 
master suite. In adapting her in-laws' house to the needs of her young 
children, Garbose said, "all my worries about keeping my own identity 
disappeared." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of putting a new veneer on a familiar facade appealed to South 
Pasadena resident Joanne Connor, who asked that her real name not be used to 
protect her marriage-and-family counseling practice. 
</P>
<P>
 True to her training, Connor, 41, analyzed whether she had "separated" 
sufficiently from her parents and two older sisters to move into the family's 
elegant Spanish-style home. "I wanted to know if I could come back here as an 
adult, if I had done enough work on myself to make this my home again," she 
explained. "In talking to my family, I realized that my memories would be 
comforting, not burdensome." 
</P>
<P>
 Family therapist Nancy Steiny, a former director of the Southern California 
Counseling Center, understands Connor's fears. Certain rooms of a family home, 
she says, may remind the purchaser of stinging punishments -- or of joyous 
celebrations. "It's important to put a new imprint on those rooms that carry 
bad vibes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One dramatic way to establish that new imprint is to redecorate the house, 
which can serve a dual purpose: helping to alter those bad vibes and showing 
off the new owner's personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a child of the 1960s and we believed you had to be completely different 
from your parents if you wanted to be an autonomous human being," said Walker, 
the former Fairfax resident. "But then I found myself living in my in-laws' 
house. I had to make the house reflect my tastes." 
</P>
<P>
 For some childhood-home buyers the redecorating process can produce much 
guilt. Connor, who wanted to undo all her parents' 1950s Sunset magazine decor, 
fretted over whether her sisters would resent the changes she had made; Swanson 
worried that if she altered the decor, her father would wonder what was wrong 
with the way he had it. 
</P>
<P>
 The guilt can intensify when it comes time to sell the home. Mar Vista boat 
broker Charlie Segal felt such remorse over putting his grandmother's tiny, 
Cape Cod-style house up for sale that he took it off the market and refurbished 
it so his growing family could continue living there. "I guess I had more 
attachment to it than I realized," the father of two said of the house he's 
lived in, on and off, since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Segal, 35, cited "financial convenience" -- he assumed an existing loan to 
help establish his credit -- as a primary incentive to purchase the home. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a child buys from his parents, who may no longer need a large home, 
he may be able to secure a house that's larger, more solidly constructed and in 
a better neighborhood than he could otherwise afford. For first-time buyers, a 
childhood home may be the only way to break into Southern California's real 
estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Goldenberg and Steiny urge Southlanders who are considering the purchase 
of a childhood home to sort out any anxieties before signing the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin, they advise, by talking openly with family members. Be willing to hear 
their concerns about what you'll do to the house, but remember that you're now 
an adult, with an adult's freedom of choice. Steiny recommends answering 
criticisms firmly, without losing your sense of humor: If mom sniffs that she'd 
never put that ugly green lamp on that table, simply say "it looks good to me" 
and move on. 
</P>
<P>
 In a home sale between family members, who each have well-rehearsed behaviors, 
setting parameters becomes crucial. Steiny's advice? Make it clear to parents 
or siblings that just because they used to live in the house, it belongs to you 
now. They can't just drop in. Such boundaries are hard enough to establish for 
any new homeowner, even more so in a family-home situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But with challenges come rewards: Childhood home buyers possess a unique 
opportunity to study their family's dynamics, to learn more about how childhood 
events affect them today, Steiny said. Making this kind of purchase "gives 
people the chance to think differently about who they are and what kind of life 
they want to lead," she said. "They are forced to think about how they want to 
be different from their parents."  
</P>
<P>
 Goldenberg adds that creating a ritual to mark the passage of the house from 
one generation to another helps secure those choices. Such rituals can either 
be public -- a festive housewarming party, where family and friends can check 
out the new arrangement -- or private, as in writing a poem. Holiday 
celebrations can be modified to reflect the new tenant's style. Steiny, who 
calls crafting rituals "a very freeing experience," says that by doing so, 
owners will come to see the house through an adult's, rather than a child's, 
eye -- a crucial part of the acclimation process. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopting new traditions can also help buyers accept the significant 
compromises -- of location or layout -- that often accompany a family-home 
purchase. Fond memories, according to one buyer, can make a mediocre home feel 
satisfactory. But potential buyers whose recollections aren't so rosy should 
ask themselves one key question: Is living in this house a choice I can truly 
live with? If the memories of your childhood, or your current attitudes toward 
family members, are harsh, you might want to consider a different home. 
</P>
<P>
 Freda Garbose knows well the trade-offs that come with buying a childhood 
home. She initially refused to move into her in-laws' home. But when it came 
time to sell the house 16 years later, it was Freda, more than her husband, 
Bernie, who didn't want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I felt like I was trying to fit a square peg into a round hole," 
she said, smiling at the memory. "But then I made that house my own -- and I 
wound up with the best of everything."

YOUR MORTGAGE; LIMITS ASKED ON REALTY REFERRAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major reversal of federal policy, the Clinton Administration wants to ban 
virtually all payments for referrals among employees of affiliated realty 
brokers, mortgage lenders, title insurers, escrow agents and others who provide 
real estate settlement services to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also wants to spell out the first guidelines for one of the fastest-growing 
trends in the home real estate field -- computerized loan origination systems 
(CLOs). 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton initiatives are contained in a long-awaited regulatory package 
sent to Capitol Hill for review just before Congress' July 4 recess. The 
proposals represent a rethinking of controversial policies adopted by the Bush 
Administration in its closing hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant change would prohibit referral fees paid by a real estate 
brokerage firm to employees who steer home buyers to affiliated mortgage 
lending, title or other service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current rules, such employees can be paid cash -- or be compensated in 
other ways -- for each home-buying customer who applies for a mortgage from an 
affiliated lender. The employee can also be paid for additional referrals of 
the same client to affiliated title, escrow, home inspection, casualty 
insurance or other services. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, say you're buying your new home through Ajax Real Estate Corp., a 
hypothetical brokerage firm in your area. As you're signing your home purchase 
contract, an Ajax "buyer service" representative offers you the option of 
"one-stop shopping." Rather than taking the time and effort to search the 
marketplace for a mortgage lender, a title insurance agent, a property 
inspector, an escrow or settlement agent, she suggests you sign up with Ajax 
affiliates in these fields and come away with what she says will be a 
discounted bottom-line cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving you a pre-printed federal form, the buyer service representative 
discloses the interrelationships among the affiliates. You sign up for the 
package deal, and the employee gets a cash commission of $750 -- undisclosed to 
you -- for simply directing your business to the affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 Under regulations adopted by the Department of Housing and Urban Development 
(HUD) in late 1992, Ajax is free to reward its local employees for referrals 
like this. But HUD has now concluded that paying fees to employees who are 
directly in contact with the consumer -- and who can strongly influence the 
home buyer's choices -- should be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 By giving employees a potent financial incentive to keep highly profitable 
home finance and settlement-related business activities in-house, HUD believes 
the consumer's interest may be compromised. Rather than Ajax Real Estate 
encouraging its home-buyer clients to shop for the lowest cost, best-quality 
mortgage money, title insurance and escrow services, the firm -- via its branch 
manager or buyer-service employee -- has an inevitable incentive to discourage 
aggressive outside shopping. At its worst, Ajax's "one-stop shopping" may in 
fact deliver a poor quality, overpriced package of services to the home buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new rule would prohibit all employee bonuses and commissions 
directly tied to referral volume within an affiliate network. But it would 
leave a notable exception: Real estate company employees who "do not routinely 
deal with the public" could still receive "bonuses and compensation" for the 
"generation of business among affiliates." 
</P>
<P>
 Major realtors with extensive affiliated-service networks had no immediate 
reaction to the proposal. But a trade group that represents their interest -- 
RESPRO, the Real Estate Service Providers Council -- denounced the plan. Sue 
Johnson, RESPRO executive director, said it amounts to a "dangerous intrusion 
by the federal government into employers' internal compensation practices" 
within the real estate field. 
</P>
<P>
 The second key focus of the proposed new rules -- computerized loan 
origination systems -- attempts to protect consumers from making payments for 
mortgage services they don't need or get. 
</P>
<P>
 CLOs typically are electronic, interactive systems listing loan options open 
to the borrower. Through computer terminals in a real estate broker's office, a 
home buyer can scan a menu of loan offerings from competing firms, and then 
actually apply for a mortgage. Usually a fee for CLO services is charged to the 
consumer. Lenders listing loan offerings may also pay the CLO operator -- which 
may be the realty firm -- some form of fee as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The new HUD proposal sets out detailed criteria for CLOs that qualify for 
exemption under federal anti-kickback rules. One of the requirements, for 
example, is that the CLO display competing mortgages in a "lender neutral" 
manner. Some critics of existing CLOs say they can be set up to make one 
lender's offerings appear to be best in the marketplace by omitting competitors 
with better pricing and products. 
</P>
<P>
 Another requirement that's already drawing fire is HUD's rule that "qualified 
CLOs" must allow a minimum of 20 lenders to be listed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's totally arbitrary," says Phillip Schulman, a Washington attorney who 
represents dozens of mortgage companies. "You don't need 20 sets of loan 
programs to give consumers a choice. Their heads are going to be spinning." 
</P>
<P>
 Still another controversial proposal: That CLO fees be paid by the borrower 
"outside of and before closing." Though the intent appears to be to ensure that 
consumers understand what services they're paying for, the rule would appear to 
allow CLO operators to collect the fee as little as one minute before the final 
settlement occurs.

GARDENER'S CHECKLIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Remember to keep the mower blades high -- 2 to 2 1/2 inches tall -- to give 
the lawn enough foliage to produce food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mulch heavily around the base of rose bushes and follow a regular watering 
program. Roses love deep, thorough waterings. 
</P>
<P>
 * For interest in foliage color and texture, look up coleus, dusty miller, 
creeping charlie or parrots beak the next time you're in the nursery. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trim off old flowers on summer annuals to prolong blooming. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant a kitchen plot of herbs. Many of them are perennial.

GARDENING / HOME IMPROVEMENT; WATERING GARDEN IS GETTING EASIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN CONNELLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Connelly is an Arcadia free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When gardeners used to talk about hybrids, they meant roses and dahlias. Now 
they're talking about hybrid irrigation controllers that combine solid-state 
circuitry with the easy programming of older electromechanical controllers. 
</P>
<P>
 And using these hybrids, watering your garden automatically has never been 
easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you notice about the hybrids is their distinctly retro look. 
Dials and switches have made a comeback, replacing the starkly simple digital 
key pad of solid-state controllers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our customers shied away from the key-pad-type controllers," said 
Dennis Calkins of the J. H. Mitchell Co., a landscape and irrigation supply 
firm in San Gabriel. "Dial-type hybrid controllers are definitely more 
user-friendly. The Rain Bird and Hardie companies seem to have hit the nail on 
the head with their dial-based designs." 
</P>
<P>
 A big seller at the Mitchell Co. is the Hardie Rain Dial, which can 
automatically open and close 6, 9 or 12 valves, depending on the model. An 
outstanding feature is their modular design, which allows the homeowner to pop 
out the controller from its box outdoors and bring it in the house to program 
in comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 No more uncomfortable crouching under the camellias to adjust the watering 
time. The Hardie Rain Dial also features a circuit breaker that detects 
short-circuits and flashes the number of the malfunctioning valve on the 
display panel. That could save you a lot of dead plants and trouble if a valve 
fails to open because of a short. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain Bird Corp.'s line of hybrid controllers are called ESP for "extra-simple 
programming." They are living up to their name, according to Ed Stuckey, 
manager of Modern Irrigation in Upland. "I even taught a blind woman how to 
program this one," he said of the ESP-6, which operates up to six valves. Other 
models in the ESP series operate from four to 16 valves. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain Bird hybrid controllers possess a water-budgeting feature that may be the 
most valuable new water-saving of the new hybrids. The watering time for each 
program can be adjusted up or down from 10% to 200%. Let's say that in the warm 
spring and autumn months your garden sprinklers need to run about 20 minutes to 
give your lawn a good soak and 30 minutes for the flower beds and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rain Bird's water-budgeting feature, when cooler but still dry weather 
comes, you can turn a dial, punch a button and the watering time for both 
programs can be decreased by 50%. When spring turns to summer it's easy to 
increase the water time by 10% increments until you get it just right. 
</P>
<P>
 It is just those sorts of seasonal adjustments that have always been a source 
of water waste in the garden. Homeowners tend to leave their controllers 
programmed for the hottest weather, forgetting to turn it down when the weather 
cools off. Or if they do turn the water time down, they sometimes forget to 
turn it back up when it gets got and wind up with some badly scorched plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy operation of Rain Bird's water-budgeting feature should help relieve 
this problem. Hardie's Rain Dial does not have water budgeting but their more 
expensive Total Control series does. 
</P>
<P>
 Watering hillsides has always been a difficult proposition because water often 
flows from sprinklers faster than the ground can absorb it, leading to a 
wasteful runoff. Sprinkler heads that put out fewer gallons per hour, giving 
the water a chance to soak in, are a partial solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Another improvement is to break the total watering time into more than one 
period. Hardie Dial and Rain Bird ESP controllers can both divide watering time 
into three periods, allowing you to give your hillside plantings three 
waterings of 15 minutes each, spaced an hour apart, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 During the record drought that ended this year, many homeowners installed drip 
irrigation systems to give trees and shrubs an adequate soaking. Watering times 
of up to six hours per station now are possible with the Hardie Rain Dial. Rain 
Bird's lower-priced ESP models can open a valve for up to 99 minutes at a time, 
but the higher-priced controllers in the series can water up to 10 hours at a 
time, plenty for any drip system. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of drought-tolerant plants found their way into our gardens during the 
last several dry years, many of them requiring irrigation only at widely spaced 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-fashioned controllers had trouble with these water-saving plants because 
they had to open a valve at least once a week or not at all. Rain Bird's ESP 
series still has that limitation, but the Hardie Rain Dial can allow 15 days 
between waterings, while higher-priced Hardie models can go 30 days between 
waterings. 
</P>
<P>
 One last special feature that pleases most customers is the low price of the 
new hybrid controllers. You can buy a six-station controller, either Hardie 
Rain Dial or Rain Bird ESP for less than $90. Rain Bird has a three-year 
warranty and Hardie backs its controllers with a five-year warranty.

RENT WATCH: DOES TENANT HAVE TO REVEAL HEALTH HISTORY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: What questions may an owner or manager ask about a tenant's medical 
condition? I receive Supplemental Security Income(SSI), have a Section 8 
voucher and have lived in this complex for a year without any medical incident. 
Perhaps because the nature of my disability is not obvious (I use no 
wheelchair, cane, guide dog or hearing aid), the manager has recently become 
extremely curious about the exact nature of my disability. He keeps asking for 
my medical information, which I have politely declined to provide. I have told 
him that any information necessary for my care in a medical emergency can be 
found in my wallet, and otherwise I prefer not to discuss my condition. May I 
continue to refuse to answer his intrusive question? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Yes, you may safely continue to keep your health information private. 
Under the 1988 Fair Housing Amendments Act, the landlord may ask you only the 
same questions he asks of all other tenants and prospective renters, such as 
questions related to your capability to pay the rent, to maintain your unit 
(with or without assistance) and to assume the regular responsibilities of a 
tenancy. If you occupy, or plan to occupy, housing designated for persons with 
specific disabilities, you may be asked to prove that you qualify. Otherwise, 
disclosing the exact nature of your disability is up to you. You may, of 
course, opt to provide the information for your own safety, but there is no 
requirement that you do so. If you need support in dealing with this issue, 
contact your local fair housing agency. Mobile Home Notices Changed to 90 Days 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I received a 60-day notice of a rent increase for the space I rent in a 
mobile home park. A friend told me that a new law requires a 90-day notice to 
mobile home owners before the rent increase can become effective. When I asked 
the park manager about this new law, she said she knew nothing about it, and 
that my rental agreement states that only a 60-day notice is required. I'm 
confused; who's correct, my friend or the park manager? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your friend is correct. Civil Code Section 798.30, which governs rent 
increase notices for mobile home owners, was recently amended. As of Jan. 1, 
the amount time for the written notice required for a rent increase in a mobile 
home park was changed from 60 to 90 days. Therefore, regardless of what it 
states in your rental contract, park management must give you at least 90 days 
of notice for any rent increase after the first of this year. You might ask 
your park manager to review this amended section of the Civil Code to avoid 
future problems, or you can contact a local mediation service for assistance. 
Hot Water Temperature Regulated by Code 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I don't get enough hot water in my apartment because I think the landlord 
keeps the water heater at the lowest possible temperature setting. What can I 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You should tell your landlord about the problem. Perhaps he is unaware that 
the Uniform Housing Code, used by most city governments as a guide for housing 
standards, requires that hot water be at least 110 degrees F. at the faucet. If 
this is not happening in your apartment, the landlord may be in violation of 
this code. Speak with the landlord to determine why the water temperature is 
low. If the problem continues, you may want to contact the local housing 
inspector. New Decor or Not, Kids Must Be Allowed 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can a property owner refuse to rent me and my two sons because she just 
redecorated the house with pastel wallpaper and off-white carpeting? I love the 
house, and the location, near my sons' school and day care, is perfect for us, 
but the owner only reluctantly agreed to take an application from me. She may 
not seriously be considering us because she told me that she thought children 
would be too hard on her new decor. Isn't this child discrimination? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By failing to give you and your children an equal chance to apply for the 
house of your choice, the owner may unknowingly be engaging in child or 
familial status discrimination, which is illegal under state and federal law. 
Individuals and households vary widely in their housekeeping habits and it is 
unfair to assume automatically that a household with children will be less 
careful in this regard. It is the owner's prerogative to decorate that house as 
she wishes, but not to exclude families because of the color scheme that she 
chose voluntarily. For further advice and assistance in handling this 
situation, you should contact a fair housing agency in your area. Is Work 
Exchanged for Deposit Refundable? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When I moved into my apartment, I made an arrangement with the owner 
concerning the $700 security deposit. I would pay $400 up front and provide 
$300 worth of yard work on the property; the owner said fine. But when I moved 
out, the owner said he didn't have to return the yard work portion. What can I 
do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The question here is what is a deposit. Payments do not necessarily have to 
be in cash. If you can show that you and your landlord agreed that your yard 
work had a value of $300, and that this was considered to be part of your 
security deposit, then you are entitled to its return. The owner must return 
all of the deposit, provided that the property was in the same condition as 
when you moved in, with the exception of normal wear and tear, and that you do 
not owe money for rent or other obligations. It is very important to put all 
such agreements in writing. As for now, talk it over with the owner. If he 
still refuses to refund the amount to which you feel you are entitled, call 
your local tenant/landlord mediation program for assistance. If negotiations 
fail, filing in Small Claims Court it also an option.

DOWN PAYMENTS OF LESS THAN 10% ON RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the refinancing boom over, competition among lenders is heating up to 
grab a larger share of mortgage lending to home buyers.The evidence suggests 
that lenders are willing to accept smaller down payments from home buyers, 
according to TRW REDI Property Data, a real estate information company.  
</P>
<P>
 In California, between January and April of this year, lenders advanced more 
than 95,000 conventional mortgages to home buyers, of which 15% required a down 
payment of less than 10% of the value of the property. Three years ago, only 5% 
of conventional mortgages were made with down payments of less than 10%.

DESTINATION: NETHERLANDS; ABLE TO SAIL; THEY WENT FOR THE ADVENTURE AND FOUND 
SPECIAL PRIDE IN MOMENTS OF INDEPENDENCE AND DISCOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sailing out to the Waddenzee in the north of Holland and having our vessel 
fall dry on the sand as the tide went out had not been my idea of how to spend 
a vacation. But the morning I slid down the ramp from our 1890s clipper ship 
and walked on the bottom of the sea was one of the highlights of my voyage on 
the Lutgerdina. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that several of the passengers were in wheelchairs, one was legally 
blind and some of the rest of us had other physical impairments was no obstacle 
to the crew of this sailing ship owned by Holland's Aquatic Sports Foundation 
for People With Disabilities. The wheelchairs were tied with ropes to be gently 
let down the steep incline. Strolling the sea floor, I looked with curiosity at 
the anchor that had held our flat-bottomed boat in place that night, studied 
the wormlike squiggles in the sand and marveled as the tide rolled in. Before 
the water rose too high on the wheelchairs, the crew got us all safely back on 
deck. I re-boarded the ship with a pocketful of shells and a memory I will not 
forget. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been my brother's idea to book this 13-day sailing and sightseeing tour 
of Holland. A wheelchair user due to muscular dystrophy, Richard was looking 
for an active vacation. In the early stages of MD myself, I had been asked to 
accompany him and my niece, Diana, a lively 11-year-old who served as her 
father's attendant on the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 So last June we three joined 11 Canadians and became the first U.S. citizens 
to sail the Lutgerdina since a Dutchman named Jan Olijve had dreamed of 
marketing the accessible cruises in North America four years earlier. Working 
with the Ontario March of Dimes, Olijve, the owner of JOS Sailing, had 
organized the first group of 20 Canadians in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailing holidays for the disabled are not new to the Dutch. The Lutgerdina, a 
110-foot, double-masted clipper ship built in 1897, was refitted in 1979 as an 
accessible teaching sailboat with adapted toilets, roll-in showers and a lift 
between decks. A hydraulic device allows passengers with limited hand or arm 
functions to steer the ship, and an electronic gadget instructs blind helmsmen 
on setting course. Navigation charts also are available in Braille. 
</P>
<P>
 Our trip to Holland's waterways started aboard KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. The 
seven-hour flight from New York's Kennedy International Airport to Amsterdam's 
Central Airport of Schiphol went smoothly enough except for a wait while the 
flight crew obtained a narrow-aisle wheelchair to transport my brother off the 
plane. After we encountered the same delay on our return, a KLM employee in New 
York explained that the airlines have codes to signify which wheelchair 
passengers can walk short distances by themselves and which cannot, and that 
it's a good idea to check and make sure passenger status is correctly 
understood. 
</P>
<P>
 Met at the airport by a guide from JOS Sailing, we were transported by van to 
the Lutgerdina, docked near Amsterdam's Centraal Station. Although our tour 
included all transportation, wheelchair users can ride the frequent trains 
between the airport and this rail-service hub. Except for trips to and from the 
airport, people with disabilities need to call a day in advance to obtain the 
special assistance offered by the national railways. Train timetables in 
Braille are available for the visually impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The first passengers to arrive, we got our choice of the ship's tiny sleeping 
cabins, which were outfitted with bunkbeds, a sink and wall cabinet. Two 
bathrooms with adapted toilets and roll-in showers were located at one end of 
the bunk-room area. (Since our trip, all of the Lutgerdina's cabins have been 
renovated, and all but one converted to two-person accommodations.) But even 
being squeezed three or four to a room somehow did not matter very much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who would even think you wouldn't mind living with four people in a little 
tiny cabin,' said Dorothy, a 76-year-old widow from Toronto. "Everybody on a 
boat talks their own life. The group dynamic is a good thing for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Young and old, able-bodied and disabled, sailing enthusiasts and inexperienced 
landlubber, seasoned travelers and first-time visitors to Europe, we would all 
take away our own memorable moments from the trip. Independent in her 
electric-powered scooter, Dorothy came for the sailing and found special pride 
in boarding one of Amsterdam's accessible streetcars by herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all public transportation in Amsterdam is accessible, and one of the best 
ways to see this compact city of canals, bicycles and outdoor cafes is by 
walking. But since many of the narrow streets are cobblestone and the sidewalks 
often brick, it's a good idea for wheelchair users to have someone to push them 
and to stick to the bike paths that frequently are separated from traffic. On a 
guided walking tour the morning after our arrival, we passed the palace of 
Queen Beatrix, snapped pictures of the houseboats lining the canals and 
lingered at the colorful, floating flower market near the 17th-Century 
Munttoren (Mint Tower). Not far away, people were buying and selling at 
Amsterdam's well-known flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 Our tour took us to the Rijksmuseum, home of Rembrandt's "The Night Watch" and 
other 17th-Century Dutch masterpieces. Some of the group spent the entire day 
there and at the nearby Van Gogh Museum. Both museums are wheelchair 
accessible, as is the nearby Stedelijk Museum, specializing in late 19th- and 
20th-Century art. 
</P>
<P>
 But with an 11-year-old restless with centuries-old paintings, we left the 
Rijksmuseum to visit one of Amsterdam's famed diamond factories across the 
street. Admission was free, and the visit well worth our time. A diamond cutter 
interrupted his work to explain to us the painstaking craft he had learned from 
his father about 40 years before. Like most of the Dutch we met even in small 
village shops, he spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
 Late afternoon found us in front of the Amsterdams Historisch Museum. 
Paintings, models and artifacts trace the history of this city founded as a 
hamlet on the River Amstel to its emergence as a major European capital. 
Although parts of the museum were not accessible, our only regret was that we 
did not have more time to spend there. 
</P>
<P>
 We ended the evening with an hourlong canal cruise that took us through 
Amsterdam's illuminated bridges and gave us an overview of the city by night. 
Of the many tour boats available, ours had a lift for wheelchairs. The guide 
kept up a steady spiel in Dutch and English, pointing out such landmarks and 
curiosities as Amsterdam's narrowest house (barely more than a yard wide) and 
the ornate facades of an earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day we set sail for the IJsselmeer, Holland's largest lake, which was 
closed off from the sea, and is accessible by a series of locks. Our mornings 
started with a typical Dutch breakfast of assorted breads, cheese, ham or 
salami, jelly, chocolate strands (sprinkled on bread), fruit and coffee. 
Lunches were similarly simple fare, but dinners were full home-cooked meals 
often topped off with yogurt or a kind of pudding for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Our sailing tour took us to the medieval castle Muiderslot in the small 
village of Muiden; to Hoorn, a thriving harbor town founded in the 14th Century 
that is a reminder of its boom trading days as the home of the Dutch East India 
Company; and through the canals in the flat farmlands of Friesland in the north 
of the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 On our last day at sea we anchored at Enkhuizen in North Holland, the home 
port of the Lutgerdina and one of the most picturesque of cities, with 
fortified walls and buildings dating from the 15th to 17th centuries. We spent 
part of the afternoon touring the Zuiderzee Museum, dedicated to depicting what 
village life was like on the shores of the Zuiderzee before that body of water 
was closed off from the sea in 1932 and transformed into the modern IJsselmeer. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor section of the museum is wheelchair-accessible and fascinating, 
even though the cobblestone streets and steep inclines do not make it easy to 
get around. Costumed guides in this meticulously restored town of 135 shops and 
homes help give an authentic picture of Dutch life at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bus trip the next day, we passed through polders planted with flowers and 
potatoes and saw some of the windmills the Dutch built to claim this low-lying 
farmland from surrounding lakes. After a coffee break on the dunes of the North 
Sea, we entered the stately city of The Hague, the seat of government in the 
Netherlands. We had time only to see the parliament buildings with the 
13th-Century Knights' Hall, Queen Beatrix's palace and the International Court 
of Justice, but The Hague offers a number of other attractions, including 
Holland's oldest picture gallery, and the Madurodam, a miniature Dutch village 
with exact reproductions of many of the Netherlands' most famous buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent the last three days on Robinson Crusoe Island, which is operated by 
the Aquatic Sports Foundation for People With Disabilities in the Loosdrecht 
Lakes district south of Amsterdam. Staff instructed us in the use of accessible 
canoes, kayaks and sailboats, and helped those wanting to swim or water-ski. We 
paddled through canals filled with water lilies and took a tugboat cruise in 
the rain past manor houses and castles to Breukelen (Brooklyn). 
</P>
<P>
 Transported to the Schiphol the next day with time enough to take advantage of 
the airport's large duty-free shopping area, we were ushered through customs 
and sent off with hugs and kisses. My brother asked me what I had thought of 
the trip. "It wasn't what I would have planned, but I'm glad I came," I said.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: FRANCE: VINTAGE ALSACE; THROUGH HILLS BLANKETED WITH 
VINEYARDS, THEY SEARCHED FOR WINE FINDS ALONG THE RHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT F. HOWE, Howe is a Paris-based free-lance writer and author of Paris 
Guide, to be published this fall by Open Road. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We had just pulled over to snap a picture of a centuries-old stone gateway 
marking the tiny wine village of Wangen, in northeastern France, when Eugene 
Kratz rolled out of the brush on a tractor even more weathered than his 
tattered cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Spying our camera he dismounted from his perch, took our arms and led us 
across the narrow pavement to his modest timbered home overlooking the valley 
below. He smiled like a proud father at the vineyards blanketing the nearby 
hills. Wine is the very soul of Alsace, he said in German-accented French, 
adding, as he patted his broad chest, "I made some of the very best." 
</P>
<P>
 Kratz, 82, then disappeared into his house, retrieving half a dozen brightly 
colored labels for Riesling, Tokay, Gewurztraminer and other wines that were 
bottled under his name before he retired in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few days, touring the entire 75-mile-long Alsatian Route du Vin 
that borders the Rhine River, we began to understand the wine heritage of which 
Kratz is so proud. As a bonus, we discovered that Alsace is home to marvelous 
food and among the most visually captivating regions in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the tiny hamlet of Marlenheim, a stone's throw from Kratz's 
vegetable patch and about 15 miles west of Strasbourg, near France's border 
with Germany, we tracked every inch of the regional wine road that wends south 
from near Strasbourg to Thann. En route, we passed dozens of geranium bedecked 
homes and busy village squares tucked into the dramatic eastern slopes and 
valleys of the Vosges mountains. In the distance, beyond the broad plains, the 
Rhine River sparkled. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everywhere we looked were fields of vines and cellars where vintners 
insisted we sit down to sample a choice wine or two. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent many an hour in winstubs -- the homey cafes where locals gather for 
food, drink and gossip. There we sampled traditional dishes such as tarte 
flambee topped with fromage blanc, cream, bacon and onions, and choucroute , a 
mixture of sausages, ham and bacon heaped like firewood on a bed of sauerkraut. 
</P>
<P>
 In Strasbourg alone there are several well-known and wonderful winstubs loyal 
to the region's cuisine. Among our picks both for their food and their charm 
are Maison des Tanneurs, Chez Yvonne and Le Clou. In Colmar we also liked the 
Maison des Tetes. 
</P>
<P>
 In these and other places we were happy to learn that Alsatian kitchens are 
also home to escargots and foie gras -- for which the region is famous -- and 
that we could find dishes as delicate as sole meunie re or as hearty as duck a 
l'orange.  
</P>
<P>
 In the few days before our departure from Paris where we live, my wife, Diane, 
and I studied up a bit on Alsatian wines, leafing through books and brochures. 
But our real education came at the countless wine caves that line the wine 
route itself, where free samples (degustations) are offered, often along with 
discount prices on bottles and liberal conversation in French, German and, 
occasionally, English. 
</P>
<P>
 At virtually every stop, we were told that Alsatian wines are misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is confusion between our wine and the German Rieslings, which are 
really very sweet," complained George Lorenz, 31, whose family has been making 
wine in the village of Bergheim for six generations. Alsatian wines can be 
fruity, but remain quite dry, he explained as we sipped several vintage wines 
with him in the tasting room of his main warehouse last year at this time. And 
unlike wine from other regions, which take their names from the place where 
they are produced (Bordeaux and Champagne, for example), Alsatian wines are 
named for their grapes. We saw and sampled seven primary varieties along the 
wine road -- Sylvaner, Pinot Blanc, Muscat, Tokay (or Pinot Gris), Riesling, 
Gewurztraminer and Pinot Noir. All are white except Pinot Noir. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting out early one morning from Strasbourg, we drove west toward the Vosges 
and began our search for the first leg of the Route du Vin -- not as easy a 
proposition as we had been lead to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidebooks insist that the route is well marked, but it really is not and we 
found ourselves doubling back several times over the next few days in search of 
the proper road. We were glad we had picked up a wine road map at the tourist 
office in Strasbourg. It clearly identified each village on the route so that 
we could watch for signs leading us to our next stop, even when we lost sight 
of the Route du Vin markers, which were often small and sometimes rather low to 
the ground. The same or a similar map can be found at tourist offices along the 
route and at some of the larger hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite false starts and turns, we traveled almost half the wine route the 
first day, charmed by vast vineyards stretching up the Vosges slopes and the 
tiny villages decked out with planters spilling over with brilliant geraniums, 
petunias, daisies and other summer flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Having followed the road through the town of Barr and far up the slopes of the 
Vosges, we stopped for lunch at the Hotel Arnold in Itterswiller, poised on a 
hillside overlooking the vineyards. There we ordered baeck-hoffa, a heaping 
crock of lamb, beef and pork on a stew of onions and potatoes, and coq au 
Riesling, a variation on coq au vin simmered in the local white wine rather 
than in the Burgundies that are more commonly used (about $55 for two). We 
couldn't help but feel inadequate as we struggled with the immense portions 
while an elderly yet surprisingly svelte couple at a nearby table lapped up 
equal amounts in record time. 
</P>
<P>
 About an hour and several miles later on this brilliantly sunny day, we 
checked into the 8-year-old Hotel Le Schoenenbourg in Riquewihr. 
</P>
<P>
 We were surprised that the hotel was only a few years old. Still, it was 
fabulously comfortable, reasonable at about $65 a night and perfectly located 
on the edge of the village. We took a short breather on the wood terrace, 
sipping cold beers and visiting with the manager's dog before heading off to 
explore the village itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The walled hamlet of Riquewihr was miraculously spared devastation during the 
World Wars and has carefully maintained its historic identity and guarded its 
enchanting warren of narrow cobbled lanes, flower bedecked water wells and its 
charming timbered clock tower. Still, it appeared to have lost its battle 
against legions of tourists and merchants hawking trinkets at virtually every 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 But any misgivings we felt about the village were quickly swept away that 
night, thanks to the culinary artistry of Francois Kiener, chef of the Auberge 
Le Schoenenbourg less than 100 yards from our hotel. Kiener -- who clopped from 
table to table in his clogs and chef's habit -- was trained in Burgundy and San 
Francisco and acknowledged that his was not traditional Alsatian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 For about $120 for both of us, we dined graciously on a plate laden with foie 
gras sprinkled with fresh tarragon, fennel and other herbs (heaven!), ravioli 
with prawns and sea bass with a tomato and basil confit. With the meal, we 
sipped a Riesling -- Schoenenbourg, grand cru 1990, made by the Raymond Berschy 
family whose office was 100 feet down a narrow road from where we sat in the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the wine route the next day we passed by Riquewihr en route to 
Kaysersberg, a marvelous village about five towns down tucked up in the valley 
of the Weiss River. Kaysersberg, which has the distinction of being the 
birthplace of Nobel Prize-winner Albert Schweitzer, was among the most 
captivating villages we saw and hasn't suffered the onslaught of tourists that 
afflicted Riquewihr. 
</P>
<P>
 The river courses through the edge of town, weaving among the timbered homes, 
a 12th-Century tower overlooks the village from a nearby slope and storks, the 
symbol of Alsace, have nested in several towers and on rooftops. We lunched 
leisurely on the outdoor patio of the Lion d'Or restaurant in the center of 
town and watched the lanky storks wheel overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving history behind, we next headed for Colmar, the business capital of the 
wine region. With a population of more than 63,000, Colmar boasts a fine 
14th-Century cathedral and several worthy museums, including the Unterlinden, 
which houses a variety of well-known religious paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 We settled that afternoon at the hostellerie Le Marechal, located in a quarter 
of the city known as Petite Venise (little Venice), for its narrow streets and 
canals. Le Marechal is worth a peek even if you don't stay there. It's a 
whimsical conglomeration of four 16th-Century homes that have been joined in 
recent years into a distinguished hotel overseen by the energetic Madame 
Ingeborg Bomo, her husband, Gilbert, and her intimidating Great Dane, Ferro. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms named after various composers (ours was Handel, about $130 per room; 
Wagner was the most expensive at $240) are elegantly decorated, many have 
air-conditioning and some have whirlpool tubs for the road-weary traveler. 
Though we were inclined to eat at Colmar's famous Maison des Tetes -- so named 
because of the busts and sculptures adorning the facade -- Madame Bomo and an 
appetizer of carpaccio of lamb and wild mushrooms convinced us to reconsider 
her dining terrace alongside one of the canals, where we dined well for about 
$140 on the capaccio, frog legs, duck breast and, of course, Riesling. 
</P>
<P>
 Resuming the wine route the next morning, we visited the stone towers perched 
on the hills above Husseren and briefly examined a handful of charming villages 
before acknowledging that as beautiful as the towns were, we were tiring of 
quaint hamlets, half-timbered homes and bins of geraniums. What better remedy, 
we thought, than turning toward the mountains we had skirted for so many days. 
</P>
<P>
 Having made no reservations for this last night, we relied mostly on 
serendipity and discovered the jewel of our trip: the Residence Les Violettes 
in Thierenbach, just up the mountains from Guebwiller, on the wine road. 
</P>
<P>
 Les Violettes is set in an exquisite valley with a view from virtually every 
room of the adjacent forested slopes and the onion-shaped bell tower of 
Notre-Dame de Thierenbach. Charmed by our modest room on the second floor (at 
an acceptable $90 per night), we returned downstairs and asked if we were too 
late for lunch. "We might be able to fix you a little something," we were told, 
as we were shown to an enclosed dining terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 We were stunned by the view and the elegance -- crystal goblets, fine china 
settings and bursting displays of roses. (If only we had dressed for the 
occasion, we thought -- an idea that appeared to be shared by some of the 
better dressed patrons eyeing us over their desserts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired, we launched into a midday meal of veal medallions blanketed with 
morels and a collection of fish fillets that included salmon, bass and other 
delights. With it, we ordered one of the more full-bodied Pinot Noirs, a 1990 
from Dorpf & Irion, a vintner from Riquewihr. The bells of the church chimed as 
if on cue. We hardly noticed the $85 bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to make room for dinner, we asked about the many paths that led into the 
forest behind the hotel and were shown a map of the terrain with instructions 
simple enough that even we could follow them. Two hours later, we returned to 
the outdoor patio set off a few yards from the main house, where a young waiter 
took our orders for afternoon cocktails. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that the next morning we would complete our trip down the remaining 
few miles of the wine road, we threw caution and our checkbook to the wind. For 
a stunning (but well-invested) $180, we dined on frog legs in garlic and duck 
breast a l'orange, followed by an assortment of mousses and ices doused with 
raspberry sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for the feast goes to Jean Pierre Munsch, the owner, chef and main 
attraction. Taking a few minutes away from the kitchen, he walked us to a 
well-camouflaged garage where he keeps many of his 21 vintage cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Munsch singled out a blue 1925 Citroen B12 coupe with leather seats. "My 
parents had one of those when I was young," said Munsch, now 64. "Later, when I 
saw one, I bought it and repaired it." 
</P>
<P>
 But his favorite: a six-cylinder 1931 Citroen Roadster, painted a sky blue, 
with deep-water blue detailing and a leather canopy that folds back so 
passengers can enjoy the open air. He climbed in, pushed a button, fretted with 
the choke and vroooooom. "C a marche!" he exclaimed. GUIDEBOOK: Alsatian Wine

BACKPACK & BUDGET; ROLLIN' ALONG THE ST. LAWRENCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Budget travelers are being offered a unique opportunity for exploring French 
Canada this summer: sailing through one of North America's best whale-watching 
areas on a traditional schooner and spending nights en route on the boat or at 
youth hostels. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips on the St. Lawrence River are arranged by Voyages Temps Libre, a travel 
company affiliated with the Quebec branch of the Canadian Hostelling Assn. The 
ship, "La Licorne," was constructed using plans dating from 1895. 
</P>
<P>
 On board, bilingual guides provide information on the flora, fauna, marine 
mammals and rich marine history of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship will make eight-day tours between Riviere-du-Loup and Cap-aux-Os, 
Gaspe. One whale-watching stop, Tadoussac, situated where the Saguenay River 
joins the St. Lawrence, has very deep water and is rich with shrimp and tiny 
fish called capelin. Finback, humpback, white beluga and even great blue whales 
are known to feed in this area. 
</P>
<P>
 You can join up for the full eight days or take portions of the trip: A 
half-day is $23, full-day $35 or sunset cruise $15 from Riviere-du-Loup. Or 
travel for one to seven days between different points. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day tour costs $385, including breakfast, four nights in hostels, 
four nights on the boat, all taxes, services of a qualified sailing team and a 
bilingual biologist-guide. Lunches, dinners and bedding are not included. 
</P>
<P>
 Departures from Riviere-du-Loup are scheduled for Aug. 2 and Aug. 23. 
Departures from Cap-aux-Os are scheduled for July 21, Aug. 11 and Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>

youth hostel, and is within walking distance of shops and entertainment, at 
1030 rue MacKay, H3G 2H1; tel. (514) 843-3317. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostel features 250 beds in rooms of four to six beds and bathrooms. All 
rooms have air-conditioning and visitors can use the kitchen to prepare their 
own meals. The cost is $12.30 per night for members of Hostelling 
International. Non-members pay 14.50.

 The enchanting voices of a dozen teen-age girls rehearsing a hula drifts into 
the still Molokai night. 
</P>
<P>
 I greet you with love . . ., they sing in Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
 Molokai, wondrous is Molokai.  
</P>
<P>
 On this hot and steamy evening on the island where, according to Hawaiian 
legend, the hula was born, we watch the torch being passed to a new generation 
in a recreation hall under whirring ceiling fans. 
</P>
<P>
 We pinch ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Matilda, 5, is spellbound by the shaking hips and intense faces of the young 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The drums, pahu, beat fiercely. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley, 1, is being unusually quiet and Henri, 7, whispers, "I can feel the 
vibrations." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe that this is the place travel agents told us not to 
bother visiting because "there is nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 From the moment we ferried across the channel from Maui, our journey onto 
Molokai, the Friendly Island, has taken us to the Hawaii of days gone by, where 
people still live off the land, leave their doors unlocked and have time to 
give a sincere smile to strangers in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a deep breath," the captain of the Maui Princess told us over a loud 
speaker a week ago. "You're leaving the bright lights; the pace is slow in 
Molokai." 
</P>
<P>
 The one-hour, 45-minute ferry ride costs $25 one-way ($12.50 kids) -- about 
half the price of a discount airline ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolphins ride alongside as the friendly staff serves a continental breakfast 
on board. Some folks don't feel like eating much though -- the channel between 
the islands is notoriously rough and although this is considered a "calm day," 
the gyrostabilized Princess rocks and rolls in a surging swell. Matilda's 
breakfast plate goes flying . . . muffins overboard! 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of trusty Dramamine, popped before we left, are just the ticket for 
us . . . the children don't seem to be bothered. 
</P>
<P>
 A rental agent for our prearranged car meets us at the dock at Kaunakakai, 
Molokai's largest town. We take the car, toss it in drive and hang a left on 
Hawaii 460 to our campground at Papohaku Beach and its dirt parking lot on the 
island's west coast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a great setting, but nature has the upper hand. "If I lived here I would 
have an awesome bug collection," Henri concludes, after a couple minutes of 
catching green inchworms and black slugs around our tents. 
</P>
<P>
 The campground's beach saves the day. Ours are the only footprints on miles of 
fine white sand. 
</P>
<P>
 This western region, with its dry grasses and red terrain, looks more like the 
plains of Africa than the tropics. 
</P>
<P>
 In nearby Maunaloa, population 250, residents take a carefree approach to 
life. One home is fenced in by surfboards. The town is so small that the local 
kids are allowed to play hide-and-seek using the perimeters of the town as the 
boundary. Big Wind Kite Factory -- the town's center of commerce -- offers free 
tours and lessons, "no strings attached." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Maunaloa Dolly Hale (house), where dolls are made out of coconuts, we 
met Lori Cavanaugh, a 15-year resident and mother of three who said she has no 
plans to return to the mainland. "You don't get lost in a crowd and the kids 
can go anywhere. They're safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Children under 16 aren't allowed on tours of the most visited Molokai 
attraction, the former leper colony at Kalaupapa. We settle for a powerful view 
of the peninsular community from the top of a tall cliff in a rain forest at 
Palaau State Park. 
</P>
<P>
 We enjoyed the family run Purdy Macadamia Nut Farm behind Molokai High, where 
everyone gets a crack at shelling macadamia nuts with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Our island routine of exploring beach coves and snorkeling shallow reefs 
continues in Molokai, but it's a much smaller place. After traversing the 
38-mile-long, 10-mile-wide island we feel like we know everyone. We keep on 
bumping into people, or relatives of people, we've already met. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows everyone's business," one local tells us with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like a good time for a shower and a little comfort, so we move into 
Molokai Shores, a comfy $65-a-night condo booked through Friendly Isle Realty 
in Kaunakakai. 
</P>
<P>
 All paved roads seem to lead to this town where there are no traffic lights, 
movie theaters or fast-food chains. Many locals supplement supplies from the 
Friendly Market with regular trips to the coast to catch crayfish, octopus and 
fish. 
</P>
<P>
 King Kamehameha V left his gastronomical mark on the island more than a 
century ago with a regal plantation of coconut trees, just outside Kaunakakai. 
He released deer into the wild and built a series of fish ponds to supply his 
royal feasts. The ponds run like stone necklaces along the coast almost as far 
east as Honouli Wai Bay, where we stop to ask Eddie Tanaka directions to the 
nearest pay phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Use mine," offers the fishing guide, construction worker and taro farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we know it, Eddie is knee-deep in the middle of his thriving taro patch 
at the back of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the life of the Hawaiians," Eddie says, pulling up a 12-month-old 
root. "Today, Hawaiians like me are trying to find an identity, and growing 
taro has brought me close to what it's all about, close to the land and the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 Developers have their eye on the pristine beaches of Molokai. With only one 
resort and seven hotels and condos, there is plenty of potential to turn this 
secret place into an island that travel agents recommend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, to find the true Hawaii you've got to catch a plane to go to 
Molokai," Eddie says, climbing out of his taro patch. "And if this disappears, 
forget Hawaii. It will be all Waikiki."

BODY IS IDENTIFIED AS DENISE HUBER; CRIME: ARIZONA MAN IS HELD IN SLAYING OF 
NEWPORT WOMAN, WHOSE DISAPPEARANCE BAFFLED POLICE FOR THREE YEARS. FROZEN 
CORPSE WAS DISCOVERED INSIDE A STOLEN TRUCK.

<P>
 The frozen body of a woman found inside a stolen truck in Arizona was 
identified late Saturday as Denise Huber, a young Newport Beach woman whose 
mysterious 1991 disappearance sparked a nationwide search that frustrated 
investigators at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa detectives traveled to Arizona on Saturday to question a former 
Lake Forest man who has been held on suspicion of murder since Wednesday, when 
the frozen body was discovered inside a Ryder truck parked outside a home at 
the Prescott Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared, died of 
blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the Maricopa County medical 
examiner's office. She was identified through fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County sheriff's investigators found evidence that linked John Joseph 
Famalaro, 37, to Huber when they searched his father's country club home on 
Thursday. Authorities declined to disclose the nature of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest may help close the book on one of the most sensational 
missing-person cases in recent Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the end to one of this department's biggest frustrations ever," 
said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Jerry Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was last seen alive about 2 a.m. on June 3, 1991, when she dropped off a 
friend in Huntington Beach after attending a rock concert at the Forum in 
Inglewood. Her blue 1988 Honda Accord was later found on a shoulder along the 
Corona del Mar Freeway, just south of the Bear Street exit, with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said that Famalaro had not been a suspect in the case. There is no 
indication that Huber knew Famalaro, a house painter who left Orange County to 
care for his aging father in Prescott, a mountain community north of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not link him to the investigation before today," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle at Huber's car, and police were never able to 
determine exactly what happened at the scene. Since the disappearance, police 
cars in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa have had bumper stickers soliciting tips 
from the public on Huber's disappearance. Flyers still dot the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Her disappearance was publicized on the television shows "America's Most 
Wanted" and "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dennis and Ione Huber had long ago given up hope of finding their 
daughter alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time goes on, I realize Denise is probably not alive," Ione Huber said 
last month, on the third anniversary of her daughter's disappearance. "Just to 
know and not have to constantly wonder what happened would be easier to handle 
than this mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers, who moved from their Eastbluff Drive home earlier this year to 
North Dakota, could not be reached for comment Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies went to the Famalaro home on Wednesday after receiving a 
tip from Phoenix police that the Ryder truck he had rented in Lake Forest in 
January was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was found after deputies saw an extension cord running from a freezer 
in the truck to Famalaro's father's house, authorities said. The cord powered 
the freezer, which had been left on for days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested shortly after the body was found, but authorities said 
they had to wait several days for the body to thaw before performing an 
autopsy. The house painter kept a post office box in Lake Forest while living 
at the country club home and made several trips back to California, Arizona 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held Saturday in lieu of $250,000 bail. His lawyer could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Prescott Courier, Famalaro, who was described by his 
customers as well-spoken, moved to Prescott to take care of his father, who has 
Parkinson's disease and is hospitalized. Famalaro's mother lives in another 
home at Prescott Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities seized the 20- to 25-foot truck and freezer and took it to the 
Department of Public Safety's crime lab in Phoenix. Several cans of paint also 
were found in the back of the truck. 
</P>

ANGELS PRESIDENT MAKES PITCH FOR BETTER STADIUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Brown, president of the California Angels, watches the growing effort 
to keep football's Rams in Orange County, and he wonders when a similar push 
for his baseball team will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one team (the Angels) plays 82 games a year here and the other (the 
Rams) plays eight to 10 games a year," Anaheim's priorities "seem to be 
misplaced," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me to see a lack of concern for the Angels," he added. "We've been 
assured that's not the case, but actions speak louder than words, and we're 
looking for action." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are looking for things the Rams also want. On top of their wish 
list is a new stadium -- or a renovated Anaheim Stadium -- and a new, more 
profitable lease. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rams already fielding lucrative relocation offers for 1995 from 
cities like Baltimore and St. Louis and the Angels securely under contract 
through 2001, football has been the more pressing concern for city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem facing Anaheim is that whatever improvements it might make to 
28-year-old, 69,000-seat Anaheim Stadium to satisfy the Rams could drive a 
deeper wedge between the city and the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: If Anaheim entices the Rams to stay, that success might drive 
the Angels away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Anaheim builds a new stadium for the Rams and tells us to get used to this 
one, then that would bother me," Brown said of the present site now used by 
both teams. "We're hopeful the city will present a plan for us soon about 
renovating this stadium or building a new (baseball) stadium, but if that 
doesn't happen, we're going to have to start looking elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lease expires in 2001. It takes five years to construct a baseball 
stadium -- two to find a site and get the necessary permits, one to design and 
two to build. We'd have to get started in 1996, and it's practically 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams stay, he said, the city will have to build a new stadium for the 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, acknowledging the city's difficult position, said the 
two teams probably can't be co-tenants for much longer. When the stadium was 
enclosed to accommodate the Rams in 1980, it essentially went from a "baseball 
facility" to a "football facility where baseball is also played" -- in an 
atmosphere that often features 40,000 empty seats a night. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent trend toward building single-use stadiums has given baseball fans 
Oriole Park at Camden Yards and The Ballpark at Arlington and football 
enthusiasts the Georgia Dome. New stadiums like these offer more 
revenue-generating opportunities and have much more charm than the 
concrete-laden multiuse Anaheim Stadium, which has become a relic. Executive 
Vice President John Shaw of the Rams has called it "economically obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the short run, it might be possible to satisfy both the Rams and Angels in 
Anaheim Stadium," Daly said. "In the long run, it probably won't be." 
</P>
<P>
 The logical solution, said the Angels' Brown, is to build a new baseball 
stadium for the Angels and renovate Anaheim Stadium for the Rams. It's a great 
idea, city officials say, but one that could cost up to $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The three most recently completed baseball stadium projects, in Baltimore 
(1992), Arlington, Tex. (1994) and Cleveland (1994), ranged in price from $105 
million to $167 million. 
</P>
<P>
 An Anaheim Stadium renovation for the Rams could be done for about $47 
million, says Iskander Abdulla, an Orange-based construction cost engineer who 
worked on the stadium enclosure project. 
</P>
<P>
 That would include complete remodeling of some 100 luxury suites and moving 
them closer to the field, turning the middle level into a club concourse 
similar to that in The Pond of Anaheim (with upgraded amenities, finishes and 
concession stands and lounges) and replacing all 69,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Though several Anaheim council members don't think money should be spent on 
the Rams, the city and the recently formed Task Force to Keep the Rams in 
Orange County are exploring the possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Several task force members are scheduled to meet Monday night with a stadium 
project manager from Kansas City-based HNTB Corp., which has been contracted to 
repair the earthquake-damaged Los Angeles Coliseum and renovate Buffalo's Rich 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports agent Leigh Steinberg, who is heading the Rams task force, said any 
discussion of stadium construction or renovation would include the Angels, and 
some Anaheim city officials have said privately that if a new stadium is built, 
it would be for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Manager James D. Ruth said funding for any stadium project would 
have to come from a variety of sources, including the county and the private 
sector. Arlington and Baltimore have placed a surtax on tickets, established 
special lotteries and tapped luxury-suite revenue to help fund their new 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council last week approved a plan to designate the stadium 
and its parking lot a redevelopment project, which would allow the city to use 
any increase in tax revenue for future development of the 150-acre stadium 
site. The city is also considering plans to turn the area into a retail and 
entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The involvement of private money makes all these things more possible," Daly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most likely spot for a new baseball stadium would be on the southwest 
corner of the Anaheim Stadium lot, closest to Orangewood Avenue and State 
College Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Smith, Anaheim Stadium general manager, said a baseball stadium would 
cover 15 to 18 acres, but he added that about 45 acres next to the stadium, 
owned by the county to store maintenance and flood-control equipment, could be 
purchased and converted to parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an awful lot of interest being focused on the Rams, but in my opinion 
there's as much interest in retaining the Angels," said Smith, who is employed 
by the city and is also involved with the Rams task force. "We're not ignoring 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Would the city be more inclined to build a stadium for baseball than for 
football? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are merits to both," Daly said, "but most of the experts will tell you 
that it's easier to finance a new baseball stadium, because the (increased) 
number of game dates gives you the potential for more revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball stadiums are also smaller and less expensive to build. And the 
consensus among city officials seems to be: Why build a football stadium when 
you might risk losing your baseball team in the process and when you already 
have a facility that can be renovated? 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, a city employee since 1972 and stadium general manager since 1988, 
thinks it's possible for Anaheim Stadium to keep both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He favors an upgrade of the club level, which would benefit everyone, and he 
thinks the negative visual impact of empty outfield seats during baseball games 
could be minimized by covering them with tarpaulin, much the way San Diego has 
covered the upper deck of Jack Murphy Stadium for the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possibilities: Some architectural changes could be made to give the 
stadium a unique flavor. In-house advertising plans could be modified to bring 
more revenue to the teams. And the task force's drive for county corporations 
to purchase Ram season tickets and invest in luxury suites would benefit the 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The existing stadium has a lot of good opportunities for changes that could 
satisfy both teams," Smith said. "It would be difficult to keep them both in 
the same stadium, but it's not an insurmountable task." 
</P>
<P>
 The major roadblock from the Angels' perspective is luxury suites. The Rams 
currently receive 80% of luxury-box revenue, and the city receives 20%, but the 
Angels receive nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who claims the Angels' lease is the second-worst in the major leagues, 
said most baseball teams net $4 million to $10 million a year in luxury-suite 
revenue alone, an amount that "would take us from the red into the black and 
give us more discretionary cash to spend to improve the team." 
</P>
<P>
 What it all boils down to, Brown says, is money. When the Angels compete 
against teams that have doubled attendance with new stadiums, resulting in 
vastly increased revenue they can use to hire better ballplayers, the Angels 
are at a competitive disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Working in the Angels' favor is the fact that, despite an 11-year legal battle 
with the city and the Rams over development of the parking lot, the Angels have 
had a much more harmonious relationship with the city than the Rams and have 
closer community ties. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Angels, unlike the Rams, have no real desire to leave Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Anaheim want to keep the Angels? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dealt with Anaheim long enough to know they're creative, bright, and if 
they want to, they'll do it," Brown said. "Our job is to make sure they want 
to. I've often said that the only way we'll leave is if we're driven out. That 
could happen by failing to meet our needs for a new stadium."

3 TENORS HIT HIGH NOTE WITH ARIAS IN ARENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA ISENBERG and TED ROHRLICH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On turf normally reserved for the artistry of Dodger center fielders, three 
men acclaimed as the world's greatest tenors -- Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo 
and Luciano Pavarotti -- brought their exquisite voices to Chavez Ravine on 
Saturday night in a concert intended as a soaring musical complement to today's 
final game of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenors' performance was set as a reprise of their spectacularly successful 
concert on the eve of the last World Cup final four years ago, when they 
appeared for the first time on the same stage outside Rome. That concert, 
before a crowd of only 6,500 at the 3rd-Century ruins of the Baths of 
Caracalla, led to the biggest-selling classical recording of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, flanked by trees, waterfalls and columns on a specially built 
stage, the tenors were aiming for an even more lucrative extravaganza. Lifelong 
soccer fans all, they headed their high notes to satellites, which passed them 
to television sets in 100 countries. Promoters predicted that as many as a 
billion people could score a global village share of the popular arias and show 
tunes that a sellout crowd estimated at 56,000 saw and heard firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, called "Encore! The Three Tenors" and presented in association 
with the World Cup, had two acts of the sort of songs that each tenor has 
performed individually in large-scale concerts. The tenors were accompanied by 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the Los Angeles Music Center Opera chorus, 
with Zubin Mehta on the podium, as he had been in Rome. Familiar songs such as 
"Granada" by Domingo and "With a Song in My Heart" by Carreras were greeted 
with applause as soon as they began. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the three tenors did the Frank Sinatra trademark "My Way," the huge 
Dodgervision screen spotlighted Ol' Blue Eyes himself sitting in the audience. 
Sinatra stood and the three tenors applauded him. 
</P>
<P>
 The tenors have reached almost cult status, particularly Pavarotti, who has 
played to crowds of 150,000 or more in London, New York and Paris and drew some 
of his devotees to Los Angeles. "We're Pavarotti groupies," said Tom Dakoske of 
Agoura, whose wife, Judianne, was wearing Pavarotti's painted face on the left 
thigh of a pair of white jeans. "We've seen him in Paris, San Diego, New York 
and the Hollywood Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40,000 seats in the stands, priced at $15 to $150, sold out months 
ago. The field was packed with rows of folding chairs set on wood platforms of 
varying heights. Celebrities and other opera fans paid as much as $1,000 apiece 
for some of the 13,000 seats on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere was festive. Souvenirs were for sale: feet cushions at $15, 
hats at $20, assorted shirts from $23 to $60, and signed baseballs by the three 
tenors and Mehta were $20. A red carpet led the way to the high-priced seats. 
And every ticket came with its own set of binoculars. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the gates opened at 5 p.m., limousines, taxicabs, private cars, 
chartered buses and even a few motor scooters began to pour into the parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Picnickers dressed in everything from formal attire to Bermuda shorts enjoyed 
wine and champagnes in tailgate parties as the sounds of CDs and tapes from the 
1990 concert drifted from cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they were opera lovers who had planned on coming since about a year 
ago, when plans for the concert were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottawa businessman Antonio Ruiz and his wife, Lise, ordered their tickets last 
September after she saw an ad in a newspaper. They had missed the Rome concert 
and did not want to miss this one. "It only happened once before," Ruiz said, 
"and it may never happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who did not plan so far ahead had to pay a premium. Scalpers outside 
the stadium and a few inside -- many fewer than at a typical Dodger game -- 
appeared to be doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Cheng, a Pasadena engineer, said he was prepared to pay $200 or $300 for 
seats legitimately priced at half that or less. His wife, he explained, is 
"crazy about this. . . . If I get it for her, she will love me forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunja Radosavljevic, an opera lover and advertising student at Cal State 
Northridge, was on a tighter budget. She had only $70 -- and needed $10 just to 
park. "Oh, well," she said, "maybe I'll pay for parking and go listen outside 
(the stadium). They can't sing opera too low." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who came were simply people who knew Dodger Stadium would be the place 
to be Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "After fires, floods, earthquakes and a high-profile double murder, Los 
Angeles has become the center of negative attention," Peg Yorkin, chairwoman of 
the Feminist Majority, a women's rights organization, said a few days before 
the event. "I felt it was incumbent upon me to attend one of the top cultural 
events of the year."

<P>
 From the stands, the outfield looked like a cross between an amphitheater and 
an open-air Hollywood sound stage. In center field, the stage and a painted 
scenic backdrop were so big that the real and fake landscapes hid pavilion 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides all the microphones, camera operators, sound crews and equipment 
recording the show, the place was loaded with security people. Show people such 
as Sinatra, Bob Hope, Whoopi Goldberg, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Gregory Peck 
were on hand along with political figures such as former HUD Secretary Jack 
Kemp and U.S. Sen. John Kerry (D-Mass.) 
</P>
<P>
 Most entertainers at Dodger Stadium have stopped with the national anthem. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been many concerts at the stadium -- from the Beatles, U2 and the 
Cure to Elton John and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
 But never before has there been a classical music event. Some opera lovers had 
never been in the ballpark before. Some stadium employees also were not too 
familiar with the idea of opera: One told concert-goers exiting an elevator 
inside, "Enjoy the game." 
</P>
<P>
 As in 1990, the singers appeared and were billed in alphabetical order. After 
the orchestra played Leonard Bernstein's overture from "Candide," Carreras 
performed the first aria, from Massenet's "Le Cid." Familiar and 
not-so-familiar arias from Puccini, Donizetti and other composers followed plus 
such Broadway tunes as Rodgers and Hart's "With a Song in My Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Both halves of the concert ended with medleys. Combining all three voices on 
and off, such songs as "My Way," "Moon River," "All I Ask of You" and "Singin' 
in the Rain" made for lighter going and gave the tenors a chance to be playful 
with one another. Toward the end of the show was the only reprise of 1990 -- 
"Nessun Dorma" from Puccini's "Turandot." 
</P>
<P>
 Decca released its "Three Tenors" recording of the 1990 concert in September 
of that year. The following March came public television replays that boosted 
record sales. KCET Channel 28 alone has aired the show 21 times since March, 
1991, raising more than $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 "Three Tenors" concert recording has passed 10 million in sales 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Encore!" producer Tibor Rudas and officials at Warner Music Group, which 
acquired worldwide TV, radio, record and home video rights for the 1994 
concert, are hoping this round does as well or better. The concert alone was 
expected to gross $12.5 million to $15 million.

U.S. FORCES' PULLOUT HITS GERMANS IN HEARTS, WALLETS

 At the height of the Cold War, someone surely would have paid a mighty sum for 
a full-color, aerial photograph of America's front line against communism at 
Bitburg Air Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Mayor Horst Buettner gives the pictures away in a hard-driven bid to 
sell the entire 1,200-acre, 480-building compound. But so far his only 
customers for the former jet fighter and missile base are tire kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get one or two inquiries a week," Buettner says between cigarettes. "But I 
doubt we'll find someone to buy it all." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the price? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," he says, brightening. "You can have all of it for about $50 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The Amis are going home, shipping out of this area of western Germany once 
known as "NATO's aircraft carrier" because of all of the U.S. air bases. With 
American forces drawing down to 100,000 troops in Europe from 340,000, nearby 
Hahn Air Base was closed a year ago and, just to the south, Zweibruecken was 
shut down in 1991. The U.S. military will hand over Bitburg's keys to the 
German government on the last day of September. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Spangdahlem Air Base is supposed to remain open, but rumors run 
through Bitburg that even Spangdahlem will be closed in a couple years, and 
that, says the Social Democratic mayor, would be "a complete disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone appreciates that the Cold War is over and that it is good for 
humanity in general that the Americans don't have to be here anymore," Buettner 
says in near-perfect English. "Mostly, everyone just hates to see the Americans 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Buettner's lament is indeed heard throughout the Bitburg area -- where 
Americans have spent about $200 million a year on everything from construction 
contracts to beer steins -- and in other such U.S. garrison towns that have 
developed hybrid cultures over the last four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last year, 12,000 Americans lived in Bitburg side by side with a like 
number of Germans. With 2,500 intermarriages since the base opened in 1953 -- 
more than one a week on average -- nearly every Bitburg family has an American 
son-in-law or a German daughter in America. And nearly every homeowner has had 
a GI living in guest quarters, paying rent that helped to pay the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most Americans first heard of Bitburg in 1985, when a visit by 
then-President Ronald Reagan to a cemetery in which Waffen SS soldiers are 
buried stirred up much controversy, the town has long been a favored post for 
Air Force troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitburg is the home of Bitburger Pils beer and the Bitburg Warriors baseball 
team, whose German and American players won the state championship last year in 
the sub-AAA league. The German-style Im Kuhstall tavern is not far from the 
American bar Your Place or Mine. Rosie's Garage, another American favorite, has 
closed with the departure of so many beer drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bye, Boys," says Stern Magazine's melancholy story on the departure of 
American troops -- and dollars -- from Bitburg. For unlike Panama, for example, 
where the U.S. presence has been regarded with as much suspicion as 
appreciation, Germany actually seems to like its American troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bitburg, the U.S. military was largely seen as a protector rather than as 
an occupying force. Residents say they felt safe with their American allies, 
even if the base made their town a likely target in a hot war with the Soviet 
Union. The entire country, after all, was a bull's-eye in the Cold War 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitburg was a small town of about 5,000 people in the 1950s when the Americans 
moved in with their broad grins and rock 'n' roll music. Bitburgers worked in 
the brewery, in construction or farming, growing hops and raising cattle. Then 
the Americans brought millions of dollars, thousands of jobs and that big, 
open, easy way that Americans have. They drove large cars and used electric 
clothes dryers. They celebrated the Fourth of July and hung their Christmas 
decorations in exotic ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In came McDonald's right at the entrance to the base, and down the street 
Dave's Tattoo opened for business on those meaty American arms. There were all 
kinds of Americans, blacks and Latinos, Southerners and Midwesterners. Living 
all together like that, they just seemed more tolerant, more open-minded than 
small-town Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, I used to love going onto the base," says Noach 
Rosenzweig, owner of the 1950s-style Max Diner. "I liked the multicultural 
situation. I liked it because it was like being abroad in the States. Americans 
take things so much easier than Germans do." 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old Bitburg native wears jeans and sandals and an American 
take-it-easy attitude. His diner serves BLTs and Sloppy Joes to a background of 
jukebox music. Like most people in town, Rosenzweig speaks colloquial English. 
His wife is half-American, the daughter of a German woman and a GI. And 
although he has been to the United States twice, most of what he knows about 
Americans he learned in Bitburg. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. base was Bitburg's window to the world. During the Cuban missile 
crisis, the base went on highest alert, warning residents that war might be 
near. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitburg students protested the Vietnam War and then were introduced to illegal 
drugs by U.S. soldiers returning from Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two F-15 jet fighters were stationed at the base, along with a Patriot 
missile battery. Pacifists demonstrated against the installation of a system to 
direct cruise missiles in the 1980s but failed to prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the incessant, piercing noise of jet engines, of aircraft taking 
off for hot spots around the world and landing again, polluting the Bitburg 
skies in their practice runs for a showdown with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those old Phantom jets were the loudest," says environmentalist Hermann 
Schaefer, who lives in a village behind the base. "And the exercises. They'd 
circle over here 30, 70, 120 times a day. One day the village of Gondorf 
counted 268 overflights." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Bitburgers clearly felt a love-hate for the Americans, who wanted to be 
everywhere and police the world, who threw their money around back when the 
dollar was 4 marks to 1 -- it's now hovering above 1.5 marks -- and sometimes 
acted as if they thought they were better than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Americans pack up their belongings and moving vans file through 
town the way military trucks once did, nostalgia already has set in for the 
good old days. Scarcely a harsh word can be heard against the Amis . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans are such fun people," says Birgit Platz, a saleswoman at the 
Auto Nova rental car agency. "I had a lot of good American friends here in 
Bitburg, and I am going to miss them." 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt Bitburg will miss their business too. With the loss of its GI market, 
Auto Nova has given up car sales -- once about 50% of its income -- and is only 
in the rental business. The company already has eliminated the job of Platz's 
American colleague, Keith Bearden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the Gulf War, our business has been falling," says Bearden, who 
settled in Bitburg with his German wife four years ago. "During the war 
everyone was gone. When they came back we thought we'd have a booming business 
again, but no. There was uncertainty. People started saving their money to pay 
off bills just in case they were moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closure will make this place a ghost town. You take away $200 million a 
year and businesses close down. It's just starting," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Buettner tries to minimize the impact of the drawdown, noting that 
nearly 5,000 Americans will be based at Spangdahlem, many of them living with 
their families in Bitburg. He hands out a brochure that shows Bitburg at the 
center of a radar screen stretching from Paris to Amsterdam to Munich -- a 
perfect central location for industry in Europe, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But businessman Heinz Bappert is not so upbeat. He sees a town with no great 
highway connections and no adjoining cities to provide ready markets. Bappert 
has made a good living in Bitburg, but 90% of his electrical business came from 
U.S. contracts that run out next year when he finishes renovations on apartment 
houses for Spangdahlem troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he says, he doesn't know what he will do with his 35 employees, part of 
the more than 2,000 Bitburgers whose livelihoods depend on American money. 
Bappert is looking for new contracts in the surrounding area but figures that 
his son eventually will have to move the family business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the Americans pull out, it's going to be dead here," Bappert says. 
</P>
<P>
 For some it already is. Harry Delges left his job at Merchants National Bank 
in Bitburg because even though the branch will remain open, "there's no more 
chance to make a career there." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he commutes an hour each day to a bank in Luxembourg and an hour back 
home at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people want to find work, they're going to have to get used to this," 
Delges says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents blame the Bitburger brewery for the town's predicament, saying 
the beer-maker fought for years to keep out industries that might have competed 
for workers and driven up wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents blame environmentalists like Schaefer, whose Defend Yourself 
group helped keep the Americans from building a second runway on the base in 
the late 1980s and from cutting down several acres of woods to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to put in a second runway 43 meters from the fence," Schaefer 
recalls. "We knew they'd come back after they had it built and say that 43 
meters was too close to the fence and ask for even more land." 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer says the Americans "dealt with the environment here like they had 
another one to replace it." They spilled jet fuel, their pipelines leaked, they 
used defoliants and buried chemicals and ammunitions, he says. He believes that 
studies now under way will prove the area to be an environmental mess, a charge 
that the Americans deny. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those who think that the U.S. government might have spared Bitburg if 
it just had two runways, Schaefer only laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is that the Americans would have gone anyway, leaving us with a 
second runway and the woods chopped down. They don't have the money anymore to 
support such a military presence in Europe," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Bob Tobias doesn't disagree. One runway or two, 
with such a large-scale drawdown, something had to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias, a public relations officer, drives through the near-deserted base in 
an orange Opel with "For Sale" signs in the windows, past empty office 
buildings and hollow aircraft hangars. The runway is quiet, and Tobias is 
visibly saddened by the overgrown fields that used to be cropped as close as a 
soldier's hair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always depressing to say goodby to your friends, but here it's worse 
because there's not a chance you'll ever be back. The base won't be here," 
Tobias says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the mayor, he insists that there is life for a town after a base closure 
and points to Hahn Air Base, which he helped to shut down a year ago. Hahn is 
operating as a private landing strip for charter companies and a flying school. 
Germany's police academy also is moving in there. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias knows of a Belgian company that has shown interest in using a couple of 
the dark hangars at Bitburg to grow mushrooms. A fireworks producer has looked 
at them as storage space, and so has a tire company. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bitburg is competing with the other former base towns for investment now. 
Four years after its closure, Zweibruecken still has 30% unemployment and has 
replaced only about a quarter of the jobs that the Air Force once provided. 
Moreover, said Zweibruecken Mayor Juergen Lambert, life is never quite the same 
without the Amis.  
</P>
<P>
 "They belonged to us," he asserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Amen, say Bitburgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with Americans," city worker Heiner Giller says. "They were part of 
this city."

<P>
 Truth is, none of Nettie MacDougall's kin paid much heed when she spun yarns 
about owning a chunk of a famous gold mine in the foothills here. Just fanciful 
talk from "ol' Aunt Net," everyone assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 So it wasn't until long after MacDougall had passed away that her 
great-nephew, Costa Mesa handyman Scott Hobbs, got curious and picked up the 
phone last year to ask the family trustee about his potential inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee: "At the lowest estimate, you know how much (the gold mine) is worth, 
Scott?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs: "How much?" 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee: "Five billion dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 That's billion -- with a B. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in this frontier town on the outskirts of Denver, about 1,000 miles from 
the Orange County Fedco store where the 31-year-old Hobbs toils away at $10 an 
hour, sits the world-renowned Glory Hole, a gold mine that his great-aunt 
helped establish during the Depression. Although the precise worth of Aunt 
MacDougall's precious property remains a matter of some debate in these parts, 
Hobbs hopes to soon swap his handyman's apron strings for a millionaire's purse 
strings. The hole, he figures, represents his way out of the rut of blue-collar 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing," said Hobbs, who has begun taking business classes to ready 
himself for his new career. "I'm not going to have to worry about money again." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hobbs shouldn't buy that new ranch just yet. Today, the Glory Hole mine 
and the plum real estate it resides on are at the center of a sinuous tale that 
has all the makings of a spaghetti Western. There are bodies stuffed down mine 
shafts. There are pine-studded hills containing tons of $390-an-ounce gold. 
There's casino gambling. And there's a peculiar lawsuit involving a Texas judge 
who, with a little help from a colleague, managed to turn a $1.25-million claim 
into a $15.5-million judgment. The upshot? It may mean that no one in the 
MacDougall line will get as much as an ounce of fool's gold. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, the twisted tale amounts to a bona fide claim jump, 1990s style, 
involving what locals regard as the "richest square mile on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 The three main players in this modern gold rush drama: Hobbs, the handsome, 
unassuming heir hoping to trade his rags for riches; Harold Caldwell, 74, the 
weathered trustee of the Glory Hole whose mien and manner remind one of actor 
Jack Palance, and Judge Robert F. Barnes, a gravel-voiced south Texan who uses 
phrases such as "nervous as a pregnant nun" and who is dead-set on settling an 
old score with Caldwell. 
</P>
<P>
 James K. Kreutz, one of 19 attorneys involved in the case, blames gold fever, 
an ailment that has broken out with periodic virulence in this part of the 
country since James Buchanan's days in the White House. "Gold," Kreutz said, 
"has a way of obscuring people's vision." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in Colorado's Gilpin County, perched atop Oh My God Road and steep, 
partially paved thoroughfares snaking their way out of suburban Denver, gold 
falls just shy of religion. And at stake in the MacDougall clan's battle is a 
storied mine that has seen its share of worshipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians have penned entire books on the Glory Hole and its central place in 
Colorado's century-old gold rush. Area gift shops peddle postcards of it, 
trumpeting the more than $200 million in gold that the 700-foot-long mine has 
produced (and that was when gold went for a few dollars an ounce). One of the 
big new casinos in town even adopted the Glory Hole name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an amazing place, and only God knows how much gold is down there," said 
Caldwell, an old-time miner who has fought 35 years of legal and personal 
battles as the Glory Hole's trustee-caretaker. "That's why everyone wants a 
piece of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the legalized gambling boom hit this county three years ago, before 
casinos began dotting the mountainous landscape and slot machines became 
Central City's hottest tourist commodity, this was a town that was defined by 
the lure and mystique of gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Guarded by primeval, 14,000-foot-high peaks, mound after mound of mine rubble, 
hundreds of creaky shafts and 50 miles of tunnels, the place is reminiscent of 
an age when prospectors sifted every creek bed and burrowed every hillside in 
the rush to get rich. 
</P>
<P>
 From the first discovery of shimmering nuggets in the gurgling shallows of 
nearby Cherry Creek in 1859, thousands of settlers stormed the Central Rockies 
in Colorado to lay claim to minerals that could bring an industrious miner a 
small fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 So quickly did word spread of the treasure lying beneath the majestic hills of 
Central City and nearby Black Hawk that President Abraham Lincoln, after the 
Civil War, dispatched a message to Central City miners, saying he was sending 
reinforcements to unearth the gold and silver to help relieve the nation's war 
debt. "There is room for all," he said, and he was not far from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1920s, William Mark Muchow, an enterprising Chicago dentist known as 
Doc, made it his mission to buy the Glory Hole and the rest of the roughly 300 
mines in the region -- among them, Big Thunder, Little Raven and Matty May -- 
and merge them into a gold-producing conglomerate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nettie MacDougall, a railroad machinist supervisor in Illinois for 45 years, 
met Muchow in Chicago during the Depression and signed on as one of the 
original 10 investors in his start-up mining company. (No one knows how much 
she paid in.) One company document from 1969 lists her as an officer of the 
Chain O' Mines firm, as it was to become known. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak between 1929 and 1937, the Glory Hole turned out 200,000 ounces of 
gold, 18 tons of silver and 1 million tons of lead, zinc and iron. It ranked as 
one of the biggest mineral producers in the country and attracted visitors of 
all stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is unclear how much MacDougall benefited from her Glory Hole 
investment before her death in 1985, she never doubted that the place would 
prove, quite literally, a gold mine for her heirs. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always saying how we'd all be millionaires," recalled Irene 
MacDougall, 82, of Homestead, Mich., whose late husband was MacDougall's 
brother. "She'd say what she would do for the family, how she'd take us all on 
a trip around the world." 
</P>
<P>
 After her death, MacDougall, who never married, left behind properties in 
Illinois and Florida, as well as $100,000 in cash. But the family put so little 
stock in her gold mine talk that no one pursued the Glory Hole entry in her 
will when it came time to settle her estate. At least not until Hobbs, the 
Costa Mesa handyman, got involved in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If MacDougall's heirs do wind up with a chunk of the Glory Hole, family 
members agree, it will be largely through his perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs, a soft-spoken man who resembles a surfer more than a would-be mining 
mogul, visited the Glory Hole last year. What he found was a mine with a 
decidedly erratic record. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its fame, the Glory Hole has sat silent for much of its 135-year 
history, its crater testimony to the difficulty of trying to wring a fraction 
of gold out of a ton of silt and stone. 
</P>
<P>
 When running, the Chain O' Mines machinery can churn through 750 tons of rock 
and minerals a day, processing it all through a rickety, musty, wood mill that 
was built in 1926. But just as often, it seems, production has been plagued by 
problems: caps on gold prices; two well-publicized "swindles" that are said to 
have robbed the company of millions in joint ventures, and personal problems 
and distractions that Caldwell said have left him with scant time to restart 
full-scale mining at the Glory Hole -- the charge he was given in 1969 when the 
aging Chain O' Mines officers tapped him to be trustee because of his loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always believed that it was my job to get the property back into 
production," Caldwell said. "But it wasn't even profitable to mine gold till 
probably the late '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 The distractions for Caldwell took a macabre turn in 1981, when two miners -- 
including the father of a close friend -- vanished near the Glory Hole. 
Relatives suspected they had been murdered and their bodies dumped into one of 
the hundreds of mines peppering the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Chain O' Mines employees searched for nine years before authorities found the 
skeletal remains of the men in 1990. Just as their families had speculated, the 
two had been buried along with their pickup truck in an abandoned 400-foot 
shaft. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men were convicted of clubbing the miners to death with lead pipes, but 
authorities never could corroborate testimony linking the killings to a San 
Jose businessman who went to prison for orchestrating a multimillion-dollar 
gold scam involving the Glory Hole. Family members suspected that the miners 
were slain because they had discovered the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Glory Hole's most vexing problem, however, is a convoluted legal row that 
has as many twists as a mile-long mine shaft: Texas Judge Barnes in 1989 
successfully sued Caldwell for reneging on a $50,000 cash loan and on a promise 
to repay a $1.2-million bank loan Barnes took out on Caldwell's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, as far as MacDougall's heirs are concerned, Barnes -- who was 
an attorney who dabbled in real estate before joining the bench in 1988 -- 
subsequently succeeded in persuading a Colorado court to make the Glory Hole 
and the other Chain O' Mines properties subject to the judgment against 
Caldwell. This despite Caldwell's insistence that he never owned the property 
and the fact that his dispute with Barnes stemmed from a soured real estate 
deal in south Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: The Glory Hole and the rest of the Chain O' Mines properties have 
been put into court-ordered receivership by Colorado District Judge Kenneth 
Barnhill. Which means that, for now, whatever income the properties generate 
goes to Barnes, according to reams of court documents on file in Texas and 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The news got even worse for Caldwell last week: Barnhill signed an order 
allowing the sheriff to sell off all or part of the property to satisfy the 
multimillion-dollar judgment. Caldwell's lawyers vow an immediate appeal, but 
they admit it will be a tough fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the legal troubles have derailed Caldwell's and the MacDougall heirs' 
hopes of getting the Glory Hole back into full production for the first time in 
more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Scott Hobbs, his mother, Susan, and surviving MacDougalls tell it, all 
of this amounts to a thinly veiled plot to lay claim to their gold at a time 
when its price -- nearly $400 an ounce -- and technological advances make 
mining quite lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hobbs recently filed a complaint with the Texas Commission on Judicial 
Conduct, alleging collusion on the part of Barnes and the Texas judge who gave 
Barnes the multimillion-dollar award in the case, Joe B. Evins. As colleagues 
and friends, Barnes, who declines to give his age, and Evins, 68, have lived 
and worked in tiny Hidalgo County, near the Mexican border, for the better part 
of a half-century. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no evidence to support the family's allegations of 
wrongdoing on the part of the judges, Scott Hobbs and Caldwell's attorneys 
point to irregularities in the $15.5-million judgment Barnes received. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the original Barnes-Caldwell transaction involved $50,000 cash and a 
$1.2-million bank loan, Evins awarded Barnes $15,550,000, including $10 million 
in punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 With interest, the judgment exceeds $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 How does a $1.2-million lawsuit become a $15.5-million judgment? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good question," said Kreutz, a Colorado attorney who represents Caldwell. 
"But you can ask for the moon when the other side doesn't show up." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings up another intriguing issue in the case, Caldwell's attorneys 
say: 
</P>
<P>
 Within the thick courthouse files are affidavits from a process server, 
DeWayne Perdew, and his girlfriend, Lucy Lackey, who said they were not even in 
the same state as Caldwell on the date he was supposedly served by Perdew with 
notice of Barnes' lawsuit. They were at a George Strait country music concert 
in Cheyenne, Wyo., they said. Perdew provided the affidavit despite the fact 
that he could face perjury charges. Initially, Perdew said he had served papers 
on Caldwell in person on July 30, 1989, court documents say. 
</P>
<P>
 What is clear from court documents is that Caldwell did not attend the 
judgment hearing, where Evins heard arguments only from one side -- Barnes'. 
</P>
<P>
 Evins denied any wrongdoing in awarding the $15.5-million judgment, saying it 
was "far-fetched" to suggest any "hanky-panky," was going on. "Wouldn't make a 
damn bit of difference if it was the President of the United States or if I had 
known the plaintiff all my life," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Evins acknowledged that the size of the judgment was unusual given 
the sum in the original dispute, he deemed it reasonable because Caldwell, he 
said, has an unusual amount of assets. "The idea of punitive damages is to 
punish," Evins said. "If your net worth is . . . $100 million, $10,000 would 
hardly be punitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes declined to comment on whether it was fair that MacDougall's relatives 
may lose their inheritance because of his unrelated feud with Caldwell. Saying 
that he has reached an age where he doesn't want any enemies, Barnes emphasized 
that he had no interest in the Glory Hole or any other mine in the Chain O' 
Mines company. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a piece of a mountain as far as I'm concerned," said Barnes, who also 
denied impropriety. "I'm satisfied that it's a good judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The original judgment and subsequent rulings that have put the ownership of 
the Chain O' Mines in jeopardy have reached state appellate courts in Colorado 
and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with this case," Evins observed, "is you've got some lying goin' 
on. . . . Everybody's a suspect in a $15-million lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when what's at stake is a gold mine. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much the Glory Hole and the rest of the Chain O' Mines property -- 
which consists of hundreds of smaller gold mines and mostly prime acreage in 
and around thriving Central City -- is worth today depends on whom you ask. 
Estimates range from $792 million to $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics insist that the real gem of the company's portfolio is the land it 
owns near downtown Central City, where casino owners are parting with handsome 
sums to put up Las Vegas-style gambling houses. 
</P>
<P>
 But old-timers believe the gold-steeped veins of the Glory Hole and 
surrounding mines have barely been scratched. Yes, the easy-to-get gold has 
been harvested. But below the surface lies much more, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1985 study by Chain O' Mines engineer-geologist Donald J. McCoy Jr. 
estimated that the Glory Hole holds 50 million tons of ore reserves, worth an 
estimated $5.3 billion in gold, silver, copper, lead and other minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, the hands of the Hobbses and MacDougalls are bound. The 
families have retained attorneys to try to sever the Chain O' Mines property 
from the Caldwell-Barnes dispute. Even if they succeed, other surviving heirs 
of the original 10 Chain O' Mines investors might surface and lay claim to the 
Glory Hole. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Hobbs has emerged as the choice of the handful of MacDougall 
heirs and Caldwell to become trustee of the company and do whatever it takes to 
pluck the mine from the legal red tape in which it is entangled. Caldwell, who 
said it's time to step down, has promised Hobbs the trusteeship, along with a 
share of whatever piece of the Glory Hole the family ends up getting. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, Hobbs constructs sales displays and "fixes things" around the Fedco 
store. But each night, he returns to a cramped studio apartment in Newport 
Beach, crammed with meticulously bound notebooks all dedicated to the Glory 
Hole, its gold and his Aunt Nettie MacDougall's legacy, a legacy he hopes to 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prize," he said, "is so damned big."

CLINTON PLAN FOR IMMUNIZATION RAISES QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ and ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton unveiled his first domestic policy initiative in early 
1993, he promised that the groundbreaking childhood vaccination program would 
reverse a declining trend of immunization in the United States and prevent many 
tragic infant deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "America's immunization delivery system is deteriorating rapidly, . . ." 
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala warned. "The problem is 
enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Clinton's well-intentioned immunization effort was widely 
touted by Administration officials as a trial run for other, more ambitious 
domestic policy initiatives being promised by the President -- including health 
care and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But just as the Administration is gearing up to implement its massive new 
Vaccines for Children program beginning Oct. 1, there is evidence that the 
President and top officials overstated the seriousness of the immunization 
problem the program is designed to cure. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-heralded survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention shows that the nation is much closer than Administration officials 
originally acknowledged to achieving the program's goal of immunizing 90% of 
all preschool children. The latest government figures show the rate at between 
80% and 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, many public health experts, members of Congress and state 
officials now say they believe that the $500 million-a-year program to buy 
discount vaccines and distribute them to private physicians may only be 
marginally effective in improving those vaccination rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next few days, members of Congress are expected to release a 
General Accounting Office report that raises serious questions about the 
Administration's ability to safely implement the program this fall as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the report, the GAO is concerned whether 
the proposed government-run distribution system can ensure that the vaccines, 
which are highly sensitive to temperature changes, will be safely transported. 
In addition, it has raised questions about the adequacy of the computer 
software in the vaccine-tracking system. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO findings are certain to fuel complaints that the program far exceeds 
what Congress intended when it passed the legislation authorizing the 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Sen. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat from the President's home state of 
Arkansas and a longtime proponent of expanded childhood immunization, plans to 
introduce an amendment to the pending Health and Human Services spending bill 
that would halt funding for the most controversial element -- the 
government-run vaccine distribution system -- until questions about it are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the barrage of criticism, Shalala blames the pharmaceutical 
industry, contending that it has inflamed the controversy because the program 
would reduce vaccine makers' profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The critics, in particular the vaccine manufacturers, did not support the 
legislation establishing the vaccine program and are now simply raising one 
issue after another ... to undercut congressional support for the program," 
Shalala said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the government has been able to buy vaccines from manufacturers at 
discount prices to be used to provide children with free or low-cost 
inoculations in public health clinics. The new program would go one step 
further by supplying as many as 79,000 private physicians with the free 
vaccines to immunize Medicaid recipients who are children, uninsured children 
and Native Americans against such illnesses as measles, mumps, rubella, 
pertussis and polio. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who unveiled his childhood immunization plan on Feb. 12, 1993, just 
three weeks after he became President, chose this as his first domestic 
initiative because it dovetailed with his goal of reforming health care and 
fulfilled a promise that he had made to the Children's Defense Fund, an 
organization supported by both Shalala and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
that has long campaigned for a national vaccine program. In addition, it was 
consistent with his pledge to curb profiteering by the pharmaceutical industry. 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, some champions of childhood immunization viewed the new 
program as unnecessary. But as the initiative has taken shape, they have become 
alarmed. As Bumpers sees it, the government's new system for distributing 
vaccines looms as "an unmitigated disaster" because it cannot guarantee the 
integrity of the drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, all government-purchased vaccines have been shipped directly to 
public clinics through a distribution network run by the nation's 
pharmaceutical manufacturers. In its place, the Administration has decided to 
create a labyrinthine new federal system to be operated by the General Services 
Administration, whose primary responsibility is government procurement. 
Much-criticized over the years as wasteful and inefficient, it has no 
experience in shipping sensitive biological material. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the GSA plan, one-third of the nation's childhood vaccine supply would 
be distributed to public and private clinics and doctors' offices through a 
mammoth, government-run warehouse in Burlington, N.J., where the agency also 
stores paint, adhesives and other flammable materials. If the facility caught 
fire, the nation could lose a substantial part of its available vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 But most distressing to many public health professionals is that the new 
program de-emphasizes proven tools for getting preschoolers vaccinated: 
parental and physician education, community outreach, longer clinic hours and 
computer tracking and follow-up programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, public health officials in some states have complained they have been 
forced to shift resources away from these strategies to fund the time-consuming 
task of recruiting private physicians to participate in the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter A. Orenstein, director of the National Immunization Program for the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, emphasized that the Vaccines for 
Children program is just one part of the Administration's overall effort to 
ensure that "kids who need vaccines" receive them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Orenstein, the Administration has proposed spending $175 million 
in fiscal 1995 -- a fourfold increase over 1993 -- for the states to spend on 
education and outreach, $28.7 million to measure the results, $5 million to 
encourage states to develop early detection systems for the outbreaks of 
communicable diseases and $4.2 million to aid private efforts to increase 
community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new funds, nonetheless, will be devoted to making free vaccines 
available to needy children through private physicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald J. Saldarini, president of Lederle-Praxis Biologicals in Wayne, 
N.J., one of four companies that manufactures vaccines in the United States, 
said the emphasis on purchasing at the expense of other measures "is like 
putting one tractor tire on the Volkswagen and leaving the other three tires 
flat." 
</P>
<P>
 The program's architects say it will remove the barrier of cost for 
unvaccinated children. But because physicians will be permitted to charge their 
standard $30-to-$50 fee for an office visit and about $15 to administer the 
shot, critics note that it will still be cheaper for parents to go to public 
health clinics, where the vaccines are already administered at little or no 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the initiative was necessary because the cost of immunizing a 
child had risen from $23 to more than $200 in the previous 10 years, putting it 
out of reach for many low-income families. He did not mention that the 
government was already spending $300 million a year to supply free vaccines to 
public clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the pharmaceutical industry promptly challenged the 
President's figures, arguing that four-fifths of the price increase stemmed 
from the development of two new vaccines and the imposition of a federal excise 
tax in 1988. Drug company officials also insisted that there was no evidence to 
prove that cost is a major barrier to immunization. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, the Administration estimates that it will be buying 80% 
of all vaccines manufactured in the United States at a discounted price -- up 
from 50% now. The regular price for the standard 15 shots administered to 
preschoolers is $270; the discounted price is $129. 
</P>
<P>
 Months after Clinton made his call for a universal vaccination program, when 
the CDC made public its 1993 immunization statistics, it became clear that the 
dire warnings issued by the President and Shalala were based on outdated data. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration relied on 1991 figures showing that little more than 50% of 
all preschoolers had been properly vaccinated. The CDC's survey for the third 
quarter of 1993 found the rate was 90% for diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus; 
80% for polio, and 86% for measles, mumps and rubella. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attributed the increase, in part, to heightened awareness arising 
from a 1991 measles epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Goldberg, a public health researcher at Brandeis University, insisted 
that Administration officials had access to 1992 CDC survey results showing an 
80% immunization rate at the time the new program was unveiled in early 1993. 
But, he said, they chose to use the misleading earlier data. HHS officials 
denied that they had tried to deceive the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, the President's proposal was greeted with skepticism by both 
Democrats and Republicans. A compromise bill, enacted in August, 1993, sought 
to limit free vaccines primarily to children of low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics in Congress said they fear the Administration may allow the 
program to be expanded to include the children of middle-income and wealthy 
families. Moreover, they are concerned that failure to enact tough controls 
could lead some physicians to use the cheaper vaccines purchased through the 
government for private patients outside the new program. Administration 
officials noted that such use would constitute fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts said the new program will move the country substantially in the 
direction of a universal system of free vaccinations. Even HHS officials 
predicted that, using the expanded supply of low-cost vaccines offered by the 
federal government, about half of the states would soon be guaranteeing free 
vaccines for citizens of all income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics in Congress also said the Administration exceeded the terms of the 
authorizing legislation by creating a government-run distribution system for 
the low-cost vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 HHS officials insisted they were forced to create a government distribution 
system because Congress did not provide money to pay for shipping by 
pharmaceutical companies. At the same time, they acknowledge that Shalala had 
declined an offer from congressional leaders last fall to provide extra funding 
that would have preserved the drug industry's role in shipping the vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration turned to the GSA to distribute the vaccines after the 
Defense Department and Department of Veterans Affairs declined to do it. In 
fact, both the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department recently canceled 
their programs for distributing vaccines to children of military families based 
on findings that the pharmaceutical industry could do it more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the GSA also tried to escape the assignment. In a May 19 letter 
to CDC Director David Satcher obtained by The Times, GSA Administrator Roger W. 
Johnson said that because of opposition by Congress and the pharmaceutical 
companies, he believed "the chances for success have disappeared and the 
possibility of an acrimonious disaster has now surfaced." 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA's plans have come under heavy fire in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think it's nuts," said Rep. Scott L. Klug (R-Wis.), another critic of 
the plan. "Why would it make any sense whatsoever to essentially bring 
immunizations from all over the country, store them with a government agency 
that has no experience to do this and then, in addition, put them next to a 
room that I assume is dangerous or they wouldn't label it a flammable room?" 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Administration officials said no more than 8% of the nation's 
supply of the vaccines will be stored in the facility at any one time. They 
also said the distribution center has double-thick fire walls and that the GSA 
has agreed to abide by stringent Food and Drug Administration rules for 
handling delicate vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can do it (logistics) for something like Desert Shield or Desert Storm, 
there's no reason why we can't do it for something like war on disease here at 
home," said a top GSA official. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, experts said storing 8% of all existing vaccines in a facility with 
flammable materials is cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an incredible concentration of all vaccines in one period of time," 
said Chris Grant, vice president for Connaught Labs Inc., a vaccine 
manufacturer. "It being such a fragile, expensive product to re-create because 
it takes so long to create, there's no manufacturer in the country that comes 
close to having such a high amount." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration said it will be able to save significant sums by shipping 
the vaccines from various manufacturers in large, consolidated quantities at a 
discounted rate provided under a massive Federal Express contract for the 
entire federal government. But Bumpers and pharmaceutical manufacturers 
disputed that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their alleged savings, I think, are grossly exaggerated," Bumpers said, 
contending that the Administration has put the figure as high as $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Public health officials who must administer the new program are not uniformly 
opposed to it, even though some have spoken out against the expenditure of more 
money for vaccines. In states such as California with a high Medicaid 
population, it is more popular than in rural states where most children are 
vaccinated at free public clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Rutherford, deputy director for prevention services in Sacramento, 
estimated that the program will save California taxpayers about $40 million, 
primarily because the federal government will now pay for vaccinating Medicaid 
patients. "We're basically enthusiastic about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mississippi, however, F. E. Thompson Jr., the state health officer, said 
the new program is unnecessary and wasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of providing additional nurses to give shots or additional clerical 
staff to send reminder notices to parents or computerized tracking system to 
keep track of children's immunization, we're spending money on large amounts of 
vaccine that we well may not even need," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply providing free vaccines to physicians is no guarantee that children 
will get the shots, experts said. In California, according to David Wood, UCLA 
professor of pediatrics, studies show that doctors frequently fail to immunize 
children who come in for checkups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education and outreach are a proven success," Bumpers said. "That's where the 
money should have been put. We didn't need to put all that much more money into 
vaccine." Immunization Program 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a recommended immunization program for children from birth to 2 years 
old. The regular price of the vaccine for the standard 15 shots administered to 
preschoolers is $270; the discounted price would be $ 129: VACCINE: DOSES

QUAKE LEAVES A LEGACY OF VIOLENCE, LOSS AND COURAGE; RECOVERY: SIX MONTHS 
LATER, THE GOVERNMENT, BUSINESSES AND RESIDENTS CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE TO 
REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER. This article was reported by Times staff 
writers Jill Bettner, John Chandler, Henry Chu, Cynthia H. Craft, Aaron 
Curtiss, Sam Enriquez, Nancy Hill-Holtzman, Hugo Martin, Ann W. O'Neill, Mack 
Reed, Kenneth Reich, Beth Shuster, Richard Simon, Douglas P. Shuit, David 
Wharton and Jeff Wong. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with a region rising from a night of death and cataclysm and fear, 
binding the wounds and taking the first steps toward recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the tales of heroes and rescues were replaced by a litany of mounting 
damage and disturbing questions about the safety of the buildings in which we 
sleep, work and park. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, six months later, the most destructive earthquake in U.S. history 
leaves a legacy of momentous violence, staggering loss, awesome compassion and 
courage, and of great achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 It also represents an uncertain future of faltering insurers, a federal 
government struggling under the burden of the costliest domestic disaster in 
United States history, and a state and city without the resources to repair and 
rebuild businesses and housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still cannot agree on where, exactly, the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake struck. And there is hardly any more sense of resolution in the 
numbers rising out of the damage inflicted from the Eastside and Glendale to 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, 20,089 dwellings remain vacant, and almost 30,000 more may be 
abandoned. Some 86,393 structures were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the 200,000 Southland applicants for the main federal rebuilding program 
have been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of steel frame buildings, which before January were thought 
relatively invulnerable, have yet to be inspected for the sort of cracking 
discovered after the quake, mystifying and alarming engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, 84% of all residents report some quake 
damage, and 30% say they have suffered financial reverses because of the 
disaster, according to a Times poll conducted earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 It has taken most of the first six months merely to understand the scope of 
the quake, and restore utilities and public transportation. The hard part is 
just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake aftermath is characterized in two phases," said Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan. "Response -- that time immediately after the disaster -- 
and recovery, which is everything from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, we've just begun the long road to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 It was four months before what may become this earthquake's signature 
phenomenon was identified: "ghost towns," areas where destruction was so 
concentrated that vandalism and decay threatened to wreck what the earthquake 
had left. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all that has been rebuilt, the most disquieting image may be the 164-unit 
Northridge Meadows apartments -- still drawing the curious who peer into the 
crushed living spaces where 16 tenants died. Survivors were given until last 
Friday to remove their belongings, and demolition is about to begin. But the 
litigation over who is responsible for the collapse will go on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The end is too far in the future to see, and the cost still anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has allocated $12 billion to cover everything from cash 
grants to individuals to reimbursing local and state governments for repairs to 
public facilities such as freeways. Local and state officials are still 
desperately lobbying for more. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest victims may turn out to be the insurance industry. From an 
estimate of $4.5 billion in April, insurance carriers have increased their 
projected losses to $6 billion. And that could climb, posing a potential crisis 
in the availability of earthquake and homeowners insurance across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing nearly two-thirds of its operating surplus in projected payouts of $600 
million, Valley-based 20th Century Insurance Group announced it would stop 
selling earthquake insurance immediately and phase out all homeowners coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, Allstate Insurance Co. and many smaller companies 
have also cut back on selling earthquake insurance, and tightened up on selling 
new homeowners policies. Price increases are almost certainly on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of earthquake victims still await word on their requests for Small 
Business Administration loans. And thousands of others have been denied 
assistance, because of their weak financial condition. The rejection rate for 
SBA loans has been close to 50%, higher than for either Hurricane Andrew or the 
1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA's strict eligibility requirements mystify property owners such as Ray 
Shouhed, an Iranian immigrant whose $500,000 investment in a half block of 
Reseda Boulevard storefronts turned to dust Jan. 17. Shouhed said that after 
generating a foot-thick application and waiting six months, he saw his SBA loan 
application turned down last week because the federal agency said his cash flow 
was insufficient. The previous owner has initiated foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all over," Shouhed said with a self-conscious smile. "What can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the costs not yet imposed, such as the price tag on future 
seismic safety requirements.

 This week, the Los Angeles City Council will consider ordering the owners of 
about 600 steel-frame buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Wilshire 
Corridor to inspect for damage. Meanwhile, repairs continue on dozens of 
damaged buildings despite experts' doubts that the methods are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially life-threatening failure of several concrete parking garages 
built under the latest seismic requirements is forcing building officials and 
structural engineers to re-examine previously accepted construction methods. 
</P>
<P>
 A seismic retrofitting program to be announced soon could require costly 
improvements to thousands more steel, wood-frame and concrete structures, said 
Nicolino Delli Quadri, earthquake spokesman for the Los Angeles Building and 
Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For tourists and commuters, the picture is not nearly so bleak as it remains 
for others. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to lessen a drop in tourism that has hit $308 million, the Los Angeles 
Convention & Visitors Bureau has launched a multimillion-dollar television and 
print advertising campaign called "Play LA." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to tell people that we are OK," said Gary Sherwin, spokesman 
for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 That image of a city reacting quickly was bolstered by the extraordinary 
repair of Southern California's world-famous freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of up to a year of commuter horrors were put to rest by an incentive 
program rewarding speedy work. 
</P>
<P>
 The reopening of the Santa Monica Freeway in April, two months early, earned a 
$15-million bonus for contractor C.C. Myers. The ramps which remain closed on 
that freeway will be reopened Friday, four days ahead of schedule, Gov. Pete 
Wilson recently announced. In May, the contractor on the downed Golden State 
Freeway over Gavin Canyon also finished more than a month early, restoring 
Southern California's commercial lifeline to the rest of the state. And key 
portions of the interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley 
freeways were reopened earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Simi Valley Freeway, whose old surface is still being ground into a 
mountain of rubble as cars squeeze by in three lanes, remains to be fully 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, which suffered more than $700 million in damage, hundreds 
of homes and businesses in Fillmore and Simi Valley have been repaired and 
reoccupied. But Fillmore lost one-third of its vital business district. Piru's 
tiny downtown remains fenced and dark. And hundreds more property owners are 
grappling with repair bills reaching six figures -- some weighing whether they 
should fix up or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification in May of 13 ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley and 
Hollywood may have ended expectations of a quick recovery among the majority of 
Southern Californians not personally touched by the quake. These areas, where 
there did not appear to be enough money or will to rebuild, raised the specter 
of large pockets that could become intractable villages of scavengers, vandals 
and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 City and law enforcement officials moved quickly to clear out trespassers, 
erect fences and hire security guards. Owners and lenders were contacted. One 
of the most endangered ghost towns, a row of abandoned apartments on Hubbard 
Street in Sylmar, was heading en masse into foreclosure, said city housing 
consultant Rich Wallach. Hoping for city intervention, the lenders have agreed 
to work with all but one of the owners to restructure the debt and rebuild, 
Wallach said. City officials expect the rebuilding to last up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though perhaps the most dramatic example, ghost towns represent only a small 
fraction of the damaged and endangered housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20,089 dwellings still vacant because of quake damage are down from 33,033 
on April 1, the city reported last week. So far, 26,841 building permits have 
been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica only one in four of the 1,900 housing units rendered 
uninhabitable have been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Those trying to fund repairs who have been turned down by SBA have a last 
resort: the Los Angeles Housing Department, which has cobbled federal grants 
and bond financing into a fund that could reach $200 million to work with the 
toughest cases. State and local officials had planned a program three times 
that large until Gov. Wilson canceled it after California voters rejected a 
proposed bond issue for quake relief last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to aid those turned down by the SBA, Riordan said the federal Economic 
Development Administration will soon announce a $30-million loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials are also seeking more federal help to assist businesses 
and to shore up the bluffs along the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Veterans Affairs officials have decided against rebuilding the 
crippled hospital in Sepulveda. Such trendy Ventura Boulevard spots as Johnny 
Rockets and Cafe Cordiale in Sherman Oaks will not reopen, at least in their 
old spots. One of the most seriously damaged hospitals, St. John's Hospital and 
Health Center in Santa Monica, will have only about half the 501 beds and half 
the 2,000 employees it had before the quake when it reopens Oct. 3. Trish 
Bartel, a spokesperson for the hospital, said the downsizing likely would have 
occurred anyway because of changes under way in the health care system. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of others are coming back stronger despite the quake. County health 
officials say they believe much of the estimated $400 million in federal 
earthquake repair funds they expect to receive will be used to build a new, 
$1.3-billion hospital to replace County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Valley, the most expensive earthquake repairs are at the Los 
Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The cost to fix a deep crack around the upper 
concourse, the weakened historic peristyle and the wrecked press box will run 
between $50 million and $60 million. Enough of the work is expected to be 
completed by the end of the summer to allow the Raiders and USC to play 
football in the stadium this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of school repairs has been nowhere near as fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Students across the region will return in September to barricades and yellow 
tape, cracks in ceiling and floor tiles and possibly unusable gymnasiums and 
auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage at schools ranged from that which caused the complete relocation of Van 
Gogh Elementary in Granada Hills to minor cracks in ceilings and walls at other 
campuses across the massive Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the earthquake, Supt. Sid Thompson said he wanted the 160 damaged 
schools -- with total damage expected to be between $300 million and $600 
million -- to be either completely or partially repaired by January. But it 
appears that goal will not be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to make the repairs without dipping into the school system's own 
coffers, the cash-short district has delayed the work while it pursues federal 
and state aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has so far received about $70 million from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency and has spent about $17 million on building repairs, safety 
and structural inspections and the replacement of lost or damaged textbooks, 
supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be years before Cal State Northridge picks up the pieces from $350 
million in damage, the greatest loss from a natural disaster ever suffered by a 
U.S. university. 
</P>
<P>
 Although desperate preparations got the campus open only two weeks late for 
the spring, enrollment was down to 24,813, the lowest since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials anticipate more enrollment decline this fall despite harried 
efforts to ready student housing and other buildings for the first day of 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most classes will take place in several hundred portable classrooms. 
Construction, fueled by $163 million in federal assistance so far, will 
continue for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking into the future, economists see the earthquake as a minor irritant 
along Southern California's long road back to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to be coming in as a very small event," said Larry Kimbell, 
director of UCLA's Business Forecasting Project. "I haven't seen any sign the 
quake has had a big impact" despite the billions of dollars of aid. He said the 
quake's long-term net economic effect will be only slightly negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to some 800,000 jobs lost statewide since 1990, UCLA forecasters see 
a net loss of 30,000 attributable to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail workers were hard hit because several large shopping centers and 
department stores were too damaged to reopen immediately. Overall, 9,400 retail 
jobs have been lost since January. But as malls and shops gradually reopen, 
many of the unemployed are returning to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 5,000 new 
construction jobs were created in Los Angeles County between January and March. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest hit mall was Northridge Fashion Center. Workers recently completed 
the removal of asbestos and will soon begin structural repairs. The mall is due 
to reopen in mid-March, although its six anchor stores are expected to reopen 
at various times between November and August, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of its parking structures will be rebuilt, including one that 
collapsed in the quake and three others that were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state level, politicians have yet to find a way to fund California's 
share of the cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike after Northern California's Loma Prieta quake, when the governor and 
legislators quickly settled on a temporary gasoline tax increase, jittery 
politicians passed the buck to voters this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of the earthquake bond proposal means California is left with no 
new source of funding to cover the 10% of the repair costs (the federal 
government pays the other 90%) to build highways, schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the most extensively measured earthquake in history has given 
scientists almost as much to debate as politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not settled, for instance, whether the earthquake occurred on a thrust 
fault branching off from the Elysian Park system, or on a hitherto-unknown 
easterly extension of the Oak Ridge fault from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking intensities seemed among the highest ever recorded, until some 
scientists suggested a reason: No such recordings were taken at all in most 
previous big quakes. That debate may compound the difficulty of rewriting 
seismic safety codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people relate earthquakes to comfort and safety, not science. And on that 
score, the overriding lesson has been that quick reaction paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kishton, coordinating officer for FEMA and a 22-year veteran of disaster 
relief, said he has never seen a better blending of federal, state and local 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a matter of days, a multibillion-dollar corporation was established with a 
500,000 customer base . . . over 10,000 federal, state and local employees . . 
. 80 offices. That got set up in a matter of a week or 10 days," Kishton said. 
"You look at Kmart or Sears. They spend years putting stuff on the drawing 
board." The Quake by the Numbers 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are staggering, running into the billions. A total of 597,000 
applications for assistance have been received by the federal government. (The 
previous record was 304,000 after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.) Here is a sampling

COMET FRAGMENTS BEGIN CRASHING INTO JUPITER; ASTRONOMY: IMPACT OF FIRST CHUNK 
CREATES A GARGANTUAN FIREBALL. SCIENTISTS ARE ELATED AT THE IMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The world's astronomers focused Saturday on Jupiter as mountain-sized 
fragments of a shattered comet -- traveling 60 times faster than a bullet -- 
began raining down on the dark side of the solar system's largest planet, 
triggering a fireball half the size of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 After the predicted impact of the first -- and smallest -- chunk of comet 
Shoemaker-Levy 9 at 1 p.m., astronomers in Spain and Chile reported seeing a 
large plume as the impact site rotated into view. Within 90 minutes, the fiery 
plume had grown into a huge fireball 4,000 miles across and 1,000 miles high, 
NASA astronomers said late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plume is brighter than anything else on Jupiter and brighter than its 
brightest moon, Io, said comet co-discoverer Eugene Shoemaker. "I mean, it's 
bright!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the first raw image from the Hubble Space Telescope showed evidence of 
what appeared to be the plume from the first impact, scientists gathered around 
the video monitor gasped in astonishment and then shouted with glee. 
</P>
<P>
 They swigged celebratory champagne straight from bottles. "We actually saw 
some amazing things," said planetary astronomer Heidi B. Hammel at NASA's 
Goddard Space Flight Center outside Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can actually see the impact site," she said. "It is a new feature on 
Jupiter, and we are going to have 20 more of them this week, each one even 
brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the impacts were all to take place out of Earth's vision, Jupiter 
rotates so quickly that the impact sites come into view within half an hour of 
each collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every major telescope in the world was trained on the giant planet 
as the first of 21 chunks of the comet hit the night side of Jupiter on 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of astronomers jockeyed for the best view -- from the South African 
Astronomical Observatory outside Cape Town and the Palomar Observatory outside 
San Diego to a thicket of eight observing stations atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, 
and NASA's airborne observatory circling the globe at 41,000 feet over 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubble telescope, orbiting well above the atmosphere that blurs the vision 
of earthbound observers, has one of the best views of Jupiter and is expected 
to take hundreds of images of the impact sites in the coming week. NASA also 
has launched high-altitude sounding rockets from New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, three major fragments of debris were expected to blast through the 
planet's swirling cloud cover by midnight Saturday, with others bombarding the 
planet at about six-hour intervals for the next six days. The largest piece of 
comet is expected to hit Jupiter on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first comet fragment hit just after lunchtime, scientists did not 
see any processed images of Jupiter, taken by NASA's space telescope, until 
late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Denied a direct view of the shooting stars, scientists were searching for 
aftereffects of the impacts -- from lightning-like flashes reflected on 
Jupiter's many moons, to shock waves rippling the giant planet's thick 
atmosphere or minute temperature changes caused by the massive release of 
energy. Some scientists have suggested that the comet would strike with more 
force than all the nuclear weapons on Earth combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoemaker, an astronomer at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Ariz., 
discovered the comet this year with his wife, astronomer Carolyn Shoemaker, and 
colleague David H. Levy, an astronomer at the Palomar Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real emotional attachment to this comet," said Carolyn Shoemaker. 
"All this time it has been such an object of beauty to me. I have to admit that 
I had a momentary tear when I realized the (impact) had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur and professional sky-watchers have been riveted for months by the 
prospect of the collision because it is the first time people have discovered a 
celestial object and then been able to predict its impact on a planet 
accurately any more than a few seconds in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, perhaps, it also is the first time humans have seen a comet 
collide with a planet. Scientists are excited at the prospect of gaining any 
insights they can into the kinds of collisions that have left their mark on 
every planet and moon in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very fortunate to be part of this suicidal comet experience," said 
Donald K. Yeomans, a comet expert at Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. 
"This is a chance to take a quantum leap forward in our understanding of what a 
comet is." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Saturday, scientists were not sure whether the Shoemaker-Levy comet 
would cause the kind of cataclysm that may have destroyed the dinosaurs on 
Earth 65 million years ago or just a cosmic fizzle, of interest only to 
dedicated comet watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it looks like this comet was not a dud," said Hal Weaver, an astronomer 
at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Jupiter -- a ball of frozen and compressed helium and hydrogen 300 times more 
massive than the Earth -- is so large that scientists expect it to easily 
absorb the comet's energy. They expect no consequences to Earth, which will be 
more than 400 million miles away from Jupiter during the impacts.

MICROSOFT AGREES TO LOOSEN GRIP ON SOFTWARE INDUSTRY; TECHNOLOGY: JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT SAYS THE ANTITRUST ACCORD SHOULD SPUR COMPETITION AND INNOVATION, 
PLUS LOWER PRICES. PACT ALSO APPLIES TO OVERSEAS MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE and JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending the most important antitrust investigation of the past decade, the 
Justice Department announced Saturday that Microsoft Corp., the world's largest 
maker of computer software, had agreed to end marketing practices that "choked 
off competition and preserved its monopoly position." 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts and government lawyers predicted that the settlement will 
increase competition and spur innovation in the software industry and lower 
prices for consumers. Its main beneficiaries will be other makers of software, 
such as IBM and Novell, who will gain openings to sell their products to 
computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
 More broadly, the settlement marks the first time that U.S. officials have 
coordinated an antitrust accord with the nations of the European Union. As a 
result, Microsoft must abide by the new restrictions on both sides of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft is an American success story, but there is no excuse for any 
company to try to cement its success through unlawful means," said Assistant 
Atty. Gen. Anne K. Bingaman, who heads the antitrust division of the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting any wrongdoing, Microsoft officials said they agreed to a 
settlement late Friday evening to head off a threatened antitrust lawsuit that 
could have kept the company tied up in court for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, federal antitrust lawyers have been investigating complaints that 
Microsoft had used its near-monopoly power in the software industry to force 
its products onto computer makers. Last year, it was estimated that Microsoft's 
programs ran 80% of the world's 150 million computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the computer industry feared that Microsoft's dominance -- based on 
its near-monopoly, with MS-DOS and Windows, on the software that controls the 
basic functions of a personal computer -- was irreparably damaging even large 
competitors while driving smaller software firms out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's largest direct competitor, Novell Inc., applauded the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we see this as a victory," said David Bradford, general counsel for 
Novell. "This has been a long effort by many companies for many years, and this 
decision today will provide consumers with increased choices and more 
innovative products." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will be in force for six years. It must be approved by a federal 
judge, but both parties agreed to abide by its terms immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 It's main provisions bar Microsoft from: 
</P>
<P>
 * Using volume licensing agreements on the sale of MS-DOS and Windows that 
effectively block out competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Imposing highly restrictive confidentiality agreements on software 
developers who create programs that work with MS-DOS and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 * Entering into certain multiyear software licensing agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 The volume licensing practices were the centerpiece of the Justice 
Department's complaint. MS-DOS and Windows are usually installed by the 
computer manufacturer, and Microsoft gained a competitive advantage by giving 
computer makers -- such as IBM, Compaq and Dell -- volume discounts on 
software. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the manufacturers signed licensing agreements to pay Microsoft a 
fee for MS-DOS and Windows on each computer sold, regardless of whether that 
software actually was installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyers had contended that these agreements locked out competitors. 
If, for example, a buyer wanted different basic software for a new computer, 
the manufacturer would have had to pay for that software in addition to the 
MS-DOS/Windows fee it paid to Microsoft -- a double royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft has used its monopoly power, in effect, to levy a 'tax' on PC 
manufacturers who would otherwise like to offer an alternative system," 
Bingaman said. This is the kind of illegal restraint of trade that violates the 
antitrust laws, according to the Justice Department complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement "will prohibit the company from continuing to engage in 
monopolistic practices in the future," Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said. "While the 
company fairly and lawfully climbed to the top of the industry ladder, it used 
unfair and illegal practices to maintain its dominant position." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Microsoft called these agreements incentives to use their 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference Saturday, Microsoft officials said they have operated "in 
a perfectly legal fashion" but nonetheless agreed to make a "few reasonable 
accommodations" to end the federal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has flourished by providing "good technology at low prices," not 
because it has locked out its competitors, said Bill Neukom, the company's vice 
president for law and corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Neukom also said he doubted that consumers would see much change from the 
settlement because the operating system accounts for only 1% to 2% of the cost 
of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is not clear that manufacturers will necessarily want to change the 
terms of their contracts, he said. Since Microsoft's products are enormously 
popular, the manufacturers may prefer to pay for a license that allows them to 
put the software on all their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional provisions of the settlement will make it easier for 
Microsoft's competitors by freeing them from restrictive agreements under which 
they were virtually unable to work with competing operating systems if they 
were developing software for Microsoft systems. The agreement also prevents 
long-term contracts that lock computer makers into some Microsoft products and 
require them to purchase a minimum number of products. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, Microsoft, which is based in Redmond, Wash., won the right to put its 
operating software on IBM's first personal computer. Since then, MS-DOS and 
Windows have become the industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's announcement symbolizes a new, more aggressive approach to 
antitrust law under the Clinton Administration. The Microsoft case was the most 
significant one to be pursued by the Justice Department since it ended 
antitrust suits against IBM and AT&T in 1982. The case against IBM was dropped, 
but the case against AT&T ended in a landmark settlement that broke up the Bell 
System and paved the way for a new era of competition in telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 In the previous Republican administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, 
federal prosecutors eased off enforcement of the nation's antitrust laws, 
arguing that government should not interfere in the market simply because more 
efficient companies were dominating an industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration lawyers under Bingaman have countered that the 
government must police "unfair competition." 
</P>
<P>
 "This historic agreement will level the playing field," she said at a news 
conference Saturday at Justice Department headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation of Microsoft began at the Federal Trade Commission four 
years ago but languished there. The Justice Department took over the case last 
year and was apparently ready to go to court. 
</P>
<P>
 But a trial could have been long and costly for both sides, and it is not 
clear that the government would have prevailed. Microsoft could argue strongly 
that its incentives and volume discounts were legal, even if they had the 
effect of hurting its weaker competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This settlement is everything we could have hoped for," Bingaman said. The 
High-Stakes Battle Over Software 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft Corp.'s agreement with the Justice Department and the European 
Commission ends one of the highest-profile antitrust investigations ever. Here 
are some key elements in the drama: 
</P>
<P>
 THE AGREEMENT 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft required computer makers to pay a fee for each machine shipped 
even if it contained another software maker's operating system. This allegedly 
gave Microsoft an advantage by forcing makers to pay two royalties if they 
wanted to use a competitor's operating system. The agreement ends this 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft required computer makers to sign lengthy contracts that often 
prevented customers from buying more advanced products. The government charged 
this discouraged new competitors. The agreement bans contracts longer than one 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Software designers who created applications using Microsoft's operating 
system had to sign confidentially agreements precluding them from working with 
Microsoft's competitors. That in effect tied the new products only to 
Microsoft. The agreement prohibit overly restrictive confidentially contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * The deal with the Justice Department will have the force of law after it is 
approved by a judge. It lasts for 6 years. 
</P>
<P>
 THE IMPACT 
</P>
<P>
 * Will lead to greater competition and perhaps a broader range of products. 
</P>
<P>
 * May eventually lower prices for consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Could create confusion at the retail level and hard choices for consumers 
over what products to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MARKETPLACE 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft has dominated the business for operating systems, which control 
basic computer functions, with its DOS and Windows products. Market share 
figures are for 1993. DOS: 39% DIS with Windows: 35% Macintosh: 9% Unix: 7% 
Others: 6% IBM OS-2: 3.5% 
</P>
<P>
 * Software dominance has kept Microsoft's revenues and profits rising 
steadily. Revenues in billions of dollars '93: $3.75 billion 
</P>
<P>
 THE TIME FRAME 
</P>
<P>
 March 1991: Microsoft and IBM reveal that Federal Trade Commission has begun 
investigating both companies for potential anti-competitive practices. 
</P>
<P>
 April 1991: Microsoft says FTC investigation has been broadened to include 
nearly all of its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 April 1992: Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates says he is not worried about the FTC 
investigation and other legal problems as business booms. 
</P>
<P>
 February 1993: FTC Chairman Janet D. Steiger seeks a preliminary injunction 
barring Microsoft from using unfair tactics. But board deadlocks on taking 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 July 1993: Justice Department steps in to review the Microsoft complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 August 1993: FTC folds its inquiry, but the Justice Department officially 
launches its own people. 
</P>
<P>
 June 1993: Federal prosecutors say they are holding negotiations with 
Microsoft as they were close to filing a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 July 1994: Microsoft avoids a lawsuit by agreeing with Justice Department and 
the European Community to end unlawful anti-competitive practices.

6 GRUELING MONTHS -- AND NOW THE HARD PART; EARTHQUAKE: FUTURE STILL UNCERTAIN 
HALF A YEAR AFTER JAN. 17 DISASTER. 'IN A SENSE, WE'VE JUST BEGUN.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It began with a region rising from a night of death and cataclysm and fear, 
binding the wounds and taking the first steps toward recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the tales of heroes and rescues were replaced by a litany of mounting 
damage and disturbing questions about the safety of the buildings in which we 
sleep, work and park our cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, six months later, the most destructive earthquake in U.S. history has 
left a legacy of momentous violence, staggering loss, awesome compassion and 
courage, and great achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 It also presents an uncertain future of faltering insurers, a federal 
government struggling under the burden of the costliest U.S. domestic disaster, 
and a state and city without the resources to repair and rebuild businesses and 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists still cannot agree on where, exactly, the Northridge earthquake 
struck. And there is hardly any more sense of resolution in the numbers rising 
out of the damage inflicted from East Los Angeles and Glendale to Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, 20,089 dwellings have been abandoned, and almost 30,000 more 
are at risk. Some 86,393 structures of all types were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the 200,000 Southland applicants for the main federal relief program have 
been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred thousand tons of debris remain to be cleared, almost as much as 
has been taken away since the quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of steel-frame buildings, which before January were thought 
relatively invulnerable, have yet to be inspected for the sort of cracking 
discovered after the quake that mystified and alarmed engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hard-hit San Fernando Valley, 84% of all residents report some quake 
damage, and 30% say they have suffered financial reverses because of the 
disaster, according to a Los Angeles Times poll conducted last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, which suffered more than $700 million in damage, hundreds 
of homes and businesses in Fillmore and Simi Valley have been repaired and 
reoccupied. But Fillmore lost one-third of its vital business district. Piru's 
tiny downtown remains fenced and dark. And hundreds more property owners are 
grappling with repair bills that reach into the six figures -- some weighing 
whether they should fix up or walk away. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the numbers is a simple fact: It has taken most of the first six months 
of relentless struggle merely to understand the scope of the quake, and restore 
utilities and public transportation. The hard part is just beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake aftermath is characterized in two phases," said Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan. "Response -- that time immediately after the disaster -- 
and recovery, which is everything from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 "In a sense, we've just begun the long road to recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 It was four months before what may become this earthquake's signature 
phenomenon was identified: "ghost towns," areas where destruction was so 
concentrated that vandalism and decay threatened to wreck what the earthquake 
had left. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all that has been rebuilt, the most disquieting image may be the 164-unit 
Northridge Meadows Apartments, still standing and still drawing the curious, 
who peer into the crushed living spaces where 16 tenants died. Survivors were 
given until last Friday to remove their belongings, and demolition is about to 
begin. But the litigation over who is responsible for the collapse, like the 
recovery itself, will go on for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The end is too far in the future to see, and the cost still anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has allocated $12 billion to cover everything from cash 
grants for individuals to reimbursing local and state governments for repairs 
to public facilities such as freeways. Local and state officials are still 
desperately lobbying for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has issued 376,693 checks, averaging 
$2,834 each, for emergency repairs. The agency has also agreed to pay $714 
million for public facilities and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Private money continues to pour into the recovery in quantities that may never 
be tallied. Twenty million for ARCO's damage to the Santa Clara River and a 
neighborhood in San Fernando caused by oil-pipeline ruptures. For repairs to 
AT&T's eight-story Ventura Boulevard telephone switching building, $11 million. 
And CalArts, a small arts college in Valencia, will spend $19 million for 
repairs so far, borrowing to pay 300 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest victims may turn out to be an insurance company. From an 
estimate of $4.5 billion in April, insurance carriers have increased their 
projected losses to $6 billion. And that could climb, posing a potential crisis 
in the availability of earthquake and homeowners insurance across the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing nearly two-thirds of its operating surplus in projected payouts of $600 
million, Valley-based 20th Century Insurance Co. announced it would stop 
selling earthquake insurance immediately and phase out all homeowners coverage 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers Insurance Group, Allstate Insurance Cos. and many smaller companies 
have also cut back on selling earthquake insurance, and tightened up on selling 
new homeowners policies. Price increases are almost certainly on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is there any accounting of the human cost -- in disrupted lives, depleted 
bank accounts, and lost homes and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of earthquake victims still await word on their requests for Small 
Business Administration loans. And thousands of others have been denied 
assistance, primarily because of their weak financial condition. The rejection 
rate for SBA loans has been close to 50%, higher than for either Hurricane 
Andrew or the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA's strict eligibility requirements mystify property owners such as Ray 
Shouhed, an Iranian immigrant whose $500,000 investment in a half block of 
Reseda Boulevard storefronts turned to dust Jan. 17. Shouhed said that after 
completing a foot-thick application and waiting six months, his SBA loan 
application was turned down last week, with the agency saying his cash flow was 
insufficient. The previous owner has initiated foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all over," Shouhed said with a self-conscious smile. "What can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the costs not yet imposed, such as the price tag on future 
seismic safety requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Los Angeles City Council will consider ordering the owners of 
about 600 steel-frame buildings in the San Fernando Valley and Wilshire 
Corridor to inspect for damage. Meanwhile, repairs continue on dozens of 
damaged buildings despite experts' doubts that the methods are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 The potentially life-threatening failure of several concrete parking garages, 
some built under the latest seismic requirements, is forcing building officials 
and structural engineers to re-examine previously accepted construction 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 A seismic retrofitting program to be announced soon could require costly 
improvements to thousands more steel, wood-frame and concrete structures, said 
Nicolino Delli Quadri, earthquake spokesman for the Los Angeles Building and 
Safety Department. 
</P>
<P>
 How well is the recovery progressing? That's a question that comes under the 
heading of beauty in the eye of the beholder. For tourists and commuters, the 
picture is not nearly so bleak as it remains for students and some property 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to lessen a drop in tourism that has hit $308 million, the Los Angeles 
Convention & Visitors Bureau has launched a multimillion-dollar advertising 
campaign called "Play L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to tell people that we are OK," said Gary Sherwin, spokesman 
for the bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 That image of a city boldly grasping its destiny was bolstered by the 
extraordinary repair of Southern California's world-famous freeway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Fears of up to a year of commuter horrors were put to rest by an incentive 
program rewarding speedy work. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the Santa Monica Freeway in April, two months early, earned a 
$15-million bonus for contractor C.C. Myers. The ramps that remain closed on 
the freeway will be reopened Friday, four days ahead of schedule, Gov. Pete 
Wilson just announced. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the contractor on the downed Golden State Freeway over Gavin Canyon 
also finished more than a month early, restoring Southern California's 
commercial lifeline to the rest of the state. And key portions of the 
interchange between the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways were reopened 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Simi Valley Freeway, whose old surface is still being ground into a 
mountain of rubble as cars squeeze by in three lanes, remains to be fully 
restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Resumption of nearly normal freeway travel may have appeared to herald a quick 
completion of the recovery process for a majority of Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 But such optimism faded with the identification in May of 13 ghost towns in 
the San Fernando Valley and Hollywood. These areas, where there did not appear 
to be enough money or will to rebuild, raised the specter of large pockets that 
could become intractable villages for scavengers, vandals and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 City and law-enforcement officials moved quickly to clear out trespassers, 
erect fences and hire security guards. Owners and lenders were contacted. A row 
of abandoned apartments on Hubbard Street, one of the most precarious ghost 
towns, was heading en masse into foreclosure, said city housing consultant Rich 
Wallach. Hoping for city intervention, the lenders have agreed to work with all 
but one of the owners to restructure the debt and rebuild, Wallach said. City 
officials expect the rebuilding to last up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Though perhaps the most dramatic example, ghost towns represent only a small 
fraction of the damaged and endangered housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20,089 dwellings still vacant because of quake damage are down from 33,033 
on April 1, the city reported last week. So far, 26,841 building permits have 
been issued. Because there is no procedure for tracking final inspections, 
officials have no idea how many of those have been completed. In general, they 
say, early projects tended to be light repairs and rebuilding walls. Heavy 
construction -- such as a Sherman Oaks apartment building being lifted 
hydraulically so its first floor could be reconstructed -- has begun in earnest 
only in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, where 30% of the city was declared a redevelopment zone to 
help with the recovery, only one in four of the 1,900 housing units rendered 
uninhabitable have been repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 Those trying to fund repairs who have been turned down by the SBA have a last 
resort: the Los Angeles Housing Department, which has cobbled federal grants 
and bond financing into a fund that could reach $200 million to work with the 
toughest cases. State and local officials had planned a program three times 
that size until Wilson canceled it after California voters rejected a proposed 
bond issue for quake relief last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Also to aid those turned down by the SBA, Riordan said the federal Economic 
Development Administration will soon announce a $30-million revolving loan 
program to help restructure their loan portfolios. The council also is 
considering the creation of redevelopment "recovery zones" to offer tax 
increment financing for long-term recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica officials are also seeking more federal help to assist business 
owners and to shore up the Pacific Palisades bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some things will never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Administration officials have decided against rebuilding the crippled 
hospital in Sepulveda. Such trendy Ventura Boulevard spots as Johnny Rockets 
and Cafe Cordiale in Sherman Oaks will not reopen, at least in their old spots. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most seriously damaged hospitals, St. John's Hospital and Health 
Center in Santa Monica, will house only about half the 501 beds and employ half 
the 2,000 workers it had before the quake when it reopens Oct. 3. Trish Bartel, 
a spokeswoman for the hospital, said the downsizing probably would have 
occurred anyway because of changes under way in the health-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the new St. John's will represent a more accurate vision of the 
future. The future means more outpatient services, more in-home care, less of a 
need for in-patient beds," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But plenty of others are coming back stronger in spite of the quake. County 
health officials say they believe much of the estimated $400 million in federal 
earthquake repair dollars they expect to receive will be used to build a new, 
$1.3-billion hospital that will replace the existing County-USC Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Valley, the most expensive earthquake repairs -- millions of 
dollars more than that of the Santa Monica Freeway -- are at the Los Angeles 
Memorial Coliseum. Originally estimated at $35 million, the cost to fix a deep 
crack around the upper concourse, the weakened historic peristyle and the 
wrecked press box will run between $50 million and $60 million. Enough of the 
work is expected to be completed by the end of the summer to allow the Raiders 
and USC to play football in the stadium this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The pace of school repairs has been nowhere near as fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Students across the region will return in September to barricades and yellow 
tape, cracks in ceiling and floor tiles and possibly unusable gymnasiums and 
auditoriums. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage at schools ranged from the abandonment of Van Gogh Elementary in 
Granada Hills for a new site to minor cracks in ceilings and walls at other 
campuses across the massive Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the earthquake, Supt. Sid Thompson said he wanted the 160 damaged 
schools -- with total damage expected to be between $300 million and $600 
million -- to be either completely or partially repaired by January. But it 
appears that goal will elude him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to make the repairs without dipping into the school system's own 
coffers, the cash-short district has delayed the work while it pursues federal 
and state aid. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has so far received about $70 million from FEMA and has spent 
about $17 million on building repairs, safety and structural inspections and 
the replacement of lost or damaged textbooks, supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools outside the giant L.A. district were also hard hit. Alemany and L.A. 
Baptist high schools in the San Fernando Valley were forced to erect temporary 
facilities while they wait for repairs to be made on their gyms. Hart High in 
Santa Clarita will demolish its gym over the summer and will use other 
facilities in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be years before Cal State Northridge picks up the pieces after 
suffering $350 million in damage, the greatest loss from a natural disaster 
ever suffered by a U.S. university. 
</P>
<P>
 Although desperate preparations got the campus open only two weeks late for 
the spring semester, enrollment was down to 24,813, the lowest since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials anticipate another enrollment decline this fall despite 
harried efforts to ready student housing, the Oviatt Library and other 
buildings for the first day of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most classes, along with the campus art gallery, in fact, will be housed in 
several hundred portable classrooms trucked onto the campus last spring. 
Construction, fueled by $163 million in federal assistance so far approved, 
will continue across the 353-acre campus for years to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking into the future, economists see the earthquake as a minor irritant 
along Southern California's long road back to economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "This seems to be coming in as a very small event," said Larry Kimbell, 
director of UCLA's Business Forecasting Project. "I haven't seen any sign the 
quake has had a big impact" despite the billions of dollars of aid. He said the 
quake's long-term net economic effect will be only slightly negative. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to 800,000 jobs lost statewide since 1990, UCLA forecasters see a net 
loss of 30,000 attributable to the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 After an initial jump in January, Los Angeles County unemployment rates 
quickly returned to about 9.7% -- the annual average for 1993 -- and have 
remained stable since February. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail workers were hard hit because several large shopping centers and 
department stores were too damaged to reopen immediately. Overall, 9,400 retail 
jobs have been lost since January. But as malls and shops gradually reopen, 
many of the unemployed are returning to work. In May, the last month for which 
data is available, 1,700 people found work in retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, almost 5,000 new 
construction jobs were created in Los Angeles County -- the largest jump in 
more than two years -- between January and March. Analysts say the construction 
boom will continue at least through the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacancy levels for industrial and research space in the San Fernando Valley 
and adjoining areas dipped only slightly after the quake before returning to 
their earlier level of 14%. according to CB Commercial Real Estate Group Inc., 
which tracks 95-million square feet in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales in the city of Los Angeles fell from $1.9 billion in November to 
nearly $1.7 billion in January and February, but the numbers for March and 
April came back to around $1.9 billion, according to the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest-hit mall was Northridge Fashion Center. Workers recently completed 
the removal of asbestos and will soon begin structural repairs. The mall is due 
to reopen in mid-March, 1995, although its six anchor stores are expected to 
reopen at various times between November and next August. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of its parking structures will be rebuilt, including one that 
collapsed in the quake and three others that were damaged. Apart from the 
returning department stores, mall general manager Lloyd Miller said it is too 
early to tell how many of its 200 smaller shops will decide to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, the Robinsons-May anchor store partly reopened 
Thursday. At the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square, closed for two months, Broadway 
and Bullocks have also partly reopened and 92 smaller stores have returned, 
with 23 more in the process. Only four will not reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 For some Los Angeles institutions, the generosity of others has proved 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's emergency medical system didn't have enough staff to help the 
thousands who sought medical help, and special medical teams were called in 
from as far away as New Mexico. Impressed by the job they did, medical 
officials in Los Angeles are organizing their own teams, which will be 
available for future disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department Engine Company 70, which got help from out-of-town 
urban search and rescue teams pulling survivors from the Northridge Meadows 
Apartments, has been named the city's first such team, and will undertake 
training this year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the state level, politicians have yet to find a way to fund California's 
share of the cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike after Northern California's Loma Prieta quake, when the governor and 
legislators quickly settled on a temporary gasoline tax increase, jittery 
politicians passed the buck to voters this election year. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat of the earthquake bond proposal means California is left with no 
new source of funding to cover the 10% of the repair costs (the federal 
government pays the other 90%) to build highways, schools and colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators moved quickly to require that mobile homes -- one in 10 of which 
was rendered uninhabitable in Los Angeles County -- be securely attached to 
their foundations. Other proposals would offer property- and income-tax relief 
to quake victims, and allow withdrawal without penalty from retirement accounts 
for earthquake repair costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the most extensively measured earthquake in history has given 
scientists almost as much to debate as politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not settled, for instance, whether the earthquake occurred on a thrust 
fault branching off from the Elysian Park system, or on a hitherto-unknown 
easterly extension of the Oak Ridge fault from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The shaking intensities seemed among the highest ever recorded, until some 
scientists suggested a reason: No such recordings were taken in most previous 
big quakes. That debate may compound the difficulty of rewriting seismic safety 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people relate earthquakes to comfort and safety, not science. And on that 
score, the overriding lesson has been that quick reaction paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Kishton, coordinating officer for FEMA and a 22-year veteran of disaster 
relief, said he has never seen a better blending of federal, state and local 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a matter of days, a multibillion-dollar corporation was established with a 
500,000 customer base . . . over 10,000 federal, state and local employees . . 
. (in) 80 offices. That got set up in a matter of a week of 10 days," Kishton 
said. "You look at K mart or Sears. They spend years putting stuff on the 
drawing board."

A QUESTION OF HONOR; SURVIVORS OF 1944 NAVAL TRAGEDY SAY THEY WERE WRONGED BY 
COURTS-MARTIAL -- AND ERA'S RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The mutineers are all old men now. Until recently, most of them have said 
little about their ordeal 50 years ago: the deadly explosion, the bigotry, and 
the time they spent in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, these survivors of the tragedy at Port Chicago -- the deadliest 
stateside disaster of World War II -- are part of a growing movement to 
repudiate the racism of the era and clear their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we were charged with was just phony," Los Angeles resident Freddie 
Meeks, 74, one of 50 African American sailors convicted of mutiny, said 
bitterly. "We did not even commit mutiny." 
</P>
<P>
 Today is the 50th anniversary of the explosion at Port Chicago, the naval 
munitions base on Suisun Bay near Concord where black sailors in segregated 
units were assigned to load explosives onto ships around the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast killed 320 people -- including more than 200 African American seamen 
-- and injured 390. It was so powerful that it destroyed two ships, maimed 
sailors in their barracks and broke windows in the St. Francis Hotel 35 miles 
away in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, 258 surviving African American seamen refused to resume loading 
munitions, seeking safer working conditions and leave to visit their families 
like white sailors had received. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty black seamen were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison terms of 
up to 15 years. The rest were court-martialed for disobeying orders and 
sentenced to short terms in the stockade. After the war, under pressure from 
NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall, the Navy reduced the sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, six Democratic members of Congress from California, contending that the 
convictions were tainted by prejudice, are calling on President Clinton to 
clear the names of the convicted men. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should put this sorry chapter in racial relations behind us, and allow 
these remaining men to complete their lives knowing that they have the esteem 
and regard of their countrymen for their service during World War II," the 
elected officials said in a letter to the President last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those signing the letter were Sens. Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer 
and House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland). 
House Natural Resources Chairman George Miller (D-Martinez), who is leading the 
drive to expunge the convictions from the seamen's records, said the 258 men 
were the victims of bigotry and were unjustly found guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court-martials would never have occurred if not for the issue of race," 
Miller said. "These men have lived with this scar on their record throughout 
their lives. They have been viewed as having less than honorable service, which 
they clearly did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, survivors of the disaster, Miller, Navy officials and the National Park 
Service will dedicate a memorial to the dead at Port Chicago, now a part of the 
Concord Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 A new monument lists all of those who died in alphabetical order -- black and 
white side by side as they never were in life. A rusty, bent piece of metal 
recovered from one ship is mounted nearby, not far from the chunks of concrete 
and wood pilings that remain from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, the Port Chicago Naval Magazine was the biggest munitions 
depot on the West Coast. Crews of African American seamen, supervised by white 
officers, served as stevedores loading the explosives on ships bound for the 
Pacific Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The seamen never received training on how to handle munitions but were under 
heavy pressure to load the ships as quickly as possible. Munitions ranging from 
rifle rounds to 2,000-lb. shells were loaded by winch, slid down ramps or 
rolled on dollies. Some officers bet on which crew would load the fastest, and 
losing crews were punished with reduced liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of July 17, 1944, there were two explosions five seconds apart at 
the loading pier. The first was small. The second demolished two ships and the 
pier, killing everyone within 1,000 feet of the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ships, the Bryan and the 11,000-ton Quinault Victory, were thrown into 
the air and broken into small pieces. Arms, legs, heads and other body parts 
were strewn among the rubble. Many of the dead were never found. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 4,600 tons of explosives packed into the Bryan, the blast was 
more than a third as large as the explosion caused by the atomic bomb dropped 
on Hiroshima a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 The detonation measured 3.4 on the Richter scale and was felt as far away as 
Nevada. It caused heavy damage in the nearby town of Port Chicago and for miles 
around, prompting the filing of 10,000 claims by civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 No one ever determined what caused the explosion, but some survivors believe 
the rush to load the ships contributed to the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 With the loading pier destroyed, the surviving seamen were assigned to clear 
the debris and collect the body parts of their fellow seamen. While white 
officers and seamen were given leave to visit their families, the African 
American seamen were shipped to nearby Mare Island Naval Shipyard in Vallejo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the explosion, Seaman Percy Robinson was in his bunk. He 
suffered lacerations on his face and arm and was hospitalized for a week. Less 
than a month after the explosion, he was among a group of 258 men told they 
would resume loading munitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset because I wasn't allowed to come home on leave after I got 
wounded," said Robinson, now 70 and living in Los Angeles. "I was still 
bandaged at the time I was ordered to go back to work. I knew other sailors on 
our base who got wounded and they went home. None of the blacks who were 
wounded were allowed to go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and the other 257 men all refused to load munitions. But after the 
admiral in charge of the depot warned them they would be shot if they continued 
to refuse, he was among 208 seamen who agreed to go back to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of loading ships, however, they were sent to the stockade and 
court-martialed for disobeying orders. Robinson was sentenced to three months 
in the stockade and served 71 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he received an honorable discharge and went on to become a senior 
staff research engineer at Hughes Aircraft, but he could never be rid of the 
stain on his record. Until recently, he never mentioned it to his wife or 
children, but every time he applied for a security clearance he had to explain 
his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always there," he said, "but you learn to live with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Seaman Meeks was on liberty in San Francisco when the blast occurred. He heard 
on the radio that he was supposed to return to the base, but did not go back 
immediately. On his return, he was put in the brig and then assigned to guard 
the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, ordered to go back to work and facing the admiral's threat, Meeks 
joined 49 others and refused to budge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we would not go back and load the ships under those conditions," 
recalled Meeks, who went on to work for Los Angeles County and is now retired. 
"They only had the blacks loading and unloading the ammunition. The whites 
didn't have to touch it. It would scare you to death the way we had to handle 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 At their mutiny trial -- the Navy's largest ever -- the prosecutor argued that 
in time of war, the seamen's concern over unsafe conditions and fear of another 
explosion were not sufficient grounds for refusing to obey an order. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a month of testimony, the Navy judges took 80 minutes to reach 
their verdict: All 50 were guilty of mutiny. The mutineers were sentenced to 
hard labor and imprisoned on Terminal Island in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurgood Marshall, an NAACP attorney who was later appointed to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, spent weeks observing the trial and protested that the men were 
charged "solely because of their race and color." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand why whenever more than one Negro disobeys an order it is 
mutiny," Marshall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Roosevelt joined with Marshall in urging the Navy to be more lenient. 
In 1946, the Navy reduced the mutineers' sentences and released them after they 
had served about 16 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all the men were reassigned to other Navy duties and given a chance to 
redeem themselves. Most of the mutineers received a discharge "under honorable 
conditions," which gave them some veterans benefits but fell short of the 
coveted honorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Chicago case prompted the Navy to overhaul its procedures for 
handling ammunition -- and to begin ending segregation even before President 
Harry S. Truman ordered the military's integration in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, a book by Robert Allen titled "The Port Chicago Mutiny" and a 
subsequent documentary by KRON-TV in San Francisco revived the memory of the 
mutiny and called into question the treatment the men received. 
</P>
<P>
 Under orders from Congress to review the case, the Navy issued a report this 
year concluding that racial discrimination played a part in the seamen's work 
assignments and living conditions. But the Navy found that racial prejudice did 
not affect the courts-martial, convictions or sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (review) panel concluded that there was nothing unfair or unjust in the 
final outcome of any of the Port Chicago court-martials," the Navy said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the effort to expunge the record of the mutineers has the backing of Port 
Chicago survivors who obeyed orders and went back to work, such as Morris 
Soublet, then a second-class bosun's mate who supervised loading of the ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the men had signed up to fight the enemy and found themselves working 
as laborers without proper training and in unsafe conditions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't afraid of getting on a ship and getting shot at," said Soublet, 
73, who lives in Oakland. "They just didn't want to handle ammunition." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young seaman at Port Chicago, Robert Routh was blinded in his barracks by 
flying glass and was discharged from the Navy. Now 69 and a Veterans 
Administration counselor in Los Angeles with a master's degree in sociology, he 
believes the court-martialed sailors got a raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to see the efforts to right this wrong," he said. "But I'm still 
appalled that the Navy Department will not look at the facts and right the 
wrongs that were perpetrated against these people." Deadly Blast 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, 320 people were killed in an explosion at the Port Chicago 
munitions depot -- the largest single wartime loss of life in the continental 
United States. Most of those who died were black sailors, who served in 
segregated units and loaded munitions onto ships. After the blast, 258 black 
seamen refused to resume work and were court-martialed.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; ALMOST ANYTHING GOES AT BAWDY BEACH PARTY; SAN DIEGO'S 
OVER-THE-LINE ANNUAL TOURNAMENT CROSSES THE BOUNDARIES OF TASTE AND POLITICAL 
CORRECTNESS. BUT IT CARRIES A TOUCH OF RESPECTABILITY BECAUSE ITS SPONSOR IS A 
MAJOR CHARITABLE PLAYER IN THE CITY.

<TEXT>
<P>
 To be fully believed, the World Championship Over-the-Line Tournament must be 
seen and heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it as a cross between Annette Funicello's "Beach Blanket Bingo" and 
Fellini's "Satyricon." 
</P>
<P>
 It is arguably the raunchiest officially sanctioned event on the coastline of 
California. It is San Diego's contribution to the beach culture, played two 
weekends each July on the sands of Fiesta Island next to Mission Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with the names of the 1,100 three-person teams who play the beach 
softball game that is the stated reason for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The names are so X-rated that no newspaper or television station will use any 
but the tamest of them. Not that the San Diego media shuns Over-the-Line. In 
fact, 21 media teams are entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Team names include every imaginable double-entendre, innuendo and outright 
tasteless sexual reference. The women's names are as raw as the men's. Names 
invoking Lorena and John Bobbitt and President and Hillary Rodham Clinton were 
popular this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The event's sponsor, the Old Mission Beach Athletic Club, says that only two 
topics are forbidden for team names: Anything mocking John Wayne and anything 
referring to the 1978 PSA crash in San Diego that killed 150 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcer for Over-the-Line -- a lawyer in real life -- booms the names 
continually over a mega-decibel public address system as teams are ordered 
about the 40 courts. The effect is a decidedly salacious tone for the four-day 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're irreverent, but our hearts are in the right place," OMBAC official Ron 
House said. "It's all good, clean fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Thornton, a feminist lawyer in San Diego, calls Over-the-Line "a 
no-taste zone" that she prefers to avoid. Attendance for the 41st annual 
tournament, which ends today, was an estimated 75,000, with men greatly 
outnumbering women. 
</P>
<P>
 The queen of Over-the-Line is Ms. Emerson, whose appellation comes from an 
off-color knock-knock joke. To be selected as Ms. Emerson is an honored 
achievement for some in the beach communities. One year's Ms. Emerson married a 
lawyer who eventually served on the City Council and is now a Republican 
candidate for the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of this year's souvenir program is a warm letter of support from 
Gov. Pete Wilson, a booster of Over-the-Line since his days as San Diego mayor. 
There is also an official proclamation from Mayor Susan Golding. 
</P>
<P>
 The program announces the dates for the 1995 tournament by showing them 
written on the bare buttocks of four women. Men are also shown with bare 
buttocks. 
</P>
<P>
 How, you may ask, can an event so culturally retrograde be not only permitted 
on public property but honored and encouraged by local officialdom, especially 
in this post-Tailhook era? 
</P>
<P>
 One answer is that Over-the-Line, as a beach sport, was invented in San Diego 
in the 1950s and the tournament had become a local institution before social 
mores changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The second answer lies with the Old Mission Beach Athletic Club, which, 
despite its beer-swilling, beach-rat image, is one of San Diego's most publicly 
spirited service groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only OMBAC could get away with this," said Kathie Baczysnski, a 30ish home 
economics teacher who was in the crowd on opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 OMBAC consists of 450 members and is replete with lawyers, developers, 
carpenters, real estate agents, teachers and 28 police officers. Most are 
confirmed beach enthusiasts -- surfers, lifeguards, volleyball players, 
swimmers -- who refuse to capitulate to middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 Profits from the concessions and entry fees from Over-the-Line are used by 
OMBAC for a long list of charitable activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund-raising for muscular dystrophy? OMBAC. Toys for poor children at 
Christmas? OMBAC. When the Pacific Beach Christmas Parade needed a sponsor? 
OMBAC. Youth athletics and sports activities for handicapped children? OMBAC. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Boys' Club in a poor neighborhood needed renovation and painting, it 
was OMBAC that responded. When a center for AIDS patients needed work before it 
could open, OMBAC members volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, when then-Mayor Maureen O'Connor needed help organizing a parade for 
America's Cup winner Dennis Conner, she turned to OMBAC. Ditto when she was 
concerned about security for the priceless Faberge eggs on loan to San Diego 
for a Soviet arts festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "More cities should have groups like OMBAC," said O'Connor, who regularly 
attends Over-the-Line and helps the group sell hot dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even feminist leaders in San Diego are loathe to say anything too negative 
about the bawdy extremes of the beach bacchanal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Coburn, president of the San Diego chapter of the National 
Organization for Women, said NOW disapproves of the attitudes toward women 
displayed at Over-the-Line, but prefers to devote its energy to more important 
issues such as abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be great if the good old boys from Over-the-Line would just 
continue doing their charitable deeds and not consider having women as toys as 
one of the fringe benefits," Coburn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the participants know little or nothing of OMBAC's charitable 
activities. All they know is that Over-the-Line is the mother of all beach 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fabulous," said Andy Woolley, 23, who runs a potato chip company. "It's 
20,000 fraternity guys reliving the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Tricia Tryon, 24, a topless dancer from Lemon Grove, strolled through the 
crowd wearing a lavender string bikini and a beeper: "In case somebody needs 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego police officers walk the sandy grounds, pose for pictures with Ms. 
Emerson, and turn a tolerant eye to all but the most egregious cases of 
rowdiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking a woman to bare her breasts is considered acceptable at Over-the-Line. 
If a woman complies, a crowd gathers. The souvenir program contains topless 
photos, as well as a list of team names. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls who come to Over-the-Line know exactly what they're getting into," said 
Sue Giansiracusa, 31, a mortgage banker. "Many of them are happy to bare 
everything if they're asked correctly." 
</P>
<P>
 Banners are hung by businesses that figure Over-the-Line participants might be 
good customers: ROCK 102.1 radio station, Jose Cuervo, Bacardi, Deja Vu strip 
joint and King Stahlman Bail Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans arrive early, pitch their awnings, lean back in their beach chairs 
and survey the passing scene. Mass quantities of beer are consumed. Many fans 
express surprise that there are athletic contests going on somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Miller, 32, an airline flight attendant, has been coming to 
Over-the-Line for several years. This year she adorned her patch of sand with 
plastic pink flamingos. She never plays the game, but would not miss the 
spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Mardi Gras of Southern California," she said.

ON CALIFORNIA: A JULY SUNDAY IN L.A. . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody seems to save newspapers anymore, not even newspaper offices. To read a 
complete Los Angeles Times from a Sunday morning 10 years ago requires hours at 
a library, reconstructing the paper from microfilm, page by blurry page. What 
emerges from this tedium, though, is a remarkable -- if somewhat skewed -- 
looking glass back into another time, and seemingly another city. 
</P>
<P>
 The major foreign crisis of the day -- July 22, 1984 -- was set in Poland, 
where the Communists were under pressure to free political prisoners. The most 
prominent death was that of Jim Fixx, the fitness guru who collapsed while 
jogging. Inside the front section Geraldine Ferraro, the new Democratic nominee 
for vice president, was pictured pushing a grocery cart through a supermarket. 
Ah, enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sports, a baseball roundup noted that Dodger relief pitcher Steve Howe, 
serving his first suspension for substance abuse, was hawking used cars on late 
night television. A business columnist declared that the 15% mortgage was here 
to stay. Cellular car phones were advertised for $2,195. And in a letter to the 
editor, Phyllis Hall Stephens wrote to thank firefighters for saving her home 
"from the dreadful fire in the Hollywood Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Dominating the edition was news about the 1984 Olympics, set to open in L.A. 
in less than a week. The front page reported the Olympic torch relay's arrival 
in the city. A large color photo captured a celebrity torchbearer bounding up a 
hill into Santa Monica. "Every time I thought I was getting tired," the runner 
was quoted as saying, "I would hear the crowd's cheering, and that would keep 
me going." The runner was O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Like I said, another time, another city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I remember that day. I remember waiting with other reporters for Simpson to 
catch his breath before he obliged us with a quote. I also remember, in a 
larger sense, that time in the city. Los Angeles in 1984 was full of itself. 
The city of suburbs had grown up. It had developed both economic muscle and 
culture. It had developed a skyline. It had arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympics were to serve as a debut, an international coming out party. "Two 
and a half billion people," Peter Ueberroth was quoted as telling a rally of 
his Olympic workers, "half of the living, breathing people on Earth, are going 
to be looking out here and watching us." Evidence of a general municipal 
preening could be found in almost every section of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 In Real Estate, a Downtown condominium development offered this testimonial 
from a tenant: "I left L.A. years ago for Newport Beach -- When I saw the 
Skyline, I moved back." A soap opera actor who carried the flame down Sunset 
Boulevard was quoted about the large spectator turnout: "It shows that the 
people here can come together when it counts." Sunday Calendar, in its effort 
to document what the new L.A. offered the world, examined the migration of 
movie industry figures to Malibu. "My favorite metaphor for Malibu," one 
screenwriter was quoted as saying, "is the airplane flying across the ocean. 
The planes flying in bring all the new talent. And the planes flying out cart 
away all the old talent." 
</P>
<P>
 There was evidence that this tower of self-affection was on more than mere 
feathers. In the classifieds, the "jobs offered" category ran for a remarkable 
71 full pages. Major aerospace companies made full-page appeals for engineering 
talent. "Skunk Works engineering is legendary," enthused Lockheed in its ad. 
"Become a part of that legend." Elsewhere, construction permit applications 
were reported running at an all-time high. New companies moving into Los 
Angeles were listed in small type. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, the Skunk Works is a vacant relic. Now the planes flying out 
are watched with distress, and company departures are reported in full doomsday 
detail. Now, "when it counts," the city often seems determined to pull apart. 
And the last time O.J. traveled a road lined with a cheering crowd, he carried, 
not a Grecian flame, but a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, it is possible to pick through the L.A. Times from that 
Sunday morning in 1984 and spot the cracks. The police commissioner's concern, 
voiced in a Metro story, about the new menace of gang violence. The economist's 
warning that the boom in housing starts could not last, a warning that merited 
four paragraphs. The complaint from minority-owned businesses that Olympic 
opportunity was not trickling down to all quarters of the city. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 To travel back into that time now is to wonder, finally, what in fact was 
real. A city on the cusp of greatness? A city on the brink of decline? And what 
then to make of the news that landed on the doorstep today, another Sunday in 
July? Is it possible that things aren't as bad now as we thought they were good 
then?

MEXICO REBELS TAKE PRIDE IN OWN DEMOCRACY; TRADITION: A HYBRID OF INDIAN 
CUSTOMS AND LIBERATION THEOLOGY, THE CONSULTATIVE PROCESS EMPHASIZES CONSENSUS.

 Half-squatting on the narrow benches of the cramped one-room schoolhouse, 
seven delegates from the village of Ibarra mopped sweat from their foreheads 
with red bandannas and took turns writing notes in a graph-paper tablet. 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of the classroom, a man in a white palm-leaf hat was talking in 
Tzeltal, the most common of the four indigenous languages spoken in Ibarra and 
in the region of the southern state of Chiapas where peasants rose up against 
the Mexican government on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers followed his comments on a 32-page document. Written in Spanish, 
the document was used by the Zapatista National Liberation Army to analyze the 
peace proposal the government made in March. The rebels rejected the proposal 
last month after a three-month consultation process that began at meetings like 
this one, though last week they agreed to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Harsh critics of the government's lack of democracy, the Zapatistas take pride 
in their own decision-making process, a form of referendum they call 
consultation with the masses. The results of that process surprised some 
analysts, not because the peace plan was rejected but because of the margin by 
which it was rejected: 97.88%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a government or organization claims to have gotten 98% of the vote, 
I get skeptical," wrote Sergio Sarmiento, political columnist for the business 
newspaper El Financiero. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts who have studied villages in the despoiled remnants of this rain 
forest say the numbers are reasonable because the style of democracy practiced 
here emphasizes consensus rather than confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is never a 60-40 vote in indigenous communities," said Neil Harvey, a 
political scientist at Brown University who has done research in Chiapas. "They 
keep discussing it until everybody is in agreement. This can take from several 
days to several months." 
</P>
<P>
 Zapatista democracy is a hybrid of Indian customs and the ideas brought to the 
jungle by social workers and priests who believed in liberation theology, a 
movement in the Roman Catholic Church that emphasizes grass-roots religion and 
cooperation. As the rain forest was settled over the past three decades, those 
ideas have developed in a climate of betrayal by a succession of leaders that 
has fostered a general distrust of leadership. The result is an elaborate form 
of direct democracy that relies on constant consultation with the rank and 
file. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long before they took up arms, there was a tradition of collective 
decision-making," said Luis Hernandez, a social critic who works in a 
cooperative for coffee growers with plots smaller than five acres, like many in 
this jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian settlers from the Chiapas highlands brought the tradition of 
cooperation with them when they began to colonize the jungle in the 1960s, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That foundation was reinforced by the priests who accompanied the settlers. 
They encouraged the colonists by turning their sojourn into a pilgrimage to the 
Promised Land with readings from Exodus -- translated into Tzeltal. 
</P>
<P>
 They also educated villagers who showed leadership skills and developed the 
kind of grass-roots Christian base communities that were evolving throughout 
Latin America. These were communities of believers who worked together to 
overcome their miserable conditions and to build a better future. 
</P>
<P>
 "They promoted collective practices and reinforced the role of the family and 
the community," Hernandez said. The church remains vital in isolated jungle 
communities. Every day at dusk, the church bell in Ibarra rings and villagers 
file quietly into the settlement's only painted building. They pray silently 
for five minutes and then resume their daily chores. 
</P>
<P>
 Collective decision-making was honed during the 1970s, when the colonists were 
threatened with expulsion because of government efforts to save the last North 
American rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibarra was one of the villages scheduled for destruction. "We knew that we all 
had to work together or we would lose everything," recalled one middle-aged man 
who, like many Zapatista sympathizers, refused to identify himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Villagers banded together with the help of outsiders from the northern city of 
Torreon who had organized poor urban neighborhoods to demand services, 
Hernandez said. Known as the Union of the People, they firmly believed in Mao 
Tse-tung's ideas of confidence in the masses. Their ideology fit well with the 
collective traditions developing among the Lacandon settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, once a decision was reached, settlers would pitch in money to 
send a representative to the state capital to make their demands known. 
Occasionally, they raised the $200 air fare to the nearest town with a paved 
road, where the representative could catch a bus. Normally, the person chosen 
walked or rode a mule for four days over muddy trails to town. The result was 
usually the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sold us out," said an outspoken woman who gave her name as Oralia. "They 
came back with new boots, new clothes and no results." 
</P>
<P>
 After 15 years of struggle, the government redrew the boundaries for the 
Lacandon reserve in 1989 and let the settlers keep the land they now farm but 
prohibited further incursions into the jungle. The experience undercut the 
settlers' faith in representatives but helped them build a structure for making 
collective decisions and resisting the government together. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey witnessed the decision-making process while doing field research seven 
years ago in Venustiano Carranza, a town near the region now controlled by the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were deciding whether to lead a demonstration to the state capital in 
Tuxtla Gutierrez," he recalled, "whether that was the correct action to take, 
or to continue negotiating with the government." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, as it often is in Chiapas, was a land dispute. A demonstration 
would require a trek to the city, carrying supplies, sleeping outdoors and 
leaving land and livestock to the care of a few who stayed behind. The product 
of all that sacrifice might simply be angering the government and spoiling the 
negotiations. The question was hashed out over two days of assemblies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Core groups of leaders did most of the talking," Harvey said. "They would 
break up into small groups that drew their own conclusions, then went back to 
the general assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they finished, everyone had agreed they should march on the state 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Even reporters taking the pulse of rebel sentiment are expected to conduct 
interviews in front of the entire community. An assembly is called, and 
everyone who wants to speak expresses a viewpoint on each question. And 
everyone listens. 
</P>
<P>
 When private conversations about this year's crop or village history turn to 
political questions, Zapatistas usually demur politely, suggesting, "Let's save 
that for the assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that tradition, the seven delegates from Ibarra hiked for two days 
from their village to a rebel base camp to hear Zapatista representatives 
explain the peace proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all came to make sure we understood," one man said in a group interview 
during a break in the assembly. "Relying on one person could lead to mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 That was a diplomatic way of saying that Zapatista villages no longer trust a 
single delegate. "Sending a committee is a kind of guarantee," Hernandez said. 
"They keep an eye on each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ibarra delegation took its responsibilities seriously, filling the 
graph-paper tablet with explanations for words that do not translate easily 
from Spanish into Tzeltal, such as autonomy.  
</P>
<P>
 Once all the delegates were certain they understood the proposal, they 
returned to their communities to discuss the plan. Photos in the Mexico City 
newspaper La Jornada showed voting by raised hands and tallies on chalkboards, 
which most reporters were not allowed to see. 
</P>
<P>
 That glimpse of Zapatista democracy contrasts sharply with the federal 
elections that rebels watched in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 104 voter precincts were set up in Ocosingo -- a county about half the 
size of Delaware in a state where barely one-fifth of the roads are paved. Most 
of the Zapatista-held territory is in Ocosingo. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to vote, peasants had to walk for hours," Hernandez said. 
Nevertheless, election results show that 20,931 people voted in Ocosingo in 
1991, nearly 200 voters per precinct. Less than three years before residents 
took up arms against the government, 72% voted for the ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, according to official vote tallies. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez does not believe those figures. "It's obvious that they stuffed the 
ballot boxes," he said. "The election did not reflect the concerns of the 
voters." 
</P>
<P>
 With that history, observers said, Zapatistas are understandably skeptical 
about the presidential elections scheduled Aug. 21. While no one expects the 
federal government to transform the national political system into the 
elaborate consultation system common in Indian communities, some observers say 
the government could learn from the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The regime of a ruling party is over," Hernandez said. "It must be modified 
into a democratic system."

ITALY INTERIOR MINISTER SET TO QUIT OVER JAIL DECREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Italy's Interior Minister Roberto Maroni said Saturday that he is ready to 
resign over a decree backed by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi that lifts the 
threat of jail from corruption suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Maroni, a member of the federalist Northern League, told Italian television he 
had asked his party to decide by today whether he should stay at his post and 
called for the decree to be scrapped in its entirety, rather than amended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am ready to resign my mandate on Monday," Maroni said. 
</P>
<P>
 His statement turned a political storm over the decree into a full-blown 
crisis for Berlusconi's 2-month-old coalition government, swept to power on a 
wave of public disgust with corruption in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The League, which built its reputation on fighting graft, is the biggest party 
in Parliament and ensures Berlusconi's three-party coalition its majority. 
</P>
<P>
 Maroni made his threat just hours after Berlusconi said he was backing the 
decree to the hilt and would amend it only to make it harder for magistrates to 
hold suspects in preventive detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting talk of a whitewash for corrupt politicians as a "despicable lie," 
the media tycoon said in a statement: 
</P>
<P>
 "I may be courting unpopularity, but I will do everything in my power to empty 
the prisons of everyone held there against the universal principles of human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "No citizen should be imprisoned without first being convicted. In Italy, in 
the Second Republic, justice must return to being a model of civility." 
</P>
<P>
 Four leading members of Milan's elite pool of "Clean Hands" magistrates 
spearheading the assault on graft told their superiors Saturday that they are 
resigning their high-profile posts. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which Berlusconi says was approved unanimously by his Cabinet, 
was issued Wednesday and removes corruption, bribery and a string of other 
crimes from a list of offenses for which suspects can be held in preventive 
detention in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Maroni said the published text differed from a draft he had approved and 
insisted that he had received assurances that corruption suspects would not be 
freed.

FLEEING RWANDAN TROOPS SHOOT AND LOOT; AFRICA: SOME UNITS ESCAPE INTO ZAIRE 
BEHIND CIVILIANS. REBELS AIR AN APPEAL FOR SURRENDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN C. RANDAL, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edgy Rwandan government troops, intoxicated on beer and marijuana, 
systematically looted this onetime resort town on the border with Zaire on 
Saturday and randomly fired revolvers and automatic weapons to discourage any 
effort to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday morning, a French colonel commanding two dozen troops sent in from 
nearby Goma to evacuate 168 Hutu orphans told his men, "Watch out, because the 
Rwandan soldiers are hashed to the eyeballs." 
</P>
<P>
 As the troops gutted government offices, stores and private homes, cargo 
aircraft roared overhead, bringing in the first emergency relief supplies for 
the hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees who have crossed into Zaire for fear 
of reprisal by predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels have taken over most of the country since Hutu majority extremists 
began massacring Tutsis and moderate Hutus after an unexplained plane crash 
killed Rwanda's Hutu president April 6. Up to half a million Rwandans have died 
in the upheaval, according to U.N. estimates, and even more have fled the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials in Goma, Gisenyi's sister city across the Zaire border, 
estimated that more than 500,000 refugees have crossed over since Thursday, 
while others have given lower figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Long after nightfall, the sound of automatic arms and explosions here was 
audible miles away in Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 And still later, some government troops retreated with their weapons over the 
border into Zaire as rebel forces said they had reached the outskirts of 
Gisenyi, Reuters news service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporters close to the border saw at least 20 trucks loaded with Rwandan 
troops and four anti-aircraft guns drive through Goma, the agency added. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuters also reported that the Tutsi-led front, in a radio broadcast, called 
on government troops to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call upon all those soldiers . . . and citizens who have fled to Gisenyi 
or other areas, to give themselves up to the RPF forces and return to their 
homes, instead of continuing to listen to those who have cheated them and have 
launched a war which they cannot fight," said rebel Radio Rwanda, monitored by 
the British Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Augustin Bizimungu, the Rwandan army's chief of staff, summed up the 
situation as "catastrophic" as he emerged from a meeting at Goma's airport with 
Maj. Gen. Romeo Dallaire, commander of the U.N. force trying to end more than 
three months of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the International Committee of the Red Cross estimated that 800,000 
Hutus would cross into Zaire, disaster relief specialists began to express 
cautious optimism about Africa's worst refugee crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lionel A. Rosenblatt, president of Washington-based Refugees International, 
said, "I think we can still avert a disaster, despite a slower start than we 
would have liked." Two flights carrying a total of 60 tons of corn arrived in 
Goma from neighboring Uganda, the first contribution from the United Nations' 
refugee relief agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing our best to cope with a lack of adequate preparedness," agency 
spokesman Panos Moumtzis told reporters. He acknowledged the shipments 
represented "just a drop in the ocean," but said air deliveries by Monday 
should amount to 240 tons a day, with the bulk of the 600 tons needed daily 
coming by road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Cross flew in 34 tons of plastic sheeting for shelters but expressed 
concern about fighting among refugees for equitable distribution.

KIDNAPED BABY FOUND; BRITONS REJOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Television viewers rejoiced, nurses cried and the police drew sighs of relief 
Saturday when an infant girl -- abducted four hours after her birth in a 
Nottingham hospital -- was returned safely to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The agony for the couple, Roger and Karen Humphries, ended after police raided 
a house in Nottingham less than a mile from the Queen's Medical Center where 
the infant, Abbie, was snatched 15 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 journalists broke into spontaneous applause Saturday as Karen 
Humphries carried her little girl into a news briefing to thank all who had 
helped in the "nightmare" search for the kidnaped baby, whose fate had 
captivated Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Infant Abbie was taken from her mother at the hospital by a woman wearing a 
nurse's uniform and disappeared. But security cameras showed a rear shot of a 
young woman walking down a corridor, in civilian clothes, with a baby in her 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Nottingham police mounted an unprecedented search for little Abbie, calling on 
residents to report any suspicious circumstances in their neighborhoods 
involving new babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humphries family made several appearances on television and in the press 
appealing to the abductors to return Abbie. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested three people in the home where Abbie was found: 
Susan Gilbert, her son Leigh, about 20, and his girlfriend, Julie, also about 
20. The girlfriend was later charged, and the other two were released. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers, however, said they had received a tip from an unidentified woman 
that led them to the Gilbert house in Nottingham. 
</P>
<P>
 One midwife also said she had become suspicious when she was told that the 
household had a new baby called Lucy but that the couple went out alone without 
the infant. She checked records but could find no trace of a home birth, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Humphries said of the moment she was able to hold her baby again: "It 
was just wonderful, wonderful." She said she particularly wanted to thank the 
person who led police to her baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors pronounced the infant to be well and unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby's safe return dispelled the depression that had enveloped the 
hospital, with nurse Lindsay Thompson saying: "The atmosphere in the hospital 
is just bubbling. Everyone is thrilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Humphries, speaking of the police, public and media, declared, "Everyone 
has been brilliant."

2 ARAB DIPLOMATS DISAPPEAR, FEARED KIDNAPING VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Arab ambassadors were reported missing Saturday in a possible kidnaping. 
Their disappearance follows the killings by Islamic extremists of 14 
foreigners, most Europeans, in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-one foreigners have been killed since extremists began targeting them in 
September, but kidnapings have been rare. Arabs had not been victims of the 
violence and considered themselves relatively safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The burnt wreckage of the car the ambassadors of Yemen and Oman were riding in 
was found Friday near Khemis el Kechna, 20 miles east of Algiers, the Algerian 
security services reported. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of the two diplomats, identified as Ambassador Hilal ibn 
Salem ibn Hamoud Siyabi of Oman and Ambassador Askar Ali Hussain of Yemen, the 
security services reported. A search was mounted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Algerians reported only that the pair had disappeared. But the Oman 
Foreign Ministry said the diplomats had been kidnaped.

CLINTON TELLS STORY OF MURDERED BOY TO PRESS CRIME BILL'S PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Invoking the "terrible story" of a 9-year-old boy murdered after expressing 
his fears of death, President Clinton on Saturday called on Congress to quickly 
pass a punishment-and-prevention crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In his weekly radio address, Clinton told the story of James Darby of New 
Orleans, who wrote the President with a request that he "stop the killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The April 29 letter read: 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Mr. Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
 "I want you to stop the killing in the city. I think somebody might kill me. 
I'm asking you nicely to stop it. I know you can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton added the sequel: 
</P>
<P>
 "Just nine days later, walking home from a Mother's Day picnic, James Darby, 
age 9, was shot in the head and killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he had no way of guaranteeing that his Administration's crime 
bill would have saved the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I can tell you with absolutely no doubt that it will save other lives; 
and without it, we have no hope of giving a new sense of purpose and safety to 
our people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton said that after nearly six years of debating, "the American people 
have asked for action, but all they've gotten is gridlock." 
</P>
<P>
 "That waiting has to end, and end now," he said. " . . . The random violence 
violates our values, our sense of family, our community, our whole hope for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years both houses of Congress have passed comprehensive crime bills 
and both have done so this year. But the House and Senate have been unable to 
agree on final legislation, reconciling differences between the measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, Congress has been stymied by an either/or debate over the false 
choice between tougher punishment or smarter prevention," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he contended that most Americans want both, believing that criminals 
should be punished and that young people from poor communities should have 
"something to say yes to, to turn away from a life of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the latest version of the crime bill does both, providing strict 
punishment for violent offenders, earmarking $8 billion to build new jails, 
setting aside another $8 billion for prevention programs and recruiting 100,000 
police officers over five years.

NASA SALUTES LEGENDARY MOON SHOT ON SMALL SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA on Saturday celebrated the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11's liftoff with a 
countdown replay, with the launch of four model rockets, and without the crew. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apollo 11 astronauts declined to attend the morning ceremony and sent 
regrets for a commemorative dinner. (All three attended the 20th anniversary 
launch ceremony.) 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of the first two men to walk on the moon -- Neil A. Armstrong and 
Edwin E. (Buzz) Aldrin Jr. -- and their fellow crewman Michael Collins, the 
National Aeronautics and Space Administration settled for the last man on the 
moon and one who lost his chance to walk on the lunar surface because of an 
accident on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 500 people gathered for the launch ceremony at the space center, 
just three miles from where Apollo 11 blasted off at 6:32 a.m. PDT on July 16, 
1969. Four days later, Armstrong and Aldrin became the first humans to walk on 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the celebrators had worked on Apollo 11 and are now retired or in 
different professions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time in space, the crew of the shuttle Columbia was informed by 
Mission Control of the historic moment. The command module of Apollo 11 also 
was named Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Columbia's journey today, as her namesake did back then, is pushing the 
frontiers of knowledge and science for all mankind, and we thank you," Mission 
Control's Mario Runco told the seven shuttle astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Runco then told commander Robert Cabana that the shuttle had been cleared to 
fire its engines for the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't we wish," Cabana said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first shuttle crew to be in space during an Apollo 11 anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty amazing that it's been that long since we walked on the moon," 
Cabana said earlier in the flight. "But we hope with the efforts we're making 
back here in the lab . . . we think it's going to pay off, and we think we're 
paving the way for future space station operations and hopefully expanding 
beyond this planet again in our exploration." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Earth, Apollo 13 astronaut Fred Haise, now an aerospace company 
executive, stood in for Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins on Saturday just as he 
did in 1969 as part of the Apollo 11 backup crew. An oxygen tank explosion on 
his way to the moon in 1970 stole his chance to walk on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo 17 commander Eugene Cernan, the last man to walk on the moon, in 
December, 1972, was the Apollo 11 crew substitute for the Saturday 
commemorative dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Haise said he expected back then that, after Apollo, humans would return to 
the moon in his lifetime. He still believes humans will explore the solar 
system and beyond, "though not as quickly as many of us who are in the autumn 
of our careers would like to see."

DIE-HARD SOCCER FANS FIND FUN EVEN IN 3RD-PLACE GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It seems somehow un-American -- two losers battling it out for third place. 
Just ask the scalpers outside the Rose Bowl before Saturday's World Cup 
consolation round matchup between Bulgaria and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brutal," said one, hawking two $100 tickets for the price of one. "It's 
got to be the worst game of the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury, as far as scalpers were concerned, was the 
nationality of the players. "It's two no-name teams," said the man pushing two 
for one. "How many Swedes are there in L.A.? Or Bulgarians?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, actually there were quite a few Swedes, or at least Swedish partisans -- 
dressed unmistakably in blue and yellow, often sporting blue-and-yellow plastic 
horns atop their heads ("for the Vikings.") 
</P>
<P>
 And where there weren't Swedes, there were Germans, Italians, English, Irish, 
Mexicans and more among the legions of fans from all over the world who 
converged on the Rose Bowl on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say this game doesn't matter, but it does matter," Arla Terrell, 
who came from Thousand Oaks, her face painted completely blue and yellow in 
homage to the Swedish team, said beforehand. "It does matter in your heart. You 
know you've come in third in the whole world." 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, football and college basketball long ago nixed 
third-place games. But in World Cup soccer, it's a tradition. "I know it's not 
an American style for losers to play, but it's always a pleasant game," said 
Guido Tognoni, spokesman for FIFA, the soccer federation. "This is the only 
game of 52 games which can be played with pleasure and no pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was the losing Bulgarian team compelled to play a consolation game, 
but members had to suffer the added indignity of schlepping all the way across 
the country from New York, where they last played, to the Rose Bowl -- before 
heading back to the East Coast to travel home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're professional players, why shouldn't they do it?" said Tognoni, 
unmoved. "FIFA pays $500,000 per team per appearance. So this is not bad money 
just to make a five-hour flight." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the third-place game, as Tognoni describes it, is far from the 
exercise in pointlessness and humiliation that some might judge it to be. It's 
often a display of virtuosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, the (third place) game was between Italy and England, and it 
was the most beautiful match of the tournament," Tognoni said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the score of Saturday's game wound up being 4-0 Sweden, many soccer 
fans had expected a good match between the Swedes and Bulgaria, precisely 
because no championship was at issue. "They don't have anything to be on edge 
about," said David Driver, 46, of Murrieta, with his soccer-playing 16-year-old 
daughter, Zara, in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the third-place game is something you usually don't hear 
discussed in American sports. If it's not for first place, no one wants to 
watch it, let alone dissect the finer plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the Olympics -- where third place means the difference between a 
bronze medal and nothing -- mustering the motivation can be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 When the U.S. Olympic water polo team went to the 1992 Games gunning for the 
gold they had narrowly missed winning in two previous Games, they ended up 
losing again and playing for the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't care -- to put it bluntly," said Bruce Wigo, executive director 
of U.S. Water Polo Inc., which oversees water polo competition in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 But certainly the soccer fans Saturday were not indifferent about the prospect 
of two defeated teams going at it for less than first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We follow the Swedish team all the way," said Niklas Ivenholt, a Swede who 
has been tailing his team around the United States on its World Cup odyssey. 
For his efforts, he has a sunburned nose and new friends from Sweden whom he 
met at the World Cup games. Like him, they were philosophical and full of 
national pride about Sweden's appearance in the consolation game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't expecting we would go so far," said Klas Andersson. "So this is a 
big success."

DISNEY'S EISNER RECUPERATING AFTER HEART BYPASS SURGERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner underwent successful emergency 
quadruple bypass surgery Saturday after complaining of discomfort, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Alfredo Trento, who performed the three-hour operation at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center, called it a normal procedure. He said he expects Eisner to make 
a "full and speedy recovery" and be home within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner, 52, was resting comfortably in stable condition after the surgery, a 
hospital spokesman said. Sources said his family was with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney executives refused to say much more about Eisner's condition, but 
sources close to the executive said they knew of no history of heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Company Vice Chairman Roy Disney issued a statement saying Eisner's duties 
will be handled by senior corporate executives until his return. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner had just arrived home to Bel-Air from an investment conference in Sun 
Valley, Ida., on Saturday when the problem began, according to Disney sources. 
Eisner, a lanky man with graying hair that is usually tousled, is known to the 
outside world as the smiling face of Walt Disney Co. through his many public 
appearances. In entertainment industry circles, he is regarded as one of 
Hollywood's most shrewd, successful and hard-driven executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years, Eisner and his management team have built the Burbank-based 
Disney from a declining company into one of the world's great entertainment 
conglomerates, with theme parks, movies, retailing and merchandising bearing 
the ubiquitous Mickey Mouse seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has taken on more responsibility for managing that empire after the 
death in April of his close friend and chief lieutenant, Disney President Frank 
Wells, in a helicopter crash in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has also been waging a concerted public relations campaign on behalf of 
Disney's America, a controversial historic theme park that the company wants to 
build on land outside Washington, D.C. Although Disney says the park will 
accurately reflect the nation's past, critics have accused the company of 
trying to sanitize history. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has also had to contend with financial losses at the Euro-Disney theme 
park outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 On the more positive side, Disney's animation division released its most 
successful movie ever this month. "The Lion King" has taken in more than $150 
million at the box office so far. Eisner spent the past few days at an annual 
investors seminar sponsored by Herbert Allen Jr. of Allen & Co., a New York 
investment banking firm that specializes in entertainment deals. Eisner was 
joined by many top entertainment executives and fund managers.

THE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT; CASE MAY OPEN ERA OF GLOBAL COOPERATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The simultaneous settlements reached Saturday by the U.S. Justice Department 
and the European Union, respectively, with Microsoft represented an unusual 
case of close cross-Atlantic cooperation on an antitrust issue and a harbinger 
of things to come, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a case where an American company settled charges 
simultaneously in America and Europe," said Richard Donovan, an antitrust 
attorney with New York-based Kelley, Drye and Warren. "But you are going to see 
more cases like this in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Donovan, who represented a fax paper company on a price-fixing case involving 
a joint U.S.-Canadian investigation, noted that Anne K. Bingaman, head of the 
Justice Department's antitrust division, is proposing legislation that would 
make it easier for the United States to share and exchange evidence with 
foreign governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department officials disclosed that the United States had been 
cooperating with the EU over the Microsoft investigation since October. The two 
governments conducted secret negotiations with Microsoft officials in Brussels 
during the week of July 4 and last week at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both governments had been prepared to go to court Friday to file a lawsuit 
accusing Microsoft of violating antitrust laws when the company agreed to a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 By working together, the governments were able to gather more evidence than 
they would have working separately. By threatening charges in two jurisdictions 
with potentially devastating results, the governments could put more pressure 
on Microsoft, Donovan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said, a joint settlement benefits Microsoft because it 
does not have to fear that an agreement it reaches with the United States will 
be used against it as leverage to negotiate even stiffer terms in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are particularly gratified that we were able to settle these issues with 
the Justice Department and the DG IV (the European equivalent of the U.S. 
antitrust department) simultaneously and on the same terms," Bill Gates, 
Microsoft chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The two agreements are similar, although the U.S. agreement lasts six years 
while the European agreement lasts four years.

THE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT; RIVAL FIRMS LOOK TO MAKE GAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Novell Inc., Lotus Development Corp., Borland International and many small 
computer software companies that have complained long and loud about Microsoft 
Corp., Saturday's announcement of a settlement in the government's antitrust 
case against the industry leader is at least a moral victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement stops far short of the sweeping measures -- such as outright 
breakup of the company -- that some people had hoped to see. And it also is 
unlikely to alter substantially the balance of power in the computer industry 
-- at least for the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has agreed to end three of the allegedly monopolistic practices that 
infuriated its competitors the most. And that was good enough for Novell, which 
offers a version of DOS (disk operating system) in competition with Microsoft. 
Novell also makes the Word Perfect word processing program and popular computer 
networking software. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft agreed to change its volume licensing of the MS-DOS and Windows 
operating systems, which had the effect of locking out competitors. It will 
also stop requiring other software firms to sign highly restrictive 
confidentiality agreements. And it will stop using certain long-term licensing 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, we see this as a victory," said David Bradford, general counsel for 
Novell, the chief rival of Microsoft. "This has been a long effort by many 
companies for many years, and this decision today will provide consumers with 
increased choices and more innovative products." 
</P>
<P>
 In principle, the settlement will benefit consumers by assuring robust 
competition in the software business, which in turn will assure interesting and 
high-quality products. Many software companies, even large ones such as Novell 
and Lotus, which makes the popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program, have been 
struggling to sustain market share in the face of relentless pressure from 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 And for smaller firms, many of whom are dependent upon one innovative product, 
Microsoft can be a terrifying specter. Companies such as Intuit, which makes 
Quicken personal finance programs, and Broderbund Software, known for its Where 
in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? educational program, have watched while 
Microsoft invested tens of millions of dollars in trying to displace them from 
their niches. 
</P>
<P>
 And investors have been reluctant to fund some start-up software companies out 
of fear that their original ideas could quickly be mimicked by Microsoft, which 
is rapidly expanding its product line to include everything from word 
processors to games. The settlement, however, will likely do little to inhibit 
Microsoft's competitive posture outside of the operating system area. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers could benefit if true competition develops in the market for DOS, 
the software that controls basic computer functions. The agreement requires 
Microsoft to change the way it licenses MS-DOS and Windows, thus opening the 
way for competing products, notably DR-DOS from Novell. 
</P>
<P>
 That provision could be even more important for the next generation of more 
high-powered operating systems, where Microsoft's dominance is not so clearly 
established. IBM, with its OS/2 program, as well as Novell with its Unix 
system, and eventually Apple and IBM with Taligent, hope to prevail over 
Microsoft in that coming battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have to assess what the implications will be for OS/2, but if this 
opens up more choices for consumers, we are very pleased," said IBM spokesman 
John Iwata.

THE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT; HARNESSING THE SOFTWARE GENIE; REGULATION: MORE 
BATTLES ARE IN STORE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT AND SOFTWARE MAKERS AS THE INFORMATION 
REVOLUTION EVOLVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department may have trimmed Microsoft Corp.'s sails in the 
personal computer business, but as the information superhighway takes shape, 
the software battle is already shifting to new fronts -- presenting the Clinton 
Administration with tough new challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, IBM, Novell, Oracle Systems and other rivals are pushing to supply 
and control the software that will set industry standards for networks of 
computers, the delivery of movies and interactive cable programming, wireless 
personal communicators and other futuristic electronic communications devices. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle to establish standards for these systems will test federal 
antitrust and communications law, as well as the Clinton Administration's 
commitment to modernizing the information superhighway. That's because these 
emerging technologies will touch nearly every American -- not just home 
computer users -- and therefore prove to be more central to the nation's 
economic, social and political life than virtually any product that has been 
examined by federal regulators thus far. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Microsoft and other computer companies have in mind -- as well as cable 
companies and the regional Bell operating companies -- is a product for the 
mass market," said Michael Wirth, a communications professor at the University 
of Denver who has written widely about mass media and public policy. "If in 
fact they achieve that market penetration then we are obviously talking about a 
much more impactful system than the personal computer." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from U.S. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown and Vice President Al 
Gore to President Clinton himself have made development of the information 
superhighway a major priority. And they have said that the computer industry is 
a critical part of the effort to modernize the nation's data networks so that 
U.S. industry can produce more jobs and remain globally competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry executives have countered that they must be allowed to make 
alliances and joint ventures in order to raise the huge amount of capital 
needed to create new computer software, lay higher capacity fiber-optic cable 
and make other upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
 The quandary had placed some companies, such as Microsoft, at loggerheads with 
federal regulators attempting to gauge the antitrust threat posed by rapidly 
developing technologies seeking to win markets that, in some cases, do not even 
exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft dispatched numerous lawyers to Washington over the past two years to 
argue that its market dominance was no threat to others and that it was due to 
technological prowess, marketing superiority, hard work and luck -- not 
anti-competitive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides former Federal Trade Commissioner Patricia Baily, Microsoft has 
utilized attorneys from New York's Sullivan & Cromwell as well as from Preston 
Thorgrimson Shidler Gates & Ellis, the Seattle-based law firm where Gate's 
father is a partner, in its battle against the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the legal maneuvering between high-powered Wall Street and 
government lawyers, the future of the information superhighway could hinge on 
the test of wills between Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates, the nation's 
second-richest man, and the federal government's chief antitrust cop -- Anne K. 
Bingaman. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Clinton appointed her as assistant attorney general in charge of the 
antitrust division, Bingaman, 50, brought several high-profile consumer 
class-action lawsuits against big companies, leading some to fear she might be 
tough on big business. 
</P>
<P>
 As an antitrust regulator, Bingaman has withdrawn permissive guidelines on 
relations between manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers and has taken aim at 
foreign consortiums with business interests in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, however, a flurry of Justice Department settlements with MCI 
Communications Corp., AT&T and other telecommunications giants suggested that 
Bingaman might not be as tough on the high-tech industry as with those other 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Justice Department settlement keeps Microsoft intact as a company 
and only alters software licensing arrangements in order to promote 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Microsoft received more of a rebuke than many businesses did during 12 
years of Republican administration antitrust enforcement that ended in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 During the period, a wave of merger activity and industry consolidation 
erupted. The era was marked by a more than 60% decline in so-called private 
antitrust action as the Justice Department and the courts embraced a 
laissez-faire approach to antitrust regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 But although computer hardware makers such as Apple Computer Co. and IBM Corp. 
did not gain dominant shares of the field during the period, the computer 
operating software produced by Microsoft -- Windows and MS-DOS -- grew by leaps 
and bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 alone, Microsoft sold more than 20 million copies of its MS-DOS 
software program for more than $750 million, according to Dataquest Inc. of San 
Jose. The software has now been installed in more than 75% of the world's 150 
million personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the agreement, some experts believe Microsoft will continue to 
dominate the computer software field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft will use its clout to remain king of the hill for some time," 
predicted Jim Warren, a Bay area computer writer for Microtimes and several 
other publications. "The Department of Justice is going to apparently permit 
them to continue to announce (new software) years in advance of actually 
delivering anything. These . . . fantasies freeze everybody else out of the 
market as people sit there and wait for Bill to deliver."

INSECTICIDES BLAMED IN DEATHS OF 17 BALD EAGLES IN WISCONSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An insecticide killed 17 bald eagles found recently in northwestern Wisconsin, 
state and federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests conducted on the birds at the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Laboratory 
in Ashland, Ore., found traces of Carbofuran, a pesticide used to kill worms in 
corn, strawberries and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife service officials declined to say whether they believe the eagle 
poisonings were intentional. But that type of pesticide is not generally used 
this early in the growing season, and there is little vegetable crop production 
in Burnett County's Fish Lake area, where the birds died, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the eagles and other animals probably died immediately after 
ingesting the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildlife service and the state Department of Natural Resources is offering 
a reward of up to $5,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of anyone who caused the eagle deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Bald eagles are no longer on the brink of extinction as they were decades ago. 
But the birds remain on state and federal threatened species lists, in part 
because of poisoning, shooting, trapping and the destruction of their forest 
habitat, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the bird's population here in the state has steadily climbed from a 
low of 82 active nesting pairs in 1970 to 464 nesting pairs in 1993, officials 
said.

JAMES FLANIGAN: BIGGEST STORES EVOLVE BACK TO SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a merger that is either the mating of dinosaurs or the creation of a new 
force in American retailing, the once-elegant department store chains of 
Federated Department Stores and R.H. Macy & Co. took business cues from J.C. 
Penney, Sears Roebuck and Wal-Mart when they agreed last week to unite their 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Private-label merchandise was a big reason behind the merger, which would 
create one of the nation's largest store groups at $13.5 billion in annual 
sales. The combined company would increase the use of store brands -- similar 
to Penney's Stafford label and Sears' Kenmore and Sears brands -- in its 
roughly 340 stores, which include Bloomingdale's, Bullock's, Lazarus and other 
historic names. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchandise in the big department stores would be cheaper and more uniform 
across the country. "The new company will have the sales volume to make its own 
store labels profitable," says a retail expert. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether trying to be a more expensive Wal-Mart is the wisest long-term 
strategy remains to be seen. In the meantime, there will be a lot of disruption 
in the apparel and retail businesses -- companies failing, jobs disappearing. 
That's because the department store business has become a metaphor for the 
exacting, efficient U.S. economy in which some things have been lost and others 
gained. 
</P>
<P>
 We should understand that behind the bargain outfit or low-priced shirt we see 
in the mall this weekend stand the rough realities of a very tough business 
that has been tempered by bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated came out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization in 1992; Macy is 
scheduled to emerge in January, after settling $6 billion in debts at roughly 
66 cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was gentler in former days. Department stores had touches of elegance and 
fashionable merchandise -- and lots of salespeople to serve customers -- 
because retailers earned higher profits on the dresses and suits, household 
items and perfumes they sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the 1980s, and junk-bond, bust-up takeovers loaded debt on a fragile 
business. Campeau Corp. of Canada sank Federated and the old Allied Stores; 
Macy's own executives wrecked the company in a leveraged buyout. Stores had to 
move merchandise just to pay the interest; markdown sales became permanent, but 
stores failed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Now retailers have emerged as grind-it-out competitors, prepared to emulate 
Wal-Mart and other discounters. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated and Macy are merging to increase size and muscle so they can beat 
down suppliers for lower prices on merchandise and concessionary terms on 
credit -- apparel makers wait 90 days and longer to get paid. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's retailers command supplies and pricing from apparel firms here and 
abroad and from a world of developing nations. "They're going beyond China for 
clothing; Indonesia and Zimbabwe are cheaper," says a U.S. garment maker. 
</P>
<P>
 Stores will continue to have constant sales, with suppliers eating the cost of 
the markdowns. Federated has narrowed the number of its suppliers for 
big-volume orders, using a concept Sears pioneered decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One result of this merger and the trend it sets in motion will be 
consolidation among the hosts of smallish companies that make up the U.S. 
apparel business. "The weak ones will go out of business," says analyst Lee 
Backus of Buckingham Research, a New York investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Another result will be a shakeout in retailing. The Federated-Macy merger 
alone will close hundreds of duplicate departments in stores across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The business will be run on tight financial controls with little margin for 
fashion. And that's a loss. Imaginative merchants used to encourage fashion. In 
the 1960s, Geraldine Stutz, who ran the Henri Bendel store in New York, gave 
floor space for young designers to try out their wares and launched the careers 
of Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein. Georges Marciano and Guess jeans originated 
at Marvin Traub's Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, department stores in the old days weren't all glamour. "In the old 
days, you could hire women cheap to staff your stores because they didn't have 
many other opportunities. Now they do," remarks George Rudes, head of St. 
Germain Inc., a Los Angeles apparel firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, says Rudes, smart women are finding opportunity today in the garment 
business, which, like the retailers it serves, is being transformed by 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. retailing is a business that uses supercomputers to bring customers an 
incredible variety of merchandise at reasonable prices. There is little wasted 
motion or wasted capital. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is constant change. The Federated-Macy merger no doubt will be 
initially successful. With Macy's coming out of bankruptcy, economies are in 
place to produce profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But questions linger long-term. Young people tend not to shop in department 
stores, reports Stillerman, Jones & Co., an Indianapolis firm that does 
research on shopping malls. The young favor specialty stores and outlets, while 
department stores attract an older clientele, from their 30s to 65 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Older people like service, which is why Nordstrom, the elegant but 
higher-priced department store chain, does well. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the stock market gives the highest price-to-earnings valuations 
in retailing to the stocks of Nordstrom at one end of the spectrum and to 
Wal-Mart and Dollar General, a fast-rising discounter out of Nashville, Tenn., 
at the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle range, which includes May Department Stores, Federated-Macy and 
Broadway Stores, along with Dillard's and Dayton-Hudson, stock valuations are 
lower. The market is saying that fierce competition will restrain profitability 
and that a shakeout is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Federated-Macy merger brings that shakeout closer. It marks another 
stage in retailing's evolution from a business of peacocks to one of 
velociraptors.

THE INTRICATE COURTSHIP OF TACO BELL; RELOCATION: O.C. FIRM'S REVIEW OF A NEW 
SITE TRIED THE NERVES AND PROVOKED THE TEMPERS OF POLITICIANS, EXECUTIVES AND 
ITS OWN EMPLOYEES. 
</P>

<P>
 This was urgent, Controller Gray Davis insisted to Assembly Speaker Willie 
Brown. A conference call had to be set up as soon as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet another 1,000 jobs were about to leave California with the imminent 
announcement by Taco Bell Corp. that it was moving its Irvine headquarters to 
the north Dallas suburb of Plano, Tex. Yet another blow to California's image 
was about to land. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives still maintained that staying in Southern California was 
their preference -- if only state lawmakers would give them a sign that it made 
sense to stick around. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there would be a sign -- actually, dollar signs in the form of 
proposed tax benefits. The conference call March 25 by Davis, an ambitious 
state capital veteran and champion political fund-raiser, and Brown, perhaps 
Sacramento's most powerful and controversial politician, would be critical in 
shaping legislation of immense symbolic importance. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation was frank. Company executives griped about city and toll-road 
development fees. Sorry, Brown said, the state couldn't do much about that. The 
businessmen complained about rules governing tax credits for rebuilding in 
riot-torn areas of Los Angeles. That, Brown said, could be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to lure the Mexican-style fast-food chain away from the seemingly 
unbeatable attraction of Texas' cheap land, cheap labor, low taxes and 
financial handouts had begun in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Before it was over, the company's slow, deliberate, exhausting review would 
try the nerves and provoke the tempers of political and business leaders, 
builders and developers and its own employees, who seemed anything but eager to 
go to a place like Plano. The decision process seemed to waver so much -- local 
construction sites excluded promptly became sites reconsidered -- that one 
developer would confess to wondering "who is driving the ship" at Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Appeals to Taco Bell's corporate elite at times would take a personal, offbeat 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Adler, a partner at the Deloitte & Touche accounting firm in Costa Mesa, 
sent friend John E. Martin, Taco Bell's chief executive, a missive every couple 
of days by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threatened to sing, 'Stay, just a little bit longer,' " says Adler, 
breaking into song at the recollection. "I sent him the temperatures in Dallas 
when it's been real cold there." 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Taco Bell may have been the ultimate poker player, hoping to 
wring every concession possible from builders, developers and politicians. And 
the poker game doesn't seem over yet -- because real financial concessions from 
state and local government have yet to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell decided three weeks ago to stay put, but for just how long remains 
uncertain. Government and business leaders assembled into an emergency "red 
team" eschew the term "done deal" when describing Taco Bell and say there's 
more work ahead. Martin last week, reserving the right to do whatever is "best 
or most practical," noted the escape hatches in the company's new office lease 
and didn't rule out moving later to another state. 
</P>
<P>
 But keeping Taco Bell, if even for a few years until something permanent can 
be arranged, was an important battle victory. How California emerged on top is 
now viewed as a lesson in waging what is certain to be a decades-long war 
between the states for prized assembly lines, machine shops, research labs and 
headquarters. A CHAT WITH THE GOVERNOR 
</P>
<P>
 By March, Martin and his top aides already had spoken with the governors of 
Texas, Georgia and North Carolina, but efforts to get California Gov. Pete 
Wilson and Taco Bell's Martin together had proved futile. The state's red team 
was working with Taco Bell. But where, wondered executives, were California's 
top political leaders? Were they concerned? Would they really do anything?  
</P>
<P>
 With a self-imposed March 31 deadline for announcing its relocation decision, 
executives became resigned to the likely move to Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the red team had set a meeting for March 28 to give Taco Bell executives 
its final presentation on reasons to stay in California, and state economic 
aide Julie Meier Wright was working hard at setting up a meeting between Wilson 
and Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 24, Wright, who heads the state Trade and Commerce Agency, drove 
through a blustery arctic storm from San Diego to Taco Bell's Irvine 
headquarters for the long anticipated conversation. Traffic on local freeways 
was a stop-and-go nightmare. Volunteers eyed the fire-scarred Laguna hills for 
possible mudslides; Malibu homes already were mired in muck. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the 12th-floor executive library, a quiet, windowless room with deep 
oversized leather chairs, artworks of glass, crystal and ceramics, paintings 
and bookcases filled with an eclectic array of books, Wright called Wilson 
while the company's top managers filed in. 
</P>
<P>
 For 45 minutes late that rainy afternoon, Wilson and Martin talked about high 
costs in California and the state's attitude toward business. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and aides Charlie Rogers, Rudy Pollak and Jonathan Blum were impressed 
that Wilson had done his homework. The governor understood such local issues as 
development fees and air quality rules that required the company to provide 
inducements for employees to share rides to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson probed more deeply into the company's costs. Was Taco Bell simply 
paying more for top management and its creative talent, Wilson wanted to know, 
or were wages and salaries abnormally high throughout the organization, from 
executives on the top floor to food servers in the cafeteria on the bottom 
floor? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin assured him that costs were much higher throughout the work force than 
they would be in Texas. And the Lone Star State, he noted, doesn't assess 
income tax, so workers could move there and increase their take-home pay 
without a wage hike. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor countered that property taxes were lower here and the overall 
cost of doing business wasn't much different, especially if the company 
included the $40-million cost of relocating and the disruption to its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also noted the state's fiscal bind, making it difficult to grant 
concessions to business. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin told the governor that Taco Bell wasn't trying to squeeze the last 
dollar out of the people of California. If Taco Bell stays, Martin argued, it 
will mean more jobs, more taxes collected and more investment in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not really fighting each other here," Martin said. "We're really trying 
to work with each other." MORE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SACRAMENTO 
</P>
<P>
 Controller Davis learned about Taco Bell's plans during a reception March 16 
at Antonello's restaurant in Santa Ana. He spoke that night and the next day 
with Chris Townsend, a government relations executive at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 After his staff and corporate officers talked further, Davis recognized the 
issues as universal concerns for business in the state -- and it was evident 
something would have to be done quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Willie Brown to set up the conference call for 10 a.m. Friday, the 
25th. A Taco Bell group headed by Charlie Rogers, the senior vice president, 
assembled in the 12th-floor library. Davis was in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was late. He had been taping his weekly television show and couldn't get 
back to his office in time. When he finally arrived at 10:15, he apologized and 
then, to the pleasant surprise of Rogers and his aides, devoted more than an 
hour to a frank, businesslike discussion of Taco Bell's problems and what the 
state could and couldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
 A new headquarters would cost nearly $100 million, executives said, and fees 
imposed by the city, a toll-road agency and others would run the bill up at 
least another $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was pessimistic. There was little, he said, that the state could do to 
get those fees waived. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers objected to laws governing tax credits the company received for 
rebuilding stores in areas damaged by the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Not only were 
the credits applied to the earnings of Taco Bell's parent company, PepsiCo Inc. 
in Purchase, N.Y., but they also were subject to rules and conditions that made 
them all but useless. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Brown could be optimistic. Changes could be adopted quickly, he suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was upbeat and curious. What were Texas and the other states, he asked, 
doing about relocation programs, retraining efforts and educational programs? 
What were they doing with tax credits? 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, with a $10-million package of incentives offered by Texas, didn't need 
much more encouragement. He urged the assemblyman to advocate some kind of tax 
relief. Expanding companies, he rationalized, ought to get some tax benefits 
for creating construction jobs, buying materials and furnishings and adding to 
the property tax rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Davis already had been working on bills aimed at retaining business 
in California. Brown had a narrow bill giving credits to manufacturers that had 
passed the Assembly and was sitting in a Senate committee. Perhaps, he 
suggested, something could be added or changed in that bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said any tax credits would have to come with some obligation to stay in 
California, maintain job levels and add some value, such as building a new 
office or buying new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Davis said, "if the corporation isn't paying people, then the state 
is," referring to unemployment and welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, Robert Girvin, Taco Bell tax director, and his staff were working by 
telephone and over facsimile machines with Brown's aides and Davis' legal 
department to go over the language for a bill that would help growing 
companies. Aides to Brown and Davis came up with the final proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Taco Bell executives saw a breakthrough, a bipartisan 
effort by the Democratic Assembly leader and Republican governor to pass some 
meaningful pro-business laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "That call was pivotal," Rogers later told Davis. AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF 
POSITIVE ENERGY 
</P>
<P>
 The following Monday, March 28, the red team was encamped in a large 
conference room at Irvine City Hall. All morning, city officials, county staff 
members, state workers and executives from regional agencies like the South 
Coast Air Quality Management District plotted strategy for their afternoon 
meeting with Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Reed, with the Irvine Unified School District, stopped by to explain the 
school lunch pilot program the district was about to announce. Taco Bell didn't 
know it yet, but the district had agreed to let the company sell its food in 
Woodbridge High School during May and June. It would be part of a plan to 
encourage students to remain on campus during lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed couldn't stay for the afternoon meeting with Taco Bell. But 22 red team 
members, led by H. Fred Mickelson, a Southern California Edison executive, were 
there to greet Rogers, Rudy Pollak and other corporate officers for the last 
and biggest red team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Wright of the Commerce and Trade Agency brought along her top regional 
aide, Judy Jarvis. Irvine Mayor Michael Ward, City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
and top aide Larry Larsen attended, as did Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. 
Riley, aide Ken Bruner and John Sibley of the county's Environmental Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wisley from Willie Brown's office rounded out the bipartisan effort for 
the 90-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an enormous amount of positive energy," Wright said later. "There 
was a real appreciation on the part of Taco Bell executives that we were making 
good progress." 
</P>
<P>
 With a projector showing color photos and charts, Mickelson, Jarvis and Ward 
talked about life in Southern California. They explained how they could help 
Taco Bell: fast processing of building permits, training and education 
incentives, clearer rules on using the revitalization zone tax credits, 
cooperation from air quality officials on the mandated ride-share plan for 
employees, support for any legislation offering tax credits for expansion in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the carrots, and there was an effort to display a modest stick. 
Jarvis pointed out that California and other government agencies such as school 
districts like to do business with companies located in the state. She raised 
the Irvine school district pilot project. That was an important issue for Taco 
Bell, which now is in some 3,000 schools nationwide and wants to get into 
thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the work already had been done the previous week. Mickelson had 
kept in close contact with the governor's office and with Brown's office. The 
effort had been one of the most well-coordinated and complete attempts to woo a 
company heading for the exit. THE MOVING TARGET 
</P>
<P>
 With Willie Brown drawing up legislation to give large companies a 6% tax 
credit for investing in plants and people in California, Taco Bell executives 
renewed their search for another Orange County headquarters site. 
</P>
<P>
 Some locations, like the Irvine Spectrum and a UC Irvine parcel, had long been 
considered. But new sites came up as well, including Rancho Santa Margarita 
property and the now-vacant Loral Aeronutronics plant -- formerly Ford 
Aerospace -- in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in mid-April, the Irvine Co. thought it was about to sign a deal 
with Taco Bell, but the fast-food chain started looking at other sites. 
Developers were irked that Taco Bell often reconsidered sites that it had 
rejected earlier. The UCI site, for instance, was reconsidered at least three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've danced through hoops on this thing, and you begin to wonder if there is 
a moving target and who is driving the ship over there," said one officer of a 
major developer who asked to remain anonymous. "One thing's for sure: They're 
not real estate people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taco Bell executives were frustrated with the deals being offered. The 
recession may have hurt a lot of businesses, but landowners and builders still 
wanted a premium for building in the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell was looking for bargains and incentives, just as it had in its 
previous cross-country search for a new home. CALIFORNIA'S TRIO OF CHALLENGERS 
</P>
<P>
 Through John Cushman of Cushman Realty Corp. in Los Angeles, the company 
approached cities in Texas and Georgia last summer to see if they could meet 
its needs for open space with access to a major international airport. North 
Carolina was added to potential sites after officials there learned about Taco 
Bell's search and asked to be considered. 
</P>
<P>
 During the week of Nov. 1, as fires ravaged the Southland, a Taco Bell team 
headed by administrative vice president Pollak toured the three states. The 
team also included Cushman and architects David Gensler and Ed Friedrich. 
</P>
<P>
 In Texas, the first stop, the financial allure was powerful. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's sister company, Frito-Lay, already had moved its corporate 
headquarters to Legacy, a 2,665-acre business park in the fast-growing North 
Dallas suburb of Plano. And there was plenty of room for Taco Bell in the same 
complex. Last year, Taco Bell had consolidated some computer operations there 
with Frito-Lay. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas could deal like no other state. Besides its regular advantages -- no 
personal or corporate state income taxes -- Texas could offer tax credits, 
property tax abatements and low-interest loans. Taco Bell ultimately would be 
offered $10 million in tax relief and training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In telephone calls and letters, Texas' tough but folksy governor, Ann 
Richards, sang the virtues of her state. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers there were not certain Taco Bell would move. Some said they 
thought the trip east was mostly an effort to squeeze concessions out of 
California or the company's landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days in Texas, Pollak and his team flew to Georgia, where economic 
development officials were ready for courtship. Utility company executives, 
Atlanta and Georgia officials and business leaders needed to find out one thing 
first before they could start a full-fledged romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Coke and Atlanta were almost synonymous, they noted, while Taco Bell was a 
unit of archrival PepsiCo. "We wanted to know what they thought about moving 
into the land of Coca-Cola," said developer John Murphy. "They addressed that, 
and it really wasn't an issue with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, it turned out, was born in Atlanta and loved the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In a welcoming breakfast, Gov. Zell Miller urged Taco Bell to keep an open 
mind about Georgia. Roy Cooper, vice president for economic development at the 
Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, hammered home such Georgia virtues as "stable and 
moderate" taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two-thirds of the population lives east of the Mississippi," he told the 
executives, "and Atlanta is in the center of that market with unmatched 
livability, a world-class city and better access to Europe. We're as good as 
Dallas and better than L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Driving around Atlanta in a minibus to look at sites, Taco Bell executives 
made time for a side trip. Pollak wanted to stop at a local Kroger grocery 
store to see if it was carrying the new Taco Bell brand products -- including 
tortilla chips, taco shells, salsa and cheese -- that the company was rolling 
out as part of a cooperative effort with Frito-Lay. 
</P>
<P>
 So thrilled were executives to see the products on the shelves that architect 
Friedrich took pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 But in early March, the company sent its regrets to Georgia. The location, 
building costs and relocation costs proved to be too much. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina has been recruiting California companies for 15 years and set 
up a permanent office in the Bay Area last fall. Martin, who once worked for 
the Hardee's fast-food chain in Raleigh, thought the Carolinas would be a great 
place for Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 While Pollak's group was in Charlotte looking at sites, North Carolina Gov. 
James B. Hunt Jr. was in California, and he stopped in at Taco Bell 
headquarters for a brief chat-cum-sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina and Charlotte promised to put in roads or any other 
infrastructure that might be needed. The state couldn't get into a bidding war, 
but it could offer $1,000 for each new job to make capital improvements. Like 
other states, it also offered tax credits for training.

 Hunt also had a $5-million competitive recruitment fund he could use at his 
discretion to bring in companies. The hitch, though, was that Charlotte would 
have to come up with a matching amount, and it was able to provide only 
$500,000. The total, though, paled in comparison with what a state like Texas 
could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte was scratched from the list at the same time as Atlanta. NO PLACE 
LIKE HOME 
</P>
<P>
 To John Martin, the numbers only told one side of the story. He describes 
business as both a science and an art, with the art too often ignored. 
California, he observes, still offers more energy and creativity, a greater 
degree of racial and ethnic diversity and a closer view of the expanding Asian 
market than any other state. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Willie Brown's tax credit measure was narrowly defeated in May, Martin 
took a longer view. Since his company's needs were evolving, he decided that a 
new lease -- a flexible one that offered the company a chance to cancel it 
early -- would most benefit the company. 
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, Shuwa Investments Corp., had offered most of the basic terms of 
a new lease last August, part of its strategy to take its best shot first. But 
back then, Taco Bell executives had only started looking at other states and 
didn't know what they wanted to do. They used the offer as a benchmark to 
compare alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 By May of this year, Martin was ready to negotiate in earnest, and he told 
Rogers and Pollak to build flexibility into the new lease. When the deal is 
ready, he told them, call me in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin and his girlfriend of two years, Stefanie Mayer, 28, flew to the island 
of Hawaii on June 4 for a two-week vacation. They also were married June 16 in 
a ceremony at Mauna Lani Point resort north of the Kona coast. It was the third 
marriage for Martin, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 The final deal was struck in quick fashion with little haggling but enormous 
amounts of lawyer time to draw up a lease that ran 70 legal-size pages long, 
without attachments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building is part of a larger project, Koll Center Irvine North, and there 
are many documents on file that affect how Taco Bell can use its building," 
Shuwa attorney Anton N. Natsis explained to his counterparts. "We need to read 
about 20 documents to understand how to put this lease together." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollak and Shuwa's Chris Mahon found they could agree quickly to some new 
terms, but putting it all on paper was another matter. Learning that one change 
would take a week to review and write, Pollak's jaw dropped in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuwa still ended up with the $41-million deal it had offered 10 months 
earlier, but it agreed to other changes, including Taco Bell's right to cancel 
the deal in the fifth and 10th years by paying a fee of up to $3 million. Shuwa 
also agreed to pay up to $4.1 million for tenant improvements. Rent was cut 
from $2.85 a square foot, negotiated during the high-priced 1980s, to $1.50 a 
square foot, about the middle of the market range today. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after Martin and Mayer were married, Pollak called him in Hawaii to 
report that the company got the flexible lease it wanted. "We'll do the deal as 
soon as I get home," Martin told him, "and we'll announce it." IT'S NOT OVER 
'TIL IT'S OVER 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell's long search provided it with a great deal of information as it 
ponders what to do in the future. If could take up an offer by the Koll Co. to 
build a structure next to its current quarters or it could follow up on any one 
of the proposals it received to build elsewhere in Orange County or in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Leader Brown's legislative effort is expected to be resurrected next 
month with a state Senate bill sponsored by Sen. Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward). 
Controller Davis says California has much more to do to compete with such 
aggressive states as Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to judge from his comments last week, Martin aims to keep 
California nervous. "If the climate in California were to go south from a 
business perspective," he warned, "then we'd look at our other options."

OPERATION COST CONTROL; MEDICINE: WHILE CONGRESS CONTEMPLATES VARIOUS BILLS, 
THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS REFORMING HEALTH CARE WITH CLOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a darling of the health care reform movement, Southern California Edison 
is chucking its carefully assembled network of 7,000 doctors and 91 hospitals 
and starting over again in its crusade to control medical spending. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 1, the giant utility will abandon its 5-year-old HealthFlex system, in 
which Edison had directly recruited doctors, hospitals and pharmacists to care 
for its workers and their families. Instead, the company will offer six 
different health plans operated by outside firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison expects to save millions of dollars because the outside contractors 
will have to promise to keep their charges stable for several years. "We want 
them to be at risk for cost increases," said Margaret Jordan, Edison's vice 
president of health care and employee services. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's latest switch in health care is typical of the experiments, trials 
and errors, and searches for fiscal control occurring at thousands of companies 
in the throes of an accelerating health care revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 American corporations have been pressing to save money on their medical costs 
for years, but the effort has been moving forward at a frantic pace at the same 
time Congress is laboring to pass landmark health care reform legislation this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The chances of actually passing health care reform legislation remain highly 
uncertain. President Clinton's desire to require all companies to offer health 
insurance -- the so-called employer mandate -- faces an uphill fight in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those businesses offering health insurance are deeply skeptical of the 
Clinton plan because they feel it hampers their continuing efforts to control 
health care costs. No bill is better than legislation that would take away 
their independence, many believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of what happens here, however, the private-sector reform has 
already had a dramatic impact. Businesses have become increasingly confident 
that they can lower health care costs by taking direct action against medical 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers now fully realize that "they, as a group, can make a difference," 
said Frank M. Brocato, president of the Florida Gulf Coast Health Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Brocato also heads the Employer Purchasing Alliance, which runs a collective 
buying program for business coalitions in Florida and Michigan. In two years 
the alliance has grown from buying health services for 250 firms with 700,000 
covered workers to making deals on behalf of 450 companies with nearly 2.5 
million workers and their family members. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a group of big employers in the San Francisco area -- including 
such giants as Chevron, Bank of America, PG&E and Pacific Telesis -- won 
discounts of 10% and more from a group of health maintenance organizations. In 
Houston, a similar coalition began receiving price discounts from local 
hospitals in January, and this month, more than 1,000 Houston physicians will 
begin working for a fee schedule arranged with the business alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying to health care providers: 'If you don't change, you won't get 
any of our business,' " said Thomas E. Murphy, group vice president at Kroger, 
the big grocery firm that is a driving force behind employer coalitions in 
Cincinnati, Phoenix and a new one starting this summer in Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers are also increasingly requiring workers to pay a bigger share of the 
health care bills and restricting their choice of doctors; offering low-fat 
meals in the company cafeteria; providing cash payments to employees who use 
lower-cost hospitals, and operating 24-hour gyms where workers can work out and 
relieve tension. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers reflect the overall effort. Between 1965 and 1991, what 
corporations spent on health care per employee rose an astonishing 451%. But 
total per-employee spending rose an average of only 8% in 1993, the smallest 
increase in six years, according to Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm, 
in a newly released national survey of corporate health plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that 8% was nearly triple the general level of inflation last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 As businesses continues their battle to tame the health care beast, here are 
some of the latest strategies being employed on the front lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Working in an alliance, corporations in Memphis, Tenn., saved $43 million last 
year through discounts from hospitals, doctors and drug companies. Their power 
of group purchasing activity is potent. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the 60 members of the Memphis Business Group of Health coalition 
spent $1,880 for each worker on their payrolls, just $105 below the national 
average. Last year, the Memphis tab was $2,499 per worker -- $1,467 below the 
U.S. average. 
</P>
<P>
 The Memphis group, which includes Federal Express among other major firms, is 
a granddaddy among corporate health alliances, operating since 1984. Key to its 
keeping costs down was a years-long effort to force hospitals to open their 
books so companies could examine where the increases were coming from. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the financial facts, the corporate alliance arranged a group 
purchase deal for its members with hospitals, doctors and home health agencies. 
The discount price structure has helped keep health care inflation for 
corporate members to 6% a year since 1987, less than half the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
 And this year, the Memphis group opened its doors to "the last group left for 
cost shifting, the very small employers," said Donna Miller, president of the 
organization. Companies in Memphis with two or more workers can now get the 
same mass purchasing power and discounts enjoyed by Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Francisco, the Bay Area Business Group on Health, after long and 
intricate negotiations, used its economic muscle to win unprecedented cost 
concessions from 18 health maintenance organizations last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300,000 workers, dependents and retirees are represented by the 11 
major employers in the group, giving them greater leverage in dealing with HMOs 
than any individual company could enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 For small employers, with four to 50 workers, the state's Health Insurance 
Plan of California offers a selection of 18 health plans. The fast-growing HIPC 
just completed its first year of operation, and now has more than 3,000 
companies and 50,000 workers and family members enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Some corporate heavyweights in Houston -- Compaq Computer, Baker Hughes, and 
Mitchell Energy & Development -- created the Houston Health Care Purchasing 
Organization, which began operations Jan. 1, with its members enjoying a 
negotiated rate structure at 46 local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospitals supplied reams of data on operations and outcomes for everything 
from appendectomies to coronary bypass surgery. This helped establish "quality 
benchmarks" that the hospitals must meet to stay in the network assembled by 
the purchasing group. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiated rates are in the middle range of local hospital prices, said 
Ralph Smith, purchasing group chairman. "Our goal is not to be the lowest price 
in the marketplace," he said. "We need to focus on quality and value and price 
will fall out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The network has 75,000 workers and dependents, and Smith expects that to 
triple in a year, as other firms see the advantages. Savings already are 
apparent -- Baker Hughes said it saved $17,000 in hospital charges during 
January alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a business coalition can save money without asking directly for a 
break on prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Florida Health Care Coalition represents 500,000 workers and 
dependents from 108 firms, including Walt Disney World, General Mills 
restaurants and Martin Marietta's electronics and missiles division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've formed a partnership with our hospitals," said coalition President 
Becky Churney. "We've realized the issue is quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition gets patient records from the hospitals, and looks for extreme 
variations in treatment patterns: the doctor who keeps a patient hospitalized 
longer than any other physicians, the cases with too many tests or too many 
prescriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hospital administrators and doctors pore over the data, they learn to 
change the way they deliver medical care. "Last year, we saved the community 
$75 million in medical costs," Churney said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the hospital side, "We recognized that businesses were very concerned and 
we worked together" to save money, said Beth Rudloff, corporate team leader at 
the Orlando Regional Health Care System, which includes four hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cost of coronary bypass surgery was trimmed to $43,000 last year, 
down from $51,000 the year before, and the average hospital stay dropped to 11 
days from 13. The average bill for a Cesarean section dropped 13% to $7,800. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Southern California Edison, the competitive market in the state among HMOs 
and insurers is now so appealing that company officials have decided to scrap 
the unique health care network they once bragged about. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who created the Edison network, Dr. Jacque Sokolov, the company's 
former medical director, agrees that Edison made the right decision to scrap 
his network of specially recruited hospitals and doctors. "It was creative for 
its time," he said, "but like every creative idea, it has become dated." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, he said, commercial HMOs and insurers in Southern California have 
become much bigger and more efficient, and can deliver care more cheaply than 
Edison's in-house system. "I have no disagreement with their strategy," Sokolov 
said of Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 But for thousands of nervous Edison workers, the end of HealthFlex will mean 
searching through new books of authorized health providers, hoping to find the 
names of their current internists, pediatricians and gynecologists. Edison's 
new system will force "a lot of people to change their primary physicians or 
receive a reduced benefit," said Carl Wood, business agent for Local 246 of the 
Utility Workers Union of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Edison's new system, workers will still be free to select any doctor, as 
they did under HealthFlex, but going outside the new networks will cost them 
more money out of pocket, Wood noted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would have liked to have had easier access to doctors outside the 
network," he said. "But there were compromises, and we saw this as the 
least-painful transition to the new health care environment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies have chosen to focus their cost-cutting efforts on a special 
area of health care.  
</P>
<P>
 Delta Air Lines offers workers needing heart surgery the option of going to 
one of six special hospital centers around the country, noted for their 
expertise in coronary care. The airline pays the travel and lodging costs for 
two family members to accompany the patient. One of the centers is the 
Cleveland Clinic, which does more heart surgeries than any other hospital in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the family travel and lodging costs included, Delta saved more than 
$2 million during the program's first year, compared with the costs of using 
local community hospitals for heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are able to negotiate very high quality care at better prices than our 
people would get out in the open market -- we are talking 35% to 50% lower," 
said spokesman Clay McConnell. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Delta workers have been happy: "If you have a choice between a smaller 
area hospital or a world-renowned hospital specializing in cardiac care, which 
would you choose?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All the sophisticated corporate efforts to find the best managed-care 
networks, get the biggest discounts and organize the most powerful alliances 
are supplemented by another, common-sense approach: making workers more 
health-conscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft, worried about the costs of caring for premature babies, gives 
a free infant car seat, a $50 value, to any woman who gets prenatal care in the 
first four months of pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Gyms, workout rooms and fitness centers are an increasingly common feature in 
the corporate world. Union Pacific has a variety of fitness centers for 28,000 
workers scattered over 19 states. When the repair crews are out along the 
tracks, sleeping in rail cars, the company often sends along another car fitted 
out as a gym. In some cities, the firm has contracts with local health clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Voluntary screening programs for cholesterol and high blood pressure, combined 
with counseling, are helping reduce health care claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jacksonville, Fla., a gym is open around the clock, seven days a week for 
workers at AT&T's universal card services divisions, which handles customer 
inquiries and marketing for the firms's credit card program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fitness fare" low-fat meals are available in the cafeteria. A new "invest in 
yourself" program promises a monthly prize drawing for anyone who has at least 
12 "workouts" a month (a gym visit, a game of tennis, some jogging). Prizes 
this year have included a dune buggy, a trip to Hawaii and a home exercise 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide range of business tools, from hard bargaining with doctors to 
corporate jogging tracks, should help in the war on medical inflation. But 
thoughtful executives, while welcoming progress, are aware of the limits and 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all under pressure to cut costs," said Luke Larocca, general manager 
of the health care arm for the Illinois Central railroad. "There is no doubt in 
my mind that competitiveness will result in reduced costs, in health care as in 
anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in medicine, the risks can be far more disastrous than in ordinary 
business. In pushing for reduced costs, we have to be careful that we don't put 
too much pressure on providers, so they cut corners, and harm employees." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Since the early 1980s, medical care costs in the United States have risen at a 
pace roughly double the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price 
index. Increases in medical care costs have abated as inflation has fallen in 
recent years, while medical care expenses for business, as measured by average 
cost per employee, rose 8% in 1993, the smallest increase in years. Comparing

BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN; HOW IT IS THAT 'SCIENTIFIC' SURVEYS' RESULTS CAN 
BE POLLS APART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BRENNAN, JOHN BRENNAN is director of The Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George H. Gallup, an inventor of modern opinion polling, idealistically 
believed that surveys of the public would enhance democracy by providing 
leaders with a true picture of peoples' attitudes and concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty years have gone by, and polls are now as common as Big Macs on the 
American landscape. But their effect remains dubious at best, as does the 
effect of the burgeoning number of studies of all types that are now part of 
every public policy debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, research using the scientific method tries to measure a phenomenon 
(such as public opinion, health risk or environmental impact) in the most 
objective manner possible. Of course, nothing is ever completely unbiased. But 
good researchers strive for that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 There's ample room for their efforts. Public policy debates abound with myths 
and ideology, often based on nothing but hearsay. Good research can cut through 
these shibboleths and keep the press and policy makers from making wrong 
assumptions. Lately, for example, careful polling has shown the lack of 
evidence for the existence of an angry, alienated Generation X, that mythical 
group of twentysomethings so beloved by scores of feature writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, an increasing amount of research is being conducted to support 
particular myths rather than to seek objective answers. In her new book 
"Tainted Truth: The Manipulation of Fact in America," Wall Street Journal 
writer Cynthia Crossen chronicles the ominous rise of this "tactical" or 
"advocacy" research, in which groups wanting to advance their agendas 
commission supposedly objective studies that almost always end up supporting 
their positions on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Crossen cites numerous examples, including a research battle between advocates 
of cloth and disposable diapers, in which each side weighed in with impressive 
environmental impact studies showing diametrically opposite results. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Crossen, advocacy research is "contributing to the steady 
degradation of social discourse on the major political, economic and 
environmental issues of the day." Anyone listening to media debates on health 
care, illegal immigration, abortion or the North American Free Trade Agreement 
could agree. Each side seems to have its own ready-made version of statistical 
reality, one the total opposite of the other. 
</P>
<P>
 When tactical research is identified as sponsored, the observer can at least 
consider the source and tread warily. More insidious, perhaps, are the 
occasions in which advocates manipulate independent findings or cite only 
selected research results to advance a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a charge was recently leveled at the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency, which has been accused of using some questionable techniques to 
determine that secondhand cigarette smoke is a Class A carcinogen. The EPA's 
actions drew a not-surprising attack from the tobacco industry. But they also 
earned criticism from the Congressional Research Service, which has raised 
doubts about some of the methodology. Nonetheless, this research remains the 
basis for the government's goal to ban smoking in virtually all workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A different but equally worrisome trend is the growing use of unscientific 
"gimmick" studies, primarily for promotion, publicity or "just for fun." 
Evidence of this is the recent revival by CBS and NBC news programs of the 
long-discredited 900-number call-in technique. Such call-ins produce biased, 
unrepresentative findings, and can be manipulated by interest groups manning 
phone banks. Both networks maintain top-notch polling units that can deliver 
sound scientific surveys in hours. But these lack the dramatic allure of 
letting the audience vote during the program. The result is the airing of 
scurrilous data that misleads rather than informs.

 In the same sphere are the new so-called on-line "polls," in which subscribers 
to on-line computer systems log in their views to a question and the system 
reports the results. These are particularly skewed: Computer on-line systems 
are currently used by only a fraction of the country, yet findings often are 
reported as if they represent America as a whole. The public -- and much of the 
press -- has a hard time discerning that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 One might expect journalists to sound the alarm about the pitfalls of bad 
research. Many -- such as Crossen -- are doing just that. But the industry as a 
whole does a woefully inadequate job. Impressive-looking studies are treated as 
breaking news. And competitive pressures often push news people to "go with it 
now and ask questions later." 
</P>
<P>
 Although much good research is being done, we are a long way from George 
Gallup's dream of survey-assisted democracy. On the contrary, it is the average 
citizen who must be on guard to judge cautiously the dizzying array of 
statistics coming his or her way.

IT WAS THE THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S MANY AEROSPACE 
COMPANIES WHO PUT . . .; THE FIRST MAN ON THE MOON 
</P>

<P>
 Casey Patelski helped Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin make their giant leap to 
the moon, and the retired aerospace engineer is ready to celebrate the 25th 
anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the astronauts are still alive, and most of us who worked at Mission 
Control in Houston are still around, so I figure it's going to be a big deal," 
said Patelski of Costa Mesa, who was a flight manager for McDonnell Douglas 
Corp. in NASA's Houston Mission Control facility during the first lunar 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patelski and others in Southern California whose efforts led to the moon 
landing on July 20, 1969, are finding this year's observance bittersweet, as 
memories of exuberant years compete with frustration over today's layoffs and 
cost-cutting by NASA and the aerospace industry. They remember a period 
seemingly without limits; today, the constraints of recession and federal 
deficits appear everywhere, ending careers and extinguishing the grandest 
ambitions for space exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around the country, engineers and scientists are being crudely dumped onto 
the street" as aerospace companies and NASA scramble to cut costs, said Jerry 
Rosenberg, executive director of the NASA Alumni League in Washington. "I'd 
guess that it will be an interesting anniversary celebration." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hub of Southern California's Apollo community was the sprawling North 
American Corp. (now Rockwell International) plant in Downey, which produced 
three key Apollo components: the engine, the lunar module and the lunar lander. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Los Angeles author Mike Gray: "From all over the country, bits and 
pieces of the spaceship flowed to the assembly bays at Downey -- fuel and 
oxygen tanks from Boulder and Buffalo, instruments from Davenport and Cedar 
Rapids and Newark, batteries from Joplin, valves from San Fernando, electronics 
from Kalamazoo and Lima, fuel cells from Hartford." 
</P>
<P>
 As that parade of parts, components and subsystems flowed into Downey, Gray 
wrote in his 1992 book, "Angle of Attack," the industry "slogged toward the 
moon, a vast national network of brainpower and craftsmanship slowly coming to 
focus on a single problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's rich aerospace heritage proved a fertile ground for 
NASA, and in return, local companies were forced to adopt manufacturing 
techniques that later served them well in the commercial aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "When NASA came in with their fine-tooth comb inspection, they absolutely 
turned our company around," recalled Harold Stout, formerly president of Long 
Beach-based Airdrome Parts Co., which manufactured about a dozen high-strength, 
low-weight tubing connectors for Apollo. "That proved to be the salvation of 
our company." 
</P>
<P>
 Other Southland communities contributed mightily to the space effort as well. 
In the 1960s, Rockwell was making the Saturn rocket's second stage in Seal 
Beach, McDonnell Douglas was building the rocket's third stage in Huntington 
Beach and TRW's San Juan Capistrano facility was helping build the engine that 
powered the lunar module. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of Southern California companies played roles in Apollo, and NASA 
pumped hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy. "In a word, the 
space program meant everything to Southern California's economy," said Shirley 
Thomas, a USC professor who has authored more than half a dozen books on space 
exploration.  
</P>
<P>
 Engineers, factory employees and managers recall workdays that involved a 
higher calling. Exploring the frontiers of space imposed special burdens, too, 
from fulfilling the hopes of an attentive public to assuring the safety of 
astronauts who had become national heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Barcus, who joined McDonnell Douglas' corporate finance staff in 
Huntington Beach in 1962, tells of employees working overtime and weekend hours 
without complaint and with a sense of mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man was going to be put on top of that rocket and blasted into space," he 
said. "Any time you put a man on top of it, it had to be a quality job." 
</P>
<P>
 The space program was also "peace-oriented, it was pushing technological 
frontiers, and it wasn't made to destroy something," Barcus said. "People loved 
working on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Those involved in the program "were almost like heroes," said Fountain Valley 
resident Bob Younkin, 55, who joined McDonnell Douglas as an engineer in 1964. 
"People could identify with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosendo Romero, a Buena Park resident who was a welder at McDonnell Douglas 
for 41 years, said he once labored 36 hours straight to repair cracks in a 
thick, steel deflector plate at the Cape Kennedy launch pad. Another shift 
stretched to 30 hours as he struggled to repair a damaged Saturn rocket part 
and keep the lunar mission on schedule.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were constant change orders," said Romero, now 65. "Welders worked 
directly off of blueprints, and when changes were needed, an engineer would 
'red pencil' it on the spot, and the welder would go to work."  
</P>
<P>
 For Romero, the crowning moment came after the lunar landing when he was 
chosen by his co-workers as their delegate to a luncheon at Houston's Rice 
Hotel honoring the Apollo 11 astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero flew home with a souvenir menu that listed Neil Parisienne Sauteed 
Potatoes, Buzz Miniature Glazed Carrots and Mike Tossed Green Salad, the latter 
named for astronaut Michael Collins, who remained in lunar orbit while 
Armstrong and Aldrin explored the moon. The menu was signed by all three space 
voyagers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started welding destroyer escorts in Abilene, Tex., when I was 14," Romero 
said. "I never dreamed of (my work) going to outer space." 
</P>
<P>
 Apollo 11's technological achievement, which author Gray has compared to 
"throwing a dime into a parking meter from three hundred miles away," inspired 
people to seek careers in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them was Winston Hickman, 51, who joined Rockwell International's 
corporate staff in the early 1970s.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been to the moon, and the next stop was Mars," Hickman said. "It was a 
real heady time with lots of gee-whiz stuff. . . . After the moon landing, it 
seemed as if it was all there to be done. We were going to do the space station 
and then go to the stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Hickman spent 17 years with Rockwell before moving on to Vans Inc., the 
Orange-based maker of tennis shoes, where he eventually became chief financial 
officer. But he still professes a fascination with space. "I'm a 'Star Trek' 
freak at heart," he confided.  
</P>
<P>
 Their strong feelings aside, most Apollo veterans acknowledge that the nation 
now lacks the will to underwrite manned space travel beyond Earth orbit. But 
they do so grudgingly, and they harbor strong doubts about the wisdom of 
letting the Apollo program die during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible, terrible mistake," said Duane Johnson, 66, a Stanton 
resident who lost his engineering job when McDonnell Douglas wound down its 
Apollo work in the early 1970s. "That Saturn rocket was a monster," said 
Johnson, who drove a moving van for years before finding another aerospace job. 
"It's just so sad."  
</P>
<P>
 Patelski, the Apollo 11 flight manager, also was laid off in the early 1970s. 
He managed to find an engineering job, though for less pay, with Fluor Corp. in 
Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was bitter about the whole thing," he said. "I mean, we went to Houston, 
trained the astronauts, and all we got was a pink slip."  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Patelski fears that NASA is being hamstrung by "a lot of 
guys my age . . . still hanging on," pushing for manned space flights when 
unmanned missions are cheaper and more effective.  
</P>
<P>
 "We contributed mightily to Mercury, Gemini and Apollo," Patelski said. "But 
it seems to me they're still thinking back to the good old days when we were 
young. . . . They've got to get young, aggressive guys who aren't stuck with 
old, Model T thinking."  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Minor, who worked in Houston Mission Control during Apollo 11's flight 
and is now president of Rockwell Space Systems Division, worries that the lack 
of a cohesive plan will dull the appetite of younger aerospace industry 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're better trained and educated than we were, and they work just as hard 
as we did in the '60s and '70s," Minor said. "But they need a goal and they 
need one badly, even if it's something 10 years away." 
</P>
<P>
 Other aerospace veterans express concerns that invaluable scientific 
information may be lost as those who were on the Apollo team retire and die.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're like the monks in the Dark Ages, carrying a core of knowledge in our 
heads," said Jim Ball, 47, a Huntington Beach resident who joined McDonnell 
Douglas early in 1969 and still does mission simulation work for the company.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's engineers know what certain parts of the Saturn looked like, but they 
don't know why engineers opted for those specific designs. Said Ball: "We've 
got to absorb this knowledge to keep it alive."  
</P>
<P>
 He is concerned, too, that today's schoolchildren appear not to view space 
exploration as a career possibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid I loved space, I read about Sputnik in the third grade, made a 
reflector telescope to look at the moon," Ball said.  
</P>
<P>
 On a recent cloudless night, Ball pointed out to his children the area of the 
moon where astronaut Pete Conrad, now a McDonnell Douglas executive in 
Huntington Beach, landed during a later Apollo mission.  
</P>
<P>
 "I remember looking at the moon in awe," Ball said. "But the kids were not 
excited."  
</P>
<P>
 Patelski, however, says he is doing his part to ensure that at least one 
capable young scientist will be ready when the United States finally returns to 
space flights beyond Earth orbit.  
</P>
<P>
 The first of Patelski's grandchildren to earn an engineering degree will get 
the bright-red 1969 Camaro that he is painstakingly restoring in his Costa Mesa 
garage.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's in my will," Patelski said. "I've got five kids, so there's a good 
chance that at least one of them will come up with an engineer."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: INDUSTRY'S RECENT CHILLS NO SIGN OF GRAVE ILLNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the mutual fund boom about to go bust? 
</P>
<P>
 That question has been asked many times over the past decade, a period of 
dizzying growth in the number of mutual funds, shareholders and assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Surging stock and bond markets during that period have made mutual funds an 
increasingly attractive place to be. Investors today have $2.1 trillion parked 
in roughly 5,400 funds, up from $1 trillion and 2,900 funds at the end of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the stock and bond markets are hurting, and net sales of mutual funds 
have started to turn lower. There are even signs that employment in the 
business is topping out. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, do all of these factors suggest that a contraction or shakeout 
in the fund industry might finally be on the horizon? 
</P>
<P>
 No way. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite slower times in a more hostile investment climate, the fund industry 
and most individual fund companies aren't hurting. Consequently, there's little 
likelihood of serious consolidation anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fund companies are still very profitable and are coming off a strong run," 
says Kurt Cerulli of Cerulli Associates, a Boston financial consulting firm. 
"The industry hasn't gone through enough trauma for a consolidation to get 
serious."  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who predicts the mutual fund industry might start to deflate should be 
asking themselves where investors would head. Might there be a mass exodus 
toward individual stocks or bonds? Not likely, considering that funds offer 
diversification, professional management and other benefits for competitive if 
not lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 How about a massive return to the safety of bank accounts? Short of a huge 
spike in interest rates, this isn't probable either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should any person seeking growth of their net worth stay with bank 
deposits?" asks George M. Salem, banking analyst for Prudential Securities in 
New York. In terms of long-term growth potential and investment choice, the 
bank products simply can't compete, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, banks themselves have been racing to enter the mutual fund business 
as a way to offset the outflow of deposits. Many insurance companies are also 
big players, and they're enjoying strong sales from variable annuities -- a 
close kin to mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, a severe and enduring bear market would drain a lot of money out of 
stock funds, but it's likely that much of this cash would merely shift into 
bond, foreign, money market or sector funds (such as gold portfolios), where it 
would await the start of the next bull market. 
</P>
<P>
 Because stock funds are typically the most lucrative to manage and money 
market portfolios the least so, profit margins would come under pressure, but 
the industry itself would survive. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, there's little chance anytime soon of a massive downsizing as 
happened in the steel and auto industries in decades past, says John Keefe of 
Keefe Worldwide Information Services, a New York financial consulting firm. The 
economics of the business are still too positive for that to take place. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall industry assets will continue to enjoy healthy growth punctuated by 
periods of investment surges, predicts Bill Klipp, chief operating officer of 
brokerage Charles Schwab's mutual fund group in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry is facing another type of consolidation. Fewer fund companies 
have been commanding a larger market share for the past decade, Keefe says, and 
this will continue to fuel merger activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Of roughly 350 fund families today, the 10 largest control 48% of the market, 
according to Dalbar's FundRate, a Boston research service. Because these giants 
typically can boast of top management skill, first-rate shareholder service 
operations, innovative new products and the most complete lineup of funds, it's 
likely they will continue to carve a larger slice of the pie. 
</P>
<P>
 This consolidation trend has been overshadowed by the mushrooming number of 
funds in recent years. New competitors, attracted by the high profitability of 
the business, haven't faced many entry barriers. "You don't need a lot of 
capital, plant or equipment to start a mutual fund," says Klipp. But with 
slowing sales, tighter profit margins and increased competition, that is likely 
to change. "There will be a substantial slowdown in the creation of new fund 
companies," he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the new entrants in recent years have been the banks. But here too 
there's reason to expect a drop-off in new activity. "Many banks that started 
to sell mutual funds within the last few years with high hopes have been sorely 
disappointed," says Cerulli. 
</P>
<P>
 When a prolonged period of heavy shareholder redemptions materializes, some of 
the smaller, weaker bank groups will be among the first to sell out, he 
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller groups in general might not be able to subsidize unprofitable funds 
during a lengthy slump. Stock funds need at least $60 million in assets to 
break even, Cerulli estimates. For bond and money market portfolios, which 
charge smaller management fees, the break-even points are closer to $150 
million and $200 million, respectively, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But a prolonged period of shareholder withdrawals isn't yet on the horizon, 
which means there aren't a lot of motivated sellers among fund companies. This 
explains why merger and acquisition activity remains modest, despite what 
observers say are high prices for anyone wanting to unload a fund company at 
this time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson Advisory Group of Stamford, Conn., last week signed a definitive 
agreement to merge with the Pimco fund group and four other money-management 
subsidiaries of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., headquartered in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction, first announced in March, would create a new firm called 
Pimco Advisors, also to be based in Newport Beach, with $70 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity would count 22 mutual funds with roughly $14 billion in assets, 
placing Pimco Advisors among the 30 or so largest fund groups. The combination 
would open Pimco funds for sale through Thomson's brokerage network. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a pickup in economic activity around the globe, U.S. inflation 
should remain in the 2% to 4% range over the next several years, predicts 
William H. Gross, a Pimco bond fund manager and managing director of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 While rising commodity prices are a concern, "wages are the primary source of 
inflation, and they remain in a downward trend worldwide," says Gross, who runs 
two bond funds given top five-star rankings by Morningstar Inc. of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicts fairly stable interest rates ahead, with 30-year Treasury bonds 
yielding between 6.5% and 8.25%. How Many Funds? 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of multiple-class pricing in recent years has made it harder to 
compute the total number of mutual funds. It also explains why you might see 
fund tallies from different sources vary by several hundred or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple-class pricing has become popular among investors who use brokers and 
financial planners because it offers choices for paying the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 A fund's Class A shares are typically sold with a front-end sales charge or 
load attached. Class B shares are usually sold with an annual "12b-1," or 
marketing, fee and a declining back-end charge. Class C shares might feature a 
yearly 12b-1 fee only, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these fee structures will produce a different total return, because 
12b-1 fees are subtracted from the performance numbers, while front- or 
back-end sales charges generally are not. This is why you see separate price 
quotations for A, B and C shares in newspaper fund tables, even though they're 
all based on the same fund -- that is, the same portfolio of stocks or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lipper Analytical Services, a premier fund-monitoring service in Summit, N.J., 
today reports performance on more than 6,300 mutual funds, but a little more 
than 900 of these are multiple classes of shares. That leaves a more accurate 
tally of about 5,400 true funds -- still a large tally, no matter how you slice 
it.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: DOLLAR GOES FURTHER, FOR NOW, ON PACKAGE 
TOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the recent weakness in the dollar making you reconsider your European 
vacation? If so, there are several ways to cut vacation costs -- including one 
that parlays the currency swings in your favor. 
</P>
<P>
 One dollar buys nearly 12% less in France and about 10% less in Germany than 
it did six months ago. It's lost nearly 6% of its value when measured against 
the British pound. 
</P>
<P>
 But that need not worry travelers. Money-saving gambits, such as booking land 
tours from U.S. wholesale tour operators, securing car rentals in advance and 
staying -- and eating -- in out-of-the way places can lower your vacation 
expenses 20% to 40% even in these dollar-devaluated days. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's market, the biggest savings come from booking a land tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? Tour operators, who rely on travel agents to send them business, price 
their vacation packages in the fall for sales the following summer. That allows 
them time to produce the slick brochures they send to the travel agents who 
sell the trips to their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, the dollar was strong. Indeed, it was so strong that many European 
tour operators cut the prices of their vacation packages by hundreds of 
dollars. If the dollar continues to slide next year's European vacationers will 
pay for it, but for now, tourists can get bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how big a bargain? 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the one-week "land package" offered by Globus Tours in London. 
</P>
<P>
 The $538 price covers six nights at the St. Ermin's Hotel near Parliament, 
continental breakfasts, airport-to-hotel transfers, half a day of sightseeing, 
a theater ticket and a two-day transportation pass that gives unlimited access 
to London bus and underground rail transportation in London, says John 
Martinen, president of Globus and Cosmos Tourama in Littleton, Colo. (The rate 
assumes an August departure and double occupancy.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you were going on your own at the same time, the "rack rate" at St. Ermin's 
-- the price of a room for one night without a corporate rate or volume 
discount -- would run $634 a person, based on double occupancy. Taxi rides to 
and from the airport would cost roughly $50 a person -- assuming two people 
share the cab, experts estimate. If you add the costs of the sightseeing, bus 
passes and theater tickets, each traveler could easily save $200 by choosing 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Globus deal is not unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Trafalgar Tours U.S.A. Inc. has an 11-day, nine-night trip to London, Paris 
and Rome. This so-called "Free and Easy" trip is popular with vacationers who 
usually shun bus tours because it has few frills like group dinners or approved 
sightseeing, says Nigel Osborne, vice president of sales and marketing for the 
New York-based tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget version of the trip costs $750, Osborne adds. International travel 
experts estimate that's at least 20% cheaper than what it would cost to 
duplicate the tour on your own in today's market. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're a seasoned traveler and don't mind staying in smaller, 
out-of-the-way hotels, you could probably travel more cheaply by avoiding 
tourist hotels and staying in the outskirts of town, says S. Enders Wimbush, 
senior international consultant for Runzheimer International in Burlington, 
Wis. But if you don't speak the language and are unfamiliar with the city, the 
package deals are a value, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there are some disadvantages to package tours. Most specifically, 
freedom. The tours leave and arrive on specific dates at specific times. If 
you're traveling from city to city, you usually must have your luggage ready 
and in front of your door before 8 a.m. You also have to accept that you've 
signed on for a group activity that will land you in a bus with 35 to 40 
strangers when taking the planned sightseeing or transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 If all that togetherness leaves you cold, there are other ways to save on 
travel to Europe, Wimbush notes. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you're planning to rent a car, arrange it through a U.S. 
company in advance, he suggests. Renting in Europe can cost 50% more because 
there are fewer cars available and fewer rental companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, avoid eating and staying in tourist areas whenever possible. Hotels and 
meals in the big cities generally cost 30% more than similar food and lodging 
at out-of-the way establishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing American cuisine over local offerings is also costly. A full 
"American breakfast" of eggs, bacon, toast and juice can cost $30 or $40 in 
Europe, but a continental breakfast of rolls with coffee or juice typically 
goes for less than $10. Sometimes it's even free. Many European hotels include 
continental breakfast in the price of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Wimbush suggests that you use a credit card, since credit card 
companies can exchange currency at somewhat more favorable rates than 
individuals can. That's because they're dealing in volume, exchanging millions 
of dollars in currency at a time. They pass on those discounts to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, be sure to pay your credit card bill promptly. If you don't, the 
monthly interest charges could add up to more than you saved on the currency 
exchange.

AGRICULTURE DEPT. REORGANIZATION HITS A SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill to reorganize the Agriculture Department and finally let Secretary Mike 
Espy begin closing field offices has been put on indefinite hold because of a 
dispute over environmental regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the House Agriculture Committee finished work on the bill. But it 
also approved an amendment by Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres), that caused the 
House leadership to keep the bill off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a number of field offices scheduled to close are still open, and 
employees are in limbo over their future with the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condit amendment would require the department to set up a risk-assessment 
office that would make sure regulations don't do more economic harm than 
environmental good. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers believe that too many regulations are made by people who don't 
understand what it costs to carry them out. Critics say risk assessment is an 
inexact, shortsighted procedure that can be politically manipulated to block 
any rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Condit didn't pull the notion out of his hat. The idea has been circulating in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar amendment applying to the Environmental Protection Agency has, since 
February, stalled a bill to lift that agency to a full-scale department with 
more clout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's stance has been two-sided. President Clinton signed an 
order Sept. 30 supporting the idea of a cost assessment. But the Administration 
opposes any legal requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 When the issue arose in the EPA bill, Vice President Al Gore and EPA 
Administrator Carol Browner lobbied Congress to keep the risk-assessment 
measure out. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the House Agriculture Committee considered the amendment, none 
of the representatives from the Agriculture Department at the hearing objected. 
The department's position is unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to work with the committee to try to address that issue," said 
James R. Lyons, assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and 
environment.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how we'll come out on that now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the office is unnecessary because the department is already involved 
in analyzing rules to balance their economic impact against the harm they are 
supposed to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee could simply send the bill along to the floor with the Condit 
amendment. But it doesn't want any other amendments offered on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed the bill along, the committee can offer it in a way that requires a 
two-thirds vote rather than a bare majority to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening the bill to amendments would require a long debate, and the bill 
cannot compete with more urgent measures, such as spending bills, for time on 
the floor in the near future. Once passed, the bill must be reconciled with the 
Senate version. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans have already decided to oppose the reorganization bill, but 
they like the risk-assessment amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill is open to amendments, critics of the job the department has done 
on food safety could try to pluck that function out of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the bill could be open to an amendment that would permit Espy to appoint 
more blacks, other minorities and women to the local committees that oversee 
the work of the department's field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee rejected that amendment on grounds that local farmers should 
elect all members.

AT HOME; CHARMING COASTAL AREA PACKS THEM IN; CORONA DEL MAR: DESPITE SMALL 
LOTS AND HIGH HOME PRICES, COMMUNITY OF OLDER BEACH HOMES IS ONE OF THE MOST 
DESIRABLE IN SOUTHLAND.

<P>
 After living in Denver for 20 years, Carole Lobdell was shocked at home prices 
in Southern California, especially in Corona del Mar, where they hoped to find 
a home close to her husband Donn's work in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 They also wanted to be near cultural opportunities, good restaurants and they 
wanted privacy. She began house-hunting in the spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went out with realtors time and again. I would say 'You people are all 
insane. . . . You're paying so much for a little house.' I finally got to the 
point that I saw this was the way it would be. . . . Everyone is crazy, but now 
I'm crazy too." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lobdells found a house they liked and bought it for the mid-$700,000s. 
They are now remodeling and adding 1,100 square feet to the four-bedroom, 2 
1/2-bath house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult (for us) to accept living in a house so close to another 
neighbor, but we are at the top of a hill," she said. "Visually, we have the 
feeling of open space." 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, with a population of 13,000, is a coastal community within 
Newport Beach and is the eastern border of the city. A stretch of beach 
provides the southwestern border. Pacific Coast Highway runs through Corona del 
Mar for about three miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The area between Coast Highway and the ocean, known as "old" Corona del Mar, 
or as residents frequently call it, "The Village," is where much of the 
community's residential charm is found. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the houses are older beach homes, most of which were originally built 
with wood clapboard siding or shingles, and small-paned wood windows -- 
reminiscent of New England seashore architecture -- and situated on tiny lots. 
Today many of those homes have been extensively remodeled and enlarged, often 
covering the entire lot or spread over two lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout "The Village," where the narrow streets are named for flowers and 
trees, designers have combined a variety of styles. Next door to what would 
best be described a mansion will be a beach cottage. The tiny yards, where 
additions have consumed the lot, are frequently overflowing with blooming 
flowers in planters, pots and baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Along Pacific Coast Highway there are shops, restaurants and the vintage 
theater, The Port, which provides a taste of a bygone era. 
</P>
<P>
 To the north of the highway, newer homes on larger lots have gradually crept 
up the hillsides offering views of Newport Bay and Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar, which means "crown of the sea" in Spanish, is one of the most 
expensive and desirable communities in Southern California. The median home 
price is in the low $600,000s, according to Dataquick Information Services, and 
sales are up. But that wasn't always the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1904, George E. Hart, who was described as an "intrepid realtor," 
bought 700 acres from the Irvine Co., headed by James Irvine II -- son of 
Irvine Ranch founder James Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart offered to sell land at $150 an acre. But in 10 years, only 15 houses and 
one small hotel had been built, so Hart traded 400 acres for citrus groves in 
Riverside County. In 1923, Corona del Mar was annexed to Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1940s, there were hundreds of lots in Corona del Mar with sewer, 
street and tax assessments of $350 to $400 each, and owners were walking away 
rather than paying. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat McNeilly grew up in Corona del Mar in the 1960s. "I remember when Fifth 
Avenue was a busted-up old dirt road, and cows would come up and stick their 
head through the fence and eat weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked in my mother's store, the Toy Shop, on Pacific Coast Highway as a 
teen-ager," said McNeilly, who is a captain with the Orange County Fire 
Department. He and his wife, Candi, now own the store, which has become a 
fixture on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeilly was working in Jackson Hole, Wyo., where he and Candi were married. 
The young couple wanted to move back to the community where their families had 
lived since the early 1960s. Both had attended Corona del Mar High School, 
where her father, John Mitchell, was head of the history department. 
</P>
<P>
 The McNeillys looked forward to raising their family where they had grown up, 
but the problem in the early 1970s was finding a house they could afford. They 
rented for several years, and in 1975 they bought a duplex in the old section 
of Corona del Mar for $80,000. The couple, who now have three children, still 
live there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've remodeled twice," McNeilly said. "We have three bedrooms, two baths and 
have about 1,500 square feet of living space, as well as a 300-square-foot deck 
on the roof." The other unit in the duplex, about 750 square feet in size, is 
rented for $850 a month. McNeilly estimates that the property is worth between 
$450,000 and $500,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Propp, a real estate agent with Grubb & Ellis in Newport Beach, has 
lived in Corona del Mar for more that two decades and also works there. 
</P>
<P>
 Home prices range from $360,000 on the low end for a three-bedroom, two-bath 
1940s home, she said, to $4.9 million for a custom home with views of the bay, 
six bedrooms and 5 1/2 baths. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-bedroom, three-bath home with a view will sell for about $750,000, she 
said, and a one-bedroom, one-bath condo is listed at $179,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The Propps bought their home in 1972 for $95,000. She said that the house, 
which has been remodeled and a pool added, would probably sell for about 
$650,000 today. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, when Janet and John Gothard began house hunting, they were 
well aware of Corona del Mar's desirability and prices. But they were also 
prepared to sacrifice to become a third-generation family in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "My Dad, Jim Wood, was involved with real estate, and I think I've lived on 
many of the streets named after a flower," said Janet Gothard. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the Gothards bought a two-bedroom, one-bath home for $175,000. The 
900-square-foot house was built in the 1940s on a 40-foot-by-60-foot lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gothards now have a 6-year-old son, Johnny, who attends the local 
elementary school. They want a larger home and are exploring their options for 
staying in the community.  
</P>
<P>
 When Val and Robert Zwerling began their house hunt after they married two 
years ago, both were acquainted with Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Zwerling, who is originally from New York, started his own software 
company 10 years ago in Newport Beach. Val had rented in the community for six 
years. They knew Corona Del Mar would be the right place to raise a family. 
Their daughter Megan was born in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to walk a lot," said Val Zwerling. "As we were expecting a child I 
wanted to be close to schools and shopping -- close enough to walk to the 
beach, or out to dinner, even for dry cleaning, or groceries. It's beautiful, 
clean and convenient." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple found a 20-year-old home, five-bedroom, three-bath house in the 
$600,000 range. "We wanted a large home and large yard, and we wanted the 
ability to expand." They are now adding between 2,000 and 2,500 square feet to 
the house and redoing the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zwerlings are not concerned about over-improving for the neighborhood. 
"Younger families are moving in and remodeling," Val Zwerling said. "You could 
buy a home in the area for $1.5 million." 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus, she said, is the community's safety. Sgt. Andy Gonis, the public 
information officer of the Newport Beach Police Department, agreed. Corona del 
Mar "is a very safe community," he said. One of the bigger problems officers 
encounter are occasional break-ins of parked cars on the narrow streets. At a

<P>
 As in all epochal battles, mythical or otherwise, there has to be a hero and 
there has to be a villain. 
</P>
<P>
 But which is which? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the difficulty facing neutral observers of today's World Cup final 
between Italy and Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in history, two three-time winners of the planet's most 
coveted sports trophy are squaring off in the championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 But which team should you support? 
</P>
<P>
 Do you take Italy, which won the World Cup in 1934, 1938 and 1982, because of 
its courage in the face of adversity? Because Coach Arrigo Sacchi has managed 
to avert disaster time and again? Because striker Roberto Baggio sports a 
ponytail and spouts Buddhism? 
</P>
<P>
 Or do you take Brazil, which won the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970, because 
of its tradition of entertaining soccer? Because Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira 
has managed to get here unbeaten? Because striker Bebeto has the most unusual 
post-goal celebration? 
</P>
<P>
 The contrasts between the opponents could not be more striking. This is not 
simply Baggio and friends against Romario and friends. This is the Old World 
against the New. This is Europe against South America. This is the Imperial 
world against the Colonial world. 
</P>
<P>
 Rome or Rio? Tiber or Amazon? Vesuvius or Sugar Loaf? 
</P>
<P>
 You make the choice. 
</P>
<P>
 But here are some pointers to guide you. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil comes into this afternoon's game having beaten Russia, Cameroon, the 
United States, the Netherlands and Sweden. The only blot on its copy book is a 
first-round tie with Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy comes into the game having beaten Norway, Nigeria, Spain and Bulgaria. 
The question marks on its record involve a loss to Ireland and a tie with 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil has scored 11 goals and allowed three. Italy has scored eight goals and 
allowed five. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has used 20 of its 22 players. Brazil has used 16 of its 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians have never trailed in a game. The Italians have trailed twice, 
losing to the Irish but coming back to defeat the Nigerians in the final two 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If it wins, Brazil would go through the tournament undefeated with one tie. If 
it wins, Italy would be the first team to take home the World Cup after losing 
a tournament game since Argentina in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics can be read any way you please. Brazil has the better offense 
and the better defense. Italy has been through the fires, has been tested and 
has survived. Brazil has not been tested. Make of that what you will. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the coaches. Tactically among the most astute and inflexible in 
the world, they both have mapped out World Cup campaigns and stuck to their 
plans, ignoring the sniping by the media and the clamor for change back home in 
their respective countries. 
</P>
<P>
 By tonight, one will wear a halo, the other a set of horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacchi has chopped and changed the Italian lineup with an almost cavalier 
attitude, but he has not made change for change's sake. There have been thought 
and intention behind his moves. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have all paid off, although even he acknowledges having a little 
buona fortuna , but what coach does not need a bit of luck now and then? 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been good to see Giuseppe Signori given a chance as a forward, 
rather than having been tied down in midfield, where he has clearly been less 
than effective. The player is a goal-scorer, let him score. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sacchi has his own ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira has had to do far less patching and repairing. He mended his defense 
early on and has pretty much stuck with the same lineup, tinkering here and 
there with his midfield but still not getting it quite right. 
</P>
<P>
 Once left back Leonardo had been tossed out of the tournament for that 
especially nasty foul on American midfielder Tab Ramos, Parreira was widely 
criticized for playing Branco in Leonardo's place and not the more exciting and 
adventurous Cafu. 
</P>
<P>
 But Branco silenced the critics and vindicated Parreira's faith by scoring 
with an unstoppable, perfectly placed free kick against the Netherlands in the 
quarterfinals. Score one for the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been good to have seen the 17-year-old Ronaldo given some 
playing time, if only that in World Cups to come the youngster can say, "Yes, I 
played on the 1994 team in the United States," but Parreira has resisted that 
temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a feeling that rather than being the exciting, wide-open final that 
everyone would like to see, today's match could bog down into a dour struggle, 
with the victor the beneficiary of one defensive mistake or a single piece of 
offensive brilliance. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1-0 result is not beyond the realm of possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's defense has been weakened by injury and suspension, and it will have 
to have the midfield help out. That will take away from the Italian offense, 
especially if Baggio, who has a strained hamstring, misses the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, despite the presence of Romario and Bebeto, struggled to score against 
the United States and Sweden, the latter twice proving a handful. The reason is 
the lack of imagination in the Brazlian midfield. Imagination is not something 
Parreira can have flown in overnight from Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 What he can do, however, is look to his bench. Alongside him sits Mario 
Zagalo, who played on Brazil's World Cup-winning teams of 1958 and 1962 and 
coached the winning team of 1970. Zagalo knows very well the meaning of jogo 
bonito , the "beautiful game." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira can also consult his memory. He was the physiotherapist for the 1970 
team. In his heart, he knows the way Brazilians like to play. But in his mind, 
will he let them do so, even if it means risking defeat? 
</P>
<P>
 It's very unlikely. As long as the result is more important than the 
performance, entertainment always will take second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Up in the press area, one man will be watching with particular interest. He's 
a television commentator, but he would much rather be down on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 In his epochal battles of yesteryear, none of them mythical, it was always 
easy to tell the heroes from the villains. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroes always wore green and gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 They might be wearing blue.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; REST EASY, THERE IS LIFE AFTER THE CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last 30 days, we were the World Cup in Los Angeles. It has been 
fabulously fun. But in 90 minutes or so, it will be forever gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rai, we hardly knew ye. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's like a honeymoon without the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, we must move on with our lives. (Actually, when I say we , I mean you 
. As for me, I'll just be shifting slightly on the couch.) The World Cup has 
dominated our attention -- well, except for the O.J. Simpson case and that 
Tabitha the Cat thing -- and it is time for us to refocus. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Pasadena adjust to post-World Cup America? 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be L.A. strife after World Cup life? 
</P>
<P>
 What's the deal with Todd Donaho? 
</P>
<P>
 These are the questions that must be asked and these are the questions that 
must be answered. I took a moment out from the World Cup third-place game to 
address as many important inquiries as I could: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The end of the World Cup leaves a big hole. How can people 
effectively cope with this? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The best way to deal with stress is to eat well. Crenshaw melons are 
29 cents a pound this week at Ralphs, pork loin roast -- rib end or sirloin end 
-- is $1.19 a pound at Hughes and Nestle Bon Bons are $1.99 at Vons. (Prices 
effective until Wednesday; all items not available in all stores.) 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But food cannot fully alleviate the psychological letdown, the emotional 
vacuum, the subconscious dissonance left by the loss of such an important 
element in our lives. Freud argued that addiction is a state of pathological 
fusion and that the addict finds comfort in areas of potential space that 
re-evoke infantile mergings and that only through the process of immersive 
transference can cathexis truly be impactful. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just watch Arena Football on ESPN Saturday nights -- 
similar game, higher scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What exactly are you saying about the future of U.S. soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Major League Soccer in this country has about as much chance as Madonna at 
a eunuchs' convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But that Adidas ad says, "Soccer's Not Coming To America. It's Already 
Here." 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah, well, if it's already here, nobody's there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Surely some of the stars of the U.S. team are here to stay as major figures 
on the sporting scene. 
</P>
<P>
 A: By next June, Alexi Lalas is an assistant manager at Jiffy Lube. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's next for Alan Rothenberg? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Baseball commissioner or Rebuild L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And Bora? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Bora who? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: SoccerFest? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Empty nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Seriously, what are we supposed to do without World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Listen, buddy, I'm already into Davis Cup. Back off, Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will happen to the 30-foot inflatable soccer ball tethered outside the 
Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It will be reconverted for use as an Accident Investigation Site (AIS) 
along the 405. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Man, what's to become of all this worthless, leftover World Cup merchandise 
that went unsold? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Check the expanded and newly eclectic "Books Near $5" table at Crown for 
the best bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The prissy people of Pasadena thumbed their noses at the possibility of the 
Raiders and their unruly fans playing at the Rose Bowl, so how come they let 
the likes of World Cup hooligans into their pretentiously precious hamlet? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Most Brazilians speak English better than most Raider fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will most out-of-town soccer fans be staying in L.A. for the NFL season? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, but most football fans in L.A. might have to go out of town for the NFL 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Many of us have become accustomed to watching KMEX daily for Univision's 
soccer coverage. What will fill that void? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although World Cup '94, indeed, is television history after today, other 
KMEX programming worth sampling includes " Las Dos Dianas ," " Mujer Prohibida 
," " Muchachitas ," " Dos Mujeres, un Camino " and, of course, " La Chica TV ." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will there be any "added time" in this article? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Gosh, I hope not -- I'm having trouble making it to the end, as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What becomes of Striker, the World Cup '94 mascot? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Modeled after the Motion Picture & Television Country House in Woodland 
Hills, the Sports Mascot Retirement Home & Manor in Los Alamitos has drawn a 
wide-based clientele. Among those currently residing -- or giving future 
commitments -- to the home are Cobi, Chief Noc-a-homa, the Phillie Phanatic, 
the San Diego Chicken, Hugo the Hornet, Stuff the Magic Dragon, Tommy Trojan, 
Dancing Barry, Dancing Harry, Dyan Cannon, Crazy George and Whatizit. There is 
a separate wing on the grounds occupied solely by Morganna the Kissin' Bandit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How come Maradona was sent home early? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sav-on was out of Sudafed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some people not Rose Bowl-bound will be having a Super Bowl-style World Cup 
Sunday party at home. What's a good thing to serve while watching the World Cup 
telecast? 
</P>
<P>
 A: During the game, we recommend a nice Hungarian braised pork stew with a 
side dish of baked acorn squash and a raspberry-cream bombe dessert. For the 
postgame, peanuts are good.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; COMMENTARY; WILL MIDDLE AMERICA KEEP SOCCER FRONT AND 
CENTER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might turn out that soccer won't make it big in America permanently because 
soccer has made it so big in America temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup has come, 52 games' worth, and now it will go, sometime around 3 
p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 It will leave a legacy of good feeling, of memorable moments, of exciting and 
emotional games and of clean, safe fun for all. Stadiums have been all but 
filled everywhere, and lots of money has been made. Also, the generally cynical 
foreign press came, saw and was mostly conquered by a well-done event. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, it will go. 
</P>
<P>
 And before long, Part 2 of Alan Rothenberg's plan for making soccer a big-time 
sport here will begin. Sometime in the spring, at various cities all over the 
country, Major League Soccer -- a league that represents the most-recent 
attempt to rank the sport alongside football, basketball, baseball and hockey 
on an already crowded sports calendar in this country -- is scheduled to make 
its debut. For the American public, the balloon payment will have come due, and 
there are many reasons to expect a default. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the World Cup has spoiled American soccer fans, especially those really 
paying attention to soccer for the first time. It has been high-quality 
entertainment and athletic competition, but it is also the best that foreign 
money can buy. We are watching AC Milan and FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich and 
Real Madrid and the University of Mexico City. We will not be watching them 
this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, in most cases, will we be watching the American players who, almost 
overnight, became household names. Alexi Lalas will probably take all that 
facial hair and find a regular barber in Europe. Paul Caligiuri has become a 
hot item and it is likely we will discover that you can take the boy out of 
Diamond Bar, especially for lots of European diamonds. Tony Meola has been on 
every TV show except "Geraldo," and he might be able to squeeze that one in too 
before he also is enticed to the lands of francs, pesetas or pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the American stars, who, while certainly American in heritage, 
were mostly here on a soccer lend-lease deal from Europe and Mexico. They are 
John Harkes, Ernie Stewart, Tom Dooley, Eric Wynalda, Cle Kooiman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So it's the same old story. How you gonna keep them down on the farm after 
they've seen Paree? Or at least after they've seen Paree's checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg has done a wonderful job with this World Cup. He has tackled the 
task, taken his knocks and gotten it done. American capitalism, innovation and 
work ethic have come through again, with Rothenberg leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peter Ueberroth made the 1984 L.A. Olympics into a huge financial and 
aesthetic success, Time magazine put him on its cover and called him man of the 
year. But when the '84 Olympics ended, Ueberroth's remaining mandate was merely 
to write some large checks to the International Olympic Committee and have the 
stadiums swept out. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg too must write some large checks to FIFA and have the stadiums 
swept out. But he must then persuade the American public to keep all its 
recently acquired warm and fuzzy soccer feelings on hold for about eight months 
and then go out and plunk down lots of season-ticket money for games in lesser 
stadiums featuring lesser players in an atmosphere of lesser soccer ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not impossible, just very difficult. America is a big-show place. It 
loves its Olympics, its Super Bowls and now its World Cups. But try to sell it 
soccer on Tuesday night in Tulsa and watch it turn tail. 
</P>
<P>
 The press will play a key role in this. The World Cup has become something of 
a writers' event. Whereas some publications have merely covered it, others have 
romanticized it. It is a sport that seems to stir those who love to wax poetic. 
</P>
<P>
 James Michener, no less, in an article for Soccer Watch, wrote: "Every four 
years, when the World Cup is up for grabs -- the supreme contest in the world's 
sporting events -- national patriotism rises to a fever pitch and the great 
spectacle is under way." 
</P>
<P>
 The distinguished Murray Kempton, in Thursday's New York Newsday, wrote: "It 
occurs to me that the worm of time's gnawings could well make this my last 
World Cup and that I must hasten to multiply my prostrations at the Communion 
rail. Since the Almighty is a multinational deity, I cannot conceive of any 
game licensed for playing in heaven except the World Cup. The archangel Michael 
will, of course, be coach and object of widespread grumblings in the angelic 
choir. But then, he can quiet all public discontents by bargaining Diego 
Maradona's release from the infernal regions. And then heaven will be truly 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, an American press that, four weeks ago, didn't know AC Milan from 
AC-DC finds itself interested in the European Championships, interested in 
whether Stoitchkov and Romario can truly get along as side-by-side strikers at 
Barcelona, in whether Roberto Baggio will forsake his Italy for Japan's 
J-League, in whether Miguel Mejia Baron survives and Bora stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the approach in the press will be different. The knee-jerk rejection 
and cynicism to anything involving the sport probably will be lessened, 
especially at some of the larger outlets. The Times will continue regular 
soccer coverage, using the established expertise of Julie Cart and Grahame L. 
Jones; the New York Times, led by the elegant writing and soccer perspective of 
columnist George Vecsey, will probably continue; the Chicago Tribune should 
carry on quite nicely with veteran Phil Hersch and a powerful and knowledgeable 
soccer advocate in its Washington bureau chief, Jim Warren. 
</P>
<P>
 But how is the show likely to play off Broadway, in America's hinterlands? 
</P>
<P>
 In a discussion on non-soccer business recently with Dale Bye, sports editor 
of the Kansas City Star, the World Cup came up. Bye said he thought his paper 
had done well in giving its readers good coverage of the event and even 
mentioned the name Stoitchkov in the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a shocker. It's not that Bye isn't knowledgeable, or that Kansas City 
lacks sophistication. It is simply that, for the Bulgarian star to have become 
that common a name and that quick a frame of reference throughout the United 
States is to think that, just maybe, Rothenberg's Major League Soccer does have 
a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Time magazine had better start planning another cover.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; THE WINNER IS . . . BRAZIL . . . OR ITALY; PREDICTIONS: 
OMARR SEES SHINING STARS, FRITZ SEES CLOUDS FOR THE ITALIANS AND RILEY'S NOT 
SAYING WHICH TEAM WILL FOUR-PEAT.

<P>
 The World Cup final is here at last in the Rose Bowl, the place where anyone 
with a hunch, a gut feeling or a painted face can select a winner before the 
game and have no less than a 50-50 chance of getting it right. 
</P>
<P>
 It's going to be Brazil or Italy, that's for sure, mainly because everyone 
else has already been eliminated. Choosing one of the three-time Cup winners, 
how tough can it be? Pretty tough, actually, especially for novices. Picking a 
winner with any degree of expertise, well, it's not that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to show you that the guesswork goes like clockwork when you're really in 
the know, maybe it's a good idea to check with experts in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Better consult the Prediction People. 
</P>
<P>
 Start with somebody knowledgeable about anything associated with a round ball. 
Make that New York Knick Coach Pat Riley, who is truly accomplished in making 
predictions. In 1987 when he was with the Lakers, he predicted that the Lakers 
would repeat in 1988 as NBA champions, which they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his track record for prognostication, Riley is reluctant to forecast 
today's winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to alienate myself on a worldwide basis," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly that the two best teams are in it. It's a tossup; 
whoever scores first and then plays that four-corner offense like Dean Smith is 
sitting on the bench." 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, the race and sports books are counting the money wagered on the 
final. Vinny Magliulo, director of the race and sports book at Caesar's Palace, 
expects more than $5 million to be wagered legally in Nevada, which is more 
than the earlier projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is still slightly favored by the oddsmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 For people like weatherman Fritz Coleman of Channel 4, this is welcome news. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, who is into the predicting business, spent Friday morning with his 
face stuck in a telescope, studying the comet that was about to sock Jupiter. 
Coleman was doing this for two reasons: He wanted to make sure that comet 
wasn't going to make a right turn and head for California and he wanted to take 
his mind off the possibility that Brazil might lose. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, Coleman is a big Brazil-backer, and with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because I am a screaming coffee addict and I don't want any 
international incident to stem the flow of coffee beans from Sao Paulo," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He's kidding, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so close to the truth I could cry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney Omarr is as close to an expert in forecasting events as anyone, at 
least for the purposes of this article. For years, Omarr has written a daily 
syndicated astrological forecast for newspapers, The Times being one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before Omarr followed the stars, he made predictions about people who 
saw them. Yes, he picked the fights. He earned his first stars for predictions 
in 1947 when he told the Philadelphia Record that Jersey Joe Walcott would beat 
Joe Louis, but he would not get the decision, which is just how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, after that, the sky was the limit for Omarr. Now, on to soccer. He 
agreed to predict the fortunes of three key players in today's final -- Roberto 
Baggio of Italy and Bebeto and Romario of Brazil -- using his fine-tuned 
astrological know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 Omarr was given only the players' birth dates, not their names, and here is 
what he came up with: 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 18, 1967 (Baggio): "He has a very spiritual personality, although maybe 
not in the orthodox fashion. He seeks perfection and tends to be moody and 
ultra-sensitive. He's his own severest critic. He'll be not so good on offense. 
He'll be somewhat locked up. He'll have a tendency to choke." 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 16, 1964 (Bebeto): "His play will be somewhat unorthodox. His team will 
depend on him more so than ever. He will do some sensational things and when 
they work he will be a hero. If they don't work, he will be subjected to 
criticism and ridicule. He either will be very bad or very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 29, 1966 (Romario): "He depends a lot on intuition. He will be very 
powerful. In fact, some of the players will feel as if he has taken over. He 
doesn't tell people what to do, he knows what should be done. And he doesn't 
choke." 
</P>
<P>
 But if you include other factors, Omarr's syndicated astrological forecast for 
today's World Cup final might seem inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio, Bebeto and Romario are Aquarians and, as we all know, the moon is in 
Scorpio for these three guys under this sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, forget the Three Tenors. Omarr's astrological forecast for the Three 
Aquarians today actually includes this message: "(the) ability to win on 
athletic field." 
</P>
<P>
 And is this important? Omarr's own astrological forecast (Leo) for today says, 
in part: "Get rid of false notions about situations, people." 
</P>
<P>
 So that's that. The stars don't lie, but they might fudge a little bit 
sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Find some more prediction experts. 
</P>
<P>
 John Langbein, in charge of the Parkfield quake prediction experiment for the 
U.S. Geological Survey, refused to make a prediction. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, this may be good news for both teams, judging by the Parkfield track 
record -- his group predicted there was a 95% chance of an earthquake of at 
least a 6 magnitude at Parkfield between 1985 and 1993. It didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone who ought to know a thing or two about predictions is Lucile Jones of 
the U.S. Geological Survey and Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ground shakes today, she can be reasonably sure that either we are 
having another earthquake or Bebeto, Romario and Mazinho are dancing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put it this way: My son, Sven, thinks it's going to be Brazil, and he's 
a soccer expert," Jones said. "He's 7 and he's gone World Cup mad too." 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Glasman is a financial adviser for Prudential Securities in Encino. His 
job requires him to know something about the future, at least as far as money 
goes. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Glasman is an expert in stocks, bonds and Brazil, which he thinks is 
going to win. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brazil wins, Glasman has some free advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy Telebras, the biggest telephone company in Brazil," Glasman said. "I 
figure that if Brazil wins, some of those telephone bills down there are going 
to be astronomical and the stock is going to go sky high." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if Brazil loses? 
</P>
<P>
 "Buy the lira," Glasman said.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; ALL TIED AFTER 56 YEARS; ITALY AND BRAZIL HAVE SPLIT THEIR 
FOUR WORLD CUP MATCHES; TODAY ONE COUNTRY WILL MAKE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Had the 1994 World Cup proceeded according to the script, this story could not 
have been written. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to be Brazil against Germany today at the Rose Bowl, not 
Brazil against Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians and Germans were expected to replay their memorable 3-3 tie of 
a year ago, when the teams met at RFK Stadium in Washington in U.S. Cup '93 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this afternoon's match was to be the clash of two three-time champions, 
but one team was supposed to be wearing black, red and yellow, not blue. 
Despite playing a combined total of 145 World Cup matches, Brazil and Germany 
have never played each other in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brazil-Germany final at the Rose Bowl was to have broken that pattern, 
thereby "making soccer history," in the organizers' felicitous phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we have an equally intriguing, if not historic, game between Brazil 
and Italy. Have they met in the past? Indeed they have. . . . JUNE 16, 1938 
</P>
<P>
 Italy 2, Brazil 1 
</P>
<P>
 With a frightened Europe moving inexorably closer to war, the third World Cup 
was played in France, providing a brief couple of weeks of pleasure in a time 
of grave uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians were the defending champions, having taken Benito Mussolini at 
his word when he sent the team a telegram before the 1934 final saying "Win or 
die!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians were another of the favorites and had in their ranks a player 
of sublime skills, a man whose talents were so remarkable that he was given not 
one, but two nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonidas da Silva was his real name, but he was known as " O Homen Borracha " 
(the Rubber Man) for his agility and his bicycle kicks with either foot. More 
commonly, however, he was called " O Diamante Negro " (the Black Diamond). 
</P>
<P>
 His value was immeasurable. In early round victories over Poland and 
Czechoslovakia, Leonidas scored six of Brazil's nine goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, meanwhile, went into the semifinal game against Brazil at the Stade 
Velodrome in Marseille confident of success. The Italians had a remarkable 
goal-scorer of their own, Silvio Piola, whose strength was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In an astonishing decision that even today, more than half a century later, 
cannot be rationalized, Brazil's coach, Ademar Pimenta, elected not to play 
Leonidas, explaining that he was "saving him for the final." 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians never got there, or they might have been playing for their 
fifth world championship today, not their fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil kept Piola in check but could not deny Italy, which satisfied its fans 
in the crowd of 35,000 by providing goals from Gino Colaussi and Giuseppe 
Meazza. Brazil's Romeo scored a consolation goal late in the game, but Italy 
was clearly the better team. JUNE 21, 1970 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil 4, Italy 1 
</P>
<P>
 This was one of those games that time travel one day will be invented in order 
to see. Travelers from the future will line up in droves to return to Azteca 
Stadium in Mexico City on that memorable afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil featured what correctly has been described as the greatest attacking 
team ever. In its star-studded ranks were, among others, Pele, Jairzinho, 
Roberto Rivelinho, Carlos Alberto and Gerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, meanwhile, featured, among others, Giacinto Facchetti, Alessandro 
Mazzola, Luigi Riva and, if only as a substitute, Gianni Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 As things turned out, it would not have mattered who the Italians put on the 
field. The Brazilians were devastating, and the crowd of 107,000 was treated to 
a display of offensive fireworks that has not been equaled. 
</P>
<P>
 It took them only 18 minutes to score their first goal, Pele rising above the 
defense to powerfully head home a cross from Jairzinho. It was a goal for the 
record books, Brazil's 100th in World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians pounced on a Brazlian defensive error late in the first half and 
Roberto Boninsegna tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The second 45 minutes belonged to Brazil and, as a result, to the world. 
Gerson orchestrated the attack, sparking it in the 65th minute with a superbly 
struck shot from the edge of the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerson then provided the cross that Pele headed into Jairzinho's path so that 
Jairzinho could make history by becoming the first player to score a goal in 
every round of the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 3-1, Brazil completed the victory in memorable fashion when Pele sent 
an excellent diagonal pass to overlapping fullback Carlos Alberto, who rocketed 
a shot into the back of the net to make Brazil the first country to win the 
title three times. JUNE 24, 1978 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil 2, Italy 1 
</P>
<P>
 Monumental Stadium in Buenos Aires was the scene of the third World Cup 
meeting between the Brazilians and Italians, who this time faced each other in 
a game both would rather have avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing more exciting than third place was on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 76,609 favored the Italians and was rewarded in the 38th minute 
when Franco Causio headed in a cross from Paolo Rossi, who would make his own 
name four years later in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in 1970, however, the second half belonged to Brazil, which tied the 
score in the 64th minute when a 35-yard shot by Nelinho deceived Italian 
goalkeeper Dino Zoff, then won it 60 seconds later when Dirceu volleyed home a 
shot from just outside the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to their earlier clashes, this one was not nearly as exciting, but 
Brazil did have the consolation of finishing the tournament unbeaten even 
though it had to settle for the bronze medal. JULY 5, 1982 
</P>
<P>
 Italy 3, Brazil 2 
</P>
<P>
 Played at tiny Sarria Stadium in Barcelona, the game attracted a capacity 
crowd of 44,000, with hundreds more watching from the rooftops and balconies 
overlooking the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a match they saw, one of the best of the 1982 tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians needed only a point to reach the semifinals. The Italians had 
to win to advance, so they attacked from the opening whistle and went ahead 
when striker Paolo Rossi headed in a center from left back Antonio Cabrini. 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, the Brazilians continued to move the ball with ease and in a 
casual, almost arrogant fashion. Seven minutes later, they were tied, the 
elegant Socrates having slotted home Zico's pass from an almost impossible 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brazilian mistake in the 25th minute proved costly when Rossi intercepted a 
careless pass by Toninho Cerezo and fired home his second goal. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no more scoring until the 68th minute, when Paolo Roberto Falcao 
struck a left-footed shot that tied the score, 2-2. Brazil needed only to keep 
the score tied for another 22 minutes and it would have made the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not in the Brazilian nature to defend -- at least it was not in 
those days -- and they continued to attack. That left the door open for the 
Italians to do likewise. The result was predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing to win, Italy got the decisive goal with 15 minutes remaining when a 
poor clearance by Junior fell at Rossi's feet and he hammered home the goal 
that sent his country through to the semifinals and the Brazilians home. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Zoff, the goalkeeper who had allowed Brazil two long-range goals in the 
1978 game, made a superb save in the closing minutes to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, as usual, was the most attractive, most adventurous, most exciting 
team in the tournament, but that was not enough. Italy went on to win the World 
Cup for a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth chapter in their 56-year rivalry will be written this afternoon.

 The problems that have plagued Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi throughout the 
tournament continue to multiply. Injuries are his main concern, with forward 
Roberto Baggio on Friday listed as only 50-50 for the game.Baggio's hamstring 
strain could spell the difference between victory and defeat for Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspensions of defenders Mauro Tassotti and Alessandro Costacurta, plus 
the uncertain status of injured sweeper Franco Baresi, leaves Sacchi having to 
reorganize his defense at the worst possible time -- with Brazilians Romario 
and Bebeto polishing their gun sights. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are Sacchi will order his midfield to adopt a more conservative role, 
perhaps allowing only Demetrio Albertini the freedom to roam. That way, the 
midfielders can help the defense more and Italy can play a counter-attacking 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, unfortunately, has shown it can overcome that strategy, even if it 
means winning by a single goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The key will be Roberto Baggio's presence and, if he is absent or hobbled by 
the injury, the showing of his expected replacement, Giuseppe Signori. The 
latter might yet have the chance to prove Sacchi wrong for playing him in 
midfield instead of up front where he belongs. GRAHAME L. JONES

<P>
 The 52-game, 24-team World Cup has down come to this: Italy and Brazil have 
earned the right to play today at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Gianluca Pagliuca Caps: 22 Up close: Pagliuca was ejected during group play 
and did not return until the second round. He built his reputation in the 
Italian league's First Division. In 1993, Pagliuca suffered a broken collerbone 
and other injuries in a car crash, but did not miss any World Cup qualifying 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi Apolloni Caps: 3 Up close: He will replace Alessandro Costacurte, who 
will miss today's game because he received two yellow cards after the first 
round. He plays alongside Benarrivo for Parma, but has limited international 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio Benarrivo Caps: 13 Up close: Benarrivo likes to move forward with the 
ball because he has the speed to return to his defensive position. Teammates 
have nicknamed him Pollicino or Tom Thumb because he is 5 feet 7, 144 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Paolo Maldini Caps: 57 Up close: Maldini is considered to be one of the 
world's best left fullbacks, and he is the anchor of Italy's defense. Although 
26, he has played in the Italian First Division for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Mussi Caps: 4 Up close: As coach of AC Milan, Arrigo Sacchi, Italy's 
national team coach, once told club owner Silvio Berlusconi Mussi would become 
an outstanding player. Berlusconi, Italy's new prime minster, did not listen. 
He sold Mussi to Turin, where he developed into a national team defender. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Baggio Caps: 42 Up close: The world's most acclaimed player, Baggio 
has shown his greatness in the last two weeks. He was the 1993 FIFA player of 
the year and European Footballer of the Year, finishing ahead of Dennis 
Bergkamp of the Netherlands and Romario of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetrio Albertini Caps: 21 Up close: Italy's playmaking midfielder is the man 
who makes it happen for Roberto Baggio. Albertini gets the masterful striker 
the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Baggio Caps: 19 Up close: He could use a new name. Baggio, not related to 
Roberto, is the backbone of the Italian midfield. Most think he will develop 
into one of the great ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicola Berti Caps: 32 Up close: Berti caused a scene in Fiorentina when he 
left the club for Inter. The fans said they were betrayed. Berti said he was 
abandoned by his one-time supporters. His aggressive play makes him a fan 
target from rival clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Donadoni Caps: 56 Up close: Donadoni has enjoyed the success of AC 
Milan where he has gained invaluable experience on the world's leading club. He 
is best used as a deep-wing on the right side. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierluigi Casiraghi Caps: 19 Up close: After toiling four years in the second 
and third divisions, Casiraghi joined Juventus in 1989. Playing for Juventus 
helped him reach the national team in 1991. But since then, he has been in and 
out of the lineup. He was traded to Lazio in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuseppe Signori Caps: 22 Up close: The left foot of Signori has not had the 
impact during the World Cup that it did during the past two seasons with Lazio 
of Rome. He won consecutive scoring titles with 49 goals in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniele Massaro Caps: 14 Up close: Massaro rejoined the national team for the 
first time since 1986. Despite his age, 1994 was his finest season for AC Milan 
as he scored 11 goals in helping the club win the scudetto, or league 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Arrigo Sacchi Age: 48 World Cup experience: This is his forst World Cup 
World Cup Record: 4-1-1 Up close: Sacchi, 48, led AC Milan to successive club 
championships in 1989-90 before taking over the national team with the intent 
of bringing home a World Cup title. Sacchi's career began in 1977 as a youth 
manager of Cesena. He never played professionally, and before coaching, Sacchi 
was a traveling shoes salesman. ROSTER

 The 52-game, 24-team World Cup has down come to this: Italy and Brazil have 
earned the right to play today at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudio Taffarel Caps: 82 Up close: Brazil's vaunted offense and underrated 
defense have made for a relatively easy tournament for Taffarel, who has only 
needed to make 12 saves. That should change today. . . . Erratic club season 
culminated with a shutout for Reggiana against European champion A.C. Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorginho Caps: 73 Up close: Has emerged as the most dangerous defensive player 
of the tournament with his runs deep down the right side and is considered 
among the world's best right defenders. . . . Assisted on game-winning goal in 
semifinals with perfect cross to Romario. . . . Anchored German League champion 
Bayern Munich's defense last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauro Silva Caps: 44 Up close: Has been unable to fill the team's dire need 
for a creative midfielder despite ample opportunity. . . . A teammate of 
Bebeto's in the Spanish League and together they led Deportivo La Coruna to 
second place behind Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 Branco Caps: 76 Up close: A solid but unspectacular member of the defense with 
a good scoring touch on free kicks. . . . Scored the game-winning goal against 
the Netherlands on a free kick. . . . Returned to play professionally in Brazil 
after stints in Italy and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto Caps: 85 Up close: Has three goals, two assists and the best front-line 
partner a forward could ever request. . . . Did not have much of an impact 
against Sweden, although could have field day against depleted Italian defense. 
. . . Key component in La Coruna's failed bid to win Spanish League. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga Caps: 55 Up close: One of the tournament's great name contrasts. He's 
nicknamed "Dunga the Destroyer" across Europe but his name means Dopey in 
Portuguese. . . . A defensive player whose presence limits the midfield's 
offensive creativity. . . . Style perfect for VfB Stuttgart in German League. 
</P>
<P>
 Zinho Caps: 40 Up close: A major disappointment who has not played well enough 
to justify Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira's decision to leave the heralded Valdo 
off the team. . . . Has shown only flashes of potential on offense. . . .One of 
few national team members still playing professionally in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Rai Caps: 56 Up close: With Mazinho playing poorly, he was inserted against 
Sweden and played even worse, consistently giving the ball away. . . . Play 
inspired chants of "Cafu, Cafu" from fans wanting tio see a different 
midfielder. . . . Helped Paris win French League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario Caps: 56 Up close: Has five goals, one assist and the best front-line 
partner a forward could ever request. . . . Only concern is midfield's 
inability to get him the ball, forcing him to back track to gain possession and 
then create own opportunities. . . . Cannot be guarded by only one defender. . 
. . Played on Barcelona team that was trounced by AC Milan, 4-0, in European 
Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Aldair Caps: 26 Up close: Major knee surgery in 1993 has done nothing to slow 
Aldair, whose play in the middle has been solid. . . .Has teammed with Marcio 
Santos to lead a defense that has allowed only three goals. . . . Played in 
Portugal before joining Roma of the Italian league. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcio Santos Caps: 41 Up close: Won a spot in the starting lineup because of 
an injury to Mozer and seems unlikely to ever give it up. . . . Has been 
tenacious heading away balls in the middle. . . . Currently plays 
professionally in France, but excellent World Cup should land him in a better 
league soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazinho Caps: 53 Up close: Hanging on to starting job by a thread after being 
benched during semifinal. . . . Somehow missed a wide open net in first half 
against Sweden. . . . Poor play in Italy led to his return to Brazilian pro 
league where he led Palmeiras to 1993 title. 
</P>
<P>
 COACH: Carlos Alberto Parreira Age: 51 World Cup Experience: Coached Kuwait in 
1982 tournament in Spain, the United Arab Emirates in 1990 in Italy and Brazil 
this year. World Cup Record: 5-5-2 Up close: Besieged by the Italian press, 
criticized for lineup decisions by his mother and Pele, Parreira has his team 
in the finals nonetheless. . . . Should be applauded for including Mario 
Zagalo, who coached Brazil to the World Cup title in 1970, on his coaching 
staff. . . . Has coached the national teams of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the 
United Arab Emirates and reportedly would be interested in directing U.S. team 
if Bora Milutinovic is not retained. ROSTER

<P>
 The problem facing Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira today is not an 
easy one to solve. His midfield's performance is key to the game's outcome but 
his midfield is clearly the team's weak point. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasted by the Brazilian media for their lack of creativity, the midfielders 
will have to lift their game to new heights, both offensively and defensively, 
against an Italian team whose midfield, on paper, is stronger and more 
attack-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira has the edge in forwards, where Romario and Bebeto will be going 
against a makeshift Italian defense, but if Italy wins the midfield battle, the 
two strikers will be left searching in vain for the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian defense is sound enough, with Aldair and Marcio Santos having 
performed better than expected in their fill-in roles at the center once 
Ricardo Rocha and Ricardo Gomes were injured. Brazil superiority fullbacks in 
Jorginho and Branco, with another surprise package waiting in the wings in the 
shape of Cafu. All three like to attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In goal, Taffarel will have to keep a sharp eye open for the long-range 
Italian shots, especially from players such as Dino Baggio and Demetrio 
Albertini. GRAHAME L. JONES

NEW CALIFORNIA FICTION; ANYTHING BUT A GENTLEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL HAYES, Daniel Hayes grew up in Southern California, studied at UC 
Berkeley and now teaches writing at UCLA. Anything but a Gentleman is an 
excerpt from a recently completed novel of the same name, which comprises 112 
vignettes that are aggressively non-linear. That's the way my mind works, he 
says, and so that's how I write. And isn't that the way people present

 ACCOMPLICE 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman entered his life. Like a long night at the theater, and you 
think you've seen all of the characters in the play, and then suddenly, out of 
nowhere, a woman walks onto the stage. A woman from a world you hadn't known 
about, hadn't even suspected. She's a Frieda or a Julie or an Elizabeth who's 
really a Liz or a Beth. Another face, another mind, another worry, another 
dupe, another potential instigator of pain. You welcome her into your heart, 
allow your mutual needs to collide, the intimacy building as secret lives 
unravel, and soon there's this ball of string at your feet, and you're standing 
above the mess, looking down, until finally you look up and see her -- her eyes 
-- and then there's nothing else to do but embrace, explore protrusions, 
cavities, or just keep staring into each other's eyes as if eyes could speak, 
and sometimes it seems they can. He felt obliged to answer her when she looked 
at him, as though a stare were a pressing question; and he responded not by 
staring back but by making a shocking proposition or, more often than not, a 
series of admissions. He had plenty of those, a whole stockpile of admissions, 
some of them old enough to no longer qualify. And so he'd pick one up like an 
old book, blow off the dust, crack open the spine and invite her to look over 
his shoulder as he jabbed with his finger to indicate the most revealing, 
potentially damaging parts.Get it over and done with, like opening your mouth 
and pointing to the tooth you want the dentist to extract. She was to be an 
accomplice in his downfall, giving evidence against him in a mad, circuitous 
attempt to gain the sympathy of the jury -- a larger collection of women who 
would later add up his deficits and, if he were lucky, give the miracle of a 
decision in his favor. To redeem himself, he needed the attention of women, one 
after another, to listen and finally touch him with a grace he didn't deserve, 
a forgiveness he hadn't ever gotten close to earning. ANSWER 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe was on the bus route, and he would always meet her there after 
crossing the city to spend the night at her place. Years later, on a trip to 
that city where he'd once lived, he found the same cafe. He'd been searching 
for it and gotten lost, and he was annoyed with himself for not being able to 
retrace his steps. But then he turned a corner and the neighborhood was 
suddenly familiar. A minute later he found the cafe, ordered coffee, sat down 
and slowly looked around. The cafe held memories just beyond his reach; he 
spent more time trying to remember than actually remembering. The cafe looked 
the same as before but the people had changed. Or, on second thought, he 
realized that the people hadn't changed, nor had the cafe, nor had the music 
that was coming out of the loudspeakers hanging from the ceiling. In any case, 
he felt out of place, the same way the past is perpetually out of place. He 
wanted to think of her again, to bring her back, to think it possible for her 
to walk through the door and stop and smile at him, her head cocked to one side 
as though to say, Well, well. Sunglasses on top of her head, her black hair cut 
short, a long skirt that went swish-swish as she came toward him. But he wasn't 
any good at imagining it, or he couldn't keep hold of the image, because he 
knew that she would be different now, and he didn't know if she even lived here 
anymore. He was sure she wouldn't like this place, that she had moved on, 
changed her tastes in cafes as well as in men. She had a habit of doing that. 
She'd always been quick to judge, which was one of the things he had liked 
about her. She saw everything in the world -- people, books, cities, movies, 
even cafes -- as attempts to please her, as court jesters come to entertain and 
earn their keep. She nodded her head yes, or she shook her head no -- rarely 
any hesitation. He'd asked her, back then, why she was with him, why she wanted 
to be with him, and she never gave him an answer that convinced him. She'd said 
yes to the person he was, but that wasn't enough. No one had ever convinced 
him, but she'd been the least convincing. She'd scared him, and that was almost 
worth it -- the thrill of not knowing, or of being unworthy and somehow getting 
away with it -- but that was also what led him to distrust her, to suspect that 
eventually she would come to dislike him and make him feel stupid. She'd make 
him feel like a book you wouldn't want to read twice. He'd finally left her to 
avoid that feeling -- he'd seen it coming -- and now, sitting in this cafe, 
wishing to get just a glimpse of her, it came to him, in spite of all his 
precautions, that exact feeling of swimming in his own stupidity. There was no 
stopping it. BOY 
</P>
<P>
 A woman said to him, Some men are men, and some men are boys and they'll 
always be boys. She wasn't referring to levels of maturity, or degrees of 
masculinity, but to a man's appearance, and also to his attitude, the way he 
took hold of the world or watched as the world took hold of him. He listened to 
her, at once imagining himself as a boy, his blond hair in his eyes as he lay 
on his back, on someone's front lawn, where someone stood above him, bending 
over and tickling him and making him feel the pleasure of getting, at the same 
moment, what he wanted and what he didn't want. A boy's highest delight was 
always in that exhilarating ambiguity. He was still ticklish, even to this day, 
but no one knew it, or no one took advantage of it; and even if you can 
sometimes make yourself laugh, or give yourself intricate forms of sexual 
pleasure, it's impossible to tickle yourself. Maybe she knew what he wanted. 
Maybe she'd seen it as soon as she'd seen that he was a boy, that he'd always 
been that way. How had she known, or how could she be so sure? And the question 
remained as to whether she wished to take advantage of the boyishness she'd 
guessed at, whether she liked to tickle. She kept her cards close to her chest, 
and he couldn't help admiring her for that. Still, it gave him hope that her 
observation about his boyishness had clearly been intended as neither 
compliment nor insult, which made him think that life for her was more 
complicated than that, more roundabout in its logic, and that she was more 
accepting of the inevitability of the way people turned out, despite their 
best-laid plans. ECLAIR 
</P>
<P>
 What he liked about her was her impulsiveness, especially when it came to 
food. She'd go to a bakery and buy indiscriminately, bringing home a huge 
assortment of baked goods. Cakes, pies, fruit tarts, sour-cream brownies, 
hazelnut croissants, bear claws, exquisite little chocolate things, every kind 
of muffin. Never anything as practical as bread. She'd come home and say, I 
went to the bakery, tossing the heavy white bags on the kitchen table. Or if it 
wasn't a bakery, then it was a deli, and she'd bring home tall pastrami 
sandwiches with gushing mustard, plump shrimps in garlic sauce, every variety 
of potato salad, three or four small bags of potato chips, just in case, and a 
dessert treat to finish things off. She had no conception of money, nor any 
idea of what a human being could reasonably be expected to eat. Her dog, a 
miniature schnauzer, feasted on leftovers. She told him that she had never set 
foot in a supermarket since the end of her marriage -- a marriage that never 
seemed quite real to him, as though she might've made up the whole thing, 
invented a change in her life by imagining herself as someone she'd never been. 
He himself couldn't imagine her in a supermarket -- now or back then, years ago 
-- buying food that had to be cooked or otherwise prepared. She left that to 
others. In bakeries and delis, she flattered the people behind the counters, 
explaining in apt, convincing terminology why their eclair, say, was better 
than anyone else's. Even later, when their sexual life was nearly null, they 
ate like fiends. And so it went, shamelessly, without the guilt or ambivalence 
typical among those who eat without reason. In restaurants, they sometimes 
finished their meal and had the feeling that only half of what was supposed to 
have happened had happened, and so they ordered the same thing again and ate 
it. Waitresses kept their thoughts to themselves. He couldn't help worrying a 
little about those waitresses, about what other people might think, but she 
never cared a lick what anyone thought, least of all waitresses. He took on 
that carefree attitude, as best he could, because he wanted to call it his own; 
he hadn't ever eaten this way, but he was interested in trying it out, 
imagining himself as someone he'd never been. When eventually they split up, he 
went back to wheeling his cart through supermarkets and eating like a normal 
person. He felt an inordinate fear of waitresses and the people who served in 
bakeries and delis, as though the verbal exchange between two strangers over a 
counter was too much for him now. She'd done all the talking in the past, he 
realized. He was convinced that these people knew far too much about him, held 
opinions about his acts of indulgence, and any indifference they displayed was 
only a ploy to know even more. HEART 
</P>
<P>
 She returned and she wanted to know what had happened in his life. He couldn't 
say. A lot had happened, only he wasn't in the mood to run down a list of items 
when he knew, or thought he knew, that they wouldn't add up to anything 
palpable. He'd been unhappy -- that was easy to say -- but he knew from 
experience that he wouldn't be able to explain why, let alone conjure what he'd 
been feeling at the time. So he didn't try, because he felt hopeless and 
because he'd gotten into the habit of not trying, of stopping before he'd even 
begun. For him, his reluctance wasn't that different from a simple lapse of 
memory: He tried to return to where he'd been a week ago, or even a couple of 
days ago, and he couldn't. He felt the way you feel when someone asks you about 
a friend of yours, how's he doing, and you don't really know what to say 
because you can't remember, and so you just make up something or you try to 
answer the question in your friend's voice, maybe using the words this friend 
would use if he were answering for himself. In your own case, you aren't 
supposed to answer the question that way, speaking for yourself as though you 
were someone else. A person should be able to go further in explaining what had 
led to unhappiness -- he knew that -- but what he ended up talking about was 
the unhappiness of not being able to explain the other, original unhappiness. 
She said, One out of two isn't so bad, and that was nice of her. She saw the 
world as one of limited opportunity, but seeing it that way hadn't undone her. 
You can only do so much, he told himself, using a line she might've used. He 
remembered when he was a boy and how his father would come home and tell his 
mother stories about everything that had happened that day at the office. In 
retrospect, he could see that his father had needed to tell the stories, 
couldn't have gone on without telling them. The stories were mostly 
point-by-point re-enactments of conversations: I said this . . . he said that . 
. . I said this. Now, no longer a boy, he wanted to tell stories that same way, 
to bring the present into the past, if only to repeat the past, to listen to 
the stories of his own life, to have her listen, to master things the second 
time around. But he'd grown paralyzed, unable to believe in his own versions of 
the past, even when the original conversations took place nowhere but in his 
own mind, in his imagination, which was where much of his life took place these 
days. He felt tempted to lie, to leave parts out, to elaborate, to make the 
story more compelling, to flatter himself. Wasn't that the biggest reason why 
people told stories? He felt tempted, and that froze him, stopped him in his 
tracks. It wasn't that he resisted these temptations -- was that even possible? 
-- but that he'd given up the idea of trying, given up the idea of saying to 
someone else, or sometimes just himself, that something had happened and it had 
happened like this . He'd given up on staking his heart to the this , which was 
like having no heart at all. MEMORY 
</P>
<P>
 He talked on the phone with an ex-girlfriend's mother. They shared the 
disadvantage of thinking too much, taking the long way around, and yet they 
spoke always from a distance, as though he were still her daughter's boyfriend. 
The relationship with the woman had ended, and yet he kept up with the woman's 
mother -- it didn't make a lot of sense. They spoke every other month or so, 
and at points they talked about her daughter, his ex-girlfriend, but only 
briefly, because there was danger in that. He didn't want to live through that 
again. She told him that she disappointed her daughter, because her daughter 
wanted her to be strong, to find strength from inside of herself. Her daughter 
couldn't easily imagine the predicament of being alone because there'd always 
been a long string of boys, and then a long string of men, to offer her an ear, 
to give notice that her presence in the world mattered. Her mother didn't have 
that any longer, and she ached for a man. It only got harder as you got older, 
as people got more set in their ways, and as time took its toll on your looks. 
Or it was a sadness over the memory of what it felt like to look the way you 
looked. Some men and women never forget, and their pasts tag along, earlier 
good fortune following at their heels like an obedient dog. But this woman had 
lost her past, watched it float away with the image of her ex-husband, and now 
she was unmoored, lonely, desperate to recover it. Even if she never gave 
herself a chance to really think about it, he knew she had the fantasy of 
returning to that same husband, and she wasn't of a mind to let it go. She 
wanted to find something that would retroactively redeem the whole of 
everything. That was the gist of what she had to say when she was at her 
weakest. And sometimes she felt a little sorry for herself -- it was true -- 
but never so much that he felt obliged to intercede to make her feel better, 
nor did she ask for that. Their phone discussions couldn't bring redemption, 
and maybe that was why it became a favorite topic. Her daughter had given him a 
taste of it, and now her mother bore witness to the pain of its sustained 
absence. PATIO 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to a new apartment that included a patio. In fact, the patio was the 
prime selling point of the apartment; he would never have moved in if the 
apartment hadn't had the patio, which looked out on a batch of eucalyptus trees 
that were slowly being strangled by omnipresent ivy. Birds, owls, a colony of 
squirrels and the occasional bewildered-looking dog, an escapee from a 
neighboring yard. He sat on his patio, on a redwood chaise lounge, and as the 
sun shone down on his bare toes he felt the closest thing to happiness. It made 
him think of his grandparents' patio, when he was a child, with trees and 
patches of Kentucky bluegrass and wind chimes, and they'd sit -- his parents 
and his mother's parents -- out on the patio, with iced tea or drinks or wine, 
and they'd chat. Chat about what? He didn't have any idea, but he could 
remember feeling bored with the circumstances -- the patio, the serenity, the 
wet dirt in the immaculate flower beds -- and so he'd investigate the alley out 
in the back, beyond the garage. There was none where he lived. Or he'd play 
with the two dogs, one of which was half-coyote. But he certainly wouldn't sit 
on the patio, like an adult, and while away an afternoon in frivolous talk. In 
short, he'd never liked that patio but saw now that his pleasure in his new 
patio was inextricably linked to the old patio, as though he'd been waiting all 
this time to take pleasure in what he couldn't take pleasure in as a child, as 
though he knew then -- somewhere in the back of his little mind -- that he was 
meant for patios, and that was why he hated his grandparents' patio. There's 
some relish in turning away or resisting your destiny and its pleasures while 
you still have the chance. Or maybe it was that he'd finally grown up, taken 
his spot on the chaise lounge, filled the indentation left by his forebears, 
moved his life, or been moved by his life, into a period of simpler pleasures 
-- the pleasure of doing nothing, of absence, of sitting and thinking and 
listening to the birds and resenting the dogs that barked, some days 
incessantly, for no reason he could fathom. He sat on his patio alone, chatting 
with himself, sunk in the warm arms of self-absorption. There was even a day 
when one of those dogs wandered among the ivy, sniffing maybe for squirrels, 
and then looked up and stood still -- as though in shock at the sight of this 
man on his chaise lounge -- and something passed between the two of them, 10 or 
so yards apart, something about fear and not-knowing and a yearning to get 
closer. He waved at the dog, as a child might, knowing that the dog wouldn't 
understand the significance of his gesture but not really caring. SILLINESS 
</P>
<P>
 She had a boy who was 11 years old. It wouldn't be true to say that that's 
what interested him about her -- the boy -- but there were times when he felt 
as though he had a lot in common with him, maybe more than with his mother. He 
liked him. The boy was reserved, unusually quiet, almost serene. When she was 
gone, he'd stay with the boy and sometimes they sat in the same room for an 
hour or two, saying nothing to each other but flipping through magazines and 
passing a box of crackers. No apparent nervousness or shyness at the heart of 
that silence. They both liked to read and shared this silly appetite for 
magazines. They leafed through one, tossed it back on the coffee table, grabbed 
another -- until eventually they exhausted the whole pile of magazines. The 
crackers, too. The boy wore glasses when he read, and sometimes he'd bite his 
nails. It wasn't clear whether he knew he was biting his nails, or whether he'd 
be ashamed to have it pointed out. The boy's mother bit her nails as well, 
which was probably where the boy had picked it up, though she wasn't in the 
least ashamed. She was tall and wore her hair in a loose braid. It seemed 
stupid but he'd always wanted to be with a woman with hair like that -- thick, 
dark, worked back into a single braid. He'd done some thinking about women's 
hair, the idea of a braid, the way he liked it. How is it that these strange 
desires come into being? Magazines, braids, people who don't say a word to each 
other. What of all those men who want to be with a blonde or a woman with 
enormous breasts? Somewhere along the line he'd succumbed to his own desires, 
recognizing their silliness, feeling embarrassed at first but then facing up to 
the limits of his imagination, giving in to his predilections the way a parent 
gives in to a child, the way some people give in to biting their nails. In 
fact, it was the same way he would've given in to the woman's boy if he'd ever 
asked for anything, ever told of a wound that wouldn't heal. He wanted the boy 
to suffer, if only for a moment, and then to reach out for help. Instead, the 
boy appeared calm, oblivious to the messiness of the lives around him -- his 
mother's, for instance. He wondered whether the boy would always be that way, 
or whether he'd explode into adolescence, making up for lost time, wearing his 
masculinity like a badge, demanding that others pay up for having made a mess 
of things. His own adolescence had been less an explosion than a muffled cry. 
And a single gesture: a hand, his own, placed across his mouth, as though 
something had just escaped that shouldn't have, that never would again. SKIRT 
</P>
<P>
 He looked at the picture, in a fashion magazine, and saw a woman in a short, 
sequined skirt unlike any skirt you'd see a woman wear on the street. He liked 
it that way -- nothing real, as though the image itself were imagined. Because 
of the way the woman in the picture was sitting -- her weight on one hip, legs 
crossed at the highest point -- the skirt was hiked up farther than it might've 
been. That was the way he phrased it in his mind -- hiked up -- and those words 
were almost more exciting than the sight of the skirt itself, which rode up her 
thighs as she stared blankly into the camera, at us, as though to say that she 
knew that we knew but that it wasn't important. It was important to him, 
though: He was mesmerized. He wanted to touch this woman, wanted to slide his 
hand along the woman's leg, up under her skirt. He also wanted her to close her 
eyes, if only for a moment, so that she could see in her mind, and he could see 
in her mind, an image of what the hand was doing. He wanted her to want that, 
to feel compelled to imagine what it must look like. But what he really wanted, 
whether he knew it or not, was to have what it was that allowed him to slide 
his hand up under her skirt. He'd first imagined it as a chance encounter -- he 
didn't know this woman, hadn't ever seen a sequined skirt like hers, and she 
was allowing him to do with her what he wanted. But that scenario went stale, 
and soon he wanted, at the least, for her to want him to want her. He wanted 
the intimacy that made that possible. He wanted a connection, a look between 
them like some speeded-up conversation, an emotional current that allowed him 
or even moved him, against all calculation of what he should do, or shouldn't 
do, to slip his hand under her skirt. He wanted what allowed that to happen 
more than he wanted it to happen. He wanted that moment again when everything 
is right in the world, when neediness is relegated to childhood, where it 
belongs, and sexual desire is pure, blunt, inexplicable. He wanted the end of 
all of that emotion that was itself the impetus of the sexual desire, a good 
part of the reason for the thrill of looking at the picture in the first place. 
STRANGER 
</P>
<P>
 He met a woman who wanted to touch only parts of his body, and never more than 
one at a time, and his penis was of no special significance. At first, before 
he fully understood the nature of her desire, she seemed only shy and hesitant. 
He wanted to reassure her, take care of her; and eventually his desire got 
mixed up with pity, as typically happened, whether or not he wanted it to. Her 
fear drew him closer, and he imagined himself leading her out of that fear, 
going as slow as she needed to go. Anyway, what was the hurry? But he'd 
misunderstood her intentions: She wanted to go slow with a peculiar vengeance. 
He first realized this when she said she wanted only to touch his eyes, for him 
to lie down on the bed so that she could sit behind him and put a single finger 
on each of his eyelids. To make the dark darker, she said. A strange request, 
he thought, but it also seemed sweet of her. He couldn't have predicted it, but 
after closing his eyes and feeling her fingers press down, ever so slightly, it 
immediately came to him that she might hurt him, and he couldn't work that 
possibility out of his mind. What if, without warning, she pressed down with 
all her might? After all, how well did he know her? Would his eyeballs explode, 
like tiny, taut balloons? Life's frightening enough, and sex is a scary 
venture, especially in the beginning, but all of that pales when compared to 
the possibility of a virtual stranger pushing down relentlessly on your 
eyeballs. He knew that, and knowing it made him uncomfortable. As it turned 
out, she didn't choose to crush his eyeballs, and she never asked to touch them 
again. Instead, she moved on to his arms, his legs, the toes of each foot taken 
as a unit. She did everything as though she was responding to a secret idea or 
plan of action, as though she possessed an elaborate stratagem for pleasure. 
Like a worn map she pulled out in private. He had no idea where she was taking 
him, but he was getting to the point of liking the fear, getting used to it. 
TUXEDO 
</P>
<P>
 If only for one night, he wanted to act gruffly, to be sure of himself, to 
feel excessively masculine. He'd throw all doubts out the window. He wanted to 
bark at people, and give the impression to bystanders that he used his power 
because he had it, whether or not he'd ever earned it. He wanted to feel as 
though he was at the end of what was necessarily a very long leash. He wanted 
to say the word women as though it amounted to a confession. He wanted to wear 
a tuxedo and drink too much and stay up all night and say all those things he'd 
never gotten around to saying, even if he'd never before felt the impulse to 
say them. He wanted to feel the impulse. He wasn't sure to whom he'd say these 
things, but maybe it was to other men -- gruff, soggy on liquor, done up in 
tuxedos, very much like himself. Men who loved each other almost as much as 
they loved themselves. WOMAN 
</P>
<P>
 The road, which wound along the edge of the city for miles, twisting and 
turning, made driving a challenge, especially in the dark. From the opposite 
direction, cars appeared out of nowhere. He drove madly, eyes glued to the 
road, talking to the woman in the passenger seat about their past together, her 
recent marriage, the direction of their lives. They didn't look at each other 
for the 40 or so minutes they drove along, because the road didn't allow it and 
because he didn't want it, and maybe she didn't either. It was like talking on 
the telephone except the person was sitting right next to you. The conversation 
advanced, retreated, got dead serious and then came back to a place of humor. 
It wasn't a matter of getting things off your chest, or even communicating 
something personal or ethereal, as much as it was a game of discussing, 
prodding, arguing, taking on opinions, propelling the conversation to places 
where you hadn't gone before, where you hadn't counted on going. Not having 
seen each other in almost two years, they returned to this way of gaining 
intimacy by giving it, through talk, an occasion or excuse. She talked of the 
limitations of her marriage, of any marriage, and of her desire to keep going, 
maybe even to embrace those limitations, though no one asks to be limited. She 
was a strange mixture of enthusiasm and sobriety, and he felt caught in 
between, not so much swayed by her opinions as amused, mesmerized, challenged. 
The limitations she spoke of were mostly the limitations of conversation with 
her husband, so that what they were having, in his car, was a conversation 
about the possibility, or difficulty, of conversation. Her husband was always 
interested in talking, she said, and even in arguing, but he wasn't always 
interested in the places where she wanted to go, the rules by which she wanted 
to conduct the conversation. Listening to her and negotiating the curves in the 
road, he could sympathize with her husband. Not because he himself got tired of 
talking to this woman, but because he imagined it was possible, if the stakes 
were consistently raised, to tire of anyone, to feel your limitations and wish 
to play a different kind of game where you'd be more comfortable. But driving 
along, engaged in this conversation, he was happy. Maybe because the stakes 
weren't high enough to scare him out of his happiness. She said at one point, I 
continue to be attracted to you, more so I think than you are to me. It wasn't 
delivered as a come-on. He let that statement sit tight, though he wanted to 
tell her otherwise, to prove her wrong. As they got nearer to her hotel, he 
drove slower and then felt a desperate urge to zoom right past it, to keep on 
driving, to keep on talking, to go just about anywhere, even if it were only in 
an elaborate set of circles, so that they could push the conversation until it 
wore itself out or worked its way to a more natural end. But he didn't do that; 
he let her off at the hotel, the conversation dropped off along with her. Some 
goodbys can't help but be abrupt, no matter how long they take. He wanted to 
say, before she left the car, that the conversation had made him happy -- 
happier than he'd been in quite a while -- but he didn't, and he didn't know 
why he didn't.

 Every year of Caldonia's 36 years, they'd all gathered at Mother's for 
Thanksgiving. That was before Dad died and the house on East 23rd was sold to a 
Chinese man, Lee Wong. Think of it! Ten of those Wongs crammed into the old 
stucco house that used to feel crowded with just five: Mother, Daddy, Caldonia, 
Vesta and Clayton. It made Caldonia shake her head in disbelief. Caldonia's 
latest obstetrician was Chinese, or was it Japanese? She never could keep it 
straight. A Chinese girl at work recently corrected Caldonia and said, "I'm 
Filipina." Then she reached out and laid her narrow hand on Caldonia's rounded 
stomach, so unexpectedly that Caldonia felt as if she'd been intruded on. The 
girl, seeing Caldonia's surprise, smiled and said, "For luck. For me. I want a 
baby, too." Caldonia felt the warmth of the girl's hand long after it had been 
withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last month of Caldonia's pregnancy, her Chinese or Japanese or 
whatever-she-was obstetrician had been seeing Caldonia once a week. The doctor 
was a small, friendly woman with bright eyes who dressed in elegant suits, as 
if she were running off to business meetings instead of squatting on a chair to 
peer up between her patients' legs. She spoke proper English without any 
accent. "Everything looks good," she told Caldonia. "Everything looks just as 
it should." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Caldonia's third child, her conception so unexpected that at first 
Caldonia had not told Fred. She waited over a week. Not that she would have 
ever considered not having the child, but Caldonia needed time alone to absorb 
the fact that, even with Iris and Nadia both in school, she was going to be the 
mother of a baby again, faced with diapers and sleepless nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as she busied herself in the kitchen, Caldonia longed for the past 
Thanksgivings at the East 23rd Street house, when Mother had festooned the 
doorways with crepe paper, and Daddy, in his matching slacks and sweater, 
carried out the holiday routine of washing and polishing every inch of his two 
black Cadillacs. Standing in that immaculate driveway, chamois in hand, he 
always greeted and chided them as they arrived, his children, then his 
grandchildren, encouraging everyone to pause and admire the shine of fenders 
and hoods, and listen to him brag for the hundredth time, "Look at that, a 
hundred thousand miles and not a scratch, not a bump. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanksgivings with Mother and Daddy had always been so perfect. There was 
plenty of room and more than enough food for anyone who happened along; 
neighbors, friends, extra relatives, dropping in for some of Mother's famous 
sweet potato pie: "Oh, and while you're at it, honey, try a little taste of 
turkey and a bit of oyster dressing, and just go ahead and get you some of my 
bread pudding, too."  
</P>
<P>
 But the last year had brought about many changes. Daddy was dead and Mother 
had squeezed herself and her possessions into the cement-block Harriet Tubman 
senior high-rises in West Oakland. Her cramped fourth-floor apartment, with its 
tiny kitchenette overlooking the freeway, no longer accommodated the swell of 
family. She now boiled tea water on a two-burner stove and heated up frozen 
dinners in a microwave. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mother herself, gone stoop-shouldered and brackish and irritable, 
complained that the grandchildren made her nervous when they came to visit: She 
reproached them for being too loud in the elevators, always threatening to pull 
on the emergency buzzer, and she worried they'd tear up her furniture, so she'd 
covered everything in plastic and laid runners along the beige pile carpet. She 
spoke more sharply to Caldonia, Vesta and Clayton, her three grown children, as 
if they were still children themselves, wearing on her last good nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 What Mother announced to Caldonia about Thanksgiving this year was, "I've 
retired from cooking, and now it's somebody else's turn." What she meant was, 
"It's up to you, Caldonia; Clayton and Vesta are useless." 
</P>
<P>
 So Caldonia and Fred won by default, even though Caldonia was just a month 
past giving birth and still feeling sore and irritable. This child had come 
Cesarean, a fact that dulled Caldonia's sense of accomplishment. It seemed the 
baby had not really come out of her body. Now here she was, barely recuperated, 
roasting the turkey and browning homemade bread crumbs, all because she knew 
better than to count on Vesta and Clayton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Y'all gonna have to pitch in; I'm not the Lone Ranger, you know," she told 
Vesta and Clayton by phone, with special emphasis in her voice just to make a 
point. She wondered if God was growing weary with her impatience.  
</P>
<P>
 After all, He'd seen to it that Caldonia and Fred were blessed with so much. 
That's how friends and family saw it, too. She and Fred seemed to make good 
choices, beginning with each other. Yes, fortune had often smiled on them. Fred 
was always getting promotions and raises on the police force. Caldonia had just 
made supervisor at the phone company. They paid their bills on time, they 
attended church, and they'd saved enough money to put Nadia and Iris in a 
private Christian school. 
</P>
<P>
 Their good fortune wasn't lost on Vesta. "Y'all got all my luck," she was fond 
of saying. But luck always has a limit. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with the Cesarean birth of this third child. Caldonia suspected 
Fred was a little disappointed this hadn't been a boy, though he'd never say 
such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In her hospital bed, breathing hard and pushing, Caldonia recalled the 
Filipina woman's hand touching her. At the time, Caldonia had felt too startled 
to be annoyed, and then she realized the woman meant no harm. But it felt like 
a curse. And her labor was long and hard. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pains got the worst, the doctor ordered the baby cut out. It was a 
disappointment, but after a short sleep and the drowsy aftermath, Caldonia 
found herself coming to in the bright light of her own excitement. She made out 
the shape and length of a perfect form, eyes, ears, fingers and toes all there 
and accounted for. She cried out in happiness, a miracle even the third time, 
grasping the wet thing in her arms. But later, as her mind cleared and they 
cleaned up the baby and returned her, Caldonia got a good look. She began to 
suspect a blunder. During her sleep, something must have happened. The child, 
made up of parts of her and Fred, did not seem to belong to either of them, and 
Caldonia wasn't sure where to lay the blame, if such a thing could be blamed at 
all: on God (whom she fiercely loved) or Nature (which she tried to respect) or 
the very chromosomes in the cells of her own body, which had bleached the child 
the color of milk, tinted her eyes pink, stained the thin spread of hair an 
off-shade of lemon. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fred hadn't actually seen the child emerge from her body, she would have 
been certain there was a hospital mix-up, and some white couple was going home 
with her child. Later, she recalled an article she saw years ago in the 
National Enquirer: "White Couple Gives Birth to Black Baby." The article went 
on to say that the woman, unbeknownst to her, carried black genes. The husband 
didn't believe the woman, accused her of infidelity and divorced her 
immediately. Caldonia thought about an article in the reverse: "Black Woman 
Gives Birth to White Baby." It wouldn't work because a black woman's baby, no 
matter how light, would always be black.  
</P>
<P>
 Fred had to remind Caldonia that this was a gift from God, and that whatever 
God had in His plan they must accept with humility. Caldonia cried bitterly 
anyway. "It's our child," he kept telling her. "What is wrong with you?" But 
Caldonia prayed secretly and fervently that the child would darken. 
</P>
<P>
 From upstairs, there came a soft cry. Caldonia set down the wooden spoon she'd 
been stirring the cranberry sauce with and turned down the flame under the pot. 
She was quicker to attend to the needs of this child than she'd been with Iris 
and Nadia. By the time she'd gotten upstairs and was peering into the crib, the 
baby was sleeping soundly again in her nest of quilts. Caldonia had taken to 
dressing her in blue; pink was so unflattering, causing her features to all but 
disappear in that little white face. Often, while the baby slept, Caldonia sat 
close by and watched. She wanted to understand exactly who this child was. She 
couldn't help comparing the luscious dark silk of her two older daughters' baby 
skin, how warm they were to the touch. This child seemed cold and foreign, a 
baby from some northern clime -- Scandinavia, perhaps, a place inhabited by 
people with white skin and canary-yellow hair, with eyes like frost. And yet, 
Nature had played a trick, for the baby's small lips were full, her cheekbones 
high and her nose broad like Fred's. And her hair was a thick cap of tight 
nappy curls. Daily, Caldonia checked the little crescents just under the 
child's tiny cuticles, but she found no indication that the skin there intended 
to darken. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia lingered by the sleeping baby, reassured by her soft breathing. From 
a certain angle, with the blinds drawn, the child might almost be considered 
pretty. There was a loud knock, followed by several more, at the front door. 
Caldonia pulled herself away and hurried down the stairs, fastening her apron 
strings as she went. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Baby Sister Vesta, the first to arrive. It was only noon, but since 
Vesta's 10th or so separation from Harold Sr., she was always showing up places 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to take all the skin off your knuckles pounding on my door like 
that," Caldonia scolded. Vesta was holding a large green salad in a wooden 
bowl, covered with Saran Wrap. Behind her, Rosie and Li'l Harold were still 
piling out of Vesta's dented and rusted red Toyota, with the bad starter and 
moody brakes and the cockeyed windshield wipers. As usual, they were already 
fussing with each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia stepped back and let Vesta past, bearing the salad bowl, which 
reminded Caldonia of a miniature terrarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now why'd you go on and dress the salad like that?" Caldonia was annoyed. 
"Dinner's not until 2." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta was unfazed. She was already peeping into the living room to inspect the 
new sectional furniture Caldonia and Fred had ordered from a catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ooooooh, this musta costed y'all a fortune!" she exclaimed. "Mmmmm, and 
light-colored, too. I'd never dare have anything light-colored with Rosie and 
Li'l Harold around." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta had never been considered pretty (certainly not the way Caldonia was -- 
high school homecoming queen and so on) what with her lumpy potato shape, funny 
lopsided smile and eyes set too close together, like a moth's. She was the 
lightest of Mother's children, honey butterscotch, but her complexion was 
uneven in places, scarred dark by childhood acne. And Vesta had never learned 
to dress. Today she was wearing yellow and black striped tights, two sizes too 
small, and an oversized yellow turtleneck with black pockets. Caldonia thought 
her sister looked like a misshapen bumblebee. And those red shoes, like Minnie 
Mouse! Caldonia had never seen anything so ugly and cheap looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie and Li'l Harold burst through the door and flung themselves on her. 
These wild children were the opposite of Iris and Nadia: careful, precise girls 
who rarely made messes and whom Vesta referred to disparagingly one infamous 
Christmas as "those little prisses." It took two whole weeks for Caldonia to 
get over that slight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the baby?" cried Rosie, and Harold echoed, "Where's the baby?" They'd 
come clutching armloads of complicated toys with multiple loose parts that 
would soon be scattered. They continued to press themselves against Caldonia 
with wet kisses and sticky hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, where is the baby?" Vesta wanted to know, bending over to see if the 
plastic flowers in the vase were real. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's 'sleep, upstairs," said Caldonia gently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Y'all named her yet? Mother's fit to be tied about that poor child." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia made her voice firm. " No , we haven't decided on a name yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta clucked her tongue like an old woman. "Scandalous," she said cheerfully. 
"You can't have a no-name child." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Caldonia could snap back, Vesta went on, eyeing Caldonia's new beige 
curtains at the window. "I can't wait to have me my own place. I'll tell you, 
girl, Clayton is driving me nuts. He's so damn picky. Picky this, picky that. 
He blew up at the kids the other morning, I mean really lost it, because he 
said they'd eaten all his cold cereal. Can you believe that? Yelling at my 
kids. Over cold cereal!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother's doing you a favor," Caldonia reminded her. "What you need to do is 
get things straight with Harold." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta blew air from her mouth. "That man works my final nerve!" She turned so 
quickly on her red shoes that her heel left a scuff mark across Caldonia's 
polished hardwood floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold is your husband," said Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie and Li'l Harold started on a mess in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia jumped in. "You kids set your toys over there, and then you can go 
swing out back. Take turns. No fussing. I don't want to have to come out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 When she turned around, Vesta was poking her face into the oven for a peek at 
the turkey. "This thing's big as a elephant!" she exclaimed, swallowed up in 
steam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girl, get outta my oven. You're gonna make it cook uneven." 
</P>
<P>
 "I could baste it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's self-basting," sighed Caldonia. "Close the door." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is everybody?" Vesta asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred's in the family room watching the game, but don't bother him, and the 
girls are down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta was wearing that awful wig again, the straight-hair page boy, three 
shades too light for her complexion. It reminded Caldonia of one of the old 
Supremes. So what if Vesta's real hair was thinning, it was all that worry over 
Harold. If she'd just ditch him once and for all, her hair would thicken, her 
skin would clear, and her whole life would improve. She'd lose some weight, 
could afford decent clothes, and she'd get another man, if that's what she 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia didn't believe in divorce, but in this case she thought it was high 
time Vesta and Harold Sr. split up for good. How those two had managed to last 
all these years was a mystery. Everybody'd warned her from the start, that very 
first day Vesta dragged Harold home from high school. They'd succeeded in 
putting a stop to their eternal fussing long enough to concoct their two unruly 
children, but otherwise it was always hurricane weather at Vesta's. 
</P>
<P>
 Daddy'd had a fit. He had forbidden Vesta to marry Harold, told her the boy 
was all flash and foolishness, barely one step up from a hoodlum. But she was 
so hardheaded and downright silly, she just thumbed her nose at Daddy and 
forged ahead with a huge wedding, marrying Harold in an expensive ceremony at 
the Methodist church Mother attended. Daddy ended up bankrolling the whole 
naughty business, including the expensive lace dress with train, though 
everyone knew Vesta had about as much business wearing white as the devil 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was that Vesta had spent these last 14 years paying the piper. Over and 
over, she'd packed up the children and left Big Harold lock, stock and barrel. 
This time it was Clayton who relented and let her move in with him in his 
two-bedroom apartment down on Lake Merritt. It was supposed to be temporary, 
just until Vesta made other arrangements, but now six months had passed, and 
Clayton had confided to Caldonia that his patience was wearing thin. 
</P>
<P>
 Foolish Clayton. It wasn't as if Caldonia hadn't cautioned him. He was always 
getting suckered into things like this, and now he was whining all the time to 
Caldonia. Said he was tired of coming home from the community college where he 
taught business classes to find the living room floor littered with Rosie's 
Black Barbie-and-her-accessories and the horse doll with the eyelashes and 
purple hair and all her accessories, and pieces of Li'l Harold's Lego set 
strewn around, and an oblivious Vesta curled up on the sofa with Clayton's 
plaid bathrobe over her legs watching "Jeopardy!" and eating Cheez-Its.  
</P>
<P>
 At first, Caldonia tried to listen patiently, the way the Lord would want her 
to. But she finally had to tell Clayton straight out that he needed to "put the 
girl out." 
</P>
<P>
 She spoke from experience. Just a year ago, she and Fred had hosted Vesta and 
the kids, and now here they were having to spend good money replacing the 
sectional furniture that Rosie and Li'l Harold had crayoned on. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta leaned across the countertop to steal an olive from the cut-glass dish. 
"You know, Clayton's bringing a woman over today," she announced coyly. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia launched into making biscuits. "Over here? He didn't mention it to 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's because he's afraid you won't approve." She let that sink in. "Let's 
see, Jean or Jane, shoot! I never can remember her name." Vesta headed over to 
the fridge for a diet soda. She found a can, popped the tab and brushed a loose 
strand of wig hair from her face. "You ain't heard about her yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia shook her head. "I can't keep up with Clayton's women. It's enough to 
keep up with three children." 
</P>
<P>
 "This one's different ," said Vesta knowingly. "And he's crazy about her, 
too." She paused, watching for Caldonia's reaction. "Now I don't want to say 
something I shouldn't. . . . Mother said don't upset you. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Then don't," said Caldonia, rinsing off her fingers at the sink. From the 
basement family room came a whoop and a shout from Fred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Vesta went on, "I haven't seen him like this with anybody for a while. 
She spends the night four, five times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 "What? With you and the kids there?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta nodded and swiped another olive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's pretty and polite. Mother thinks so, too." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretty and polite!" murmured Caldonia. "You and Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta seemed especially pleased with herself. "There's something you won't 
like about her, but I'll let you find out on your own." And she let out a 
ladylike belch and squished the diet soda can in her right fist. 
</P>
<P>
 To herself, Caldonia murmured, "Lord, Lord, Lord," and then, mercifully, the 
baby cried, and Caldonia excused herself and went upstairs.  
</P>
<P>
 CLAYTON ARRIVED SHORTLY after 1:30, sporting a new haircut and supporting 
Mother's stout, crooked body against his skeletal frame. He reminded Caldonia 
of a marionette, arms and legs dangling off the sides of his body as if held on 
by wires. Nervous energy seemed to eat up any pounds that might have settled 
onto his frail frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Caldonia had asked Mother about Clayton's puniness and his high voice, 
worried that Clayton was being denied entry to manhood, but Mother cut her 
short and asked her what on earth had gotten into her, what could she possibly 
mean bringing up something like that, was she trying to say her baby brother 
was gay ? Mother's eyes had hardened like marbles. No, that wasn't what 
Caldonia had meant at all, she'd only said he was "frail," but by then it was 
too late because Mother'd already interpreted, in the narrowest terms 
available, what Caldonia meant about Mother's favorite child. "He's a good son. 
He finished college. He's done well for himself and he does well by me. Don't 
you talk about your brother that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton kissed Caldonia on the cheek, and now he was kissing Vesta, too. 
"Let's see, it's been an hour since I've seen you ," he teased. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ha ha ha," murmured Vesta, unaware that her wig had slid an inch off her 
forehead and a portion of her mashed-down real hair was exposed. "You're still 
pissed off at the kids about that cold cereal, I know you." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother shot them both a look and said she needed to sit down right away, she 
wasn't feeling right. They found her a comfortable spot on the new sectional 
sofa in front of the living room television, where she announced, "Now, I don't 
want to look at no football." Clayton crouched on the floor and began to search 
the channels. A quick perusal through the main networks produced mostly 
oversized men tumbling around in helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 "How about a parade?" Clayton suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't want to see a parade either. Just find something pleasant for me to 
look at and turn down the sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton settled on a PBS travelogue of pubs in Ireland and got Mother 
adjusted. Caldonia brought out glasses of fruit juice for them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, goodness, you know I can't take ice," said Mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia took the glass back to the sink and spooned out ice. There was just 
the slightest edge to her voice as she said, "Vesta, take this back out to 
Mother, please, and tell her it's good for her. Just a little cranberry juice 
and orange juice and some mineral water." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton hovered in the kitchen doorway, glass in hand. His eyes seemed to 
burst from his eager light-brown face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jill call yet?" he asked in a voice meant to sound matter-of-fact but which 
came out over-eager and tinged with plaintiveness. He had a nervous habit of 
rocking on his heels then rising onto his toes, as if in preparation for 
ascension. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, nobody's called," said Caldonia primly, wiping her hands on a kitchen 
towel. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta let out a shriek. "Ooooh, honey, and I called her Jane. Shoot, you know 
me, I'm just bad with names. Guess I been so nervous I'd call her Evelyn, I 
just don't call her by a name at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton's complexion went gray for a moment. He leaned back hard on his heels, 
suddenly grounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vesta, you are something else, bringing up Evelyn like that!" snapped 
Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn had been Clayton's fiancee the year before. A beauty queen, Miss Black 
Something or Other, standing over six feet tall, with legs like a giraffe's and 
eyes that had seen just a little too much of life for Caldonia's taste. Evelyn 
Gilroy: the color of dark butterscotch with skin as smooth as silk and a set of 
thick eyelashes that swept across her cheeks, blinking like a doll each time 
anyone asked her something. "I believe so," she'd say if something was true. "I 
believe not," she'd say if something was false. And she'd cold-shouldered 
Clayton's family, let them know they weren't really good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clayton hadn't seen it coming, he never did. Evelyn kept him tied up in a 
knot so tight he wouldn't eat, and he lost weight and took to having migraines. 
But like a fool he went ahead and spent all his money on the diamond ring he 
placed on her finger. He saw engagement, a lifetime of long, brown Evelyn, his 
forever; Evelyn saw only an expensive diamond. She had the gold melted down 
after the breakup and put the diamond in a pendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia had kept her mouth shut. "Six things the Lord hates . . . a false 
witness telling a pack of lies and one who stirs up quarrels between brothers." 
She tried not to say anything bad about anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton looked at his watch. "I'd better try calling Jill again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Turkey's about ready," said Caldonia. "And what did you bring for dinner, Mr. 
Clayton?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton's eyes shot over to Vesta. "Didn't Vesta bring my salad?" 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia turned, hand on hip, eyebrows arched. "Well then, what did Miss Vesta 
bring?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, shoot," Vesta moaned, without shame. "I thought the salad was from all of 
us. I mean, we live in one place, me and Clayton and the kids. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are four people living there," Caldonia pointed out, "and that 
means four big appetites." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry. I've got so much on my mind," sighed Vesta. "Harold called this 
morning wanting to know what me and the kids were doing today. He's wanting to 
come back. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to hear it," said Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred was cheering again from the family room. Caldonia cast her eyes 
ceilingward. "Now watch, the baby'll start crying any second." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get her!" said Clayton. "You named her yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 As predicted, the thin, high siren of Caldonia's newest addition scored the 
air. "Oh, shoot," said Caldonia. "I knew this would happen. Vesta, would you 
set the table, please." 
</P>
<P>
 From the living room, Mother's voice rasped out, "The baby's crying. Aren't we 
going to eat sometime today?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then the children surged through the back door, all four of them, Iris 
announcing that she and Nadia were back and that Rosie had yanked the barrettes 
from her braids, Li'l Harold was spitting on ants, and what was Caldonia going 
to do about it?  
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, Caldonia found relief from all of their demands, lifting the pink 
and yellow fussing child from the little crib. Her watery blue eyes were 
squeezed into slits. Sensitivity to light, might lead to blindness. Keep her 
out of direct sunlight, protect her eyes and skin. She sounded like a 
houseplant, to be tended in the dark. Caldonia held her until the cries turned 
to soft whimpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There, there, sweetheart," she murmured. She carried the child down the back 
steps, avoiding the rest of the family, to where Fred sat on the edge of the 
family-room sofa. She handed the child to him. "There's my little girl," he 
said joyfully. His long-limbed dark body dwarfed the pale doll beside him. 
"There's my little sweetheart." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's here," said Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shooooo, my little baby," he cooed into the child's ear and lay her against 
his thick, dark chest. "My little Angela, my little Monica, my Little Bo-peep." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia started out the door, then turned and paused a moment. She was trying 
to make sense out of Fred's long, milk-chocolate arms and the tiny, wriggling 
shrimp-like creature now being caressed, ever so gently, by his capable black 
hands. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder, thought Caldonia, if I'll ever love her enough. It was an ugly, 
secret thought, one that haunted Caldonia with all its awful possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 THREE O'CLOCK, AND Mother snored on the sofa. The turkey sat browned but 
untouched in its pan on top of the stove. The salad continued to wilt in the 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 The table, arrayed with Caldonia's wedding china, held an air of empty 
expectation. The kids were snacking on peanut butter and arguing over Chutes 
and Ladders on the dining room floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think we should go ahead with dinner," Fred finally said, "meaning 
no offense to your lady friend, Clayton, but I don't want to hold things up any 
longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia saw her brother's face fall. "Maybe just a half hour more," she said 
sympathetically. "You're sure she's got our number and the directions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton nodded. He sat hunched on a hassock in the living room, clasping and 
unclasping his hands, looking himself like a scolded child. The phone rang. 
Both Vesta and Clayton practically leaped from their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was only a friend of Fred's from the police force. The baby's tiny 
bright pink face nestled itself against Caldonia's bosom. 
</P>
<P>
 She squeezed the nameless child to her. The funny little face called to mind a 
newborn kitten's. Caldonia knew the family was talking behind her back. Even 
Fred was running out of patience. She kept waiting for the name to announce 
itself, the way Iris' and Nadia's names had. 
</P>
<P>
 By 4 o'clock, everyone was so bad-humored that Clayton finally gave in and 
agreed they should eat, but his voice was tight and hollow when he spoke. 
"Something must have happened to her," he said. "I really wanted us all to eat 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred rounded up the kids. The girls danced their way to the table; the adults 
settled themselves somewhat grimly. There was a scraping of chairs and the 
usual compliments about how good everything looked.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why we had to wait so long," complained Mother. She surveyed the 
table with a critical eye. She focused in on Vesta, who was now holding the 
baby. "Oh, there's my sweet little grandbaby." She looked the child up and 
down. "When are they going to find you a name, hmmmmm? You've got to have a 
name. Such a shame, poor little thing!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my cousin's so pretty," said Rosie. "Pretty cousin!" 
</P>
<P>
 "My sister's going to be blond!" Iris explained. "There's a girl at my school 
with really blond hair." She added exploratorily, "The girl is white." 
</P>
<P>
 "Child needs a name," murmured Mother into her plate. "It's been a month now." 
She looked up hard at Fred. "I thought you were going to call her after your 
grandmother."  
</P>
<P>
 "Iris, eat your food, Iris," said Fred warningly to his daughter. Mother 
maintained her sharp stare. 
</P>
<P>
 The doorbell rang. Almost quarter to 5. Clayton leaped up and disappeared into 
the hallway. Fred caught Caldonia's eye and winked as if to say everything was 
all right, she should ignore Mother, ignore them all. Caldonia could hear a 
woman's voice, hushed, then Clayton's, apologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment later, Clayton re-entered the dining room with false cheer. "Hey, hey 
hey!" he announced. "Everyone, can I have your attention. I'd like you all to 
meet someone. This is Jill." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Caldonia couldn't see much more than a pair of brown boots and a 
long black coat, but when the woman stepped from the shadows, Caldonia was 
startled by her fine, straight hair the color of corn silk and skin the color 
of beaten egg white.  
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia immediately looked at Mother for an explanation. But Mother was 
placidly spooning more oyster dressing into her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know Vesta and my mother," said Clayton, "and this is my sister Caldonia 
and her husband, Fred." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Jill," called Vesta cheerfully, then turned to Caldonia with a sly smile. 
She was enjoying this moment thoroughly. "Isn't she pretty? I told you she was 
so pretty," she observed for Jill's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia sat stunned. She felt betrayed, by Clayton, by Vesta, but most of all 
by Mother, who went right on eating. Vesta's ignorance could almost be excused; 
the girl was color struck, thought all white women were pretty, had been that 
way since she was a child. When she watched old black-and-white movies, she was 
always sighing over old pale-white, dead actresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred got up from the table and took Jill's coat. Clayton pulled out the empty 
chair at the end of the table for her, and Jill set about squeezing herself in 
between Nadia and Iris.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Caldonia hadn't said a word. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let her see the baby!" cried Vesta. "Show Jill the baby!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Let her get settled first," Caldonia murmured. "She doesn't need to be 
bothered with the baby." She felt suddenly proprietary toward her child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vesta was on a roll. "Ask Jill what she thinks about the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger rose in Caldonia. "I don't need to ask Jill anything," was what came out 
of her mouth, and Mother's head shot up like a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta didn't seem to care. "Now that I think about it," she grinned, "that 
could be Jill's baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton was trying to change the subject, but Jill interrupted. Her voice, 
when she spoke, had that sharp bell-like sound like so many white women's. 
"Clayton told me you just had a baby. Congratulations." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," said Caldonia, surprised by her own relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Vesta wouldn't let up. "Jill, look at this pretty child my sister has. She's 
got your coloring." 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton went to work fixing Jill a plate. "Turkey? Cranberry sauce? Gravy?" He 
went down the list with an eagerness that filled Caldonia with loathing. Jill 
murmured, "Clayton, not so much, you know I've already eaten.' 
</P>
<P>
 Already eaten ! Caldonia thought; well, knock me over with a feather. Already 
eaten ! This, while everyone had waited so patiently, the kids getting fussier 
and hungrier. As if in sympathy, the baby let out a long wail on Caldonia's 
lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama!" cried Iris and Nadia simultaneously. "The baby's crying." It felt like 
an accusation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring the poor little thing over to me," said Mother. "Let me hold her." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia snapped back, "Not now, she needs to be fed." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby began to howl full force. It was as if all the tension in the room 
had settled over her and drawn her little face into tight, red fury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill asked Clayton to please sit down and not worry over her. Caldonia had a 
sudden image of Jill emerging from her brother's bedroom and traipsing into the 
bathroom, dressed only in her panties and bra, in front of the children. 
Caldonia alternated between fury with Clayton and fury with the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred turned to Caldonia. "Honey, want me to take the baby downstairs with me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll keep her," said Caldonia. She got up from the table.  
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't she just the prettiest little thing?" Vesta prodded Jill. "I think 
she's so cute ." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's sweet," Jill agreed, but she was staring hopelessly at the mounds of 
turkey and dressing Clayton had heaped on her plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told you the baby was cute, didn't I?" said Clayton, as if to leave no 
doubt about what he might have said about the child. Then, for Jill's benefit, 
he launched into his version of how he'd been the one to get Caldonia to the 
hospital just in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be tellin' her that," said Mother, biting into a turkey wing. "Your 
sister was in labor for almost 18 hours before that Chinese lady did something 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo-ther," warned Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill tentatively reached out one pale hand and touched the baby's blanched 
skin. "I don't get to see newborns very often," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let her hold the baby," insisted Vesta. Her eyes had gone round and bright. 
The baby stopped crying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jill's eating," said Caldonia, pulling the baby back against her body. "The 
baby's too fussy." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's OK," said Jill. She was working so hard at being polite. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Clayton was urging. "Come on, Caldonia, let Jill hold the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia could see she had no choice without offending everyone. She leaned 
down and handed the baby to Jill. Jill gathered the child against her and 
rocked gently from side to side, "Mmmmm, she's so little." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia arranged the loose-knit blanket around the baby's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at Jill holding the baby," commented Mother, her turkey leg held up in 
one hand. "Isn't that something." 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby could be hers," said Vesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia caught Fred's eye and saw a warning there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sure look a lot alike," Mother went on, hope in her voice. She leaned 
across the table and studied first the baby's face, then Jill's. "They got that 
same pretty complexion, don't you think so, Clayton? What do you think, Jill? 
Is that a pretty baby to you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Jill was trying to be polite for them all. "What's her name?" she asked. A 
moment of silence followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "She doesn't have one," Mother said bitterly. "It's been a month now, and 
Caldonia can't decide what to call it." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia felt heat rise to her face. She snapped back, "The baby's albino," as 
if that answered anything. She meant the word to sound bold, even cruel, 
despite the fact that the Lord would be shaking His head at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton jumped in. "What Sis means is that she's not sure if the baby's eyes 
will have sensitivity to light. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I mean at all," Caldonia said matter-of-factly. "I mean what 
I said; I'm upset my baby is white." It was the first time she'd actually said 
it. Not to Fred, not even to herself. But now it seemed like the most natural 
thing to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The room grew very still. Fred cleared his throat. Mother murmured, "Hmmmmm 
mmmmmm!" disapprovingly under her breath. The children eyeballed one another 
with keen interest. But Jill didn't seem to mind. She looked straight back in 
Caldonia's face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't the albino trait inherited?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia nodded. "It's from Fred's side." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think she's pretty," defended Vesta. "Maybe she'll grow up and look 
like Jill." 
</P>
<P>
 "Being albino," said Caldonia, "is different from being. . . ." She paused. 
She saw no point in offending Jill. "A blond nappy head just isn't pretty," 
Caldonia heard herself saying. "That's called funny-looking." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone laughed, except Mother, who pursed her lips and said softly, "Y'all 
some wrong folks!" 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia bent down and retrieved the baby from Jill. "I'm afraid she'll spit 
up all over you," she said with false concern. "She looks like she might." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe everybody'll think the baby's mulatto," said Vesta, her mouth full of 
stuffing. "That's what they call a white and black mix. You know, like you and 
Clayton." She used her fork to gesture toward Jill, as if joining her with 
Clayton in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clayton and Jill are not mulatto," Caldonia said stonily. She felt her anger 
giving her direction. "Clayton is black, and Jill is white. Mulatto would be 
what they'd have if they had a child, Vesta. It's not the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hold on there, don't rush us now," said Clayton, but he said it only for 
Jill's sake. His smile had broadened, his eyes brightened. Caldonia could see 
he rather liked the idea of having a child with Jill. And she could see by 
Jill's tense but civil expression that this would never happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean nothin'," said Vesta cheerfully. She grinned at Jill. "You know 
me, I'm just over here runnin' my mouth like I usually do. My best friend in 
grade school was white. 'Member her, Caldonia? Patty what's-her-face, that big 
old fat girl, pretty face though." 
</P>
<P>
 The baby began to fuss in Caldonia's arms. Her bad humor quickly escalated to 
rage, and her face turned the color of Pepto-Bismol. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia excused herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feed the baby here," Clayton called after her. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth was, Caldonia didn't want to nurse her youngest child near a 
stranger. She pulled shut the louvered doors that separated the kitchen and 
dining room. She sat down in one of the vinyl-backed kitchen chairs and 
arranged the baby's pink mouth at her brown breast. 
</P>
<P>
 The louvered doors opened ever so slightly and Fred squeezed through. If he 
was annoyed with Caldonia he didn't show it. Instead, he bent down and kissed 
the nursing baby. "You know I love you," he whispered in her tiny shell-pink 
ear, "even if your mama's actin' crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia had to smile in spite of herself. She hummed softly to the pink and 
yellow child. When Fred went out again, Caldonia caught a glimpse of Clayton's 
slender brown fingers caressing Jill's pale arm, and the stiffening of that arm 
as Jill carefully and surreptitiously moved just out of reach. It was a simple 
gesture, designed not to embarrass Clayton in front of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia looked down at her youngest daughter. She didn't know which was 
worse, going through life toward blindness or going through life white. In a 
way, it was kind of the same thing. How was her daughter going to feel, this 
little pale stalk in a dark field? 
</P>
<P>
 Iris and Nadia let themselves into the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close the door!" Caldonia hissed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mama, we love our sister," said Iris pointedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, of course you do!" Caldonia hadn't meant to give the girls a wrong 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could put her in the sun," suggested Nadia helpfully. "She could get a tan 
and be like us." 
</P>
<P>
 The two girls ran their hands over the baby's little pink ones and cooed at 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is like us," Caldonia corrected. "She is us." 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia's head shot up. The voice was clear and precise. It was Jill, first 
poking her head through the kitchen door and then standing in the kitchen 
doorway, small and white, not much taller than Nadia and Iris. Caldonia quickly 
covered her breast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank you for having me," Jill said softly. "And I'm sorry about 
all the inconvenience and the mix-up." 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, before she was able to line up her thoughts, Caldonia actually 
thought the girl was apologizing for the absence of the baby's color. "The 
mix-up?" said Caldonia vaguely. She reached for the right words. "Clayton's 
friends are always welcome," she said. "Come back any time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I will." The girl smiled, and Caldonia knew they both were thinking how this 
would not happen. "Thank you," said the girl, relieved and forgiven, as if 
Caldonia had the power to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 THAT NIGHT, WHEN THE DISHES had been washed, the kitchen swept and the 
children put to bed, Caldonia asked Fred tentatively, "Do you think it would be 
foolish to name the baby Ebony?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fred burst out laughing. "Girl, what are you talking about?"  
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give my child a real name," said Caldonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's real all right," he chuckled. "What is wrong with you, Caldonia? You 
can't make her black, you know. Naming her Ebony is as bad as naming a dark 
child Pearl, or Magnolia. We should call her Angela, after my grandmother." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want her to know. . . ." Caldonia began stupidly, "I just want her to 
feel. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred looked at her long and hard. "She is , Caldonia," was all he said before 
he went upstairs and turned on the news. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldonia stood next to the sink under the framed "God Bless This Mess" sampler 
Mother had made for her last Christmas. God, thought Caldonia wistfully, in His 
infinite wisdom, has given me this child without a name. She wasn't blaming 
God; she wasn't blaming anyone but herself for the mean pinch in her heart that 
prevented her from running right upstairs and calling the child by her rightful 
name.

NEW CALIFORNIA FICTION; BAD LUCK WITH CATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRIS MAZZA, Cris Mazza, whose first book was Animal Acts, says she is known 
for writing about animals. I am interested in how people relate to animals and 
pets and how this reflects on how they relate to each other. She has five dogs 
and two homes: In the summer, she lives in north San Diego County, and during 
the academic year, she is a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, 
where she teaches fiction writing. Her fifth book, Exposed, was published by 
Coffee House Press in May.

<TEXT>
<P>
 She was half dressed, wearing black underwear and one of Jerry's undershirts, 
when someone she didn't even know knocked on the door. "Do you have a 
black-and-white cat?" the someone asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry, stay here," she called over her shoulder as she ran on her toes down 
the front walk. 
</P>
<P>
 He was already in the doorway. "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Get back inside!" She scooped up the mess in the street with one hand. One 
eye was dangling out of its socket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brenda, what're you doing?" he shouted from the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go away. Get back!" Trying to hide the cat's body, she rolled it up in the 
bottom part of her undershirt. Jerry was coming toward her, but she made a wide 
circle around him, running over some finely crushed glass in the street, then 
down the alley to the first trashcan she could find. There was blood on the 
front of her shirt. A few nights back she'd had a dream about going to a 
symphony concert without a shirt on. She thought, So this is what that was all 
about. She dropped the undershirt in the trash on top of the cat then held an 
empty box over her chest as she jumped the back fence and went in through the 
back door. "Jerry, you here?" He didn't answer. She left the box by the door 
and went into the bedroom, scooting quickly past the still-open front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry was on the bed, lying diagonally like he had the last time, his face 
turned away from her. "Honey? Jerry?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Ozzie, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't even care." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't say that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't start it again." She took out another one of his undershirts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like clockwork," he said. "Every six months." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost a year ago." 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, though, he was right -- it was only six months since he'd stopped 
mourning for Mikey, the dumb one, found stone dead in the gutter, not a mark on 
the body. Just too damn dumb to get out of the street. She hadn't been home. 
Jerry had carried Mikey up to the porch, then went to the neighbor and asked 
what he should do next. He saved his crying until she got home, and he 
confessed that Mikey had been pestering him while he was practicing the 
xylophone, so he'd put the cat out, probably just 20 minutes before it 
happened. But he'd stopped crying and closed himself in his music room for 
several hours when he found out she'd thrown Mikey away instead of burying him. 
At least when they lost Big Sam there was no evidence; he'd just stopped coming 
home, disappeared one night. 
</P>
<P>
 She thought, It's getting messier every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry rolled over. He was wearing a T-shirt with a picture of Bobby Fischer on 
the front. Brenda got the penny jar from the dresser and poured a pile onto the 
mattress, then kneeled on the floor and started counting out sets of 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd better go through with it," Jerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You know." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this is a good time to talk about it. Especially not now." She 
found a slug among the coins and swore under her breath. Every time a cat died, 
he asked for a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are Bessie and Spunky?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around." 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you think they miss Ozzie? Think they saw it happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, Jerry." She shook her head and began stacking the pennies in 
wrappers from the bank.  
</P>
<P>
 "You're right, what a stupid thing to say. Typical, though, right? I thought I 
would someday grow up and get over this kind of stuff. But no ." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're too old to grow up anymore." She smiled at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah. How'm I gonna be able to suddenly become a pizza delivery boy or a 
popcorn vendor at the stadium?" 
</P>
<P>
 " How to do it is simple -- you just do it." She had three dollars in pennies 
wrapped, so she put the remaining pennies back into the jar. "Besides, the 
symphony isn't folding; it's just a strike." 
</P>
<P>
 " I'm not striking," he said. "Anyway, we've got to figure out what to do with 
Bessie and Spunky." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crummy place for cats." 
</P>
<P>
 "So what do you suggest?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We could move," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You kidding? Eventually, yes. But now? Just for the cats? You're out of your 
mind!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Then let me move." 
</P>
<P>
 " Let you? Who's stopping you? I just think it's a dumb idea." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know. Aren't all my ideas dumb?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," she said. "Want to walk up to the store with me? I've got to get some 
milk and eggs." 
</P>
<P>
 "No. I'm going to get Spunky and Bessie and keep them inside until I think of 
what to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Brenda came back, he told her he'd arranged to give the two remaining 
cats to a friend's father who had a small farm off the old highway that snaked 
through the Indian reservation. They would deliver the cats to the friend at 
the union hall after the meeting that night, and the friend would take them to 
his father. So Jerry was keeping the cats inside until it was time to go. The 
cats sat at the front door, looking over their shoulders and crying, standing 
up on their hind legs and sniffing at the keyhole, digging their claws into the 
carpet by the doorway until Brenda shouted at them. She and Jerry were sitting 
at the kitchen table deciding what he could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't last forever," she said. "You could find something temporary." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's already been forever. I can't figure out what this union wants, for us 
to play for every rinky-dink roadshow or circus that comes through and needs 
backup music? That's just as bad as forever." 
</P>
<P>
 She had two blank pieces of paper to write down all the ideas they came up 
with. One list was for things he could do, the other was for her. Her list was 
already started: piano lessons . The paper was stationery from one of the 
schools where she substituted, but the teachers didn't seem to get sick very 
often. "OK, let's get serious," she said. "How about . . . we could go to the 
park and perform duets with a donation hat." 
</P>
<P>
 "A voice and percussion duet? Great." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just kidding. But remember how I sang at the park with my brother shaking a 
tambourine? We made a bundle." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Jerry said. "Ten dollars in half a day." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not accomplishing anything," she said. It started to rain. The cats had 
finally gone to sleep on the sofa, but raised their heads when the rain began 
to hit the metal rain gutter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," she said. "What do you say to giving up on this and going into the 
bedroom?" 
</P>
<P>
 " Now ? Ozzie just got killed this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "And tomorrow he'll have just been killed yesterday, and the next day he'll 
have been killed the day before yesterday. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that supposed to mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda shrugged. "Forget it." The downpour suddenly intensified, as though 
someone outside had turned a hose onto the front window. "Wow, look at that. Do 
we have to go to that meeting?" 
</P>
<P>
 " I have to," he said. "Greg's meeting me to pick up the cats." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cats stretched, hopped off the sofa and came toward the table, 
purring, then jumped into Jerry's lap. "I have something to admit," Jerry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda wrote secretary on her list, then folded her hands on the tabletop, 
smiling slightly at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you looking at me like that?" 
</P>

 "Just waiting for what terrible thing you're going to 'fess up to," she said. 
"I can hardly wait. As a matter of fact, though, sometimes I wish you'd hit me 
or gamble away all our money -- what's left of it -- or get into some really 
vicious drugs and start hocking stuff, or maybe start fooling around, or . . . 
I don't know, something really bad ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because, Jerry, what could we possibly say to a lawyer? That we're 
incompatible because there are no duets written for voice and percussion? Or 
that life is intolerable because you need help starting the lawn mower or using 
a Phillips screwdriver? Or that I can't respect you as a man because you watch 
the same movies over and over and still get all misty-eyed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Is all that true?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not what I'm saying. That's not the point. It's just that we don't 
have anything bad enough to say." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's bad enough." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget it, Jerry. Go on and finish admitting, then we'll have to get going," 
she said. "Maybe I'll admit something too." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry looked down at the cat. He was holding his hand very rigidly in a fist 
and letting the cat rub its head against his knuckles. "It was my fault . . . 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no one's fault. It happens." 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't have to happen. Last night, when I put Bessie and Spunky in the 
shed, I couldn't catch Ozzie. He kept playing with me, hiding under the car, 
racing around me. So I said, OK, if you want to stay out all night, be my 
guest." 
</P>
<P>
 "So you think you're a jinx and no cat is safe around you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you have to say stuff like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you tell me stuff like that? What am I supposed to say?" 
</P>
<P>
 He looked up briefly, then continued watching the cat butt its head against 
his knuckles. "Maybe you could say nothing. You could sit there and listen. You 
don't have to answer if you're not going to say anything helpful or the least 
bit . . . sympathetic." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be fine, if you ever talked about anything that even mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 "What if the things I choose to talk about matter to me?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what, Jerry?" she grinned. "You should've been a soap opera star. I 
swear, 80 percent of the women in America would be in love with you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great. The one I'm married to doesn't even watch TV." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, how about this?" She chuckled while writing movie star on his piece of 
paper, then passed the paper across the table to him. "So . . . you feel guilty 
about Ozzie. OK, I'll sit here and listen. Really, I'm listening." She bent to 
write housekeeper and gardener on her list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Really. Why do you feel guilty?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well . . . they depend on me. I let them down. I guess I let you down too." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you didn't." She got up and went into the bedroom to get their raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I did," he said. "Look at the mess we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you didn't." She smiled and handed him the car keys. "I never depended on 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good thing. Who would? I don't do anything useful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerry, look, you're like the cats, you just do the thing that makes you what 
you are. Just like they had to do the things that being a cat is all about, so 
they got squashed." She went back to her list and wrote truck driver , child 
care and sex . 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Jerry said. "You can't convince me that being a cat automatically 
includes getting hit by cars." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK." She crossed out sex . 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go ." He grabbed her list, crumpled it and tossed it into the kitchen 
sink. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MEETING WAS SUPPOSED to be private, for union members only, but Brenda 
stood in the doorway and listened to someone recite a list of laughable items 
on the latest offer. Almost everyone in the room did at least chuckle after 
each item, so sometimes she missed the first few words of the next one. But 
Jerry wasn't laughing. He was sitting in the back row on the far side of the 
room from where Brenda was huddled in the doorway. It was still raining, and 
the roof had a very small awning. When the wind came up, the rain slanted and 
wet not only the porch area but the floor inside the room too, so it wasn't as 
though she was dry, just drier than she would be if she was standing in the 
parking lot. Jerry had asked her why the hell she wanted to come. He was 
sitting there with one elbow on one knee, his cheek in his hand. It was the 
same way he'd sat in his classes at college. He was really almost exactly the 
same as he'd been when she was first attracted by his graceful walk, his easy 
laugh. He'd even been a campus hero for a week after his desperate efforts in a 
psychological test and interview to get out of the draft. He'd actually 
received the unfit designation he'd wanted, and the poor duped analyst had 
diagnosed him as neurotically immature and suggested treatment. It got him out 
of the draft but he couldn't avoid ROTC. Twenty years ago in Oklahoma, every 
boy had to take ROTC, so Jerry had protested by getting Ds. He had to be 
careful to make sure they were Ds and not Fs. He wouldn't want to have to 
repeat ROTC. She suddenly remembered he'd learned how to take a gun apart and 
put it back together. 
</P>
<P>
 A gust of wind spattered rain across her back. She'd missed the last several 
items while thinking about ancient history. They'd moved on to working 
conditions, and the latest offer concerning the backstage area was to remove 
the word "suitable" from the old contract's wording: "Each musician shall have 
a suitable locker." The rain intensified, hitting the pavement in the parking 
lot with a sound like water on a hot griddle, so someone got up and closed the 
door and Brenda had to run back to the car for shelter. They were parked next 
to the guy who was taking the cats to his father's dirt farm. The cats were in 
a big cardboard box on the guy's back seat. The box was no longer rocking, so 
the cats had probably settled down. She sat tapping her foot, twisting her 
hair, pushing her cuticles back, staring at the rivulets running down the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE TRIED TO GET HIM UP AT 9 and again at 10, but he didn't stagger into the 
bathroom until 11:30. "You're still here," he said after his shower. "Didn't 
you get any calls?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's sick today. You missed the rally, you know. You slept right 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 "You thought I should go do that Teamster stuff?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to go with you." 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell for?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to watch you picket," she said. "You look so . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "So much like a guy who's picketing." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, you look so . . . different, somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you just never saw a bunch of idiots walking in circles holding signs." 
</P>
<P>
 It was no longer raining. The sun had been out since the clouds broke at about 
7 that morning, when she'd gotten up to make applesauce out of the box of 
bruised apples she'd bought at a farmer's market for $2. The last of the jars 
were being processed. Every window was steamed up and the house smelled appley. 
Jerry was reading the paper, but he'd discarded the classified ads. She was 
going to spread the ads out and go through them to see what jobs they could 
apply for, but the phone rang. It was too late to get a substituting job that 
day, and too early to be an assignment for tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry didn't move, so after four rings, Brenda picked it up. It was the guy 
who'd taken the cats to his father. She stood leaning against the wall in the 
kitchen where she could see Jerry still looking at the sports page, and she 
listened to the guy explaining how his father had put the box in an empty horse 
stall and opened it but didn't take the cats out because it's best to let them 
explore new territory on their own. But, he assumed, something had frightened 
them -- maybe one of the cats that already lived there, or one of about 20 dogs 
his father kept -- so Bessie and Spunky had left the box a lot sooner than he 
would've expected them to want to leave. Maybe the thunder and lightning had 
frightened them too, and since it was night they couldn't see where they were 
going, and the bottom line was they'd just flat-out disappeared. Maybe they 
would come back, the guy said, but with all that rain, his father wasn't 
holding out too much hope. That was an awful lot of rain, the guy said. It was 
just too much rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda thanked the guy and hung up. Jerry didn't even ask "what was that?" 
like he usually did after she got a phone call. She went back to where she'd 
spread the classified ads on the floor, kneeled, read down one column and 
asked, "Is busboy or hospital orderly OK??" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh God, I guess so," he groaned. He had the paper folded to the crossword 
puzzle, then began rhythmically stabbing his pencil through the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she told him about Bessie and Spunky. "They could be hiding, Jerry. They 
might just suddenly come out from underneath something and go ask for something 
to eat. Or they might even find their way back here . It's happened, hasn't 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
 He got up and went into the bedroom. She sighed, paused for a second, staring 
at the still-empty opening for a dishwasher, then followed him, but he wasn't 
lying across the bed or looking up phone numbers of divorce lawyers. He was in 
the closet, kneeling, with his head hidden underneath the clothes. When he 
backed out, he had his leather high-top sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's up?" she said. "You gonna wear those for picketing tomorrow? Your bad 
ankle bothering you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, no. I'm going out to look for the cats." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Tomorrow morning, if they don't come out this afternoon, like you said." 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean, we're going to search that whole valley out there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to come." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's going to carry you home when you step on a wasp nest or trip in a 
gopher hole or slip in the mud?" She stopped and sniffed. "I think the 
applesauce is done." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate it when you get this way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What way?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Rushing all over doing stuff." He sat on the bed holding the shoes, one on 
each knee. They were still almost new. She'd persuaded him to buy them after 
his last bad ankle sprain two years before. He looked at her. "You ready to 
admit it yet? Ready to give up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you talking about?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Why'd it have to rain, anyway," he moaned. "I hate rain." 
</P>
<P>
 "It needs to rain or things don't grow." 
</P>
<P>
 He left his shoes on the bed and went back to the living room, stepped on the 
classified ads on his way to the sofa and picked up the tattered crossword 
puzzle. Brenda went out into the back yard to weed the small garden area she'd 
cleared the week before. She had planted some quick-growing, easy-care 
vegetables -- lettuce, chard, bush beans, green pepper. The ground was 
saturated and the small plants were flattened. She used twigs to support the 
ones that weren't beaten to death. There was a snake on the lawn that she 
killed with the hoe. 
</P>
<P>
 IT WASN'T REALLY A FARM after all. It was about 50 square yards where the 
sagebrush had been cleared, surrounded by a low, leaning chain-link fence to 
keep the pack of dogs from roaming free. The house was a converted portable 
horse stall. The barn was several more portable horse stalls facing each other 
with sheet metal covering the space between the roofs. There were two sheep in 
a pen, their dirty wool full of burrs and sticks. There were a few chickens 
loose with the dogs. There were three horses in stalls, one empty stall where 
the feed was stored and one stall used as a pen for some puppies. A few cats 
sat on the roof or the tops of stalls. There hadn't been any other houses along 
the last three miles of dirt road. The telephone wires stopped where the paved 
road did. The guy had a generator for power and a tank to hold water. 
</P>
<P>
 "A great place to be a cat," Brenda said, "but a lousy place to be a human." 
</P>
<P>
 "Great place to be a cat if you're not chased away by all the dogs. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Or eaten by a coyote," she said, which she hadn't said before, although she 
knew it must have occurred to him. Sure enough, he turned sharply and said, 
"Shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the place wasn't there, but his son had said to go on up and look 
around for the cats. The dogs barked but let them come through the gate. Jerry 
had brought a cat toy -- a plastic ball with a bell inside it -- that he shook 
in one hand as he walked through the barn and called the cats' names. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked under every feed sack, behind every bale of hay, between boxes of 
tools and horse junk. Then they walked around the inside perimeter of the 
fence, looking under abandoned pieces of sheet metal, peering into dark holes 
in an old water tank. There was another opening in the fence -- not a gate, 
just a place where two ends of the chain link came together and were tied shut 
with a piece of rope. Jerry untied the knot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you going?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for the cats, what did you think I was going to do out here, look 
for a job?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know which would be more hopeless." 
</P>
<P>
 There was an erosion path winding down into a shallow canyon. The ground was 
still wet but it was probably 85 degrees and there were no shade trees. The 
highest bushes came only to their waists. The little trail was rutted down the 
middle. It was also filled with holes of various sizes -- big enough for a 
squirrel or skunk, small enough for a spider or wasp. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes you think the cats would stay on a trail?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a better idea?" 
</P>
<P>
 After a moment she said, "I guess not." Then added, "It's as good as anywhere 
else. Might as well, while we're here. But we can't keep chasing forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry didn't answer. He paused every few steps to shake the toy and call the 
cats' names. His foot hit some loose mud and slid out in front of him once, but 
he caught himself with his palms against some big rocks, then went on calling, 
pausing to scan the area, moving on again. They'd gone down the trail far 
enough so they couldn't see the barn anymore. The shallow canyon was only a 
side entry into a huge valley surrounded by low rolling hills, all covered with 
the same dry, scrubby bushes, rocks, holes and -- for now -- mud. It went on 
forever, without a tree or river to break the monotony or provide a goal. They 
would never be able to cover it all, foot by foot, shaking every bush, jingling 
the cat toy outside every crevice between two rocks, following every erosion 
trail, rolling every boulder. And even if they could eventually cover it all, 
actually look everywhere , they'd never find anything. While they were looking 
here, Bessie could be torn in half and eaten by a coyote three miles away, the 
carcass filled with maggots, the head carried down a hole by a possum or skunk, 
and the pieces scattered by crows and buzzards. By the time Jerry worked his 
way three miles to the west or east or south or wherever she'd been killed, 
there'd be nothing there. He'd just step right over the mound of red ants 
swarming over a piece of her tail and keep looking. Things could just 
disappear, no longer exist, why go on sliding around in the mud trying to find 
something that's just not there anymore. "Oh God, Jerry, it's hope less!" 
</P>
<P>
 He was about 10 steps in front of her. She sat on a flat rock that was flush 
with the ground, the bushes now towering over her head. "What are we going to 
do , what'll we do ?" She was shrieking and Jerry was slipping in the mud, 
coming back up the trail toward her. "Look at us, look at us, we just can't, 
how can we -- it's so hopeless and pointless to even go on trying and we'll 
never . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry squatted beside her, then crouched over her, hugging her with his arms 
and legs. Her nose was in his ear and her mouth open against his jaw. He ran 
his hand down her spine then softly patted the back of her head. "We can't, we 
can't, we can't," she moaned. "And what difference would it make? What's gonna 
change if we go on for another five minutes or six months? Call it off, please, 
call it off." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quitter." 
</P>
<P>
 She almost fell over into the mud as Jerry pushed away and stood up. She 
stared as he wiped her tears off his cheek and neck, his eyes slits, then he 
went back down the trail, calling the cats and shaking the toy. She watched 
until he was out of sight and she couldn't even hear him anymore.

By LIZA WIELAND, Like the woman in Purgatory, Liza Wieland thought about buying 
a ticket to Silverton from Durango, Colo., but she didn't go through with it. 
The rest of the story comes from the novel I'm working on now. In some ways, 
this is a chapter, but a different telling of the story. Wieland teaches 
American literature and creative writing at Cal State Fresno. Her novel The 
Names of the Lost was published in 1992 by Southern Methodist University Press; 
Discovering America, a collection of short stories, was published in 1994 by 
Random House.

 Main Street in Durango, Colorado, makes me sad to the very core, the kind of 
deep loneliness I used to feel as a kid on winter mornings in Flagstaff when 
I'd walk to the bottom of the driveway to get the newspaper. Up and down the 
block, there'd be all those houses lit up against the cold, the buttery light 
of the neighbors' kitchens making me feel orphaned. All the way back up the 
driveway, my heart seemed like it would break open, and the pain of it got 
sharper and stronger until I thought it would kill me, right there on the back 
stoop, with all the news that's fit to print clutched in my hand. I'd let 
myself in the back door, into my mother's kitchen, and she'd turn away from the 
stove to watch me come in like she'd missed me for all of the five minutes I'd 
been gone. Everyone else was still asleep. I'd hand her the paper and see that 
same yellow light shining in our house too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the only place to go back to is the Pine Aire Motel, and Charlie and the 
tired argument we've had the whole way across the country from New York, then 
on to Flagstaff to my father and my brother and his exemplary life. We were 
going so Charlie could meet my family before we get married. But somewhere in 
the great ugly void of Kansas we seem to have decided what we really need to 
get is an abortion. I say "we," but I have plans of my own. I always have had 
plans of my own, I guess. It's what my mother hated most about me, that I 
wasn't your basic family-type person, wouldn't run with the pack, turned and 
snarled at the pack most of the time. Wouldn't she be surprised now. Maybe she 
is surprised, looking down from her front-row seat in heaven. Maybe she's 
saying to her heavenly cronies, That one's mine. Maybe she's thinking, Hang on, 
there's hope. 
</P>
<P>
 I've come to the end of Main Street, where it bottlenecks into the turnstiles 
for the narrow-gauge railroad to Silverton, passing through, would you believe 
it, the town of Purgatory. I have this idea: I will go to Purgatory, and I will 
get work in a bar. Of course there are bars in Purgatory, there'd have to be, 
but the glasses would always be just out of reach, or else you'd drink and 
drink but never forget your sorrows, never even get drunk. I can go there and 
have this baby that its own father doesn't want, and no one will ever find me. 
This baby can grow up in Purgatory, and when it gets ready to enter the world, 
it will be one of the few humans truly equipped to live there. Charlie can 
drive the rest of the way to see my brother and my dad, and he'll be happy for 
a way out. That's when I start to feel scared. There's a solid wall of people 
moving from the McDonald's across the street past me to the railroad station 
and the ticket window, and at first I resist their jostling, but then I let 
myself be pushed into their number, close behind a man with an infant slung 
over his shoulder. I get packed in so close I can smell the sweet stink of 
talcum powder and sour milk that babies give off. I follow the baby and buy a 
ticket to Silverton. Then I stand along the west wall of the depot watching the 
baby as its eyes begin to close for the slow ride into sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:20, when the all-aboard whistle blows directly above my head, I open my 
mouth and give one long grieving wail, but it can't be heard above the whistle 
and the loudspeaker instructing passengers to have their tickets ready. My 
stomach heaves, and it's while I'm getting sick in the ladies' room that the 
train leaves for Purgatory and Silverton and all points in between. I know I'm 
going to ask myself sometimes what would have happened if I'd gotten on that 
train. What would have happened if my baby hadn't picked that moment to show 
off its early willfulness? I know, too, that I'll never stop asking because 
I'll never come up with a good enough answer. 
</P>
<P>
 WE LEAVE DURANGO AT FIRST LIGHT, HEADING WEST, THEN SOUTH, ON Route 160, the 
two-lane highway that will run us through Four Corners, the wild and desolate 
convergence of Utah, Colorado, Arizona and New Mexico. We stop there, expecting 
fanfare and earth shifting under the weight of its own importance, but find 
instead only a few Indians selling their wares, and 200 portable toilets. Then 
the road drifts gradually southwest, skirting first the Navajo, then the Hopi 
reservation, then the Navajo again, bisecting and squaring the land until it 
dead-ends into 89 South to Flagstaff. 
</P>
<P>
 I point out to Charlie how this landscape looks like the moon or other places 
you would never think to go. The roads are deserted and so the land takes care 
of itself, makes itself up as it goes along, seeming to have never gotten the 
news about the way order and repetition make for what people back East call 
scenery. I wonder if the point of scenery isn't getting a lot of other people 
to see exactly what you've seen, which accounts for postcard sales and that red 
barn near Gloucester, Massachusetts, that's the most often-painted piece of 
landscape in the entire free world. 
</P>
<P>
 Out here, though, I'm more alone, even with Charlie close enough to touch, 
even more alone than I felt last night on Main Street in Durango. This desert 
couldn't care one iota about my traveling through it on the way to Flagstaff 
and from there to my sorry old age, my puny death. It doesn't even care about 
its own name, much less mine. Names means boundaries, and the desert has 
nothing to do with boundaries -- they're somebody else's problem. I've never 
felt so much myself as I do now, driving through this desert, with Charlie 
sleeping next to me, his head turned away. I'm never so much myself as when I'm 
nowhere. This is especially true in the early mornings. We both like to be 
driving before the sun's up, and then hard, hot daylight begins to come on, 
come toward us, and that whole desert world turns blue, blue like it's 
underwater. So you can see, in some small way, that the desert had once been an 
ocean, that it had dried out, gone belly up, but hung onto its original color 
the same way we all die, holding onto the shadows of what we've been. 
</P>
<P>
 North Flagstaff was a long time ago given over to light industry. Railroad 
tracks guard the innards of the city and heavy-duty trucks fill the motel 
parking lots. I call my brother from a pay phone. When he answers, I tell him 
we're here, making my voice singsong and haunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good," David says, "Dad can't wait to see you." 
</P>
<P>
 "How is he?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So-so. We drove him around today so he could see some of the painted desert. 
Lately he's started talking about maybe moving out to California." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it isn't. He thinks Mom is in California waiting for him. He drinks too 
much. Fell down and had to have stitches in his forehead, and now he's on 
crutches. It's like living with a hundred children. You can take over for a few 
days. I've had it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy to stay in a motel," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, the more the merrier. Arlene's about gone stir-crazy since she quit 
work. She says just get here as soon as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad's out of it," I say to Charlie when I come back to the car. I tell him 
about the stitches and my mother's putative whereabouts.  
</P>
<P>
 "You get this voice when you talk about him," Charlie says. "It's like that 
computerized instruction at the airport, 'Our next stop is Concourse B. The 
doors are ready to close.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah?" I say. "So?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that it's not very nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Nice, I think. No, it's not nice. I'm not nice. I know a lot of people who 
are, but I'm not one of them. Arlene is nice. When we get to their house, I'll 
watch her and see how she does it. If I can't manage, well, she's nice enough 
for two. I tell this to Charlie. I tell him I always thought Arlene should be 
the name of a much older woman than my brother's wife is. Whenever I heard the 
name, all I could think of was Arlene Francis from "What's My Line?" and the 
way she had to sit there in her chiffon gown next to the likes of Soupy Sales 
and Nipsey Russell. So when David first brought Arlene Fisher to meet us three 
years ago this Christmas, I was surprised to see somebody young and pretty, 
with this mass of blond curly hair, and wearing a red dress like she knew how 
it was supposed to be worn. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bad Christmas for everybody, though now I find it hard to say exactly 
why. I remember that no one was there to meet me at the airport, and when I did 
finally wise up and call a cab, the house was dark and locked. On Christmas 
Day, my mother finally told me why, told me that all my life I'd been selfish, 
not at all nice, and she was giving up. Arlene got to hear most of it. The day 
was never mentioned between us again until the night before Arlene and David's 
wedding. At the rehearsal dinner, in the ladies' room, a very drunk Arlene put 
her arms around an equally drunk me and promised I'd never, ever be locked out 
of their house. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, they moved Mother and Dad into their house, because they were 
too old to be alone. Twice Mother had been found walking into the Coconino 
National Forest, shedding her clothes piece by piece as a trail to follow back. 
She died a month ago, and at the very end, she didn't recognize anybody, got 
the generations and bloodlines all confused. "Mother," she had said to Arlene, 
"I hope I have a daughter just like you. And if I do, will you pay to send her 
to college?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now Arlene is 8 1/2 months pregnant, carrying high and walking swaybacked with 
her feet turned out. I think, in the first instant of seeing her, that Arlene 
looks used up, like the baby is already starting to take its measure of her, 
even before its official entrance into the world. Her skin has the flush of 
somebody who's been drinking or crying or both, and her eyes move quickly from 
my face to Charlie's to David's, as if she can't quite keep up with all that's 
being said. She says she's hated the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women talk about this glow," she says when I ask why. "All expectant mothers 
are supposed to have it. Bull, I say. It's not a glow, it's the frenzy of 
looking for yet another place to pee." 
</P>
<P>
 "You get a sort of bovine feeling," David says. It's a term one of the 
pregnancy books used. Charlie tries not to look at me. It's part of the deal he 
was trying to make in the motel in Durango before I took my little walk to the 
train station: no talking about our situation, no meaningful looks. It wasn't 
my deal, so I'm looking at him as hard as I can. 
</P>
<P>
 When my father comes into the room, I'm not sure he recognizes me. We hold 
each other in a formal way, like people just learning to ballroom dance. He 
balances on one crutch to shake hands with Charlie, says he's pleased to meet 
him. Then he turns back to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mother was just wondering where you were," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what did you tell her?" I ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said you'd been met with unavoidable delays." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's how come I talk like an airport," I say to Charlie and point at my 
father. Nobody else understands what I mean exactly, but they get the drift. 
Arlene changes the subject, tells my father he did a good job putting on the 
new bandage.  
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't we a pair?" my father says to her. "We could be our own hospital 
waiting room." 
</P>
<P>
 Arlene smiles. We talk about her doctor, Lamaze classes. My father says he'll 
wait around for the birth, but then he's off. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, Dad," I say, "what's in California that's got you so worked up?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Ask your mother," he says, and stops for a second. "I like the Pacific Ocean. 
Seems like I should see it again before I die." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the rush?" David asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I got to be scouting retirement places for your mother and me. She never 
did like this desert out here. I know I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," I say, "I heard she already took off." 
</P>
<P>
 My father gives me a dark look. David waves his hand to mean I should stop 
egging him on. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know that's the best way to do it," my father says. "I have to look 
around by myself, and you know, I think she should look around by herself too. 
It shouldn't be that I run her life." 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have told her that before," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe so," my father tells me, "maybe so, but I hadn't thought of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 AFTER SUPPER, ARLENE TAKES ME UPSTAIRS TO see what is still the guest room but 
will soon be the baby's room. Its walls are hung with colored posters of exotic 
birds and animals, toucans, ibexes, peacocks. There's a windsock in one corner, 
its streamers all the colors of the rainbow, fluttering against the freshly 
painted white walls. I want to tell her about Charlie and me, but I don't know 
where to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word is," Arlene says, lowering herself to her knees, "babies go for 
bright colors and contrasts. No pastels, none of that Santa Fe style here. Help 
me fold some of these, will you?" 
</P>
<P>
 We sit on the floor with our backs resting against the bed. Between us, 
there's a pile of baby clothes and shoes, gifts from various baby showers and 
hand-me-downs from relatives and friends. In the pile, I recognize some of my 
old favorites. Carter's pajamas with feet, the kind that snap together at the 
waist. There's a pile of stretch shirts and matching pants. I remember being 
the first kid on the block to wear 100% polyester. 
</P>
<P>
 "Amazing how these lasted," I say to Arlene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your mother told me it's because you both grew so fast, you hardly ever wore 
anything longer than a couple of months." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember," I say. "I remember Mother crying after we'd been to the shoe 
store and my foot had grown two sizes. At dinner she said to Dad she cried 
because she had been jamming my feet into those old shoes. She thought I was 
just being stubborn about putting them on all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your poor mother." 
</P>
<P>
 "No kidding, " I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "She asked for you right at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called being delirious." 
</P>
<P>
 "She said to tell you hello." 
</P>
<P>
 I want to say something to Arlene, but I can't. It's not that I don't know 
where to start, it's that if I started, I'd never stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you OK?" I ask Arlene through the silence. "You look dead tired." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am. It's supposed to be two weeks now, but all the books say that first 
babies are usually late. I've got a kind of cooped-up feeling too. And it's 
only going to get worse. I keep thinking, what if my water breaks in some 
public place. So I only go to the grocery store and I always make sure to buy a 
jar of pickles so I can drop it in case of emergency. I read where a pregnant 
woman always carried a jar of pickles in case her water broke in public." 
</P>
<P>
 We look at each other and burst out laughing. David comes running up the 
stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," he says when he sees us folding baby clothes, "I thought you were 
crying." 
</P>
<P>
 "These days, it's a tossup," Arlene says. 
</P>
<P>
 We've folded the sunsuits, the pinafores, smocked dresses, plastic pants, 
footie pajamas and piled them in the drawers of what used to be Arlene's desk. 
If that's not symbolic, then nothing is, but I know better than to say such a 
thing out loud. All that's left are two pairs of shoes, polished white 
baptismal shoes and tiny blue Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bo don't know diapers," Arlene says, holding up the Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did those come from?" I say, pointing to the white pair. 
</P>
<P>
 "David bought those down in Mexico. From a woman sitting outside a church. She 
said they belonged to Santo Nino, the child saint who travels through the 
countryside at night and wears out his shoes. She said David should give these 
shoes to his baby to wear and then when the baby outgrows them he should bring 
them back to Santo Nino. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sweet," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," Arlene agrees, picking up the two pairs of shoes and opening the 
bottom drawer of her desk. I crawl over on my hands and knees as Arlene tries 
to shut the drawer, and I reach in and pull out the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no," I say to Arlene, shaking my head, getting up and walking to the 
closet where I've already hung up some of my own clothes. I bend down and line 
up the tiny Nikes next to a larger pair. Arlene is standing right next to me, 
laughing, but then she covers her face with her hands and it doesn't sound like 
laughter.  
</P>
<P>
 "What? What?" I say, and go to wrap my arms around Arlene's shoulders. It 
kills me that I made her cry. Arlene shakes her head and stands still against 
me. When she can speak again, she says the sight of those shoes in the closet 
just now made everything real. 
</P>
<P>
 LATER, I'M LYING THERE IN THE DARK LIMBO OF the guest room soon-to-be nursery, 
listening to David and Arlene whispering together on the other side of the 
wall. Charlie's downstairs watching late-night TV. He'll probably stay down 
there. It's really the beginning of the end. I can see it now that I've got 
some perspective, now that we're able to sit farther away from each other than 
the length of the front seat of a moving vehicle. I drift a little further 
toward sleep and into an old dream, one I had about David and Arlene's wedding, 
but years before they were actually married. In the dream, David, Arlene and I 
are all standing on our old front lawn, and I reach out to touch David's 
wedding ring, because I doubt it's real. Like Thomas, Arlene says in garbled 
dream language, like Thomas into the wounds, her voice sounding like it's 
coming out of a long metal tube. Then David says to me, This will never happen 
to you, and it's right then that I always bolt awake, breathing hard and 
feeling as if there's been a fist driven into my heart. 
</P>
<P>
 I can remember their real wedding like it was yesterday, even though I was 
hung over from the rehearsal dinner. I remember how David looked at Arlene in a 
way I'd never seen before, and then after the priest pronounced them husband 
and wife and after he kissed Arlene, David looked up at me and made his eyes go 
huge, like he couldn't believe it any more than I could. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I read from the Book of Ruth, "Entreat me not to leave you or to 
return from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge I 
will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God; where you die 
I will die, and there will I be buried. May the Lord do so to me and more also 
if even death parts me from you. And when Naomi saw she was determined to go 
with her, she said no more." 
</P>
<P>
 "Say no more," was a joke between David and Arlene ever since she said it to 
him when he asked her to marry him. So when I got to that part, they both 
laughed and Arlene dropped the shredded Kleenex she'd been hanging onto for 
dear life, dropped it right at the priest's feet, and it lay there for the rest 
of the ceremony. Everybody was happy. Even my mother and I declared a truce. We 
got drunk at the reception and fed each other pieces of the wedding cake, 
neatly and carefully, no messing around. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NEXT NIGHT, AFTER SUPPER, DAVID TAKES us all out to the Grand Canyon, a 
club where four of his lawyer friends are playing in a band called Power of 
Attorney. Their big hit is "Heart Balm and Tender Offers," which David says is 
an inside joke. The lead singer is a woman from David's firm whose voice is 
half Emmylou Harris, half Beverly Sills, a nicer-sounding combination than you 
might think. Between songs she tells lawyer jokes that run toward the 
indiscreet. She winks at David and Arlene and says, "Did you hear about the 
lawyer who was so lazy he married a pregnant woman?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing she's the best tax attorney in Flagstaff," David says, 
smiling, "or she'd be out tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Dad sits at the table and listens to the first three songs, them stumps up to 
the bar for a refill. I watch him shift his good hip onto a stool and rest with 
his bum leg hanging down to the boot rail, three inches up from the floor. 
Arlene elbows me in the ribs and whispers how it's the most comfortable she's 
seen him since Mother died. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he's been wanting some other men to talk to," I say back. And not David 
either, I think. If David and Dad could be old men together, they'd be quite 
the pair. But right now, they're too much alike, with too many years between 
them, years that David will discover one by one and slowly, just as Dad is 
forgetting, leaving them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been much company for him, I guess," Arlene says. 
</P>
<P>
 We watch as Dad introduces himself to the man on his left, who then turns to 
look back at us when Dad jerks his thumb over his shoulder to show he's with 
us. Both men turn slightly to the left to watch the television over the bar. 
It's preseason football, the Broncos and the Chiefs going head to head in 
Denver, the sky-cam drifting high above the stadium to bring its view of the 
Rockies into a million homes and establishments just like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 I watch Dad and his new friend carrying on a kind of conversation, nodding 
sometimes, pointing at the TV without ever lifting their elbows up off the bar. 
There's a jangling part of me that admires men's conversation, always 
recognizes it above whatever else is going on in a room. The way it takes place 
with so little effort, that's what I admire most about the way men talk to each 
other, the way it always has to do with things of this world. Charlie's like 
that too: All during this trip, he's loved talking to other guys on the road, 
store clerks and pump jockeys, about mileages and the names of towns and the 
exact distance we covered in a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Dad orders another beer and a shot of whiskey to go with it, then raises the 
shot glass to the television. I imagine he's making his old toast to Joe 
Montana, a guy he admires for having the name of the biggest wide-open state in 
the Union with the lowest population per square mile. 
</P>
<P>
 David gets up from the table and goes to stand at the bar next to Dad. He puts 
his hand on Dad's shoulder, but it's shaken off. I know what David's saying. 
He's telling Dad to ease up, checking to see if he wants to head back to the 
house. Dad turns back to the game, and David stands still for a minute with his 
hands hanging at his sides. Even without seeing his face, I know how David's 
slowly thinking through the situation like he always does. Then he moves around 
to Dad's right and sits beside him, nudging him with his elbow and signaling to 
the bartender at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 I see Dad lean away to his left and say something to David, then swing himself 
off the bar stool, kicking his crutches up under the boot rail. Without them, 
he stumbles, pushing off against people's backs, heading toward the poolroom at 
the back of the bar. David is right after him. I get up and follow along the 
opposite wall of the room. Dad sees me and waves me back, but I keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the poolroom from the bar is like walking out of a cave into full 
sunlight. Three naked light bulbs hang in a row over a pool table lined with 
pink felt instead of the usual green. Dad and David shield their eyes in 
identical gestures of salute. There are four women and one man standing around 
the table, alternating in and out of the game. They look up at their new 
spectators.  
</P>
<P>
 "Need a sixth?" Dad says. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, it's OK. We're OK," one of the women, a blonde, says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could help out," Dad says. "That way you could all play. I'm not great, but 
I have my moments."  
</P>
<P>
 "Dad," I say, "let them be." 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch this," Dad says, taking a cue from the rack on the wall. "I'll call it, 
too. Usually I shoot with my crutches, but I left them back in there with the 
lawyers. Five in the left center there." 
</P>
<P>
 Delicately, Dad lowers himself over the table, looking like a bird coming in 
for a landing, his hip bones balanced against the rim of the table. He slips 
the cue back and forth under his left index finger and closes his eyes. The 
table groans and shifts under his weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, what did I say?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five in the left center," says another of the women. Dad lifts his head, and 
looks at her for a long time. She's small, dressed in a white T-shirt and a 
denim miniskirt. She wears a small tan purse crossed over one shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, honey," Dad says, "what's with that purse anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 David comes to stand next to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad," he says, then looks up at the other players and tells them he's sorry 
for the interruption in their game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry about what?" Dad says, pushing himself upright against the table, 
lifting it up off the floor at the end so that all the balls roll forward 
toward the woman with the purse. She holds up her arms as if expecting to take 
the table's full weight.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't you ever apologize for me, you understand? Ever. I'm not some old fart 
who pisses in public and has to answer to his own damn children." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dad," David says again, "we should be getting home." 
</P>
<P>
 "The hell you say. Just who do you think you are, dragging me off? Your mother 
will treat me a hell of a lot better than this, better than any of you. When I 
get to her in California she'll let me play pool if you won't. She'll let me do 
anything I want. Right now. I'm going. Right this minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Dad drops the pool cue and stumbles around the far side of the table toward 
the door. When he tries to pass through into the bar, David reaches for his 
arm, but Dad shoves him away, so hard that David's head snaps back against the 
door jamb. Dad stops and considers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Didn't know I had it in me, did you, son?" he says. "Neither did I." 
</P>
<P>
 We follow as he makes his way along the bar toward the door. Power of Attorney 
is doing a song I recognize but don't know the name of, and they're into the 
second verse before I get out the door, singing about a wild card up your 
sleeve. I see Dad turn around in the parking lot, sway for a few seconds, then 
fall into David's arms. I can hear him saying he misses my mother, wishes she'd 
come back from California, doesn't understand why she went. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's you damn kids," he says. "You drove her away. You fought all the time, 
you hung on her, made her drive you everywhere, all day long. You never said 
thank you. We would come home from a night out, and she would sit in the parked 
car and say to me, 'Do I really have to go back in there?' It might as well be 
that you killed her." 
</P>
<P>
 David shifts and leans Dad against the door of a car, like he's a potted plant 
or something you don't expect will make a move against you. 
</P>
<P>
 "And you especially," my father says to me, "you're the worst. Other people's 
children don't do what you did, they don't go running off like that, over 
nothing, over a cross word." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry," I say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to make it up to her," he says, "before it's too late." 
</P>
<P>
 We're absolutely still. All around us, around this parking lot, is the desert, 
its dark buttes and canyons waiting to turn blue in the early morning light, 
waiting to remember the strange truth of its origin, which is that it was once 
an ocean. If I started walking now, I could be out in the desert, smack in the 
middle of it by morning. I could watch its blue light turn slowly, softly to 
yellow, the yellow of kitchens in Flagstaff in the winter, when only the two of 
us were up. If I started now, I could be in Purgatory in a few days, and not 
alone, at least not for long. If I started now, I would never stop.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO MAKE 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SAFER AND MORE LIVABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months ago today the deadly Northridge earthquake rocked Los Angeles, 
leaving freeways buckled, homes destroyed, lives shattered. For this city, the 
events of Jan. 17 drove home a message.The time had come to move beyond simply 
patching up the masonry and questioning our love affair with the automobile. It 
was time to set aside old assumptions about this place and find new, innovative 
ways to solve our problems -- from education to crime to transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, The Times published a special section on The Next Los Angeles, in 
which leading experts put forth new ideas on critical issues facing the region. 
The aim was to spark community discussion and debate about what Los Angeles 
might become. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's second special section on The Next Los Angeles, the focus shifts 
from what's possible to what's practical. Inside, experts are joined by 
community leaders and the public at large in proposing and evaluating concrete 
solutions to real-world problems. The aim this time is to move forward toward 
The Next Los Angeles with steps we can take now to make the Southland safer, 
more prosperous, move livable.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; INSIGHTS; CREATIVE SOLUTIONS; 
IMAGINATIVE STRATEGIES FOR TACKLING THE CITY'S PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tom Logsdon, Tom Logsdon, a senior aerospace engineer at Rockwell 
International in Seal Beach, is the author of Breaking ThroughCreative Problem 
Solving Using Six successful Strategies (Addison Wesley, 1993). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "If you can't write your idea on the back of your business card, you don't 
have an idea." American theatrical producer David Balasco, who made that 
observation, never had to suffer the daily gridlock that plagues Los Angeles 
commuters. But his simple, creative approach can help us turn Southern 
California into a more enjoyable and productive place. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, I got the idea to write a book on simple, creative solutions. 
I analyzed more than 400 such solutions developed by innovative individuals 
over the last 2,500 years. Soon I learned something quite intriguing. The 
individuals who make major breakthroughs have different personalities. They 
have different lifestyles. The problems they solve are different. But the 
thought processes they use in developing their simple, creative solutions are 
hauntingly similar. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why all of us can learn how to become more creative. All we have to do 
is apply the specific thought processes creative individuals employ when they 
make major breakthroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are my six strategies for achieving creative solutions. 1. Taking a fresh 
look at the interfaces 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, when President John F. Kennedy asked his fellow Americans to join him 
in conquering the moon, Werner von Braun and his colleagues' favored approach 
for the mission called for a single 12-million-pound booster that would lift 
off the launch pad, then fly up to the moon, dropping off increasingly smaller 
stages along the way. But then one scientist figured out how to reach the lunar 
surface at half price. Instead of flying the astronauts directly to the moon 
aboard one gigantic booster, the new scheme called for a rendezvous in orbit 
around the moon.  
</P>
<P>
 When the astronauts reached lunar orbit, two of them would enter a smaller and 
lighter craft for their trip down to the lunar surface. Then half of it would 
fly back up to rejoin the larger craft circling overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunar orbit rendezvous allowed the use of a single booster weighing only 6 
million pounds. In other words, only half the liftoff weight would be required 
to complete the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 This inspiration came taking a fresh look at what happens when two dissimilar 
things come together. Most interfaces are so unobtrusive we seldom ever notice 
them. But, as you try to devise ways to solve problems, notice how easy -- and 
inexpensive -- it is to manipulate various interfaces to produce fruitful 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the interfaces in local prisons. In today's prisons, 
social interaction makes effective prisoner control difficult. But troublesome 
interfaces could be restructured to eliminate most human interactions during 
incarceration. 
</P>
<P>
 Meals, laundry, toiletries and medical supplies would all be delivered by 
conveyor belt so prisoners would have essentially no human contact during their 
short stay. No one would be harmed or brutalized or inducted by fellow inmates 
into the next levels of crime. But prisoners would have ample time to reflect 
on their wasted lives in that safe, but lonely, prison. 2. Reformulating the 
problem 
</P>
<P>
 In order to maximize the payload-carrying capabilities of the Saturn V moon 
rocket, my fellow aerospace engineers and I installed special devices to 
measure the amount of fuel and oxidizer remaining so we could make adjustments 
in the ratio at which the two propellants were being burned.  
</P>
<P>
 This allowed us to achieve simultaneous depletion of the two. Unfortunately, 
adjustments in the mixture caused small payload changes, which we tried to 
eliminate by various means. But one scientist, Bud Brux reminded us that the 
purpose of a rocket is to carry payloads into space. So, he reasoned that we 
actually should maximize payload variations instead of trying to make them go 
away. That brilliant insight allowed the Saturn V to carry nearly 3,000 extra 
pounds of payload to the moon, saving U.S. taxpayers $6 million on each lunar 
flight. 
</P>
<P>
 This scientist used a strategy that frequently leads to breakthroughs of major 
proportions. He reformulated the problem and in so doing turned it into an 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the problem of graffiti artists defacing Los Angeles. Instead of trying 
to stop graffiti before it happens, maybe the solution is to require convicted 
graffiti artists to clean up the mess? Each guilty party might be responsible 
for a three-block area. Sweaty hours of hand-scrubbing might make the crime 
downright unappealing. That's reformulating the problem. 3. Visualizing 
fruitful analogies 
</P>
<P>
 In 1905, two brothers wobbled aloft aboard an ungainly contraption over the 
sands at Kitty Hawk. Why did they succeed when so many others had failed? 
Because they had a special ability to visualize fruitful analogies in designing 
and building their flying machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their predecessors had been distracted by the rapidly flapping wings 
of the sparrow. But the Wright brothers used the condor, a soaring bird, as the 
mode they were attempting to emulate. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruitful analogies can also accentuate your creative problem-solving skills. 
Find the hidden connection between the problem you're trying to solve and 
another problem already solved by earlier inventors and you may be on your way 
toward developing your own breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 A fruitful analogy, properly chosen and implemented, could help improve 
Southern California neighborhoods. The Peace Corps has been a consistently 
successful institution but, unfortunately, those who join must make a two-year 
commitment. A practical analogy could be a "Weekend Peace Corps." Platoons of 
50 to 75 residents could clean up a park, refurbish housing units or clean city 
streets with highly visible results. 4. Searching for useful order of magnitude 
changes 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, two talented scientists, J. Presper Eckhert and John W. 
Mauchley, volunteered to build a new kind of computer to tackle stubborn 
computational problems encountered in building new artillery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 They decided against copying Harvard University's Mark 1 machine because its 
electromechanical switching circuits required at least 1/500th of a second to 
open or close. 
</P>
<P>
 So they chose, instead, to build their new computer with electronic switches, 
in which the only thing that moves is a stream of electrons hurtling forward at 
186,000 miles per second. An electronic device can switch in one-millionth of a 
second -- or faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Eckhert and Mauchley put their faith in a high-payoff approach by searching 
for useful order-of-magnitude changes. 
</P>
<P>
 One order-of-magnitude change capable of making Southern California a better 
place would involve the use of electromagnetic waves rather than motorcars, 
which take about 20 million times longer to reach their destinations. Another 
term for this is telecommuting. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic offices would allow commuters to avoid traffic congestion. Computer 
modem fax machines, software modules and inexpensive telephone links could 
provide order-of-magnitude improvements over almost any commute. 5. Staying 
alert to happy serendipity 
</P>
<P>
 In 1581, Galileo Galilee saw inside a church a candle hanging on a chain, 
swaying in the breeze. He noticed that the amount of time required for the 
candle to swing back and forth was independent of the length of its swinging 
arc. If the candle traveled along a short arc, it moved slowly; if it traveled 
along a longer arc, it moved faster to compensate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clocks using Galileo's pendulum principle soon were being produced all over 
Europe. Galileo was fortunate to experience happy serendipity, which occurs 
when we stumble onto a creative solution almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Serendipity played a key role in many of humankind's most important 
discoveries, among them vulcanized rubber, the self-starter for automobiles, 
the microwave oven, Velcro and the cotton gin.  
</P>
<P>
 While vacationing in southern Scotland, I experienced "happy serendipity" when 
I stumbled upon an approach that might prove helpful in revamping our sagging 
Southern California economy. I noticed that government leaders in Glasgow had 
formed the Scottish Development Agency to encourage industrial development on 
the Scottish countryside with emphasis on computer chip production, automotive 
component manufacturing and other high-value enterprises. Some of the unique 
skills and talents associated with California's high-tech aerospace industry 
might be salvaged by analogous well-organized governmental structures. 6. 
Breaking your problem apart and putting it back together again 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of his junior year at Yale, an undergraduate named Fred Smith 
wrote a term paper in which he advanced the notion that a nationwide 
package-delivery service with guaranteed overnight arrival could become a 
billion-dollar enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not, he reasoned, fly all the packages radially inward to one central 
location in the middle of the night, sort them according to destination, then 
fly them radially outward again, he reasoned. Later, he gave his dream a try, 
with Memphis as the center of his "hub-and-spoke" system. His company is called 
Federal Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith broke his problem apart and put it back together again in a different 
way. (Unfortunately, his initial proposal did not elicit rave reviews; his term 
paper received a barely passing grade.) 
</P>
<P>
 Such a creative approach can yield surprising results. Take Los Angeles' 
notorious traffic. What if a high-speed computer analyzed information about 
each family in the Los Angeles Basin -- addresses, work locations, hobbies, 
tastes. Then it was asked to relocate families to homes where their commute 
times would be minimized. 
</P>
<P>
 Ok, so most people might not want to uproot. But if even a small fraction 
thought it was a good idea, traffic congestion in Los Angeles would improve 
dramatically.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; INSIGHTS; ABOUT THIS SECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First came the decline of the aerospace industry and the collapse of the real 
estate market. Then the litany of now all too familiar woes all pointing to the 
fading of a dream--riots, brush fires and, finally, the Northride quake of Jan. 
17, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, six months after the deadly temblor, the world is coming back into focus. 
Memories of quake and fire and riot are beginning to fade, as the seeds of 
optimism and renewed prosperity take root. Now comes perhaps the most vexing 
question of all: Where do we go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 13, The Times published an unusual special section called The Next Los 
Angeles, in which we challenged the experts to dream of a new city that had 
licked some of its most intractable problems. What would such a place look 
like? How would it run, be governed, produce jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 The answers were provocative. And they succeeded in sparking lively debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, The Times is publishing a second special section of The Next Los Angeles 
-- not about dreams, but about reality. Its purpose is to generate practical 
proposals aimed at solving tangible problems within a reasonable time frame and 
at an affordable cost to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 This time our reporters fanned out across the community to interview not only 
experts, but community activists and ordinary Angelenos who are making positive 
contributions and can offer useful perspectives on how to solve real-world 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea was simple: Elicit from each subject one specific step -- to take 
effect over the next two years -- that would significantly improve Los Angeles, 
whether it be about crime or culture, race relations or jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we asked the public to evaluate these and other proposals. The result are 
included in a special Times Poll. Finally, we compiled a special pull-out guide 
-- People Helping People -- listing ways people can get involved to better 
their community. 
</P>
<P>
 From this enterprise, some common themes emerged about Angelenos' attitudes 
toward this place and how it should change: 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, and the lure of possible greener pastures elsewhere, 
most people like it here. 
</P>
<P>
 The most fertile ground for change lies close to home -- the individual, the 
family, the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Big institutions can't be counted on to lead the way. Government, police and 
schools are financially strapped, and even in flush times, they are slow to 
change. Look for private sources of money and support, and proposals that rely 
on individual and family commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenge yourself and those around you to solving problems. Your idea may be 
just as good as the next person's--even better.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; THE PUBLIC'S VIEW; THE TIMES 
POLL; AN ENDURING OPTIMISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our optimism has always confounded the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay about Los Angeles in the depth of the Depression, novelist James 
M. Cain complained about bad food, nutty religions and economic stagnation. A 
"Gethsemane of woes," Cain wrote. Yet, to his consternation, he found the 
people behaving as if they were living in paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty years later, as they struggle through another round of misfortune, Los 
Angeles County residents are still in a surprisingly good mood. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Times Poll makes it clear that, despite all that has befallen Los 
Angeles in the last few years, most people have not slipped into a slough of 
despond, do not intend to pull up stakes and fully expect the economic picture 
to brighten fairly soon. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the poll, 78% of Los Angeles County residents said they are 
satisfied with the way things are going in their personal lives, and nearly 70% 
expressed similar sentiments about the communities in which they live. And 
although concerns about crime and joblessness continue to preoccupy many 
people, 67% said they feel safe and 66% said their personal finances are 
secure. Moreover, a majority of people surveyed predicted that the local 
economy will be on the mend in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, directed by John Brennan, interviewed 1,239 county residents 
between June 17 and 20. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus three 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the lucky ones who are upbeat about living in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of a month, Ronald, an unemployed aerospace engineer in 
Chatsworth, lost his job and part of his house when the earthquake struck. 
Almost 60 and beginning to run out of savings, Ronald worries that his job 
prospects aren't what they once were. But he has every expectation of bouncing 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll get a job doing something," said Ronald, who asked that his last name 
not be used. "Painting, wall papering, flipping burgers if it comes to that. 
We've got enough savings to get us through to the end of the year. So I guess 
we are kind of close to the hairy edge. But I've been laid off before, and I've 
never felt like we're going down the tubes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald agreed with a large majority of people surveyed -- 77% -- who said that 
their communities' most prized attributes, the things that drew them there in 
the first place, had not lost their value. 
</P>
<P>
 Proximity to work and the availability of affordable housing were the most 
oft-cited reasons people gave for choosing to live where they do. But when 
asked what was most appealing about their communities, the answers often had to 
do with the look and feel of a place: neighborhood peace and quiet, the 
climate, natural surroundings, parks and privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have everything here that other places only tend to have one of -- the 
mountains, the oceans and the climate," said Ronald. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other people surveyed, he places a high value on the people who live 
near him. What distinguishes them, he said, is "an attitude that they can make 
it on their own, that they don't need someone to hold their hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll found that as residents think about the future of their communities 
and how to make life better, they tend to place a heavier burden of 
responsibility on themselves than on government. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most said they believe that local government bears the greatest 
responsibility for reviving the economy and improving transportation, more 
people look to families and individuals than to government when it comes to 
making Los Angeles safer from crime and to raising the community's moral 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the parents have to teach the children what is right and what is 
wrong, rather than the school teaching them, or the television teaching them," 
said Tammy, who described herself as a 56-year-old housewife in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the way you live yourself as a family sets an example. To a large 
degree, the way you live your life, I believe, is what teaches your children," 
said Tammy, who did not wish to give her last name. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to recommending specific remedies for the city's economic, 
transportation and moral ills, people were not of one mind. However, a clearer 
consensus emerged when people were asked what they would do make Los Angeles a 
more livable place. The largest number of answers focused on hiring more police 
and sheriff's deputies and on cracking down on various types of illegal 
activities, including illegal immigration. Asked about illegal immigration in a 
separate question, 72%, including majorities of all four ethnic groups polled, 
said it is a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll asked county residents to rate the quality of life in their 
communities in a variety ways. More often than not, the answers were positive, 
although people living outside the Los Angeles city limits tended to be more 
enthusiastic than city dwellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost two-thirds of the people polled said Los Angeles is a good place to 
raise children. Sixty-three percent said race relations are good. About 60% 
rated public transportation as good. Almost three-fourths gave favorable 
ratings to local police and sheriff's departments. About 50% said local public 
schools are doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent steady stream of newcomers also implies a vote of confidence in Los 
Angeles. The youth, education and earning power of many of the new arrivals 
suggest that people on the way up still believe they can build productive lives 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than 10% of the county's adult population arrived here during 
the last five years. A majority -- 59% -- are younger than 30, 36% have college 
degrees and 34% have incomes of more than $40,000, the poll found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many people said they think families and individuals could do a 
better job than government at making things better in their communities, the 
poll results did not reflect a particularly high degree of community activism. 
</P>
<P>
 A bit less than half of the people surveyed said they take part in activities 
like charity work, neighborhood crime watches, parent teacher associations, 
local politics, church-sponsored activities, Scouts, youth sports or classroom 
volunteer work. However, just over 60% said they would be willing to devote a 
couple of hours a month to some form of volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, some of the people polled told reporters in follow-up interviews that 
they wanted to volunteer their time but cited age or ailing health or past 
failures as reasons why they aren't doing anything today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nellie Fisher of Torrance said she gave up in exasperation after trying for 
years, as the president of a senior citizen tenants' association, to persuade 
whites and Asian Americans to get together. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Asians started moving in, they didn't want to come in with us," 
Fisher said. "They had their own things, their own ethnic pot lucks, and they 
didn't want to mix in. They wave and are nice and friendly but seemed to want 
to keep their distance." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said that one of the things she prizes most about Los Angeles is its 
cultural diversity, but she said she is at a loss about how to promote social 
ties between groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher is not alone in her frustration. Although a majority said race 
relations are good in the county, many people were at a loss when asked to 
recommend one step that could be taken to promote racial harmony.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor was there a consensus among people who did offer recommendations for 
improving race relations. Sixteen percent said that local institutions should 
sponsor more cross-cultural programs; 12% called for an anti-bias curriculum in 
local schools and 12% said parents should do more to teach children tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, African Americans, the group with the highest rate of community 
activism -- 62% reported doing volunteer work of some sort -- were the most 
pessimistic about the state of their own lives and that of their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian Americans, on the other hand, reported the lowest rate of participation 
in community activities -- 34% -- while indicating the highest levels of 
satisfaction in their own lives -- 90% -- and in their communities -- 75%. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were exceptions to the ethnic trends. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Dean, who described herself as a middle-aged woman who lives alone on a 
monthly disability check, spoke of the stimulating life she has found as the 
only black occupant of a West Hollywood apartment complex full of Russian 
emigres who speak little English. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted decent housing, and this is where I came," said Dean, who moved from 
central Los Angeles two years ago. "It was a little hard at first. The 
neighbors didn't know what to make of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Dean found that Jewish Family Services would drive her to the doctor and 
the grocery store. And a bilingual girl in the building helped her communicate 
with her neighbors. She planted a garden for the first time. ("Where I used to 
live, the kids tore up all the plants," she said.)  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Dean has no desire to follow friends who have moved out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't escape the gangs or the natural disasters," she said. "I think you 
can make a quality life for yourself no matter where you are if you care 
enough, and I do care." 
</P>
<P>
 If the clear-headed optimism of people like Dean bodes well for the future of 
Los Angeles, there remains an undercurrent of discouragement. Twenty-three 
percent said they are strongly considering moving out of Los Angeles County in 
the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what are the most important problems facing their communities, people 
pointed to crime, gangs, drugs and unemployment, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 But for all those contemplating a better life somewhere else, there are many 
others held in place by the memories of better times. For such people, optimism 
is the stubborn refusal to give up on a place they used to love. 
</P>
<P>
 Living alone in an apartment near Hollywood and Vine, Evelyn Ewing waits for 
the day she can move back into the house in Beachwood Canyon where she lived 
since moving from Minnesota 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake that knocked her house down around her is just one of many 
things to which Ewing reacts with soldierly fortitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crime, the filth, the graffiti, the potholes. . . . You heard it all 
before," Ewing sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I think about leaving? Sure. I was offered a house at Leisure World, free. 
But I'm still here. I'm an upbeat sort of person. I'm a survivor." Satisfaction 
Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of economic recession and a series of epic disasters, residents of 
Los Angeles County are generally satisfied with where they live. The same is 
true of residents of the city of Los Angeles, although they are somewhat less 
positive about certain facets of Southland living. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite riots, fires and earthquakes, community satisfaction among county 
residents has not declined in the past two years. It remains lower than that 
measured nationally, however. Los Angeles County: 69% in 1994 Nation: 76% in 
1994 What People Like Most Quiet: 13% Good location: 11% The people: 11% 
Convenience: 9% Community spirit: 9% The climate: 8% Good neighbors: 8% 
Family/Friends: 7% Safety: 6% Natural beauty: 5% Community's Biggest Problems 
Crime: 34% Gangs: 31% Drugs: 12% Unemployment: 10% Poor schools, education: 7% 
Graffiti: 5% Homelessness, poverty: 4% Recession, the economy: 4% Too much 
growth, overpopulation: 3% Illegal immigrants: 3% How We See Our Community 
</P>
<P>
 COMMUTERS: Seven-in-10 county residents commute somewhere daily; 44% alone in 
the car, 15% in carpools, 6% by bus and 2% by train. The median average daily 
commute is 40 minutes both ways. Despite all the publicity they get, very few 
people have excessively long commutes: only 5% say they spend more than 2 hours 
on the road each day. 
</P>
<P>
 * TRAFFIC: Even among those who commute daily by car, most describe their 
community's traffic flow as good. NEIGHBORS: Half of whites in the county live 
in white neighborhoods, but the other half live either in mixed race or 
minority-dominated areas. Two-in-10 blacks live in Latino neighborhoods but 
just 1% of Latinos inhabit black sections. WORRIES: Drugs are a particular 
community problem for black county residents, gangs very much worry Latinos. 
ARRIVALS: Asians account for 10% of the county's total adult population. But a 
full quarter of those who have moved here in the last five years are of Asian 
background. UNDOCUMENTED: Asked if illegal immigration is a problem for the 
county, eight-in-10 whites and blacks say yes. But so do 71% of Asians and 54% 
of Latinos. OUTTA HERE: Most of those looking to leave the county want to move 
out of the state altogether. About 3-in-10 are looking to move elsewhere in 
southern California; just one-in-8 are northern California-bound. REASONS: 
Crime, more affordable housing and better work are the main reasons people give 
for wanting to move out of the county. LEAVING ANYWAY: Not everyone who wants 
to leave the county is unhappy. In fact more of would-be movers movers are 
satisfied with their current community than dissatisfied.  
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied: 55% 
</P>
<P>
 Dissatisfied: 43% GOOD DEEDS: The most common community activities for county 
residents are church-sponsored functions. Others include assisting in youth 
sports, classroom volunteer work and charity activities. TELECOMMUTING: When 
people were asked to volunteer ideas for improving transportation, virtually no 
one mentioned telecommuting -- encouraging people to work at or near home via 
computer. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,239 adult residents of Los Angeles County, by 
telephone, June 17 through 20. Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all 
exchanges in the county. Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that 
listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was conducted in 
English and Spanish. The sample was weighted slightly to conform with Census 
figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the 
total sample is plus or minus 3 percentage points. For certain subgroups, the 
error margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors, like the wording of questions and the order in which questions are 
presented.

<P>
 If Nathaniel Pique had been in high school two years ago, he would surely have 
been named the least likely to succeed. At 9, he worked for drug dealers. At 
16, his best friend was a .380-caliber automatic. At 18, he figured a 
4-year-old girl caught in gang cross-fire was "just in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 20-year-old who can say, "If I haven't done it, I've seen it done 
in front of me," is enrolled in community college and plans to graduate from a 
four-year school.  
</P>
<P>
 He credits his turnaround to the San Francisco-based Omega Boys Club, a 
nationally recognized youth organization that goes way beyond after-school 
basketball, offering job training, academic assistance and peer counseling to 
young African American men, ages 11 to 25, to stem the tide of drugs and 
violence in the inner city. The club's current budget is listed at $450,000, 
money raised from foundations, corporations and private donations, co-founder 
Joe Marshall said.  
</P>
<P>
 Pique first connected with Marshall, a former teacher, on the club's call-in 
radio show, "Street Soldiers," broadcast over commercial station KMEL-FM in San 
Francisco. The forum tries to reach gang members with straight talk about drugs 
and violence and to point the way out. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the program began a simulcast in Los Angeles on the first and third 
Mondays of the month at 10 p.m. over KBET-FM 92.3.  
</P>
<P>
 Pique said he called in as a joke, but: "They talked to me an hour and 30 
minutes. It hit me. No one ever came at me like they did. No one. It was 
basically: 'You're going to die or go to jail.' Then stuff started flashing 
before my eyes and I started getting worried about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pique dismantled his gun and started to attend weekly Omega meetings.  
</P>
<P>
 What impressed Pique most were the caring and dedication shown to him by 
Marshall and academic Director Margaret Norris. 
</P>
<P>
 He revisited his old neighborhood once, and his car was stolen at gunpoint by 
an old enemy. Unable to control his desire for revenge, he embarked with his 
former partners on a manhunt at midnight, leaving a message on the Omega 
answering machine: "The streets is where I belong, where I'm going to stay at." 
</P>
<P>
 As they drove around looking for the carjacker, Pique's pager sounded. "It was 
the Omega Boys Club number. At one o'clock in the morning.... They just kept 
paging me and paging me and paging me. So I turned it off. Fifteen minutes 
later, I turned it on. It was still going off. So I pulled over and called 
them. It was Miss Norris." 
</P>
<P>
 She gave him a new thought: "You cannot kill the enemy. You think you're 
killing him. It creates a new enemy for you. His brother, sister, mother, 
father, cousin, friends. Then they're going to try and kill you. And that 
creates a new enemy for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the Omega Club has helped finance the college educations of 108 young 
men and women from the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 Pique works at the club as a peer counselor, answering the hot line and 
writing letters to inmates. While he awaits admission to a college or 
university, he studies at the local community college, earning A's in the 
administration of justice.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to become what I always hated," he says. "A police officer."

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; VALUES; HOW DO YOU TEACH YOUR 
CHILD VALUES WHEN IT'S ON THE LIST WITH 'FIND ANOTHER JOB,' 'GET SOME SLEEP' 
AND 'DO THE LAUNDRY?'; SOLUTIONS; BALANCE CHILDREN'S ACTIVITY SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Reginald Clark, founder of the Montclair-based Reginald Clark and 
Associates and consultant to school districts nationwide on how to increase the 
success of low-achieving students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist Clark, 44, was born in Chicago, the oldest of five children in a 
family headed by a single mother, and grew up to earn two master's degrees and 
a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin. Because of his experience and 
observations, he questioned the prevailing wisdom that children's development 
and academic success could be explained by family structure, economics or 
whether their mothers worked. He came to believe that those who succeeded were 
more active than those who failed and that the successful ones also received 
the support of active networks of adults in their schools and neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark calls for programs to give children a "balanced activity schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 They are awake 90 to 100 hours a week, in school 30 hours a week and have 
roughly 70 more hours to fill. At least 35 of those hours should be spent in 
"high-yield activities" that can be applied later to schoolwork: studying, 
homework, reading, writing, hobbies, lessons, working on computers or visiting 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
 Two to five hours should be devoted to chores or volunteer-type activities 
that promote responsibility. The other time can be spent in activity that 
nurtures body, mind and spirit: eating, hygiene, free play, watching TV, 
hanging out with friends, shopping for fun, playing, daydreaming, meditating, 
praying. 
</P>
<P>
 In studies, Clark found that youngsters who score at or above national norms 
spend half their free time on constructive activities. But adult networks are 
critical to support them. 
</P>
<P>
 To build up that network in a certain school district, his assistants help 
build relationships between educators and students. They may help teachers 
understand their biases and stereotypes about the parents of low-achieving 
students or help them manage children's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 They also help link the students to other adults in the neighborhood who can 
serve as mentors, coaches or tutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other child advocates, he encourages the buildup of programs like 
youth clubs, reading programs in libraries and after-school enrichment programs 
in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Two schools in Pasadena that used Clark's model saw dramatic results, rising 
from among the lowest-scoring schools to the top for their income bracket, he 
said. His model is being implemented in Bakersfield and five neighborhoods in 
Nashville, Tenn.  
</P>
<P>
 School districts can implement such programs at relatively low cost. And 
private funding sources can be tapped for teacher and parent training programs 
and to help underwrite after-school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is where the family leaves off, other adults have to pick up 
and ensure that the student does get that access to 30 hours a week or more of 
constructive activity. . . . It's do-able. It's just a matter of having the 
insight and the will."

 'Tis all in pieces, all coherence gone. -- John Donne, 1611  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the commuter train from downtown Los Angeles to Irvine the other day, a man 
said to the stranger next to him: "A lot of people are killing their families 
now. What's the deal?" 
</P>
<P>
 Haven't most of us had a moment when we considered events from the past few 
years and wondered -- however fleetingly because the thought is so profoundly 
unsettling -- whether civilization is unraveling? And asked ourselves what the 
deal is. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the horrific details of some children coldbloodedly gunning down 
their parents, police officers or other children. Or the images of our 
neighbors setting fires and arming themselves against looters after the Rodney 
G. King verdicts. Or reports of children laughing at movie portrayals of the 
Holocaust or, perhaps more chillingly, at scenes of cruelty designed by some of 
our other neighbors to make them laugh. ("The Terminator:" "Consider this a 
divorce.")  
</P>
<P>
 It might have been the shock of the genial-appearing sports legend O.J. 
Simpson standing accused of murdering his former wife and her friend. Or 
perhaps it happened in your own home when your 10-year-old mentioned she would 
feel safer if she had a gun in her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Are provocative solutions to our social problems being proposed around "family 
values"? 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dan Quayle, the term family values has become a joke ("Addams Family 
Values," "Trump Family Values"). The Los Angeles County Children's Planning 
Council, like other panels attempting to pin down the causes of our current 
problems, came up with poverty, violence, substance abuse and racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers might add biology, saying violent environments produce 
chemical changes that can be inherited. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many from the left, the right and the "extreme center" do not apologize 
when they say the deal basically is that children today experience a pathetic 
lack of meaningful contact with caring adults. 
</P>
<P>
 An array of public opinion polls has shown that most people agree. What they 
usually mean, though, is, "Not in our own homes, of course, because everything 
there is fine, thank you, but the problem is in the homes of those other 
people. And in the schools." 
</P>
<P>
 But when you go out and talk to people about our moral crisis, you find some 
palpable differences these days. 
</P>
<P>
 One is that there appears to be less moralizing and less blame being passed 
around. People now are calling for personal responsibility, not just from 
"them" but from "us." As parents, they say, let's not lie to our children; as 
teachers, let's not fear instilling core values; as neighbors, let's volunteer 
to help children separated from their parents. Let's all do better to support 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 But answers are elusive as to how we get there from here. How can you teach 
values to your 2-year-old or to the neighbor's troubled adolescent when it's on 
the "to-do" list somewhere between find another job, get some sleep, lose 15 
pounds and do the laundry? The answer: We do the best we can. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping social and cultural solutions are often heartfelt and have the ring 
of common sense. But with notable exceptions, they are rarely supported by 
empirical evidence that they can change behavior on a large scale. If they ever 
get put into practice, it's usually because of a leap of faith by a private 
foundation. More realistic may be the small steps, the changes individuals and 
families and communities make in their immediate worlds. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the minority opinion that we may be over-reacting. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Astroth, a Montana State University youth specialist, observes that in 
every decade since the 1930s, elders have said young people are out of control. 
In fact, he argues, today's teen-agers are better educated, healthier and more 
responsible than teen-agers of the past. Even among those who grow up in 
vulnerable environments, Astroth maintains that the great majority do not 
develop self-destructive patterns of behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 It might be worthwhile taking a look at them, he suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, young people and those working closest to the trenches seem to be 
among the least depressed about the future. Generation Xers on a computer 
bulletin board say the biggest problem in society today is reporters and other 
adults who ask stupid questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, as psychologist and sociologist Carolyn Reid-Green observed, 
pessimism is ultimately pointless because it closes doors to solutions. There 
are plenty of people doing fine work with children and families, she said. 
"It's just not enough."

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; VALUES; HOW DO YOU TEACH YOUR

AND 'DO THE LAUNDRY?'; SOLUTIONS; CREATE A 'YOUTH CHARTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Damon 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: William Damon, 49, director of the Center for Human Development and 
professor of education at Brown University in Providence, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed by the decaying moral climate for youth in the last two generations, 
Damon has started speaking to parent groups, schools, churches and other 
community organizations, hoping to convey his sense of urgency about raising 
standards in the home, the school and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon proposes building a "youth charter" of common moral values among 
parents, teachers and communities so that young people run into the same high 
expectations of behavior wherever they go. Most people can agree that they want 
children to be kind, decent, honest, respectful, fair and responsible. The best 
way for adults to instill these character values in children is to model them 
and to move beyond blame to support one another. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his projects is an after-school program in which trained teachers 
involve 4- to 6-year-olds in serious long-term projects, like building a 
playground or publishing a community newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than trying to protect children by isolating them from perceived 
dangers, adults need to work with the community to provide safer activities, 
Damon argues. The most powerful method of teaching morality for teachers or 
parents is the most difficult: an honest relationship. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of implementing a local youth charter depend on the local 
conditions. Devastated areas may need federal funds to build up quality 
after-school programs. In other places, it's more a question of attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any opposition, it might come from those who believe that equal 
distribution of resources would make more of a change. QUOTE: 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to take responsibility for their neighbor's children. The 
problems are only solvable by getting right down to the place where the rubber 
meets the road, where grown-ups are making contact with kids. Until people do 
that, kids will be drifting around causing themselves and the community a lot 
of trouble." William Damon

By Wade F. Horn 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Wade F. Horn, 39, director of the new National Fatherhood Initiative, 
based in Lancaster, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn believes that most social problems -- crime, drugs, violence, welfare 
dependency, teen-age pregnancy, educational failure -- are linked to the 
absence of fathers. He believes that the best way to increase support for 
parents and achieve cultural change is to change attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn wants men to understand that their place is in the home, both physically 
and emotionally. He is working on a media campaign and producing public service 
announcements and a catalogue of educational materials to underscore two 
points: Fathers provide something unique and irreplaceable, and men are much 
more likely to be responsible fathers in the context of legal and committed 
marriages. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn says employers need to support fathers by giving them time off to be 
involved at school or take care of ill children. 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's initiative parallels government experiments in several cities, 
including Los Angeles, to reduce welfare costs by identifying fathers of 
newborns in the hospital and encouraging them to take more active roles in the 
lives of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Horn's ideas are in short supply in many families and may be difficult to 
implement on a large scale. Some feminists contend that encouraging men to 
return to the home will only make conditions worse for women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 With a first-year budget of $400,000 provided by private foundations, Horn has 
enough money to fund a national summit on fatherhood planned in Dallas in the 
fall and to put out a catalogue of materials on fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative has hired a community organizer to build a coalition of local 
community groups, starting this summer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "If a man chooses to father children, to me it means three things. He needs to 
spend time with his children. Not quality time. Quantity time. He needs to be 
committed to his children and committed to his children's mother. And he needs 
to feel responsible for the child's well-being and socialization. That's what 
being a real man is to me." Wade F. Horn

<TEXT>
<P>
 MYTH: Teen-age pregnancies are soaring.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Sexual activity rates have risen, but the pregnancy rate among 
sexually active teen-agers actually fell 19% between 1972 and 1990. The trend 
shows that teen-agers have become more successful in preventing pregnancy over 
the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Teen-agers are fathering the babies born to teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: In 1990, in 23% of the births to a school-age parent, the partner was 
also of school age. In 69% of such births, the mother was of school age and the 
father was older. In fact, men older than 25 caused more births among teen-age 
mothers than did boys 10 to 18. In California, men older than 25 father around 
12,000 babies born to teen-age mothers every year; nationally, they father more 
than 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Teen-age suicides have skyrocketed over the last 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Although teen-age suicides rose 118% between 1970 and 1989 in the 
rest of the country, they dropped 16% in Los Angeles County, which has one of 
the lowest rates in the country. All suicides in L.A. County dropped 48% from 
1970 to 1992, a phenomenon attributed partly to changing demographics: People 
of other races do not commit suicide as often as whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Out-of-wedlock births are a modern phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: America's founding fathers were not always married: In Concord, 
Mass., a bastion of Puritan tradition, a third of children born during the 20 
years before the American Revolution were conceived out of wedlock; during the 
1780s and 1790s, a third of the brides in rural New England were pregnant when 
they married. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: The 1950s were an era of sexual restraint, abstinence and deferred 
gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Teen-age birth rates soared in the 1950s and have not been equaled 
since. But childbirth was linked more to marriage then. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: No one has time, and society's problems are too big for individuals to 
make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Each of the following actions can be accomplished in less than five 
minutes:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Call a candidate's headquarters and ask for his or her position statement 
on children, violence, family values and education. Call the mayor's office or 
the White House Public Opinion line: (202) 456-1111. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Call the Campaign for Kids TV at (202) 628-2620 and request a free packet 
on monitoring the Children's Television Act. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Call or write teachers to applaud when they do something inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Donate books to elementary schools or public libraries.

 Los Angeles residents are victimized by crime 40 times an hour. Drive-by 
killings, serial child molesters, even a young girl's body entombed in a 
concrete-filled trash bin have become a part of this city's landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seeking to make Los Angeles safe clearly have an unenviable, perhaps 
impossible, task -- and no shortage of advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of crime dominates conversation. Even recent statistics showing some 
crimes on the decline have failed to derail the public's obsession with the 
topic. From that continuous debate have arisen thousands of heartfelt 
solutions, most of them unworkable, unpalatable or at least unaffordable. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental question: How can 7,600 Los Angeles police officers hope to 
shield more than 3.5 million people from murder, mayhem and the theft of their 
mag wheels? The simple answer: They cannot do the job alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest buzzword in public safety is "community-based policing," a notion 
nearly universally embraced by criminologists and police chiefs. By definition, 
the concept recognizes that police alone can't do job; we need to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, crime is a national problem that cannot be solved in the microcosm. 
Cracking down on guns and drugs and addressing the root causes of violence -- 
including poverty -- can hardly be tackled city by city or block by block. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the public has become acutely aware, after living through riots and 
natural disasters, that neither can individuals stand by and wait for society's 
greater ills to be cured, especially when the likelihood is that they never 
will be. 
</P>
<P>
 That is where the simplicity of community-based policing appeals. Neighborhood 
Watch is the most common and time-honored example, but increasing interaction 
between police and the people they are paid to protect can occur in less 
traditional ways. In Los Angeles this has meant Spanish classes for police 
officers, neighborhood police stations, citizen advisory councils and cops 
walking their beats. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the country, community-based policing is in vogue, but its vague 
definition has led to widely varying applications and to some successes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Columbia, S.C., city-sponsored mortgage breaks for police officers have 
helped 12 of them -- 5% of the force -- move back to the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Waterloo, Iowa, a couple organized their community to turn a closed bar 
into a recreation and arts center for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Cleveland, neighborhood activists joined with police to drive drug 
dealers off a vacant lot, then worked with city housing officials to get houses 
built there. 
</P>
<P>
 Such diverse solutions to local problems illustrate some of the ways Los 
Angeles residents could get involved in increasing public safety, their 
participation limited only by their imaginations and abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims' rights advocates think we should fight for stiffer sentences for 
violent criminals; those who work with adolescents say we should concentrate on 
counseling youth before violence becomes a lifestyle; urban planners talk of 
designing buildings and parks where people can both feel and be safer; police 
officials say that if we could only provide them with better technology, street 
cops would become more efficient and have more time to spend on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 These suggestions are not revelations to even the most casual student of 
crime-prevention techniques, but they share an attribute more important than 
novelty: All are within reach, depending only on political will and public and 
private money. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of those closely involved with recommendations that followed the Los 
Angeles riots, such down-to-earth proposals offer hope that the rush to 
community-based policing will be more than a knee-jerk reaction to that 
uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see community-based policing really being played out in the years to come 
-- a police force that is very decentralized in many ways, with communities 
buying into the Police Department the way many do with fire departments," said 
Gil Ray, who was the lead staff attorney for the Christopher Commission. "What 
I don't know is if that's the future or the past; it's almost going back to 
beat policing."

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; PUBLIC SAFETY; CAN WE AGREE 
ON DOWN-TO-EARTH STEPS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY-BASED POLICING ACTUALLY WILL 
WORK?; SOLUTIONS; ORGANIZE GRAFFITI PAINT-OUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Chris Rios, 23, a member of the Barrio Van Nuys gang who has been 
participating in gang truce meetings since October. Rios was first arrested at 
age 11 and has spent most of his life in trouble with the law, including a 
conviction for attempted murder. He was shot and seriously wounded two years 
ago while trying to steal a car. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of community-based policing is a feeling of safety, and feeling 
safe begins with everyone getting out and getting involved -- including gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Rios, community-based policing initially meant more hassles. As police 
ventured into his neighborhood, Rios -- his head shaved, his pants baggy -- 
found himself being stopped more frequently for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last October, Rios began attending peace treaty meetings aimed at Latino 
gangs in the east San Fernando Valley, organized by Williams (Blinky) 
Rodriguez, who runs a boxing gym in Van Nuys. At first Rios was motivated by 
curiosity, along with the desire to protect his turf if a gang war happened to 
erupt afterward. Later, some of what he heard started to make sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was so negative, I said, 'This is not going to last. . . . Before 
this is over, I'm going to end up killing five of my enemies.' Then I started 
thinking that if we unite our race together, people will start thinking we can 
do something. It will open people's minds that we are not the lost race." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez first raised the idea of organizing paint-outs during one of the 
treaty meetings. His reasoning was that it would give gang members something 
constructive to do and that if they toiled to erase graffiti, they would be 
less likely to replace it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios thought it sounded silly, but as time went on he became a convert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that it was a quality-of-life issue and a pride issue and a 
beautification issue, a lot of things," he said. "Graffiti terrorizes people." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of Rios' fellow gang members received his transformation eagerly; some 
called him a rat for talking to police. And he has no illusions that covering 
up graffiti in itself can stem violence, although he does think it makes people 
less fearful about leaving their homes, which in turn makes the neighborhood 
safer. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly a month of planning, Rios and about 30 of his homeboys gathered 
on a Van Nuys street corner one Saturday in May. They were met there by several 
police officers carrying paint and brushes -- Rios says proudly that he felt 
respected by the officers because they left their uniforms home. 
</P>
<P>
 Four hours and many gallons of paint later, a badly scribbled 10-square-block 
area was graffiti-free. Residents of many of the vandalized houses and 
apartments picked up brushes and joined in the effort, working side by side 
with the vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elderly people came out to see what we were doing," Rios said. "Some of them 
I've never seen come out at all. . . . It made me feel good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: Better than 50-50 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest challenge would be motivating gang members to become involved in 
their neighborhoods in this constructive way. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the paint-out, Rios said he has been approached by leaders of several 
other San Fernando Valley gangs who are interested in cleaning up their own 
neighborhoods, but spreading the word beyond his contacts probably would 
require the assistance of gang counselors and community outreach workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost would be minimal if the gangs agreed, because the only real expense would 
be buying paint. And it could take effect immediately. 
</P>

who, let's not write it on the wall."

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; PUBLIC SAFETY; CAN WE AGREE 
ON DOWN-TO-EARTH STEPS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY-BASED POLICING ACTUALLY WILL 
WORK?; SOLUTIONS; ENFORCE MINIMUM SENTENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Arnold Heilemann, vice president of Justice for Homicide Victims, a 
group he joined after his 15-year-old son, Clinton, was killed in a Pacific 
Palisades parking lot by a transient armed with an assault rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many victims' relatives, Heilemann advocates strict enforcement of 
minimum sentences for violent offenders, to keep them in prison longer and thus 
prevent them from endangering the public's safety.The problem, he says, is not 
so much that sentences are too short but that often the terms are cut 
drastically if the convict behaves in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike trendy efforts to lengthen criminal sentences, like the so-called Three 
Strikes provision, such truth-in-sentencing proposals are not new or unusual. 
But they do have the potential for quick results. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforcing minimum sentences could begin almost immediately, if proposed state 
legislation were passed. But the major hitch, Heilemann concedes, is getting 
state legislators to pass those laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Corrections recently estimated that the proposal could 
cost more than $100 million, although supporters say such estimates do not 
account for the savings that would be accrued by preventing felons from 
committing other crimes.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; PUBLIC SAFETY; CAN WE AGREE 
ON DOWN-TO-EARTH STEPS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITY-BASED POLICING ACTUALLY WILL 
WORK?; SOLUTIONS: TEACH TEENS ABOUT VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Leah Aldridge, project director at the Los Angeles Commission on 
Assaults Against Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Serious attacks can be prevented simply by helping teens understand the roots 
of violence against women at the moment in their lives when they are forming 
their first romantic liaisons, Aldridge says. 
</P>
<P>
 Disturbed by surveys showing that at least 10% of high school students have 
experienced violence in their dating relationships, she developed a workshop 
about rape and battery. Last year she began taking it to counseling and 
recreation centers and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-part workshop aims at educating teen-agers about battery and rape in 
relationships, teaching boys why it is unacceptable behavior and girls how to 
resist it. 
</P>
<P>
 It relies heavily on developing rapport with teen-agers and communicating with 
them in the language of their culture. In one innovative exercise, Aldridge 
asks teens to recite lyrics from their favorite songs, to really listen to what 
they are saying, then to determine whether the relationships described in the 
songs are healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the kids today have a lot of notions about putting their partner in 
check, regulating her," Aldridge said. "There's even a rap song about 
regulating called 'Regulate.' I tell them, 'What that boils down to is 
disciplining your partner. That's where violence begins."' REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 This already is working on a small scale. But money remains a hurdle. 
Aldridge's three-year project, which calls for disseminating information to 
more than 300 centers, clubs and schools and training 25 teachers, is financed 
by a $43,000 grant from the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning. Taking 
it districtwide would cost far more. 
</P>
<P>
 The major obstacle to expanding the program might not be finding funds but 
convincing school and district administrators of the program's value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem you face is you tell an administrator, 'I want to come in and 
talk about rape.' And they say, 'Oh, we don't have that problem here,' " she 
said.

WORK?; SOLUTIONS; BRING COPS HOME, ARM THEM WITH BETTER TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Allan Parachini, public affairs director for the American Civil 
Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 When Parachini set out to map where Los Angeles police live, he expected to 
prove the commonly held belief that many of them live far from the 
neighborhoods they patrol. But even he was surprised at the percentages: More 
than four-fifths of members of the force live outside city limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in this city knew that a majority of the cops didn't live here," he 
said. "But I have to say that when I got through with the calculator and saw 
83.1%, I was surprised myself. I did the calculations again." 
</P>
<P>
 The report summarizing his findings outlined several possible solutions, 
including offering the enticement of low- and zero-interest mortgage loans to 
officers willing to move into the city. It recommends greater financial rewards 
-- perhaps even bonuses -- for those who move to high-crime areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Persuading officers to move to the city would make officers more aware of the 
needs and problems of the city, based on personal experience. And city 
residents would gain a more balanced view of law enforcement by having cops as 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Parachini believes that private lenders would respond to "jaw-boning by the 
mayor" and other politicians and community leaders, perhaps even agreeing to 
offer interest rate reductions without requiring any financial contribution 
from the city. Banks gain positive publicity by becoming lenders to the 
officers. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 This in an innovative idea, but costs could be a big obstacle. A pioneer 
program of interest breaks for cops, started four years ago in Columbia, S.C., 
has drawn 13 officers -- about 5% of that city's small force -- into the city. 
There, the city subsidizes half the 4% loan and no down payment is required. 
Still, questions linger about whether such a program would work in larger, 
financially strapped cities like Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Bruce Ramm, a former City of Orange police officer who started a 
consulting company in 1987 to advise planners and architects on ways to improve 
security in their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 First described in a 1972 book about public housing, the concept of defensible 
space boils down to designing safer buildings and parks. The idea is not to 
build fortresses, Ramm said, but instead to create open spaces that allow users 
or tenants to see each other -- and any potential criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, this kind of subtle opening up and protecting should happen during 
the design process, but some improvements are possible -- though usually more 
expensive -- for finished buildings. Ramm advocates getting law enforcement 
experts involved in residential and commercial development projects at their 
inception. Here is a look at how the more relaxed and aesthetic concept of 
"open fences" could be used in the community of tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 * REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Some city council members already are interested in defensible space, although 
so far they have shied away from the suggestion that it be required through 
planning and zoning ordinances. The cost of such a requirement would be minimal 
for the cities, but developers complain that they would have to spend more and 
that they cannot afford to, particularly during a recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes could take effect quickly if individual neighborhoods decide on their 
own to work with local law enforcement agencies on a plan for creating 
defensible space. But changes could be very slow -- or not happen at all -- if 
they depend on elected bodies passing new ordinances and zoning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of misperceptions about this -- a bar-on-the-window or Ft. 
Knox idea. It's by no means that. If anything, we're telling people to knock 
down some fences, open it up." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruce Ramm 
</P>
<P>
 * DEFENDING YOUR SPACE 
</P>
<P>
 * Erect passive barriers, such as low-lying rail fences or bushes, to define 
private areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Highlight walkways for maximum visibility from street and emphasize the 
transition from public to private space through gateways, porches, ornamental 
stairs and stoops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cluster small groups of homes to encourage close contact with neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain grounds to minimize hiding places. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orient buildings and floor plans to increase visibility of entry ways from 
within living area, especially kitchen. DRAWING THE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Public space: A common area that is used by the public, like the sidewalk and 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Transitional space: A walkway, porch or driveway. An area that bridges public 
and private space. 
</P>
<P>
 Private space: The living area of an apartment or house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Open fences: Plants and low railings for fences give buildings a practical and 
aesthetic protection from intruders. These barriers must look natural and not 
exceed six feet in height. Tall, solid fences give intruders a place to hide 
and obscure the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood watch: Every entrance to a home must be visible from within as 
well as across the street. The visibility can discourage potential intruders 
from attempting a break in.

 FROM: William F. Russell, commanding officer for the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Support Services Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department lags far behind private industry in 
technology and is even eclipsed by many smaller police departments.It has an 
antiquated mainframe system that allows almost no electronic interaction and a 
scattering of personal computers -- many of them donated to the department -- 
that can be used only as word processors because they are not interconnected. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most police reports are written in longhand and photocopied at 
least 16 times for departmentwide distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell wants to bring all 18 geographic police divisions on line with an 
interactive computer system called LAN, the Local Area Network, with emphasis 
on shrinking the time detectives spend on paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction of paperwork would have the benefit of increasing time officers 
could spend on the street. Russell said he wants to target detectives with the 
first wave of computers because he believes some quick and obvious gains could 
be made in their ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detectives spend from 40% to 60% of their time processing paper," Russell 
said. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 Financing is the only thing preventing LAN from being installed tomorrow. 
Estimates for a bare-bones system stretch toward $3 million. But Russell said 
he is confident that an effort by the mayor's office to obtain corporate 
donations will be successful and that the system will be in use within two 
years.

 The 1980s transformed Southern California into a racial and ethnic 
smorgasbord, a community rich with colors and accents. Whites continued to move 
out to the edges of the map, blacks began to leave inner-city areas in record 
numbers, and Latinos and Asians appeared virtually everywhere. The truths of 
our recent past have become the myths of our present: South Central is not 
black; Orange County is no longer white; Koreatown is only 30% Asian. But this 
seeming integration has not meant the death of segregation, for while these 
ethnic groups live in ever-closer proximity there is no guarantee that they 
like it. "High diversity in a (census) tract does not imply that the different 
populations are socially or residentially mixed," according to Eugene Turner 
and James P. Allen, professors in the Cal State Northridge geography department 
who put together an atlas showing changes in population patterns in 
metropolitan Los Angeles and Orange counties between 1980 and 1990. Ethnic 
Salad, Lightly Tossed 
</P>
<P>
 Many communities experienced dramatic changes in their ethnic diversity during 
the decade. In general, the areas with the sharpest increases lost the most 
whites and gained the most minorities. Ritzy San Marino and upper-income 
Arcadia were definitely not the picture of diversity in 1980, but gained a 
sizable Asian population during the decade. Blacks, Asians and Latinos moved to 
Covina and West Covina, greatly increasing the diversity of those communities. 
Downey, Bellflower, north Long Beach, Anaheim and Garden Grove saw similar 
diversity gains. Areas that decreased in diversity, such as Vernon, South Gate 
and Santa Ana, experienced a jump in a single ethnic group, usually Latinos. 
The change in diversity was determined by calculating each tract's "diversity 
index" for 1980 and 1990, and then subtracting the earlier index from the later 
one. Higher positive scores indicate increasing diversity while higher negative 
scores indicate decreasing diversity. Landscape of Diversity 
</P>
<P>
 The decade took a diverse region and made it even more so. This map of the 
relative diversity of each Census tract shows a patchwork of communities 
throughout Los Angeles and Orange counties where whites, blacks, Latinos, 
Asians and American Indians rub elbows. But the index also shows that large 
chunks of ethnic clustering remain, populated by whites, blacks or Latinos. 
Asians tend to be scattered across the map. The diversity index (also dubbed 
the entropy index) measures how equally the different groups are represented. 
The higher the number, the greater the diversity. White Flight in Action 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, whites increasingly moved to the 'burbs and beyond. Growth 
occurred primarily in areas of new middle- or upper-income housing developments 
or recent Soviet or Iranian immigrant settlements. Clusters of note include 
Glendale, the southern San Fernando Valley, the Westside, Long Beach, the east 
San Gabriel Valley, Irvine and south Orange County. Whites are the only ethnic 
group studied whose numbers are shrinking, thanks to migration, a low birth 
rate and high average age. During the decade, the Anglo population declined in 
Los Angeles County by more than 330,000 and increased in Orange County by only 
44,000. Goodby South Central; Hello Everywhere 
</P>
<P>
 The region's African-American population became less concentrated during the 
'80s, moving away from inner-city areas such as South Central, Compton and 
Watts and dispersing widely. On a smaller scale, the same thing happened in 
Pacoima, Pasadena, Monrovia, Pomona and Long Beach. That Latin Look 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980s saw an increase of more than 1.5 million Latinos in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Although new arrivals, primarily from Mexico and Central 
America, contributed to the jump, a high birth rate was equally important. Many 
settled in the traditional enclaves of Boyle Heights, East Los Angeles and 
Pico-Union. But large numbers moved elsewhere, including into predominantly 
black areas such as South Central Los Angeles, Lennox and Inglewood. An Asian 
Explosion 
</P>
<P>
 Asian growth was widespread and huge -- more than doubling during the 1980s -- 
largely because of immigration. There was some clustering of growth in 
Koreatown, northeast Los Angeles, the east San Gabriel Valley and Cerritos, as 
well as noted concentrations of Cambodians in Long Beach and Vietnamese in 
Santa Ana and the Little Saigon area of Westminster. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Methodology: The maps produced by Turner and Allen, reproduced here, were 
based on U.S. Census data from 1980 and 1990. The maps are divided into census 
tracts with a freeway grid and place names added to provide landmarks. To 
express an area's racial and ethnic mix, the authors used a formula that yields 
an index of diversity; the higher the number, the more equally the groups are 
represented within a tract. Thus, simply replacing white residents with Asians, 
for example, would not make an area more diverse. Diversity requires an 
increase in the array of racial and ethnic groups in an area, according to the 
work, titled "An Atlas of Population Patterns in Metropolitan Los Angeles and 
Orange Counties 1980-1990." (To get a copy, send a $10 check, payable to the

</P>

 FROM: Genethia H. Hayes, Lucky Altman and Corey Madden. Hayes, 50, is 
assistant executive director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 
Los Angeles and director of its Project Ahead. Altman, 53, is a Catholic lay 
worker who coordinates adult human relations programs for the National 
Conference in Los Angeles. Madden, 34, is associate producing director at the 
Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles who is producing "Bandido!" a new play by Luis 
Valdez, and has previously produced, among others, a work by Culture Clash, a 
Latino comedy group, and Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los Angeles 1992," 
about the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes disputes the pervasive idea that relations between people of different 
races are a problem. Rather, she argues that they represent an opportunity for 
human development. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposes that Angelenos should take responsibility for their own 
attitudes. They should question stereotypes and stop blaming other people for 
their problems. She says these are the steps toward true freedom, which can be 
terrifying but ultimately very rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes says her proposal, which applies to people of all races, starts with 
self-examination and reflection. She suggests people get to the root of their 
prejudices by figuring out where their images of different races comes from. If 
they see news photographs of criminal suspects, for example, does that mean 
that all people of that race are potential criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 "And if you are a minority and you decide that all policeman are like the ones 
who beat Rodney King, and then that all white people are nefarious and that 
there is a conspiracy to keep black people down and out, then I think you are a 
loser too," Hayes says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people refuse to be limited by prejudice, Hayes says, they can give other 
people the dignity they deserve. One group of people would not be expected to 
fit in to another's cultural mold. This would allow a sort of racial and ethnic 
detente. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman sees a the biggest problem in human relations as a lack of honest 
interaction, which comes from people's inability to listen beyond their own 
racial and cultural framework and their tendency to rush to judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 She proposes that people cultivate relationships in which they have honest 
relationships with people who are different than they are. 
</P>
<P>
 As a practical first step, Altman suggests that people take a sheet of paper 
and write down the name of the group that they are most uncomfortable with. 
Then, without censoring themselves, they should write the words that come to 
mind. Next, figure out the source of the images: media, family, work 
interaction. Families can do this exercise together, then decide if this is a 
group they want to learn more about. 
</P>
<P>
 Madden says Angelenos should try to defeat the isolating aspects of this city. 
She says they should put themselves "in the way of an experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Madden believes that people must build understanding, not assume that it will 
come automatically. Attending a new concert, joining a community group or a 
church are just some ways that people might start building understanding with 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living is a struggle," she says. "The fact that we are struggling with each 
other is probably a sign of life and not defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 She mentions how, during a disaster, people tend to work together regardless 
of the color of the skin or the language they speak because they recognize 
their common needs. The same might be translated to everyday life. REALITY 
CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 The keys to these ideas are individual initiative and making people understand 
why such efforts are in their best interests. These steps can be taken at no 
public cost and, in theory at least, can show results immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 But progress is hard to measure. Education -- through the media, in schools, 
on the job -- is essential, and so is creativity. But there must be a 
commitment by the community to take the necessary steps. Elected officials and 
community, religious and business leaders mus provide leadership.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; HUMAN RELATIONS; WILL LOS

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Mother Altagracia Perez, as she's called in high Episcopal, came to 
Los Angeles just over a month ago to minister to this city's spiritual needs, 
special-ordered from above, bearing enthusiasm and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 She laughs a lot, with a kind of gusto that puffs up her cheeks and crinkles 
her eyes. "The things about me that were seen as a problem before are now seen 
as an asset in Los Angeles," she says, letting you in with her smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Polite company doesn't usually talk about such things in this wildly 
multicultural Los Angeles, 1994. Or at least it doesn't talk across cultural 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 These are such things as skin color (Perez's is black), and language (she 
speaks Spanish and English) and culture (hers is Dominican-Puerto Rican-South 
Bronx). Polite company is too scared to talk about such things, or too angry, 
or indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
 Polite company is making a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez can see this in her church, St. Phillip's Episcopal in South-Central Los 
Angeles, which offers a take on the problems -- and opportunities -- of the 
city as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Phillip's was the first black parish west of the Mississippi in the 
history of the Episcopal church. But that was because the white church wouldn't 
have their kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 80% of St. Phillip's parishioners are Latino. And Perez says the black 
members have come to resent what they see as the takeover of their church, a 
safe place that was uniquely their own. "Eventually, it got to feel like a 
competition between groups," the reverend mother says. 
</P>
<P>
 So Perez, 32, has rolled up her sleeves and begun breaking down walls. What 
she's found are bridges that have been obscured by years of misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know that black Latinos were among the founders of Nuestra Senora la 
Reina de Los Angeles, otherwise known as L.A.? Or that Mexican President Benito 
Juarez refused to turn over runaway American slaves to their owners in the 
United States? The congregation of St. Phillip's knows: Perez has made sure to 
spread the word. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in the baby steps right now," she says of her church in transition. 
"We are learning how to dialogue with each other." 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles, too, needs to talk and, more important, listen to the 
different voices that make up the city now. Listening can transform. Hearing 
merely registers noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The voices of Los Angeles are angry, cynical, anxious and afraid. But other 
strains are enthusiastic and optimistic: The entire nation is looking west. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Los Angeles create a model of vitality by shaping common goals or 
disintegrate into a modern-day Babel, with each group realizing too late that 
isolation doesn't lead to heaven but can indeed lead to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Good intentions are hardly enough to ensure a harmonious future for L.A. 
"Can't we all get along?" is too simplistic a scold for even children now. The 
real question, of course, is how? 
</P>
<P>
 No 12-step program, court-ordered desegregation project, affirmative action 
plan or college scholarship program offers a magic cure for inequality, racism 
and fear. Resentment and violence have become part of the equation too. 
</P>
<P>
 Integration, mostly in the limited arenas of the classroom and on the job, has 
brought only piecemeal success. A minority of citizens believes that 
segregation is the way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken as a whole, the problems can overwhelm, suffocating initiative and 
excusing indifference as a reasonable choice. It is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, people in Los Angeles are taking steps -- often unnoticed beyond 
the neighborhood, the synagogue, the workplace -- to make bettering human 
understanding anything but trite. History has taught us that harmony cannot be 
legislated. It starts small and builds from there. It is a journey that opens 
minds and changes hearts. Children are often excellent guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Genethia Hayes, assistant executive director at the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference in Los Angeles, tells the story of a little girl, 
fair-haired with big blue eyes, who trailed her and her husband down the aisles 
of a grocery store in Bear Valley, mesmerized by what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes bent down to talk to her and the little girl, not much beyond 2, rested 
the palms of her hands against Hayes' cheeks. "But you're not warm!" the child 
exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Hayes told her she was right, the little girl said the color of her skin 
looked just like the warm cookies that her mother took from the oven. And 
Hayes' husband, she went on, had skin that looked like the cookies that burned. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl's mother, mortified, came flying when she heard the exchange. 
The child had never seen black people before. But her mother told her not talk 
about such things, that it wasn't nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the child was telling the truth," Hayes says. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother was right to be embarrassed, but not for her daughter. Tolerance, 
just like bigotry, is taught.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Robert Hijar, 22, also known as rapper M.C. Boulevard, is a former gang 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijar spent his 16th and 17th years in California Youth Authority facilities, 
where he completed high school.Now he is a college student with hopes of 
becoming a youth counselor and a professional rapper and singer. He has 
performed his "positive rap" for gang members of all ethnic backgrounds at the 
"Come Togethers" sponsored by the Los Angeles County Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes a major problem in improving racial and ethnic relations is 
negative stereotyping, fostered by the media. He advocates establishing regular 
interchanges among elementary schools from diverse areas of Los Angeles County 
to encourage friendships among children of different races and ethnicities. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would resemble a regular system of field trips; for example, a 
class of predominantly Latino second-graders would visit with a class of 
predominantly black, Asian or white students. Joint activities could be planned 
and pen pals could be paired. REALITY CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 School bureaucracies could be the biggest obstacle, especially if schools from 
different districts are involved. Parents might also be wary of allowing their 
children to travel to neighborhoods they are not familiar with. As with any 
school activity, this could be overcome by briefing parents first and requiring 
parental permission before a child could participate. 
</P>
<P>
 If school districts like the idea, it could be put in place almost 
immediately. But parental opposition is not the only potential problem. Cost 
may also be a factor. Cash-strapped districts have little money to expand 
non-academic programs. They would have to be committed to promoting this 
project over others.

<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Cheryl Greer, 39, a faculty member of Pacific Oaks College in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer, who leads seminars and workshops on diversity training, proposes that 
school districts introduce an anti-bias perspective in their curricula -- 
beginning in preschool -- that teaches children to be critical thinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a curriculum recognizes and explores differences in people by including 
diversity in all subject matter. It is not a separate discipline, like ethnic 
studies. Such a perspective shows diversity as the norm and allows children to 
decide what is fair and unfair. It talks about ways to effect change. REALITY 
CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 This can happen, at least on a limited scale. Implementing anti-bias curricula 
on a large scale might be difficult given the politics of local school boards 
and the intense competition and review process for public school textbooks. The 
notion might catch on more quickly in private schools.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; LIVELIHOODS; BUILDING AN 
ECONOMY WITH GLOBAL REACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles today is like an entrepreneurial company that has outgrown its 
early, informal ways yet clings to them, reluctant to take on the organization 
and structure of the metropolis it has become for fear of losing its youthful 
spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 But childhood's end has come. The five-county Los Angeles region is home to 
15.5 million people, a population larger than many countries with an economy 
larger than most. 
</P>
<P>
 The area's old patterns of living and governing have reached the point of 
diminishing returns in a more crowded and demanding city. 
</P>
<P>
 So there must be changes, some highly visible and many less so. They must 
begin to happen now, and they must be realistic, pragmatic steps, not 
pie-in-the-sky pronouncements that sound promising but have little real-world 
impact on jobs and commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, Los Angeles in the next few years will see the beginnings of a 
true mass transit system, which will be built to comply with the federal Clean 
Air Act. The system, which is already being planned at City Hall, will involve 
high-speed trains running between major centers and connecting to informal 
minivans for local transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass transit is imperative, not voluntary. The federal Environmental 
Protection Agency has issued orders on Clean Air Act compliance that if 
implemented would thwart Los Angeles' future as an international hub of 
business and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 So the city must act. Rail commuting will focus development of offices and 
malls at terminal points, enhancing the role of Century City, Van Nuys 
Boulevard and other major centers in the city's life. As cities have changed 
and grown in the past -- New York's social and business life was once centered 
on now-neglected 14th Street; fashionable Georgetown was once a noisome 
backwater of Washington -- so Los Angeles will change now. 
</P>
<P>
 But many changes will be less visible, though more profound. The city's 
Charter will be changed, probably to give more power to the office of mayor but 
in any event to reform the fractionated governance that has made dealing with 
City Hall a bureaucratic morass. 
</P>
<P>
 To induce rage in any business person, mention permits. Los Angeles issues 
55,000 permits to do business every year, yet it is almost never a routine 
matter: 98% of the permits issued are termed "discretionary" or unique cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The business owner must obtain special approval from the City Council and the 
state government in Sacramento, whether the business in question is a juice 
bar, a dress shop or a condominium complex. "By the time you get the 11th 
permit, economic opportunity has moved on, the banking climate has changed, 
your business is dead," quips attorney Terry Christensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is an alternative to the Inquisition, called a ministerial permit. 
In such cases, rules are preset, business owners complete simple forms and open 
for business. Attempts are under way to increase the number of ministerial 
permits, which have been used only 2% of the time because City Council members 
and department heads guard their power. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Charter reform is needed. "You cannot deal with the realities of 
the '90s with a government designed for the '20s," says Bernard Kinsey, a 
business consultant and former director of RLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Other institutions need updating. The public school system, which never was 
meant to hold 800,000 students, needs restructuring and reform. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next Los Angeles won't be born only of corrected faults. A positive 
shift in perspective is needed. Los Angeles, capital of the global 
entertainment business today, needs to become the intellectual and commercial 
hub of the information industry of tomorrow. Academic programs on new media are 
being instituted at the area's universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to think of ourselves as global citizens in a great world city, not 
local players in the Southern California landscape," says Jeff Berg, chairman 
of the talent agency International Creative Management. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a great port city, through which $140 billion worth of goods passed 
last year. In that respect it is imperative that Los Angeles succeed in its 
efforts to obtain the rest of the $800 million funding for the Alameda Rail 
Corridor, which will speed freight out to the rest of the country and create 
jobs for the city's young people in import-export processing, light 
manufacturing and the financing of foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 We should be mindful of our assets: The mosaic of entrepreneurship that makes 
business life so vital in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
 * New populations eager to open their own shops. 
</P>
<P>
 * More women-owned companies than any other place on earth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Institutions of higher learning that support the cultural and business life. 
</P>
<P>
 * The many organizations that nurture the landscape, both natural and 
man-made.

 For visions of Los Angeles' future, look on the one hand at the Getty Museum 
complex being constructed on the mountain off the San Diego Freeway. That 
represents a $700-million investment in the culture of the city, and there 
should be more like it. Then look at the numerous multifaceted businesses 
opening up despite obstacles in all parts of this five-county global economy of 
15.5 million people. The energy is remarkable, and so is the future.

THE RAILS TO CLEAN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: William G. Ouchi, adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan, is on leave from 
UCLA, where he is a professor at the Anderson Graduate School of Management. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi intends to use a mass transit solution for an air pollution problem, but 
his overriding motivation is neither people-moving nor people-breathing, it's 
preserving a future for the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clean Air Act became a sword hanging over this region last February, when 
the federal government, under a court order, issued a 27,000-page plan to clean 
up the air that included stringent new rules for trucks, planes, trains and 
ships. The plan would severely limit the region's economy. Heavy trucks would 
have the same low-emissions requirements as passenger cars. Ships would have to 
reduce engine emissions when entering the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are unworkable. "Our harbor commissioners tell us that ships won't 
come to Los Angeles with such rules," Ouchi says. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rules also are not final. The EPA's intent was to force Los Angeles to 
come up with its own solutions to achieve compliance with the Clean Air Act. 
"The EPA gave us 12 months and made it clear they would look kindly on our 
response," Ouchi says. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's response will lie in curbing the passenger car and commuting 
traffic through an adaptation of the Metropolitan Transit Authority's 
$200-billion 30-year plan for mass rail transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouchi proposes to adapt the rail plan to create a high-speed rail system that 
would run between major centers -- Warner Center to Century City, Universal 
City to Downtown, Huntington Park to Pasadena and so forth. Then minibuses and 
minivans would carry passengers to local destinations, much as airport shuttle 
vans do. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a period of years, there would be 50,000 to 60,000 minivans and minibuses 
run by private business, Ouchi says. The result would raise mass transit usage 
from today's 5% of home-to-work commuting to 22% by 2010. "It would return 
highway mobility to 1980 levels, 50% faster than today, and help immensely to 
bring Los Angeles into compliance with the Clean Air Act," he says. REALITY 
CHECK 
</P>
<P>
 This should happen, but will it? There has been little success so far in 
getting commuters out of their cars.

TURNING IT AROUND; THE LITTLE COMPANY THAT COULD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an ill wind, as the saying goes. In 1989, the Berlin Wall fell and the 
downsizing of Southern California's aerospace industry began, with widespread 
job loss and economic disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 But a small business success story also began in El Segundo's aerospace alley. 
Anita Gabriel and Orie Rechtman, longtime entrepreneurs, bought Wareforce Inc., 
a software distribution company, in 1989, when it was selling $2 million a year 
in computer programs to schools and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 They chose to go after business among big defense contractors, suddenly forced 
to slash costs and eager to listen when Wareforce promised to supply their 
software needs at a fraction of the cost of their own purchasing departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "People would feel sorry when we said we were supplying the aerospace 
industry, but that was our opportunity," says Gabriel, a San Francisco native 
who has owned companies in textiles and management consulting in two decades in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 She and Rechtman, who is her husband, have taken Wareforce to $21 million in 
sales last year. They anticipate $30 million sales this year and $100 million 
within five years, says Rechtman, who immigrated from Israel in 1972, graduated 
from USC in 1975 and started in business importing Italian furniture. He got 
into computers for home and school use in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Software is developing so rapidly that big organizations want suppliers to 
anticipate needs and fill them. Wareforce services a customer list which 
includes Hughes Aircraft, Lockheed, Southern California Edison and the 
University of California system and USC with only 40 employees. How? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're automated," says Gabriel. "Customers order by E-mail and pay 
electronically, and we can deliver electronically, too. With computers, it 
costs less to do business these days." 
</P>
<P>
 Wareforce has opened sales offices in San Francisco and Atlanta, but the 
company will grow in Southern California. "Tremendous opportunities are coming 
in Los Angeles as companies of 100 employees or more will multiply in the next 
five to six years," says Rechtman. 
</P>
<P>
 What companies are those? "We're looking at people laid off in aerospace who 
have consulting and technology companies with maybe 30 to 50 employees," 
Rechtman explains. "The growth will come from those independents." Opportunity 
from adversity, like Wareforce itself.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; HOW CAN WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE MOSAIC OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT MAKES BUSINESS LIFE SO VITAL IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA?; SOLUTIONS; SPUR SMALL BUSINESS WITH TAX BREAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry Christensen , Los Angeles lawyer , and Jane Pisano, dean of USC's School 
of Public Administration and USC's vice president for external relations.  
</P>
<P>
 Christensen recommends tax incentives to spur small businesses, which are the 
engine of economic growth and create most of the new jobs in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a 1% gross revenue tax in the city of Los Angeles that is 
particularly onerous," he says. The tax is not on profit but on every dollar a 
business owner takes in. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen recommends forgiving the 1% tax for a store or plant that sets up 
in the damaged areas, enabling business owners to make a higher profit and thus 
promise bankers more secure loan repayment and backers a faster return on 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Christensen also would have the city appoint an investment banker to be a 
conduit for small companies trying to get city contracts or loans or grant 
money from the state or federal government, including Small Business 
Administration loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The investment bank would take over some work done now by the Community 
Redevelopment Agency and other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Pisano recommends targeting tax credits for federally supported 
"empowerment zone" now on the drawing board. She says credits should go to 
industries in which Los Angeles can be a global leader, rather than merely 
spreading around aid without strategic planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed empowerment zone, which would include parts of East, Central and 
South Los Angeles, should become an economic engine for the city, Pisano says. 
It should concentrate on industries "where Los Angeles has had, has and/or 
could have a global competitive edge, not just tax credits for any old thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Promising industries would include large and small companies in garment 
manufacturing and finishing, advanced transportation technology, biomedical 
research and manufacturing, multimedia and advanced communications, she 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 If the credits are granted too widely, she says, "it may help the area in a 
transitory way if industries are incentivized and started. But if they are not 
globally competitive, they are not going to last long." REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 These are good, specific ideas that could be implemented quickly. 
Unfortunately, that doesn't mean they will be. The city is strapped, so it will 
be reluctant to forgo any tax. Also, appointment of a private investment bank 
would trigger opposition from city entities like the Community Redevelopment 
Agency. However, devising a strategic plan for urban economic investment is 
within reach, and it makes good sense.

</P>

<P>
 FROM: Jeff Berg, chairman of International Creative Management, one of the 
nation's largest talent agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many familiar Southern California businesses -- movies, television, 
telecommunications, publishing -- will be redefining their operations in the 
next few years.And those businesses employ directly and indirectly 534,000 
people and contribute $16.3 billion to the Southern California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Berg says, it is important that Los Angeles remain a major part of the 
global information industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The area needs to do more than expedite permits for movie production. "We want 
a new partnership with our institutions of higher learning: Caltech, UCLA, USC, 
CalArts, the Cal State schools, the Claremont Colleges," says Berg. REALITY 
CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Universities are already focusing on information sciences, but they are also 
chronically short of money. The entertainment industry could endow more 
academic chairs and companies could gain big public relations points by 
donating time and money.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; HOW CAN WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE MOSAIC OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT MAKES BUSINESS LIFE SO VITAL IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA?; MYTHBUSTERS; AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL KOTKIN , Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Center for the New West and a 
fellow at the Pepperdine School of Business 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 1) All the fast-growing, exciting companies are located elsewhere, mainly in 
other states and countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing no one told that to Dirk Gates or 32 other California chief 
executive officers on Inc. Magazine's list of the nation's 100 fastest-growing 
companies. California may be suffering from layoffs and over-regulation, but it 
clearly remains the best place in America -- and arguably the world -- to start 
a fast-growing company, particularly in fields such as high-technology and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has exactly the kind of employees I'm looking for," says Gates, 
whose Calabasas based Xircom Inc. ranked fourth on the Inc. list. 
"Well-educated, hard-working and ambitious." 
</P>
<P>
 2) Our work force is not as well educated, especially when compared to 
brain-rich areas such as Seattle and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by the accounting firm Price Waterhouse found that in 
northwest Los Angeles County and Ventura County, 24% of adults boasted 
bachelor's degrees, compared to a national average of 20%. In fact, Los 
Angeles' Westside and Orange County rank at the top (along with the San 
Francisco area). By the way, that's ahead of Seattle and Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Southern California has one of the most diverse talent bases in the West and 
in the country," says Price Waterhouse analyst Denis Macheski. "It's just not a 
very well known fact." 
</P>
<P>
 3) We do not benefit from the "spinoff phenomenon" that characterizes vital 
economic centers such as Silicon Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, what about AST Research and the new enterprises it has wrought? From the 
Irvine-based computer firm has sprung several successful companies, the most 
notable being Kingston Technologies in Fountain Valley. Founded five years ago 
by former AST manager John Tu and his partner David Sun, Kingston is among the 
fastest growing firms in the country, with annual sales approaching $700 
million. Tu is also involved with AST co-founder Tom Yuen in another venture, 
called NuReality, that seeks to meld computer technology and multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 4) What growth companies we have are located largely in suburban areas such as 
Orange and Ventura Counties. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent survey by Cognetics in Cambridge, Mass., ranked 778 metropolitan 
"sub-markets" by their per capita population of "gazelle" -- fast-growing -- 
firms. Among the top 20 were four Southern California communities, Sunnyvale 
and Irvine -- no surprise there -- but also South Gate and Compton. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton economic development official Vladimir Jefferson says the city has 
enjoyed expansions linked to its location near the port, Century Freeway and 
Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Another south L.A. County firm making it big is Casa Herrera, which makes 
chip- and tortilla-making equipment for the burgeoning Mexican food industry. 
Nationwide sales of tortillas alone have grown from $350 million to over $1.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Innovative business ideas no longer emanate from Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tell that to Seaborn Beverages, a fledgling Newport Beach company that 
is the first company to sell desalinated ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaborn has begun to sell the treated water taken near Catalina Island. Its 
appeal: it actually has less salt and dissolved solids than conventional 
bottled waters. Over its first months in business, says company co-founder 
Bruce Sweyd -- a former executive with Original New York Seltzer -- shipments 
have more than tripled to over 4,000 cases a week, with half now sold outside 
the region. 
</P>
<P>
 6) The local textile business is in decline as more and more operations move 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 With the growth of the region's apparel industry, Southern California has 
developed a thriving textile trade that has gone from virtually nothing 30 
years ago to more than 30 mills employing more than 30,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest player today is L.A. Dye & Printworks, which was founded 11 years 
ago and now employs 1,400 workers. Company President Helmut Ackerman, a German 
immigrant, and his chief financial officer, Raymond Tsang, a native of Hong 
Kong, expect their firm to expand with the growing popularity of the 
"California look." With styles changing so often, Ackerman expects customers to 
keep shifting from distant Asian producers to Los Angeles-based mills. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Los Angeles' image is bad for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the much-reported problems effecting the region, the Southern 
California lifestyle has spawned a number of shampoo- and cosmetic-related 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Berglass, Rancho Dominguez-based DEP, says that for his company, being 
located in Los Angeles is a key marketing asset. His best selling hair 
treatment line is called "L.A. Looks". 
</P>
<P>
 "They love the L.A. image," says DEP marketing manager Cindy Zielinski, who 
recently moved from the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 8) There are no new jobs in aerospace. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the decline in the aerospace industry has been devastating, some 
entrepreneurial ventures are forging ahead. North Hollywood-based Advanced 
Aerodynamics & Structures Inc. and its more than 150 employees have recently 
received FAA certification approval to build a new turboprop corporate plane. 
The six-seat design is the brainchild of two immigrant engineers, Dr. Carl Chen 
from Taiwan and Iranian-born engineer Darius Sharifzadeh. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the financing for AASI comes from Taiwan, and the company is in 
discussion with possible joint-venture partners in Israel, Taiwan, China, South 
Africa, Canada and Northern Ireland. But plans for manufacturing are focused on 
two possible Southern California locations, Long Beach and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we all live and want to work,"' Chen says. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Hollywood is hemorrhaging jobs to states where it's cheaper to produce 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, the proportion of films shot partially or entirely in California 
actually has increased from roughly one-half to around two-thirds; nearly 75% 
of the filming is done in Los Angeles. The state now accounts for roughly 60% 
of all the country's film-related jobs and has more than four times as many 
industry workers than its nearest rival, New York, and more than 20 times as 
many as its much ballyhooed competitor, Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a tremendous base of entertainment in Los Angeles that people 
have whatever resource they need," says Steve Michaels, president of 525 Post 
Production of Hollywood, which has grown from six people seven years years ago 
to more than 100 today. JOEL KOTKIN

CALIFORNIA?; SOLUTIONS; A PROGRAM TO SPUR HOME BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Bernard W. Kinsey, former director of RLA and now head of his own 
bus-iness development and management consulting company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinsey starts from the fact that a significant number of houses are wearing 
out."We lose 2% of the housing stock every year," Kinsey says. "We need an 
aggressive program to put up housing for low- and middle-income people all over 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a program would create many jobs. Kinsey tries to calculate a number: "We 
have $500 billion in real estate value in Los Angeles County alone, including 
the beaches. If you lose 2% of that each year, that's $10 billion of wealth 
lost annually. How many jobs is that at $18,000 per job? It's way over half a 
million jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 There are incentives already in place, specifically state tax credits 
available to developers of moderate-income housing. But those credits are being 
taken up mainly in new communities, not in areas where houses are in short 
supply. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 One solution being contemplated at City Hall is to use the city's bonds to 
help small developers defray infrastructure costs. But bond financing is no 
easier to come by than any other money. 
</P>
<P>
 However, money spent on housing is money well spent. Jobs open up quickly and 
new homes improve the city and its capital base.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; HOW CAN WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THE MOSAIC OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT MAKES BUSINESS LIFE SO VITAL IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA?; SOLUTIONS; PUTTING NAFTA TO WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: David Hayes-Bautista, UCLA professor and head of the Latino Futures 
Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes-Bautista contends that California is failing to exploit opportunities 
created by the North American Free Trade Agreement, which began to take effect 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has a healthy inner-city population, unlike many other U.S. 
cities, he says. "Every week Gov. Ann Richards of Texas is down in Monterrey, 
Mexico City, Guadalajara or Puebla. But our governor spends his time bashing 
immigrants, creating an image of some monstrous, blood-sucking leech." 
</P>
<P>
 We need to take advantage of Southern California's large Latino work force to 
push the export business with Mexico, Hayes-Bautista argues. Companies must 
work harder to market their products south of the border. And state and local 
governments need to develop a concrete strategy to attract capital from Mexico 
and to encourage even more trans-border commerce. Then officials must put the 
strategy into action and make sure it is sustained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is production of commercial entertainment in Spanish located in Miami?" 
Hayes-Bautista asks. "We have six times the Latino population of Miami. We have 
more artists, more filmmakers and writers. We should be working like crazy to 
sell to all of Latin America." REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that helps Southern California business take advantage of emerging 
opportunities in Mexico is to be encouraged. NAFTA offers potentially huge 
payoffs in new markets and job opportunities. But if Los Angeles fails to move 
strongly, it will lose out not only to other states but to countries like those 
in Asia that are aggressively pursuing opportunities with Latin America.

</P>
<P>
 To diminish the number of cars on the Southland's crowded freeways, Shoup 
advocates the enforcement of a little-known state law that requires companies 
to offer employees the cash equivalent of what the company pays per-person for 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Under existing law, companies that lease parking spaces and have more than 50 
employees are supposed to offer their employees the choice of taking the cash 
in lieu of a parking spot. Few companies, however, heed this law, which was 
passed more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If the law were enforced, experts estimate, it would eliminate 135,000 vehicle 
trips per day, removing 30 times more cars from the road than the Blue Line 
trolley did. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash option would be most tempting for commuters in congested regions. In 
Southern California, parking subsidies can cost as much as $300 per space each 
month. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 It can be done, though there are hassles involved with enforcing the law. In 
companies that provide free parking to some employees, the offer of cash will 
create tensions. Problems also will occur when a company supplements its own 
parking lot with leased space. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoup suggests launching an education program so more employers understand the 
law.

<P>
 MYTH: My commute is hell; it's worse today than ever.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: The average travel distance to work is 15 miles one way, a decrease 
in distance for the first time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: I don't pollute much because I drive slowly.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: A 10-mile trip at an average speed of 20 m.p.h. results in running 
emissions 250% greater than a 10-mile trip at 55 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: We Californians are in love with our automobiles.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: In fact, 36 states have more vehicles per capita than California. 
Also in 36 states, people drive more miles per capita than Californians do, and 
residents of 42 states use more gasoline and diesel fuel. And 37 states have 
more licensed drivers per capita than California. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: It doesn't pay to car-pool.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: A solo commuter with a 40-mile round trip in a subcompact vehicle 
could save $630 annually in fuel, maintenance, vehicle wear and insurance costs 
by car-pooling with one other person. On average, car-pooling also saves about 
24 minutes of fighting traffic.  
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Rush hour is from 8 to 9 weekday mornings and from 5 to 6 in the 
evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 FACT: "Rush hour" is not one hour at the beginning and end of the day but a 
total of six hours, from 6:30 to 9 a.m. and from 3 to 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: I don't drive far, so I don't contribute to our smog.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: More than half the emissions that cars spew into our air occur within 
the first five miles of any trip. During a 20-mile trip, for instance, a car 
will emit 23 grams of hydrocarbons; of those, 14 grams are released within the 
first five miles of any trip.

CREATING A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE OR SIMPLY A COSTLY EDIFICE THAT MOST 
ANGELENOS WON'T USE?; SOLUTIONS; FILL GAPS IN BUS, RAIL SERVICE WITH FEEDER 
SYSTEM OF VANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Rae James, deputy mayor of housing, planning and transportation, left. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, James argues, should launch a one-year pilot program of 
community-based vans called "circulators." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood circulators are intended to fill the voids in the transportation 
network. During rush hours, these vans would travel set point-to-point routes, 
traveling, for instance, from a college to Union Station. Each full-circle 
route would take no more than 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 During non-peak travel times, the vans would operate as a dial-a-ride service, 
taking elderly shoppers, for instance, to a grocery store. The circulators 
would perform as a feeder system, promptly taking people to places where buses 
and rail either don't go or are inconvenient to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Circulators would be cheaper transportation than taxis and offer more 
convenience than buses. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to other transportation schemes, this one is relatively inexpensive 
-- and its chances of succeeding are better than most. 
</P>
<P>
 To start up a one-year program, James estimated would cost $11 million for 50 
vans in selected communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still in their cars, and buses don't always go where people want 
to go in a timely fashion. We need a feeder system. Circulators can fill that 
gap."

<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Eric Mann, longtime community organizer, former auto worker and director 
of the nonprofit Labor, Community, Strategy Center. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Existing bus service can be improved by lowering fares, beefing up security 
and doubling the capacity on overcrowded lines, Mann believes.He also would 
like to see electric buses added to the fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann proposes setting aside $100 million a year for two years to build 10 bus 
depots and purchase 300 non-polluting electric buses. 
</P>
<P>
 An improved bus system should be designed to accommodate low-income urban 
riders as well as wealthier commuters, Mann says. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials "have made an implicit statement that they fund rail 
projects and whatever is left over can fund the bus. We say, 'Invest in the bus 
first,' " Mann said. Buses have long been the underfunded workhorses of the 
transit industry, serving 1.3 million passengers a day. Currently, the 
Metropolitan Transit Authority spends about $1.25 per passenger for security on 
rail but only 4 cents per bus rider. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 This makes sense, but that's no guarantee of success. Implementing a program 
like this would require some rethinking of Los Angeles' ambitious endeavor to 
create an elaborate rail network. Powerful political forces would have to be 
convinced that bus passengers have not received their share of the transit pie.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My sister-in-law called me from Century City when she arrived on business from 
Ohio. "I'm coming to visit you," she announced, although the hotel concierge 
had told her he didn't have a clue how anyone traveled in Los Angeles without a 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 But she'd forgotten her driver's license, so she couldn't rent a car. She 
tried to get bus information but hung up after being put on hold for 20 
minutes. The shuttle companies said they would charge $60 to take her 24 miles 
to Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 So I drove to see her. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of city is this?" she asked, exasperated. 
</P>
<P>
 If you live here -- and especially if you are poor -- you may ask that 
question every day. You make your way through the world in a substandard 
transportation system. You have no choice. A day laborer like Mario Vazquez, 
who lives on the Eastside, takes four buses daily to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Northridge earthquake shattered parts of six freeways, having a car 
no longer necessarily meant you could get places faster. Perhaps what angered 
commuters most was being treated as though their time was not valuable, being 
forced to wait for crowded buses and trains or sitting in traffic jams for 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved what most of us already suspected: that public transportation is 
inconvenient. After the quake, ridership on the Santa Clarita MetroLink train 
-- the route most affected -- increased 20-fold at its peak. But as soon as the 
highways began opening -- despite discount fares and appeals to our consciences 
about the environment -- most of us returned to our cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommuting, another highly touted alternative to the car, met a similar 
fate. After highways reopened, its popularity waned. 
</P>
<P>
 People won't use public transit unless it's convenient and safe, transit 
experts warned us. Unless poverty or disasters like earthquakes force them. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on our brief encounters with public transportation, a lot of us began to 
wonder: Are we creating a transit system that makes sense? 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, despite the billions poured into erecting elaborate rail systems, 
fewer and fewer people use public transportation. In 1960, about 13% of us 
traveled on bus and rail. Thirty years later, only 5% do. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, public transportation peaked in 1985. When fare for the 
county's buses was 50 cents, 1.6 million passengers took buses daily. But there 
were service cuts and fare hikes. And we began building rail lines, starting 
with the Blue Line trolley, which travels between Long Beach and L.A.'s 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Boasting 37,000 daily passengers, the Blue Line carries more riders than the 
Red Line subway or MetroLink. Shortly after the Blue Line opened, we shut the 
bus lines that ran parallel. True, those buses often beat the spanking new 
trolley by as much as 20 minutes. But we meant to usher in the new age of rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, about 60,000 passengers a day ride L.A.'s rail, the Blue Line, Red Line 
and MetroLink. That's a lot fewer than the roughly 400,000 riders who stopped 
using the buses after service cuts and fare hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Did we achieve our goal of taking cars off the region's crowded roads? About 
two-thirds of Blue Line riders say they used to take the bus. They merely 
switched from one form of public transportation to another. 
</P>
<P>
 We need better transportation now. Maybe that means we need to rethink how we 
spend our transportation dollars so we get more for our money. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we need to experiment, try shuttles in neighborhoods served by 
overcrowded buses. Or open the transit market so that more companies can offer 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, we could improve the bus system so that it serves more 
people with greater comfort and convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail, we are told, is for the future. With only a fledgling system in place, 
we are building for our children. But what happens until then? The visiting 
sisters-in-law shouldn't have to wait a decade. Nor should Mario Vazquez.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; GETTING AROUND; ARE WE 
CREATING A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE OR SIMPLY A COSTLY EDIFICE THAT MOST 
ANGELENOS WON'T USE?; SOLUTIONS; EXPAND CAR-POOL LANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Robert W. Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, a nonprofit 
educational organization, and a transportation consultant who has worked for 
the state and federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poole believes we must expand our existing network of car-pool lanes and 
experiment with some, allowing single-occupant drivers to use low-volume 
car-pool lanes if they pay a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 During rush hour, the fee would be double the amount charged during non-peak 
travel times. At 20 cents a mile, a ten-mile trip during rush hour, for 
instance, would cost $2, a price many motorists would pay if they were in a 
hurry or tired of sitting in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would stimulate greater use of higher occupancy car-pooling and, by 
allowing more people to use these lanes, it would potentially reduce political 
opposition to them," Poole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three percent of Southland car-poolers travel with members of their own 
households, according to one study. Experts say these folks would probably 
share rides even if there were no car-pool lanes. In an effort to remove a 
greater number of single-occupant cars from our roads, officials could launch 
an experimental program and limit car-pool lanes to vehicles with three or more 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure success, the existing 66-mile network of car-pool lanes must be 
rapidly expanded, Poole said. (Caltrans currently plans to have 305 miles of 
car pool lanes open by 2003). 
</P>
<P>
 On freeways like the Santa Monica, where there is no room to restripe and 
create car-pool lanes, transitways -- or elevated structures like the one being 
built on the Harbor Freeway -- could be built. Revenue generated by fees paid 
by low-occupancy vehicles could help offset the cost of building such 
structures. REALITY CHECK:  
</P>
<P>
 Launching this car-pool lane program would mean restriping highways to create 
more car-pool lanes, which cost $2.5 million a mile; and building elevated 
transitways, which cost $20 million per mile. About $30 million would be 
necessary to set up an automatic electronic toll system to charge low-occupancy 
vehicles on 50 miles of car-pool lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, however, would not be without risk. Current car-poolers might be 
dissuaded from sharing rides if they have to accommodate three in one vehicle. 
Or they might decide that they prefer to pay the fee to drive solo, further 
increasing the numbers who drive alone. Historically, some Southlanders have 
vehemently opposed car-pool lanes, saying they hamper an individual's freedom. 
They are not likely to be won over by this program. QUOTE: 
</P>
<P>
 "We must stimulate more serious car-pooling. We should not be providing a 
windfall for people who would be car-pooling anyway. This would enable us to 
get more utilization of those lanes and to accommodate more vehicles by 
allowing paying customers."-Robert W. Poole

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; GETTING AROUND; ARE WE 
CREATING A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE OR SIMPLY A COSTLY EDIFICE THAT MOST 
ANGELENOS WON'T USE?; SOLUTIONS: TARGETING THE GROSS POLLUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Charles Lave, professor of economics at UC Irvine, who has studied 
transportation-related issues for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lave believes the time has come for Los Angeles to crack down on the region's 
worst-polluting vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single biggest change we could make to improve air quality is to get the 
gross polluters off the streets," Lave said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts say that cars account for almost half of the region's smog 
problem. In fact, most of Los Angeles' air pollution is produced by only 10% of 
the vehicles, the gross polluters. Cleaning up these cars would reduce 
automobile emissions by about 50%, which would be a significant dent in smog. 
</P>
<P>
 To snag polluting vehicles, Lave proposes using remote sensor devices that 
monitor a car's emission levels as it drives by. Enforcement officials with 
these gadgets could be posted on streets or freeways, and they would know 
immediately which of the passing cars emitted high levels of pollutants. 
Drivers would be pulled over and required to go through a smog inspection. 
Motorists whose cars fail would be ticketed on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Another approach would use equipment now available. The license plates of 
suspected polluting cars could be photographed, and the car's registered owner 
would receive a notice requiring a smog inspection. Failure to appear for the 
smog inspection would result in a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 This idea more than pays for itself. A six-month test program could be 
implemented for $2 million. This program could be run at 10% of the cost of the 
existing biennial inspections. AIR PATROL 
</P>
<P>
 Remote sensors can now check passing cars for excessive emissions in a matter 
of seconds. With sensors installed at freeway entrances and exits, car owners 
would have no need for annual smog checks. Owners of vehicles that excessively 
spew out pollutants would be notified by mail. Here is how the sensor works: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Infrared source: An infrared beam is projected across a freeway entrance or 
exit. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Detector: A receiver picks up the beam on the other side and records a 
snapshot of a vehicle's emission. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Calibrator: The emission information is processed. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Computer: Data is analyzed by a nearby computer. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Video camera: A video camera keeps a record of every vehicle checked. 
</P>
<P>
 SPECTRUM OF POLLUTANTS 
</P>
<P>
 The receiver contains four detectors that view the infrared beam through 
separate filters. Three of the filters isolate pollutants. * Carbon dioxide * 
Carbon monoxide * Hydrocarbons 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth sensor, which picks up a spectral region that the pollutants do not 
absorb, is used as a reference. 
</P>
<P>
 COST OF VIGILANCE 
</P>
<P>
 A portable system, which includes the sensor, calibrator, computer, video 
camera and a van, costs an estimated $100,000 to $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 A NETWORK OF SENSORS 
</P>
<P>
 Although the technology is young, incorporating remote sensors into a network 
with a centrally located computer command center could happen very soon.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; GETTING AROUND; ARE WE 
CREATING A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE OR SIMPLY A COSTLY EDIFICE THAT MOST 
ANGELENOS WON'T USE?; SOLUTIONS; SPUR TRANSIT GROWTH WITH PRIVATE COMPETITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Genevieve Giuliano, associate professor of urban and regional planning 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Giuliano advocates creating a competitive transportation market by issuing 
more taxi medallions so more cabs are available and by allowing more private 
bus and shuttle companies to serve communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the existing system, one behemoth agency -- the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority -- basically serves most of the Los Angeles area, 
coordinating the Blue Line trolley, Red Line subway and various buses that 
serve 1.3 million passengers daily. But inner-city buses, like No. 204 on 
Vermont, are often overcrowded, exceeding industry standards for passenger 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Public transportation has been set up using a model that requires large 
numbers of people traveling to a centralized destination, such as downtown Los 
Angeles, Giuliano said. But she and other transit planners say today's 
commuters travel to dispersed workplaces. As a result, there is an inadequate 
supply of transportation like buses, taxis and shuttles to serve commuters' 
needs in a timely fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 With more companies -- small and large -- competing, service to passengers 
would improve and could include more creative solutions, like van pools, 
Giuliano said. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 There would be various obstacles to Giuliano's plan. The Public Utilities 
Commission conducts safety inspections of vans and buses and would have to 
increase its staff to keep pace with a larger number of private companies 
providing transportation. And labor union officials would balk, believing they 
were losing jobs to other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a complicated proposal, but it has a good chance of working. The cost has 
not been calculated, but such a plan could actually save money and be in place 
within two years.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; GETTING AROUND; ARE WE 
CREATING A TRANSIT SYSTEM THAT MAKES SENSE OR SIMPLY A COSTLY EDIFICE THAT MOST 
ANGELENOS WON'T USE?; SUCCESS STORY; BUS SYSTEM IN BRAZIL EVERYTHING OURS IS 
NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a fraction of the cost of installing a subway, officials in Curitiba, 
Brazil, set up a first-class Jetsons-like bus network -- one so convenient and 
prompt that 75% take mass transit to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus system in Curitiba, a city of 1.6 million, is everything ours is not: 
fast, efficient and popular, offering express and short-hop vehicles as well as 
the ability to readily transfer among different services. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers purchase fares in advance and enter clear cylindrical tube-like 
stations, where the platforms are the same height as the bus floor. This means 
riders don't step up to get on the bus. When the bus arrives, all its doors 
open. Within seconds, passengers disembark and others board, allowing the bus 
to zip along to the next stop. 
</P>
<P>
 On Los Angeles buses, a significant amount of time is lost at each stop as all 
passengers enter one door and the driver collects fares. Delays are also caused 
when passengers, for example parents toting children and strollers, have 
difficulty mounting the steep steps. In Curitiba, passengers board buses at a 
rate of eight people per second, or four times faster than people board at 
conventional bus stops. 
</P>
<P>
 The star-shaped city has five major arteries, with large bus terminals at the 
end of each. Along the arteries, mega-buses travel in exclusive lanes with 
synchronized traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
 These giant accordion-like buses, the equivalent of three buses connected, can 
accommodate about 300 passengers as they travel the high-density corridors. The 
red buses carry about 14,000 passengers an hour, comparable to the capacity of 
some subways. But their routes cost about $1.3 million per kilometer, or 
one-eightieth the cost of a subway, by some estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 For the convenience of passengers, buses are color-coded. Red buses run along 
the city's five main corridors, stopping at every stop. Gray express buses 
travel parallel to the red ones, outside the bus-only lanes. Yellow feeder 
buses circulate outside the central city. Green inter-district buses travel 
concentric routes connecting neighborhoods and main transit centers. Passengers 
pay one fare (about 40 cents) and can transfer from one service to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike those in Los Angeles and other U.S. cities, Curitiba's transit system 
is not subsidized. In Los Angeles, taxpayers pay a $21-per-passenger subsidy 
for every Metrolink rider and $1.17 for each bus ride. 
</P>
<P>
 In Curitiba, a government agency orchestrates the running of the system, 
paying private companies to operate the buses. These companies are paid by the 
distance they operate. They receive part of the fare, and the rest of the 
revenue is used to cover such system costs as planning and maintaining roads 
and terminals. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the bus system generates revenue for the city. Stores and shops that 
lease space in stations pay into the city's coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's three-term former mayor, Jaime Lerner, "believed in the need to 
create a city where automobiles did not dominate," said Robert Cervero, 
professor of city and regional planning at UC Berkeley. At the same time, 
Lerner wanted an affordable solution for his city's transportation needs. 
Deciding against tearing up the city's 17th-Century buildings to build a 
subway, he opted for the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The city was designed to be pedestrian- and transit-friendly, hosting 
high-density housing along the five arteries. Officials also established 
disincentives for driving: Steep prices are charged for parking, fuel and 
vehicle registration. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Curitiba "is widely recognized as a medium-sized city which introduced 
an alternative to the automobile that people are using," Cervero said. "It's an 
example of good planning." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Curitiba, the capital of the farming state of Parana, also seem 
to regard the bus system as a triumph. Seventy-five percent commute by bus in 
Curitiba, but only 45% do so in Sao Paulo and 57% in Rio. And transportation 
officials around the world are looking at this city, wondering if its success 
can be applied elsewhere.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; LIVABLE L.A.; HOW CAN WE

<P>
 Imagine you live outside California and most of your knowledge about Los 
Angeles comes from reading tourist guidebooks. Sure, you'd find passing 
references to smog, traffic, earthquake danger, social tensions and crime. But 
the luring listings of wonders probably would tempt you to at least consider a 
visit here. 
</P>
<P>
 The climate, the beaches, the mountains, the palm trees. The glitzy shopping 
district of Beverly Hills, the shaded stalls of Olvera Street, the funky 
streetscape of Venice, the new Chinatown in Monterey Park. Dodger Stadium, the 
Music Center, the Getty Museum, the Watts Towers. Manhattan Beach, Universal 
Studios, Sunset Strip, El Mercado. And on. And on. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Angelenos, once banner-waving boosters, might snicker at that list 
now. That's for tourists, they'd explain. That's the false facade of a town 
that perfected illusion and made public relations into a major industry. Put 
down the guidebook, they'd say, and listen to us for a while. Or worse yet, try 
living here. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, you listen to their contrary lists, their tour of an L.A. where palm tree 
trunks are scarred with graffiti and every supermarket seems staked out by 
panhandlers. OK, amazing commuting distances may be a dubious trade-off for 
ice-free driveways and, yes, the bay is polluted. But for the most part, those 
complaints seem to you to echo problems of all Big American Cities, just 
collected late and fast in a place that had considered itself exempt. The place 
still seems quite livable to someone not yet ready for Ojai or Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 So you take the next step. You actually land a job and live here for a while. 
You make those tourist spots your own mental landmarks; you choose your 
favorite beach, your local team, your best taco stand, your independent 
bookstore. Years pass. You're one of those veterans now. You grumble about 
traffic and smog but hope things will improve. You stay. 
</P>
<P>
 As work, you get to ask strangers for ideas to make L.A. life more enjoyable. 
How can we improve the quality of existence away from job, freeway and police 
station? This time, many answers repeat a theme that may have taken a newcomer 
a decade to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this: Living among an amazing array of attractions, Angelenos are too 
isolated from their city and from each other. Life can be pleasant, but life is 
too fractured, too segregated, too lonely. The greatly mocked "C" word of 
psycho-babble and urban planning pops up a lot, unprompted; you now know the 
lack of that "community" is no joke, not just a complaint of greenhorns. 
</P>
<P>
 The successes of Pasadena's Old Town, Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, 
Universal City's CityWalk prove we are hungry to get out of our cars and see 
each other. As CityWalk's principal architect, Jon Jerde, explains: "An event 
happens when other humans get together. A reaffirmation of human-ness you miss 
when you are alone in your hot tub or watching your TV." 
</P>
<P>
 However, sweeping gestures are not the answer. The incomplete subway system 
can't be expanded 100 times over. Zoning that encouraged endless sprawl won't 
be overthrown next week. Office towers built over possible parkland won't be 
torn down. The ethos of private spaces won't end. Poverty, crime and drugs 
won't quickly disappear. Nor will the Sun Belt transiency that makes people 
reluctant to get involved, to put down roots, to explore. The ugliness of 
commercial streets is hard to thoroughly erase. L.A. won't be, and shouldn't 
be, made into Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 But smaller things can be done. Downtown's ethnic neighborhoods can be linked 
to each other and spruced up for pedestrians. Teen-agers can run athletic 
programs for younger kids. Pan-ethnic street festivals can be held. Empty lots 
can be turned into parks. Vacant storefronts can become clubhouses. Communal 
exercise equipment can be put in supermarkets and churches. Filmmakers could 
make mini-documentaries about life here and show them on television and in 
movie theaters. A fleet of buses could move young people to many cultural and 
recreation opportunities. Alienating streets can be made friendlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Adolfo Nodal, general manager of Los Angeles city's Cultural Affairs 
Department, argues for projects that enhance neighborhood identities, like 
relighting neon signs on the Wilshire Corridor, building a formal gateway into 
Koreatown, sprucing up mariachi plazas in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot going on in L.A.," he says. "The biggest thing that's missing 
here is a thread to hold it all together.... We need to start celebrating this 
city instead of just leaving it or driving through it as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 That all is true. But sometimes I wish for pocket-sized guidebooks to civic 
pride, a Michelin star system for neighborhood interaction. I see "Comedy 
Clubs" and "Concerts" listed in Fodor's, but not the other big "C" word.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; LIVABLE L.A.; HOW CAN WE 
GUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AWAY FROM JOB, 
FREEWAY AND POLICE STATION?; SOLUTIONS; REMAKE DOWNTOWN ETHNIC DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Ray Bradbury, science fiction writer ("Fahrenheit 451," "The Martian 
Chronicles") and urban activist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury wants to link and improve the three historic ethnic neighborhoods in 
Downtown Los Angeles -- Olvera Street, Chinatown and Little Tokyo -- into a 
walkable and exciting district for tourists and Angelenos to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many other cities in the world can boast of such ethnic diversity in such 
close proximity, Bradbury says. But not too many other great cities, he adds, 
have so hurt potential urban jewels with poor lighting, worse signage, disdain 
for pedestrian life and a debilitating sense of isolation. The result is that 
the once-vibrant neighborhoods now seem downright lonely at night. Los Angeles 
should weave those three neighborhoods together, using lights, landscaping and 
improved security. Visitors could be pointed along a designated route, jazzed 
up with vendors, bookstalls and pushcarts on now-drab streets. One model is 
Boston's Freedom Trail. Local successes include Santa Monica's Third Street 
Promenade and Pasadena's Old Town. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Los Angeles city government finally killed plans for the 
$33-million "Steel Cloud," a grandiose and odd-looking structure that was 
supposed to span that freeway section near Olvera Street. It would have cost 
$33 million. Bradbury is relieved by its death: "We don't need a monument. We 
need fluid movement of people." This money could be put to use realizing 
Bradbury's plan. QUOTE: 
</P>
<P>
 "All these Downtown neighborhoods can function again. We need to repaint, 
redo, rethink and integrate them. It's not that expensive. It's all just 
waiting to be changed."-Ray Bradbury,

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; LIVABLE L.A.; HOW CAN WE 
GUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AWAY FROM JOB, 
FREEWAY AND POLICE STATION?; SOLUTIONS; CREATE YOUTH SPORTS CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Anita DeFrantz, president of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los 
Angeles, pictured above with children playing basketball at foundation office. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrantz's organization uses profits from the 1984 Olympics for various sports 
programs. A 1976 bronze medal winner in Olympic rowing and the first African 
American female rower to compete in the Olympics, she serves on the executive 
board of the International Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Sports Corps of teen-agers would train, coach and referee athletic games 
for younger children around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 She argues that school busing for integration has produced an unintended 
negative effect on parental involvement in neighborhood schools: Too many 
families live too far away from their children's campuses to volunteer for 
after-school recreation programs. At the same time, increasing economic 
pressures make it difficult to find parents with time for coaching and 
refereeing. The result is a shortage of sports and recreational opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Los Angeles has no shortage of teen-agers who could be trained as 
coaches and refs. Nor does it have a shortage of schoolyards and school 
athletic fields that are locked up on evenings and weekends. Her foundation, 
she suggests, could develop and offer classes in various sports; the classes 
would be similar to water safety courses offered by the Red Cross to young 
people who want to be junior lifeguards. The teen-agers might then be paid a 
modest wage, funded perhaps by government, charities and minimal participation 
fees from children's families. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, she envisions a wonderful experience for both young players and 
teen-age coaches, offering role models to the former and a sense of 
responsibility to the latter: "There are lots of good kids out there who don't 
have an opportunity to show they are good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, the sports corps would bring structure to some chaotic lives. 
REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 A sure bet, at least on a small scale; there is no good reason not to start 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 A key would be securing some private money to get this program off the ground. 
With city budgets tapped out, public money would be hard to come by, although 
DeFrantz hopes the program would encourage restoration of recreation programs 
lost because of city and state budget cuts. Liability and security problems 
might arise, but she insists that they could be solved with legal waivers and 
supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a program could begin at least on a modest scale, with families pitching 
in time and some money, then grow from there. QUOTE: 
</P>
<P>
 "What kids need most is certainty, and that's the hardest thing to get in this 
world," DeFrantz says. "They need to know if they go to a certain place at a 
certain time, they are going to be involved in something good."-Anita DeFrantz.

THE NEXT LOS ANGELES / TURNING IDEAS INTO ACTION; LIVABLE L.A.; HOW CAN WE 
BUILD A SENSE OF COMMUNITY AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE AWAY FROM JOB, 
FREEWAY, POLICE STATION?; MYTHBUSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MYTH: Los Angeles County has plenty of parkland and open space for its 9 
million population.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: The county has about 885,000 acres in federal, state and municipal 
parks and recreation centers. In theory, that total nearly meets the suggested 
national standard of one acre per 1,000 residents. But only about 100,000 acres 
are easily accessible for daily recreation for many people, says the county's 
regional planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Nearly everyone in Los Angeles has a private back yard.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Nearly half of the housing units in Los Angeles County are in 
buildings with two or more units, according to the federal census. And about a 
quarter of the units in the county are in buildings with 10 or more units. In 
the city of Los Angeles, nearly 60% of the housing is in multiple-unit 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Los Angeles is not a reading town.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: If library holdings mean anything, Los Angeles is quite a reading 
county, with 16.5 million books in public libraries, not including university 
and college collections. Only the New York, Chicago and Boston metropolitan 
areas have more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: People in Los Angeles are generally in good physical condition and are 
obsessed with with fitness and exercise.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: About half of all women and a third of the men in Los Angeles County 
reported that they want to lose weight, a state survey found. But the study 
discovered that that 55% of county residents are either couch potatoes or 
exercise rarely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: After New York, Los Angeles is the cultural capital of the United 
States.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Los Angeles County does indeed rank second in the nation for the 
sheer array of cultural institutions and entertainment offerings. But nine 
other cities in the country rank higher in terms of the percentage of 
population who say they regularly attend cultural and arts events. 
Charlottesville, Va., home of the University of Virginia, ranks first, with 
24.3%. New York ranks fourth with 19.1%, and Los Angeles market surveys show 
17.8%. San Francisco and Washington are among those ranked above Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: With so many young families moving to other states, Los Angeles is 
becoming an old-peoples' town.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: In fact, only about 10% of Los Angeles County residents are 65 or 
older, the Census shows. About 26% of county residents are younger than 18, and 
that percentage is expected to grow with immigration from Latin America and 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 MYTH: Nobody wants to visit Downtown Los Angeles anymore unless it is to watch 
a criminal trial or to get a free meal on Skid Row.  
</P>
<P>
 REALITY: Surveys by the Los Angeles Convention & Visitors Bureau found that 
Downtown is the region's 10th most popular tourist attraction. The nine more 
popular spots are, in descending order, Beverly Hills, Universal Studios, 
Disneyland, Hollywood, beach areas, Griffith Park, Knott's Berry Farm, Mann's 
Chinese Theater and the Queen Mary.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Robert A. Wiswell, chairman of USC's department of exercise science and 
member of the Governor's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles may be the home of glamour gyms, health-obsessed aerobics. But, in 
fact, a very large portion of our population exercises little or not at all.For 
many, health club membership or the purchase of home exercise equipment is 
prohibitively expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 So he proposes installing coin-operated exercise machines in shopping malls, 
supermarkets, churches, community centers, transit stations and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The vending and exercise machine industries could quickly develop new 
equipment, coin-operated at a modest fee and hardy enough to survive in public 
settings. Computerized equipment could respond to personalized exercise 
programs encoded on plastic cards. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 Go for it and feel the burn  
</P>
<P>
 Because this would be a profit-making enterprise, there would be no cost to 
taxpayers. All that's needed are some adventurous entrepreneurs. Questions 
about safety, hygiene, maintenance and liability need to be answered. But the 
need, Wiswell says, is clear.

</P>

<TEXT>

 Overbuilding in the 1980s has led to an urban landscape strewn with strip 
malls, many of which are more than half vacant.Los Angeles architect Jeffrey 
Daniels suggests offering tax credits to owners of such properties in exchange 
for allowing temporary uses, like community centers, art galleries, youth clubs 
and vest pocket parks on the empty properties rent-free. Elaborating on some of 
Daniels' ideas, futurist artist Steven M. Johnson shows how malls could be 
reused under a program called "L.A. NOW." Qualifying sites would be numbered 
and matched thematically to appropriate community organizations and events, and 
upcoming activities would be publicized in the neighborhood media.

FREEWAY, POLICE STATION?; SOLUTIONS; LOCAL DOCUMENTARY FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FROM: Elizabeth M. Daley, dean of the USC School of Cinema-Television. 
</P>
<P>
 Daley proposes a program to make short documentary features about Los Angeles 
life and neighborhoods and have them regularly shown in movie theaters and on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has an unmatched talent pool of film- and video-makers, both 
professionals and students. It also has unmatched diversity in ethnic groups, 
geography, neighborhoods and industries. Put those resources together to teach 
everyone else about the city around them, Daley urges. 
</P>
<P>
 The films could be lighthearted guides to Los Angeles attractions, serious 
explorations of civic issues. The goal is to get people to enjoy, explore and 
understand the city more. REALITY CHECK: 
</P>
<P>
 It's a wrap. Film schools, studios and local government officials could 
persuade theaters and TV stations to show the three-minute films. Television 
news directors should welcome the chance to show the community features. Young 
people and community residents can be involved in the process. But production 
values must be very strong; this should not be a rehash of the amateur hour. 
Film schools and Hollywood studios could offer technical assistance. Costs 
could be absorbed by these private institutions.

 It's great sport to kill off whole cities. Delivering them from the dead can 
be almost as much fun. Those who wrote the obituaries of New York City in the 
1970s no doubt found it just as fulfilling to report the Big Apple's revival in 
the boom-boom '80s. Similarly, some of the same hip-shot sociologists who a 
decade ago filled bookshelves and public television documentaries with 
glittering dispatches from the new capital of the Pacific Rim now, with equal 
sweep, lament the fading of poor, pitiful Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of an organic city -- now soaring, now slumping, now cohesive, now 
torn apart -- is a tempting plaything for anyone with a magazine to fill or a 
grant proposal to submit. Let us do Los Angeles, they say. And so Los Angeles 
is done. And redone. And done again. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wind. 
</P>
<P>
 It means nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of ancient Pompeii, cities typically don't up and die, just 
like that. Nor do they emerge overnight. Rome wasn't built in a day, and 
neither was Reseda. Yes, cities grow and change and pass through bright times 
and bleak. And yes, a city as a sum of its parts can be charted, tracked, 
polled, pondered. This macro approach, though, can make for some dubious 
science, and it requires a certain suspension of reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality is not waking up all worried about the collective mood of the 
metropolis. Reality is jumping into clothes and off to the job. Reality is not 
fretful contemplation of the merits of mass transit. Reality is trying to 
squirt past that lumbering truck driver who has jammed up the fast lane. 
Reality is not 15 million residents living, thinking, fearing and hoping as 
one, strands in some coherent municipal weave. Reality is 15 million people 
with 15 million different reasons to climb out of bed each morning and 15 
million sets of dilemmas and demons, of everyday delights and big dreams. And 
about all they have in common is geography. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality is people just getting by, one by one, and an interesting place to 
meet some of these people is Room 2207 of the L.A. County registrar's 
headquarters in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Room 2207 is one of several bureaucratic way stations that must be visited 
when filing fictitious business name statements. This filing is part of a 
larger process, the process of starting a new business. And to spend a morning 
in Room 2207 is to encounter a wealth of everyday hope and everyday courage. 
</P>
<P>
 In this room, I met a woman from Claremont named Alice Wolleydt. She had spent 
the past dozen years caring for her mother. On the side she designed dolls, "a 
doll here, a doll there." Her mother died, and Wolleydt was going to launch the 
American Doll Collection Co. She spoke of business seminars she had attended 
and of articles read and clipped. One magazine piece had mentioned a doll maker 
who turned a $100-million profit on just five designs. Her eyes almost danced 
as she repeated the figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have wanted," she said, "to do this for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 I met Reynaldo Roter, a 49-year-old immigrant from the Philippines. In his old 
country, he had been a salesman, a "businessman." Here, he parked cars, tended 
bar, learned to "take any work they give you, in order to survive." Over 10 
years he had managed to save a few thousand dollars, enough to gain access to a 
small plot of land and some bonzai seedlings. Exotic Bonsai is what he wants to 
call his company. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he scared? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why," he asked, "should I be scared? I know bonsai." 
</P>
<P>
 I met a mother of three who, with her husband, intended to run several home 
businesses, selling telephone services, discount travel packages and the like 
on the side. They had paid $495 apiece for franchise start-up kits at a 
convention. She spoke of a desire for "supplemental income, a little more 
financial security." She spoke of saving enough to someday move "to a better 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 I met a couple of guys starting a janitorial service. "Everybody needs toilet 
paper," one explained merrily. 
</P>
<P>
 They wore beepers and seemed quite secretive, and only after a promise of 
anonymity would they explain. They are sales reps for an existing janitorial 
company. They were supposed to be on the road right then, making calls. But 
they could see the future, and it was not bright. "It's a good business," one 
said, "but the people who run it don't know what they are doing. It has nothing 
to do with the recession, but it is going to go under. When it does, we will be 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 I met Angel. Mother of three, she had worked 14 years as a secretary for a 
national telephone company. She had been laid off. "I never thought that would 
happen," she said. This calamity forced a family decision. Her husband would 
quit his job with a furniture company. They would invest her severance and 
start a furniture company of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming," she said. "It's scary to take that first step. 
But everybody has to do it sooner or later, right? Everybody has to take a 
chance, if they want to take some control over their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 They had discussed moving to another city, another economy, but that 
conversation, Angel said, "lasted about three minutes. I am from here. I was 
born here. East L.A. So was my husband. I don't know any other place. I feel 
comfortable here. This is all I know." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Angel what was the big dream, and she flashed a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pool," she said, without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 In all I met maybe a dozen people starting new businesses. Dozens more passed 
through Room 2207 before I could hear their stories. A county worker told me 
they come each day "by the hundreds. Hundreds and hundreds. You can see a lot 
of hopes and dreams in this room." 
</P>
<P>
 And you can hear a lot of stories. And taken together maybe the stories say 
something about the city. And maybe they don't. For there is no sum to this 
equation, only parts. The parts are the people. And there are millions of them, 
each an expert on the question of what might await the Next Los Angeles.
