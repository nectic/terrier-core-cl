 THIRD STRIKE?: Roosevelt C. McCowan tried to steal 18 bottles of cologne from 
a drug store, prosecutors say, and for that petty theft he should spend 25 
years to life in prison. McCowan has half a dozen felony convictions, they say, 
amply qualifying him for the "three strikes and you're out" law (B1).

 MOON WALK: Gene Cernan wasn't the first to stroll on the moon. But the former 
astronaut was the last man to leave his footprints there. . . . Cernan flew 
three separate space missions during his 13 years with NASA. He will share his 
experiences at the Ronald Reagan Library near Simi Valley at a July 26 forum to 
celebrate the 25th anniversary of the lunar landing.

 LEGAL EAGLES: When it comes to public justice, Ventura County lawyers are in 
the vanguard this year. Three of 10 finalists for a national award are local 
attorneys. . . . The Trial Lawyers for Public Justice picked Mark O. Hiepler 
and Alan R. Templeman of Oxnard for their victory over Health Net, which 
refused to provide Hiepler's sister with a bone-marrow transplant before she 
died of cancer. Oxnard civil rights lawyer Lee Pliscou also was named for his 
successful sex-discrimination case on behalf of women packinghouse workers.

GEORGE RAMOS: RECLAIMING THE SIMPLE DELIGHTS OF OLVERA STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my bosses rolls his eyes whenever the subject of L.A.'s taxicabs came 
up. Having once covered the complex and sometimes chaotic world of the cabbies, 
he doesn't envy reporters who have to write about it. "Every time I hear the 
word taxi, " he once told me, "my brain turns to spaghetti." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm beginning to feel the same way about Olvera Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge for some Parmesan cheese set in with the news that Los Angeles City 
Controller Rick Tuttle had issued an audit of El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historic 
Park, where Olvera Street is located, that found numerous weaknesses in the way 
business is done there. Among other things, the audit described as woeful the 
efforts to promote Olvera Street by, for example, restoring a controversial 
Siqueiros mural washed over in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 It also found that most of the financial safeguards recommended in an audit 
back in 1988 haven't been implemented yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was no evidence of any financial wrongdoing, the audit was 
another reminder that Olvera Street is a pain in the you-know-where. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Olvera Street I know as a reporter is a far cry from the place I looked 
forward to visiting as a kid. We used to end trips to Downtown with some 
taquitos from a corner stand on the street, which, when it started as a tourist 
attraction in 1929, was a back alley. The taquitos were great, though I never 
praised them too much in front of my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, I look for the aspirin, not the food, because the arguments around 
Olvera Street overload the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 The first big fight I covered as a reporter came in the years before the city 
took over sole possession of El Pueblo park in 1990. The dispute centered on 
how best to modernize Olvera Street, which needs earthquake-related work for 
its aging buildings and adequate parking for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants, who were supporters of then-City Councilwoman Gloria Molina, 
charged that Councilman Richard Alatorre, whose district includes Olvera 
Street, might give the revitalization project to the East Los Angeles Community 
Union, whose leaders are friendly with Alatorre. Molina friend and restaurateur 
Vivien Bonzo alleged that TELACU would turn Olvera Street into a "Mexican 
Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre denied that and while officials at the Eastside developer hinted they 
might consider such a project, they never submitted a proposal for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 TELACU is now off doing other work and the Olvera Street project isn't close 
to beginning. Nevertheless, the dispute convinced some merchants that Alatorre 
wasn't a friend, regardless of the lavish praise he has heaped on them over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other squabbles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city considered getting more rent from the merchants, noting that it was 
city policy to require competitive bidding for people who do business on city 
land. The folks on Olvera Street howled, saying many of them were direct 
descendants of its founders and that they should be exempted since they worked 
hard at preserving it as a city institution. 
</P>
<P>
 The voters agreed with them in 1992 and approved a charter amendment that 
exempted Olvera Street merchants from the competitive bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 The merchants, however, continued to battle City Hall. They squabbled over how 
best to attract visitors, contending that Recreation and Parks commissioners 
were unsympathetic to them. They argued about security arrangements. They 
argued with the managers picked by Recreation and Parks officials to oversee 
day-to-day activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-fighting has reached ridiculous levels. Molina supporters, for example, 
refuse to patronize Olvera Street eateries operated by Alatorre allies. To do 
so just ain't right, they sniff. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt relieved when the merchants agreed to a plan to create a seven-member 
authority to oversee El Pueblo park, taking away jurisdiction from Recreation 
and Parks. That was approved in 1992, but there's a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Tom Bradley didn't appoint anyone before leaving office and, so 
far, Mayor Richard Riordan hasn't appointed anyone either. 
</P>
<P>
 That has led to more uncertainty and bickering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle, in issuing his critical audit, lent credence to the widespread 
perception that many problems at Olvera Street stem from lack of good city 
management. He says Riordan can start shaping up the place by quickly 
announcing his appointments to the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to kick-start this thing," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amen! Then, perhaps we can get back to the street's simple delights -- like 
the taquitos.

 Mort Sahl needs to update his material. ("Everyone's Liberal Until It Costs 
Them a Quarter," Voices, July 11.) When his show business friends tell him they 
can't wait for the health plan because it will cover them from the cradle to 
the grave, he tells them, "Why don't you join the Army? You'll get your 
clothes, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Mort, the government reneged on both counts. Those of us who put in 20-30 
years -- World War II, Korea and Vietnam -- now find ourselves on Medicare 
paying for supplemental insurance out of our own pockets just like everybody 
else and petrified that we'll need long-term care that's not covered. 
</P>
<P>
 And, yes, we used to turn in clothing for salvage, but that was way back in 
World War II. Now, after the initial issue, replacement clothing is purchased 
from a minuscule clothing allowance.

<P>
 Ask most L.A. residents to describe South-Central Los Angeles and their 
response likely will include war-zone images of burned-out buildings, 
syringe-littered streets and drive-by shootings. The reality, say those who 
live and work in South-Central, is far different. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Platform, some of the people who travel to South-Central for their 
jobs describe a place just like any other, neighborhoods of decent, caring 
people who are working to change the image of the place they call "home." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people who make those (negative) assertions have never been to 
South-Central," says John Bryant, chairman of Operation Hope, which hosts an 
annual bus trip through the area for business owners in an effort to encourage 
inner-city investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you drive through South-Central you won't see drive-by shootings or 
AK-47s. You will see beautiful well-maintained tree-lined streets," Bryant 
says. "Horrible properties are the exception, not the rule. There is real pride 
of ownership here." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, statistics compiled by the Stockton-based American Savings Bank show 
that inner-city residents are less likely to default on their home mortgage 
than owners of higher priced properties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that the default rates are about half," says John Nunn, senior vice 
president and director of community outreach for the bank. Although Nunn could 
not provide statistics specifically for South-Central, he says, "The default 
rate in the area follows the normal pattern for inner cities." 
</P>
<P>
 While many people maintain that its reputation as a crime-ridden wasteland is 
undeserved, South-Central -- an area without any real boundaries that includes 
a wide range of neighborhoods -- has some real problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime statistics in the LAPD's South Division, which is located in 
South-Central, are higher than anywhere else in the city, says Deputy Chief 
Mark Kroeker who has worked on and off in South Central since 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of being apathetic about the problem, the residents of South-Central 
are enthusiastic about doing something about it," Kroeker says. "The numbers 
are higher but there has been a 13% decrease in major crimes compared to last 
year and homicides are down substantially." 
</P>
<P>
 While the reality of those crime statistics add to the perception of 
South-Central as a dangerous place to live, many believe that the image is 
unfairly perpetuated by the media. "I think the media has a responsibility to 
have a higher sense of consciousness than they have displayed," Bryant says. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the population of South-Central, estimated at anywhere from 500,000 to 1 
million people, is primarily African-American and Latino, the area's image also 
has much to do with racism, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think in most people's minds, South-Central is associated as a black area," 
says Shanto Iyengar, a communications and political science professor at UCLA. 
"There's a tendency to associate African American areas with such attributes as 
high rates of crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be further from the truth, say those who know. "Frankly, you 
have some of the finest people you could ever meet living there," Kroeker says.

THE 'REAL' STORY BEHIND VIOLENT SOCCER CLASHES

 "From a sociological perspective could you explain the phenomena that is 
taking place in Huntington Park?" That was a question a reporter asked me amid 
the commotion sparked by fans of Mexico's World Cup team. The commotion forced 
the police to use non-lethal weapons to disperse a crowd of more than 5,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 As a recently elected official and in my capacity as mayor pro-tem of the city 
of Huntington Park, I was puzzled by the reporter's question. Not being a 
sociologist I could only try to describe what had been happening in my city: 
There was a group of people who were ecstatic that Mexico had advanced to the 
second round in the World Cup. Fearing for the health and safety of our 
residents city officials and police had to be prepared to deal with an 
opportunistic criminal element that loves to create havoc during such events. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrations fueled passions, emotions and feelings in many areas. Quite a 
number of agendas would capitalize on what was happening. And sadly the 
residents of this great city were witnessing a party in their back yard that 
they never intended to host. Furthermore, the party turned unruly, our back 
yard was trashed and the feeling of community that we are trying to achieve 
suffered a real blow because of the media coverage.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of our residents believe the media promoted Huntington Park as "the place 
to be" if you wanted to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 And anti-immigrant forces have used the celebrations to malign Huntington Park 
and "those Mexicans," even going so far as to suggest that Mexicans go back to 
Mexico because they come here only to create trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, an outside criminal element saw a golden opportunity to 
jeopardize the health and safety of our citizens. Throwing bottles at police, 
looting and injuring a couple of people. On the three different dates of the 
World Cup celebrations in this city the number of arrestees totaled 36. Only a 
handful were residents of Huntington Park, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 During our last City Council meeting on July 5, I witnessed efforts aimed at 
further polarizing residents into groups. I will not be part of that. I am a 
Mexican immigrant who was brought here by my parents 22 years ago. I have been 
a U.S. citizen by choice for almost 10 years. I serve all segments of the 
community, and yes, even the media.  
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park is a dynamic established community. And we will be a stronger 
community because of what we have lived through. I'm proud of our residents for 
their tolerance, our business people and our police for their professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the sociological interpretation of what happened, I'll leave that to 
the professionals.

 A Vietnamese woman has just delivered a beautiful healthy baby boy. Nurse 
Crane, her delivery attendant, is puzzled when the new mother ignores the baby 
after she presents him to her.On the hospital records, Nurse Crane describes 
the mother's response as "Bonding: 0." 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Nurse Crane did not know that many Asian people believe a baby is in grave 
danger when first born. To recognize its presence by fussing over it would 
bring too much attention, which might place the baby in jeopardy, a concept 
related to the evil eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese mother was not unconcerned about her baby. On the contrary, she 
cared so much for her child she went through the charade of ignoring him to 
safeguard his life from what she perceived as perilous influences. When Nurse 
Crane later discovered her misinterpretation of the situation at a 
hospital-sponsored cross-cultural awareness workshop, she felt regretful. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1992 film "Indochine," the same attitude toward babies was echoed in 
actress Catherine Deneuve's comments about a newly born Vietnamese baby. "The 
evil spirits are listening," the character said. "If we say we like him, they 
will harm him." 
</P>
<P>
 People from many cultures are reluctant to draw attention to a baby for fear 
of attracting misfortune. After complimenting a child's physical attributes, 
many American Jews try to protect the baby by saying kain ayinhore , which 
translates as "not one evil eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Rule: A seeming lack of demonstrated affection for a child may have different 
meanings for people from other cultures.

 Having worked as a Los Angeles city lifeguard at six urban parks between 1979 
and 1990, I read with interest the articles about the severe beating of 
lifeguard Paul Alba and the attacks of other lifeguards at the Will Rogers pool 
in Watts. I am troubled now, as I was years ago, by the naive parents who drop 
their children off curbside and assume that lifeguards want to and are capable 
of providing day care.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was a lifeguard, the pool staff had essentially no backup other than 
park "locals," often the bag people and drug dealers who are in the park 
everyday. These "park residents" really didn't want to see the police cars come 
around and an agreement was reached between them and the lifeguards: Help keep 
the peace and the pool staff won't have to call the police. If you were a 
parent, would you drop your kid off curbside if you knew the local drug dealer 
was your baby-sitter's best back-up? 
</P>
<P>
 I have been fascinated by TV coverage of police, National Guard troops and 
others trying to deal with the exuberance of youth during the World Cup, the 
Cinco de Mayo carnival and the riots. They had flack jackets, helmets, rubber 
bullets, tear gas, shields and billy clubs. There were dozens of them, and 
their job of calming the masses still wasn't easy. Yet a couple of half-naked, 
barefooted 17-year-old lifeguards are asked to deal with (tough situations). In 
all the articles about the incidents in Will Rogers Park, community members 
spoke of how essential public recreation is to keeping the peace and quality of 
life. Who pays for this type of service? The same funds that pay for increased 
police and other government departments. Other departments -- police, fire, and 
utilities -- have the option of creating public support from growing public 
fears while recreation is often seen as nonessential. 
</P>
<P>
 I am praying for Paul Alba, his wife and child. He went to work because he 
believed he was doing a good thing for his community and for his family. These 
are values we need desperately in our city. He has paid a very high price for 
this noble act and the price he has paid must weigh heavily on all our 
shoulders.

 JOAN IRVINE SMITH 
</P>
<P>
 Businesswoman, founder of Irvine Museum and descendant of family that 
established Orange County's giant Irvine Ranch.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've seen tremendous change in the areas of California where I lived as a 
child -- certainly the coastal areas where I would spend summers at Irvine 
Cove. You have a little bit of feeling of that coastline where Crystal Cove 
State Park is. The Irvine Ranch was beautiful -- rolling hills, grasslands, 
much of it in agriculture, the canyons with indigenous plants, the oak and 
sycamore trees. It was like coming to a pristine and virgin world -- like the 
movie "Sea of Grass" with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn where they 
established this vast cattle ranch in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as time has gone on that has all changed. Certainly, where we made 
our money in the Irvine Co. was through development; but it was planned 
development, for example, the master plan for the city of Irvine. That was one 
of the things that I fought so hard for in the company: to have a master plan 
so that development would not be done in a helter-skelter manner but would 
preserve as much of the environmental landscape as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 I was first exposed to the California Impressionists as a teen-ager when my 
stepfather, a federal judge, would take my mother and me to lunch at the 
California Club where we had the most magnificent collection of plein-air art 
anywhere. It brought to mind the places I recalled growing up. I would stand in 
awe of those paintings as a young girl and think, "My God, if I could ever be 
able to have some of this art!" 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, I collected a few pieces. As the collection grew, it seemed 
to me that this would be a legacy to the people of Orange County. It not only 
is something that people enjoy looking at; it tells the story of what 
California was. It is indeed silent testament to the fact that our environment 
is in danger. When you look at these paintings, you can see what California was 
nearly a century ago -- the unspoiled areas, the wildflowers, the clean air. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean you stop progress. But you plan your progress so that it can 
preserve as much of the natural environment as possible. And I've learned that 
for both sides in this issue it must be a matter of enlightened self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to bring the development and environmental communities together. We 
need to be at a conference table rather than before the Bar.

 The transition from living in an American city to the Israeli kibbutz I 
resided at for two months was not difficult: I needed a change of lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 I was among 10 minority youths sent to the kibbutz to enjoy an intercultural 
experience and help break down racial barriers. Our sponsor was Operation 
Unity, a nonprofit organization headquartered in Los Angeles that mainly 
focuses on bringing the African American and Jewish communities together in 
positive ways.

 Waking up at 4:30 a.m. to do agricultural work, which I was not accustomed to, 
was easy after the first few days. The smiles, blank expressions and compassion 
were the things I saw before, during and after work. At times, we felt like 
exhibits in a museum. Sometimes it was funny and other times it was annoying. 
But I never felt uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversation consumed hours of my time, talking to old and young people, on 
and off the kibbutz. They all wanted to know how I felt because of the dramatic 
difference between kibbutz life and life back at home. The people on Kibbutz 
Beit Zera were warm. They didn't see me as a person of color, they saw me. They 
never wanted to make me feel uncomfortable, and even when we talked about 
sensitive issues, they were always respectful. There was never a hint of 
anything racial or religious. They were interested in me and my feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was the greatest experience I have had because I live in a country 
where history, race and religion seem to be the most important things. While I 
was in Israel, those things were dismissed. My being Afro-Latino was dismissed, 
along with religion of my parents, my history and the history of my people. The 
only things that mattered were my feelings, emotions and thoughts as a human 
being. 
</P>
<P>
 To many people living in Israel, America is still the place to be, the place 
to live with no problems. We often compared the life in Israel to life here. 
Ironically, I was the advocate of Israel and they stood up for America. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that America is not just what they see on TV. After going there, I 
realized that the things we hear about Israel in America are blown way out of 
proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 From my point of view, kibbutz life is easier, I didn't have to worry about 
getting shot just going from my house to a friend's house. Everyone is there to 
help each other, there is not a sense of "if you get in my way, I will step on 
you," but an attitude of "if I make it, I will take you with me." Everything 
there is calm and peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Before I went to Israel, I heard stereotypes about Jewish people, but I never 
had much contact with them. I felt good about the fact that I went there with a 
blank sheet and had no preconceived notions.  
</P>
<P>
 What I learned is that there are good people and bad people among every group 
and that people have different sides to their personalities. If someone were to 
ask me what I think about Jewish people (I can only speak from experience), I 
would say the Jewish people I have met were open-minded, loving and 
understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we must work toward making feelings, emotions and being human more 
important in America than religion, history and race. This is why groups like 
Operation Unity must be supported. 
</P>
<P>
 I plan to do my part. We must all do our part.

<P>
 I work four to five days each week doing typesetting and desktop publishing 
for a union printing company in South-Central, and I've never had any problem. 
Traveling to my job from Echo Park you can see the extreme segregation that 
exists in Los Angeles. I start out in a neighborhood that's mostly white and 
Latino; go through a Mexican area, then a Korean area, then a Salvadoran and 
Central-American area, then through the mix of white and some blacks around the 
University of Southern California and on into the part of South Central where I 
work that's almost entirely African American. 
</P>
<P>
 What puts people in fear of going into some areas is the media hype that 
they'll get car-jacked or robbed or harassed, but that's life in L.A., it's 
what happens when you cram millions of people in somewhere and also separate 
them up. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people believe crime exists because there are bad people, and it's 
true. Bad politicians making cruel and selfish decisions have created the 
poverty and hopelessness that contribute to urban crime. ALEXA MEDLIN

 As a business agent for Local 660 of the Service Employees International 
Union, I represent about 2,000 staffers at Martin Luther King Hospital and 
King-Drew Medical Center, including Augustus Hawkins Hospital for the acute 
mentally ill.  
</P>
<P>
 Not once have I ever had any sort of incident happen in all the time I've 
spent in what's supposed to be a frightening area for white people. I know what 
they say in the news media; they report all the tragic, terrible things that 
happen, but there are so many good things that happen in that area that don't 
get reported. Like kids that study hard and get good grades. Like adults 
working every day, going to church, taking their kids to Boy Scout or Girl 
Scout meetings. Like normal families anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not saying I don't stay alert and take precautions, but if something is 
going to happen to you it will happen, no matter where. I think it's very 
significant that once my car broke down near the hospital and within five 
minutes two kind older gentlemen, Good Samaritans, came along and helped me get 
it started again. SIGMUND STRINGER

 In the 20 years I've worked for the Department of Water and Power, I've gone 
all over Los Angeles, and even worked awhile in the (San Fernando) Valley. Now 
I'm a service person, replacing meters and fixing things, but I've also been a 
meter reader and bill collector for DWP. 
</P>
<P>
 I work out of a base office in Watts -- that's where I park my truck every 
day. I go around Watts, South-Central and the Crenshaw area, and I have no 
problem at all. To tell the truth, I've had most of my troubles with customers 
in affluent areas, where people seem to expect more than they deserve. When I 
collected bills I had to get the payment or turn off service on the spot, and 
people in areas like the Hollywood Hills always had some story -- their check 
was in the mail, maybe, or they'd demand some kind of special treatment. People 
have even asked me to talk to their agents. Which I absolutely don't do. 
</P>
<P>
 In this area of town people don't say much. I've even had them say "thank you" 
when I had to turn off service. 
</P>
<P>
 I do avoid situations when there's a crowd of young people standing around 
that look like gang members; I don't stop there unless it's an emergency. And I 
guess if I was on my own free time I probably wouldn't come down to South Los 
Angeles just to hang around. But trouble can happen anywhere in this city.

 I own a small shopping center in South-Central, and I go down to that area 
about once a week. I've gone daytime, at dusk, in the evening, and I've never 
had anything happen I'd even call an incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center is across from a junior high school, so there's usually a 
lot of teen-agers around. Sometimes I get a cup of coffee at the little 
hamburger stand across the street where a lot of the kids hang out. I never 
feel any more at risk than I do in Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, there's a large shopping center at Slauson and Vermont that I 
understand has one of the highest per-square-foot gross incomes in the entire 
city of Los Angeles. It was not touched in the riots. It's sad that with that 
much success, no other developers will move into the area.

QUICK-CHANGE ARTIST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pessimism about the human condition sometimes can become apocalyptic. "The 
Coming Anarchy" was the title of an Atlantic Monthly article in which Robert 
Kaplan posited chaos in West Africa as a foretaste of the chaos that awaits us 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of human survival is all-encompassing; but before representatives 
of world leaders can begin to try to answer it at September's Cairo conference 
on population, they must understand what kind of question it is. It is at the 
deepest level not only an economic or social or political or even environmental 
question but also a question of evolutionary biology. 
</P>
<P>
 Evolutionary biology is far more than the study of the fossil record. As 
Jonathan Weiner shows in a remarkable new book, "The Beak of the Finch: A Story 
of Evolution in Our Time," it is the study of the continuing biological change 
by which a species either adapts or perishes.  
</P>
<P>
 It may be true, as the old saying goes, that "you can't change human nature." 
But Weiner has marshaled an astounding array of examples showing that under 
extreme evolutionary pressure, extreme and sudden biological change has 
sometimes occurred in other species. Where elephants are being hunted to 
near-extinction for their tusks, tuskless elephants begin to appear. Can humans 
change that drastically? 
</P>
<P>
 Just what kind of change would save Homo sapiens from extinction, not to speak 
of who would implement the change, is far from clear. But credit Weiner with 
moving a bold question a large step toward explicit formulation on the eve of 
an important conference.

THE FRENCH CONNECTION; AIDS-TEST ROYALTY FLAP IS OVER; NOW ON TO THE REAL 
CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the National Institutes of Health have brought a merciful end to 
a rancorous decade-old dispute with the Pasteur Institute in Paris over how 
much each agency deserves in royalties from sales of the blood test for the 
AIDS virus. They agreed last Monday to increase the amounts to be paid to the 
French over the next eight years before the patent runs out. 
</P>
<P>
 While the NIH's statement was couched in legalese meant to blur the obvious, 
the inescapable conclusion was that the U.S. government now admits that its 
scientists used the French-discovered virus without proper credit. 
</P>
<P>
 The French said the Pasteur Institute sent samples of the AIDS virus it had 
isolated to Drs. Robert C. Gallo and Mikulas Popovic of the National Cancer 
Institute and that they had improperly patented the blood test with it. Gallo 
contended that his cultures were inadvertently contaminated with the French 
virus. The NIH's Office of Research Integrity at first charged the men with 
misconduct but dropped the charges on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services had been 
looking into whether the two scientists had committed perjury, mail fraud and 
other criminal acts. He turned the findings over to the U.S. attorney in 
Maryland, where the NIH is located. The U.S. attorney declined to prosecute on 
the grounds that it would be difficult to prove Gallo acted with criminal 
intent and that the statute of limitations had expired. Gallo, who has received 
more than $688,000 in royalties, stoutly denies wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not just scientific egos but millions of dollars of potential royalties until 
the year 2002 are involved. Last Monday, Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the 
NIH, and Dr. Maxime Schwartz, director of the Pasteur Institute, finally worked 
out an agreement that alters the formula for royalties. We hope that ends this 
unseemly dispute and lets researchers and clinicians get on with the real task 
of finding a cure and vaccine for this deadly disease whose reckless path 
respects neither privilege, status or money.

ANYONE FOR ADULT SOLUTIONS TO MEXICO-U.S. BORDER PROBLEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two recent investigations have confirmed fears that corrupt Mexican officials 
are cooperating with sophisticated smuggling rings that import illegal 
immigrants into the United States. To their credit, Mexico City authorities 
have begun a crackdown. But however successful that effort proves to be, it 
won't address the larger challenge -- true and effective regulation of the flow 
of people across the open border. 
</P>
<P>
 OMINOUS CORRUPTION: According to a recent article by Times staff writer 
Sebastian Rotella, the regional chief of the Mexican immigration service in 
Tijuana and two of his deputies have been dismissed and charged with 
corruption. A dozen other Mexican border officials are also under investigation 
by the Mexican Interior Ministry, which oversees that country's immigration 
agency. The government probe grew out of an independent investigation by the 
respected Tijuana-based Bi-National Center for Human Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 That activist group documented what one of its leaders called a "scandalous 
and ominous" pattern of corruption in which regional immigration officials not 
only tolerated people smugglers but, in some instances, actively aided them in 
delivering groups of non-Mexican illegal immigrants across the U.S. border. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-Mexicans account for only about 10% of the illegal immigrants detained by 
the U.S. Border Patrol in its San Diego sector. But they are the most lucrative 
clientele for smugglers. Chinese pay up to $30,000 for illegal entry to this 
country, for example, compared to the $300 or so charged an illegal Mexican 
immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 One can only hope that the crackdown by Mexico City will nip this sleazy but 
profitable enterprise in the bud before it becomes as entrenched as drug 
smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LARGER ISSUE: Mexico City and Washington could help enormously by noting 
that the illegal traffic in non-Mexicans is a problem for both nations -- 
because the despicable activity not only flouts U.S. immigration laws but also 
undermines President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's effort to end official 
corruption in Mexico. That understanding should propel them to cooperate more 
closely on combatting the people smugglers. 
</P>
<P>
 It should, but it might not: Getting any Mexican agency to cooperate with the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service these days is highly problematic. 
The revival of illegal immigration as a political issue in the United States 
has led some U.S. politicians to be downright demagogic, and that has Mexican 
nerves raw. Even as popular and progressive a leader as Salinas would risk 
infuriating Mexicans if cooperation with the INS were seen by his countrymen as 
an accommodation to the anti-immigrant bandwagon. 
</P>
<P>
 What Washington could do for Salinas is to discuss a complex and admittedly 
controversial Mexican proposal that has gotten scant attention in the U.S. 
immigration debate, yet could be a solution to perhaps 50% of the problem: a 
treaty to legalize and then regulate the flow of Mexican workers into -- but 
also eventually out of -- the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it a guest-worker program, a new bracero program -- whatever. U.S. 
officials have been reluctant to discuss it in recent years, even as the 
historic North American Free Trade Agreement was being negotiated with Mexico 
and Canada, because of political opposition from organized labor and some of 
our more strident immigration restrictionists. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REAL CHALLENGE: Yet experts who have studied the flow of people between 
Mexico and the United States have long argued that it is largely, if not 
entirely, an economically motivated migratory flow of workers seeking jobs, not 
immigrants seeking U.S. residency or angling for social service or health 
benefits. If some way could be found to regulate that flow -- making it 
aboveboard and legal, eliminating the exploitation that predictably comes with 
criminality -- then it could be as efficient as the cross-border flow of goods 
and capital now regulated by NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, it's a provocative proposal. But certainly it is no more controversial 
than some of the proposals put forward in this country to "solve" the illegal 
immigration problem, such as ill-conceived notions of denying health care, 
education and even citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. 
Indeed, a bilateral labor pact has a far better chance of working than some of 
those far-fetched ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum a "North American Free Labor Agreement" could help the United 
States control that part of its immigrant flow originating from Mexico -- 
anywhere from 50% to 60% of the problem, if INS arrest statistics are accurate. 
Surely this is a goal well worth pursuing as a start on crafting a rational 
immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is not pursued, all we have are divisive anti-immigrant panaceas and 
periodic crackdowns on officials on both sides of the border who succumb to the 
temptation of easy profit in the trafficking of desperate human beings. The 
laws of economics and human nature being what they are, that approach is likely 
to prove only partially successful at best. And that is just not good enough.

WE CAN ABIDE BY GLOBAL RULES; TRADE: ENFORCEMENT OF GATT BY A NEW WORLD BODY 
WON'T THREATEN U.S. HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE CHARNOVITZ, Steve Charnovitz is policy director of the Competitiveness 
Policy Council in Washington. The views expressed here are his own. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, now 46 years old, has never been 
voted on by the U.S. Congress. So it should not be surprising that the upcoming 
vote on the new World Trade Organization is generating controversy. Rep. Newt 
Gingrich (R-Ga.), Ralph Nader and others are troubled about the impact of the 
WTO on American sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 Treaties are a hot button for many Americans. Thomas Jefferson's warning about 
avoiding "entangling alliances" is embedded in our psyche. Yet most concerns 
about the WTO are unfounded. It cannot overturn our laws. It cannot impose 
taxes on Americans. It is not a "world government." 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue of sovereignty is not as straightforward as some proponents of 
the WTO are asserting. The United States will incur new obligations in joining 
the new organization. And the WTO will raise the costs of American disobedience 
to international rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Some public-interest groups are worried about the WTO's rules regarding 
environmental and health standards for imported products. The purpose of these 
disciplines was to make it harder for nations to use such standards as a guise 
for aiding domestic producers. The Clinton Administration recognized that the 
disciplines were too rigid and succeeded in modifying them slightly during the 
final days of the Uruguay Round of negotiations. Even so, these rules may still 
interfere with legitimate environmental laws. 
</P>
<P>
 If a dispute panel determines that one of our laws violates the WTO, then the 
United States will be called upon to change it. In some cases, there may be 
good reasons to rewrite a law to make it more evenhanded. Nevertheless, 
Congress is not compelled to make the change. If the offending law is not 
amended, however, the WTO will permit the complaining country to respond with 
higher tariffs. How this new procedure will play out remains to be seen. Of all 
the countries in the world, the United States is probably most immune to 
pressure of this sort. 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern raised about the WTO is that it will make it more costly for 
the United States to impose unilateral trade sanctions. That's true. The 
rationale for such American vigilantism was that the international rules were 
inadequate. But improved dispute procedures were achieved during the Uruguay 
Round. If they work, the unilateral sanctions weapon should no longer be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides honesty itself, there is another reason for the advocates of the WTO 
to avoid oversimplification. The isolationists should not be allowed to shape 
the sovereignty debate. In an interdependent global economy, sovereignty is not 
an us-or-them proposition. Effective intergovernmental institutions do not 
subvert the achievement of national will. They promote it through international 
cooperation.  
</P>
<P>
 It is true, as Gingrich says, that world government is not required for world 
trade. But history shows that trade governance is required. International rules 
will be needed until someone finds a cure for protectionism. When nations 
voluntarily sign a code to avoid such self-defeating behavior, they are not 
losing self-determination. They are achieving it. 
</P>
<P>
 Public officials should not hide this basic truth from the American people. 
Given the Uruguay Round's significant economic benefits, congressional approval 
of the treaty ought to be a no-brainer. But more cumbersome agreements will 
probably be needed in the years ahead on economic and environmental issues. 
Perpetuating the fiction that the United States can prosper in its own bubble 
of sovereignty will complicate ratification of future accords.  
</P>
<P>
 Achieving a delicate balance between international rule and national values 
will be a key task of statecraft in the decades ahead. As Europeans discovered 
in the Maastricht debate, managing interdependence requires trial and error. 
The WTO is far from a perfect institution. But it is good for the commonweal 
and should be approved by Congress.

CLEANER AIR BEGINS HERE AT HOME; POLLUTION: WASHINGTON WILL BE A CATALYST FOR 
DEVELOPING STATE AND LOCAL SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FELICIA MARCUS, Felicia Marcus is regional administrator for EPA's Western 
region. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the summer smog thickens around us, it's time to talk about something that 
for many of us is only a dream: clean air. By clean I simply mean healthy to 
breathe -- air that doesn't leave one feeling sluggish all day, doesn't result 
in painful breathing and that perhaps even allows a view of the mountains just 
a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 It was public health, not a pristine image of blue skies, that our national 
lawmakers had in mind when they wrote the Clean Air Act in 1970 and 
strengthened it in 1977 and 1990. Since the passage of this law, tremendous 
progress has been made throughout the nation to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 State and local environmental agencies in California have traditionally been 
national leaders in the area of air-quality control efforts. However, despite 
exceptional efforts and achievements by those agencies, California's air 
quality remains the worst in the nation. Over three-quarters of all 
Californians are exposed to health-threatening levels of air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clean Air Act, state and local agencies are required to develop 
long-term plans to show how they will achieve safe, clean air by specific 
dates. Due to its extraordinary problem, the Los Angeles area was given more 
time than any other city in the nation -- until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in recent years these agencies have not successfully enacted plans 
demonstrating how they will meet the Clean Air Act's standards for public 
health. As a result of this, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has been 
ordered by the courts to craft federal implementation plans (FIPs) to ensure 
that someone provides an overall clean-air plan in these communities. 
Specifically, these court orders affect the South Coast (which includes Los 
Angeles and Orange counties), Sacramento and Ventura air basins. 
</P>
<P>
 The court-ordered plans proposed by the EPA in February require contributions 
from nearly every source of air pollution, including some sources that have not 
been involved before. Tough choices were made, and the EPA will be receiving 
strong reactions -- and, we hope, some constructive alternatives -- in public 
hearings, beginning today at AQMD headquarters in Diamond Bar, and in written 
comments through August. We are not here to impose any particular measure; we 
want to come up with the most environmentally and economically sound plan 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 While we plan to do our best, there are limits to what we can effectively 
implement. We continue to believe -- strongly -- that the best plans can be put 
together only at the state and local level, where there is far more flexibility 
and where these decisions appropriately belong. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's approach in developing these federal plans, therefore, is to look 
for ways to support and augment state and regional clean-air planning efforts 
while working with the business, environmental and local government communities 
to develop the FIPs as an effective backstop. Through our workshops and locally 
generated focus groups, we have seen unprecedented dialogue among these groups 
over what the most cost-effective measures might be.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, this cooperative effort may overshadow the fact that the FIPs do 
not relieve state and local planners from their legal obligation to design and 
implement clean-air measures. A parallel process is occurring to produce a 
local plan -- with hearings scheduled in coming weeks and adoption shortly 
thereafter. It would be a tragedy to focus only on the federal effort and 
ignore the action where it counts most. The residents of each affected 
community, each industry group and the appropriate state and local agencies 
must work to make state and local plans successful. And the federal government, 
while stepping up to the plate with a proposal, must continue to be as 
supportive as possible of those efforts. That is ultimately how the promise of 
the Clean Air Act will be kept.

JUSTICE BY JURY IS A MYTH; LAW: LAY PEOPLE ARE NO MATCH FOR CRAFTY LAWYERS, 
IRRATIONAL PROCEDURES AND UNINTELLIGIBLE INSTRUCTION FROM THE BENCH. 
</P>

 Speculation is rampant about O. J. Simpson's chances at the hands of a jury. 
But the debate over fairness, pretrial publicity, celebrity and so on misses 
the point. It is an enduring and profound truth that juries have never been 
reliable vehicles for the equitable resolution of trial court disputes. Here's 
why: 
</P>
<P>
 * The American lay jury is a howling anachronism. Originally effective during 
colonial times as a bulwark against the judges appointed by England, the jury 
today has become a pawn in the hands of skilled and well-financed litigators. 
As modernity brings us more complexity, continued use of the lay jury for many 
litigated disputes is dysfunctional. Uninformed and unjust decisions result. 
</P>
<P>
 In what other problem-solving endeavor would we rely exclusively on people 
with virtually no expertise in or firsthand knowledge of the matter to be 
resolved? This reaches the height of irrationality when we ask lay people to 
judge the testimony of expert witnesses in scientific and technological fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * The law abides the paradox of jury lawlessness. This phenomenon, also known 
as jury nullification, is unique to American law. Initially, jurors are sworn 
to obey the judge's legal instructions. Yet in deliberations, the power of 
jurors to ignore the law is inviolable, defended by pillars of the bench and 
bar alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * The adversary and jury systems combine to deliver a witch's brew of trial 
justice. For years, crafty attorneys have prevailed, in contravention of the 
merits of their cases, by plying myriad forensic tricks and pandering to the 
basest of juror emotions. Not only does the legal profession condone these 
tactics, it also instructs in their use through law school courses and 
practitioner seminars. In a survey of Los Angeles jurors I conducted in 1988 
(the largest in the United States), more than one-third believed that the 
outcome of the cases they sat on had been dictated by a disparity in skills 
between the opposing attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disparate financial resources between litigants skew jury trial results. The 
wealthier the litigant, the better the available legal representation. I refer 
not only to better attorneys, but also to more persuasive expert witnesses, and 
to litigation support services that help to "scientifically" select the most 
favorably disposed jurors. These factors influenced the first Rodney King case, 
the William Kennedy Smith rape case and the Bobbitt, Menendez and Damian 
Williams cases.  
</P>
<P>
 * Antediluvian procedural rules cripple even elemental jury fact-finding. 
While the law reposes the most solemn obligations upon the jury -- 
determination of guilt or innocence in criminal cases; assignment of rights, 
duties and damage awards in civil cases -- it denies jurors basic independent 
fact-finding tools. Most courts, for instance, forbid jurors to ask questions, 
take notes or see a transcript of the testimony. I call this the jury idiot 
savant syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most judicial instructions are worthless. Rather than explain or clarify the 
law, the judge's instructions usually confound the jurors with jargon-laden, 
incomprehensible language -- worded to avoid appellate reversal, not to guide 
jurors. Consequently, jurors commonly deliberate and vote in ignorance of the 
law as given from the bench, referring instead to their personal values and 
biases, or succumbing to the emotions evoked by attorney pandering. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad jury verdicts -- those abrasively inconsonant with both the law and common 
notions of justice and decency -- are not the product of some misguided new 
morality, but rather are and have always been endemic to our jury system. They 
will continue so until the system is reformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Needed reforms would first remove complex and technical cases from juries, and 
then empower juries in the remaining cases. Engaged jurors are more effective 
jurors. Allow them to ask questions and take notes. In deliberations, permit 
them to retrieve from computers any part of the transcribed testimony or the 
judge's instructions. Use neutral instead of partisan expert witnesses. Above 
all, reword instructions so that if jurors want to follow the law, they can 
actually understand it.

PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA; A BALKANS PEACE THAT CANNOT LAST; THE WEST-IMPOSED 
DIVISION IS UNWORKABLE AND UNJUST, AND WILL ENCOURAGE ULTRANATIONAL FORCES 
ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEMAL KURSPAHIC, Kemal Kurspahic is Washington-based editor and 
correspondent for the newspaper Oslobodjenje. He was editor in chief in 
Sarajevo until March and was named 1993 International Editor of the Year by 
World Press Review magazine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For me as a Bosnian it has been sad to watch international mediators, 
including, it seems, the leaders of the G-7 nations, carve up my homeland. The 
European Union's Lord David Owen and the U.N.'s Thorvald Stoltenberg even sat 
with the self-proclaimed leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic (who is 
neither a Bosnian nor a Serb, because he came from the mountainous Montenegrin 
region of Durmitor, nor even a leader, because he ran for no public office in 
the first free elections in Bosnia in 1990). In their discussions on a terrace 
overlooking the Drina River in the town of Zvornik, they proposed dividing 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, giving 51% of its territory to the newly created 
Bosnian-Croat federation and 49% to Serbian forces. This plan has since been 
ratified by the Western powers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few towns that symbolize all the weaknesses of this formula for 
division as strongly as Zvornik. It was one of the first Bosnian towns stormed 
by the Serbian paramilitary forces, supported by the Yugoslav Army, in their 
genocidal campaign of "ethnic cleansing" in April, 1992. The Muslim majority 
was either expelled or killed, including correspondent Kjasif Smajlovic, who 
was executed while writing in his office for my paper, the Bosnian Independent 
Daily (Oslobodjenje). He was the first journalist killed in the war in Bosnia. 
Thus Zvornik became an almost ethnically "pure" Serbian town. And there, now, 
in Zvornik sat the European and U.N. mediators with the person most responsible 
for this and so many other crimes, discussing ways to legalize the Serbs' 
violation of all the norms upon which the "new world order" was supposed to 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Look again at Zvornik to see one of the best examples why this latest design 
to divide Bosnia is not only legally and morally wrong in rewarding aggression 
and "ethnic cleansing," but also unworkable. Even if Karadzic and his Serbian 
boss, Slobodan Milosevic, agree to the proposed formula, how can they tell 
their followers, who they moved to other people's towns, homes and property, to 
leave? There are tens of thousands of Serbs who now occupy other people's homes 
in the Serbian-occupied parts of Bosnia, who would be required to leave if 
Serbian conquests were reduced from more than 70% to 49% of Bosnian territory. 
Many of those Serbs committed unspeakable crimes, killing thousands of innocent 
civilians and expelling almost the whole Muslim population, including my 
mother, Sena, and my good old stepfather, Kemal Kolonic. They had to leave 
their home in Prijedor, their family house and land and their newly bought Ford 
Fiesta, and also pay 2,000 German marks each just for a Serbian ausweiss -- 
permission to leave as propertyless refugees. How are such Serbs to be told 
that there is now some peace agreement and they have to leave the houses, lands 
and goods they acquired? Serbs are not going to surrender any of this 
voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 I think there is a better path, at least for the United States. Instead of 
joining the Europeans in dividing Bosnia, President Clinton could build on his 
own initial successes. Those include the removal of the Serbian artillery 
around Sarajevo and Gorazde and the more decisive protection of other "safe 
havens," implementation of the "no-fly zone" and, especially, the creation of a 
Bosnian-Croat federation and cessation of the fighting between the Croatian and 
Bosnian armies. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of appeasing the Serbs by allowing them to create their "Greater 
Serbia" empire, the world should insist that they accept the same 
constitutional framework and the same rights and guarantees accepted by the 
Bosnians and Croats in the redesigned Bosnian federation. The Serbs should be 
told that there is no prospect of recognition of their conquests or of the 
borders they have changed by force. They should be told that there is no 
prospect of easing or lifting of sanctions against Serbia until they accept an 
internationally sponsored just and durable peace. There should be an extended 
threat of the use of air power to protect Bosnian towns and a lifting of the 
arms embargo against Bosnia to give that country a fair chance for self-defense 
and even liberation of its territories if peace efforts fail. 
</P>
<P>
 These sorts of conditions and demands have already been tested, with the 
Croats. There was a strong ultranationalistic current among them, asking for a 
division of Bosnia and creation of a "Croatian Republic" on Bosnian soil. But, 
faced with the threat of sanctions and international isolation, they opted for 
federation. Given the proper message of resolve, instead of legalization of 
their crimes, Serbs would, sooner or later, do the same. And, more important, 
that wouldn't be a message just to them, but to all other ultranationalists 
throughout the Balkans and Eastern Europe -- starting with Serbia's best 
friend, the Russian rightist Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- who see creation of 
Greater Serbia as a signal that they, too, can fight for their dream empires. 
President Clinton recently stated that the United States and NATO should not 
change the military balance or enter the war on one side against the other. But 
that is exactly what they did by imposing the embargo and keeping Bosnia's 
hands tied in the face of brutal aggression. They gave the Serbs the decisive 
advantage in the war. President Clinton would now do much better if he followed 
his own, tougher course than by joining the Europeans in their attempts to 
impose an unjust and unworkable division on Bosnia.

ANN CONWAY: TENOR IS THE NIGHT; OPERA PACIFIC SUPPORTERS THRILL TO 'ENCORE' 
CONCERT AT DODGER STADIUM; GOP HEAVYWEIGHTS TURN OUT FOR $2,500-PER-PERSON BASH 
AT NIXON LIBRARY

 Opera Pacific supporters traded their lorgnettes and chocolates for binoculars 
and popcorn on Saturday when they joined 50,000 music-lovers -- Frank Sinatra, 
among them -- for the historic "Encore! The Three Tenors!" concert at Dodger 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Zipping to Los Angeles via the Orange Blossom Bus Line, members of Opera 
Pacific's Viva Guild sampled box suppers containing Italian chicken and 
tiramisu before taking their seats -- some as pricey as $300 each -- to watch 
Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti join conductor Zubin Mehta 
for the Southern California reprise of their precedent-setting 1990 Rome 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Guild members were stunned by the transformation of Dodger Stadium. On view, 
instead of the usual baseball diamond and blinking scoreboard: hundreds of 
stately palm trees, twin rock waterfalls 48-feet high, 20 classical columns and 
a painted backdrop of lush valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Rappaport, for one, was confused by the juxtaposition of palms with 
classical columns. "Rome?" she wondered. And then looking at the roaring 
waterfalls: "Yosemite?" 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. The whole thing was out of this world. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrilling the crowd with classical favorites such as "Vesti La Giubba," "Ave 
Maria" and "Nessun Dorma," the tenors also gave their California audience a 
medley they could hum along with (and some did) when they performed "A Tribute 
to Hollywood."  
</P>
<P>
 With boyish pleasure the tenors delivered, "Singing in the Rain," (at which 
audience member Gene Kelly took a bow), "Moon River," "Be My Love," "All I Ask 
of You," "My Way" (with a nod from Sinatra) and more. "I wish they'd sing 'Some 
Enchanted Evening,' " said Andy Cies, who attended the concert with his wife, 
Leslie, and children Jenny and Andrew. 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't. But the tenors gave the opera buffs something that kept them 
coming back to their seats: encore after encore after encore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," said a wide-eyed tour organizer Buck Buchanan, guild 
chairman. "They have given us so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the trip were Karen Hardin and Carole Follman (who opted to take a 
limo to the event: "Our husbands are salmon fishing in Alaska, so we thought 
we'd treat ourselves," Follman said), Bill and Laila Conlin, Ed McGrath, Janet 
Curci, Maxine Gibson, Donna Bunce and Ed McGrath.

 Richard M. Nixon Tribute: In a West Coast first, the Richard Nixon Library & 
Birthplace re-created a White House-style state dinner in tribute to the 37th 
President of the United States. The price tag? A whopping $2,500 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Guests -- who included Nixon's brother Ed Nixon, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole (R-Kan.), Gov. Pete Wilson and his wife, Gayle, Bob and Dolores Hope, and 
Gene and Jackie Autry -- mingled on a hillock near Richard and Pat Nixon's 
memorial sites, sipping libations and sampling appetizers, before entering the 
Yorba Linda library for a sit-down repast prepared by Henry Haller, former 
White House executive chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving by a helicopter, Dole mingled with guests who also included Judy and 
George Argyros (chairman of the library's Legacy of Peace campaign), Caroline 
Ahmanson and Arco Chairman Lod Cook before they dined on Colorado mountain 
smoked trout, sorrel soup, California pink grapefruit sorbet, stuffed veal loin 
and orange mousse embellished with a chocolate presidential seal. The menu for 
the "Architect of Peace" tribute duplicated one prepared at a 1970 state dinner 
for Nixon and French President Georges Pompidou. 
</P>
<P>
 During the reception, Dole noted that the library was the one presidential 
library that is privately funded. "So, it's very important that we preserve it, 
" he said. (Later, during his address, Dole told the black-tie crowd: "The more 
time I spend in presidential libraries, the more I wonder how one would look in 
Russell, Kan.," his hometown). 
</P>
<P>
 Of Nixon's quest for peace, Dole said: "He really believed in it . . . he took 
all of those trips to Russia and China and other places because he believed in 
it -- didn't want anymore conflict for the next generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to be strong too. We have to have a strong defense. We're not 
looking for anything, don't want any territory. But the world has to know we 
are carrying a pretty heavy load. We are the leaders of the free world; nobody 
else out there is equipped to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Nixon's death in April, Ed Nixon has tried to carry on his brother's 
legacy. "Peace is what tonight is all about," said Nixon, a geologist who came 
from Washington state for the affair. "Since my brother's passing, I've 
traveled and I'm planning to do more in keeping with the mission he has charged 
us all with, to get out in the world and stir it up -- try to show them where 
the bear went through the buckwheat, because they don't seem to be able to see 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hope and Autry were inseparable during the cocktail reception. Sitting at a 
small table near the Nixon birthplace, they reminisced and talked of peace. "I 
knew the late President for many years," said Autry, who sported 
nugget-and-diamond studs on his formal shirt (and a galaxy of red, white and 
blue stars on the lining of his jacket.) "I was here with him a few years ago . 
. . it's nice to come back and see the library again." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hope: "I think people are getting smarter about the need for working on 
bringing peace to the world. We need to pray hard for peace; it would be a 
wonderful thing for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests: Peter and Mary Muth; Betty Hutton Williams; Clara Jane 
Nixon (widow of Richard Nixon's late brother, Don); Maurice Stans, who was 
secretary of commerce in the Nixon Administration (and who was honored at the 
event for his ardent fund-raising on behalf of the library); Dr. Howard House; 
Mary Ann and Lon Wells; Paul and Virginia Knott Bender; Chapman College 
President James Doti and his wife, Lynn; Bruce and Pam Nestande; and Glen and 
Dotti Stillwell.

 It was like old times, almost, at the opening-night performance of "The Who's 
Tommy" on Friday night at the Universal Amphitheatre. The sounds of one of the 
consummate, hard-core, rock 'n' roll party bands of the late '60s and '70s 
prompted recollections of bygone youth -- sweet recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used to smash up their instruments all over the place," Linda LoRe, 
chairwoman of Giorgio Beverly Hills, recalled wistfully. "This was the 
toned-down version, but I felt like I was in high school again." 
</P>
<P>
 "I started college in '67 -- this is a soundtrack of my college years," 
producer Steve Tisch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have things missing from my eardrums from Who concerts I attended," 
said Gary Goldberg, also among the opening-night crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 But the that-was-then, this-is-now ambience included a lack of illegal 
substances in this audience. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the event was partly business -- a "network-fest," as one mid-level 
Fox television executive put it with mock pleasure. The operatic saga of the 
"deaf, dumb and blind kid" was the centerpiece of an evening benefiting 
Children's Action Network and Education First!, entertainment industry-based 
nonprofit charities for kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The networking potential was awesome. MCA President Sid Sheinberg and his 
wife, Lorraine; Sony Pictures Chairman Peter Guber and his wife, Lynda; Hearst 
Entertainment CEO Jerry Isenberg and his wife, Carole, and Kate Capshaw and 
Steven Spielberg were the evening's co-chairs, though the Spielbergs didn't 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Steel, Penny Marshall, Mayor Richard Riordan, Neil Simon, New York Knicks 
Coach Pat Riley, "Seinfeld's" Julia Louis-Dreyfus, and "Forrest Gump's" Gary 
Sinise were among the guests. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, the bells and whistles continued at a post-party (complete 
with pinball machines with "Jurassic Park" themes), located in some uncharted 
territory beyond Universal's CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the Who's Pete Townshend sought refuge in the safety of a corner, 
seeming so gentle and low-key it was impossible to imagine him smashing even a 
fly. "I never really understood that somehow 'Tommy' has assumed a life of its 
own outside of rock, not just the Who," Townshend said. "I had no conception it 
would happen like this."

 Reborn to Be Wild: The crowd at the Laemmle's Sunset 5 on Thursday was 
redolent with recently purchased leather wear for the premiere of the 25th 
anniversary and re-release of the hippie-biker classic "Easy Rider." (The 
pre-screening paparazzi frenzy was partially eclipsed by Julio Iglesias making 
an appearance at the record store one flight below.) There was also a 
post-screening party at Thunder Roadhouse, a biker-themed restaurant and 
emporium on the Sunset Strip. This '60s flashback was the brainchild of the 
co-owners of the restaurant, Mike Eisenberg and the film's stars, Peter Fonda 
and Dennis Hopper. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: A generous helping of film- and music-biz types, erstwhile 
bikers and biker wanna-bes (with a dash of the real thing), and a smattering of 
celebs culled from both the Age of Aquarius and Generation X. These included 
Fonda and Karen Black from the film, Jon Lovitz, Sally Kirkland and Rick (once 
upon a time known as Ricky) Schroder. Disappointing no-shows included Hopper, 
the film's director and star, and "Easy Rider" fan Tonya Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Event: After the film, Fonda roared down Sunset Boulevard with the 
Uglys, the salt-and-pepper-topped biker gang he belongs to. "It was their 
idea," Fonda said about the 20-bike procession to Thunder Roadhouse. "They're 
very ugly about these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Chow: A buffet of Roadhouse ribs, beef chili, pasta and salad. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I've become an icon," said Fonda, who pointed out that "Easy Rider" 
was the eighth of 44 films he's been in. "Wherever I go in the world, I'm 
introduced as 'Captain America' or 'Easy Rider.' And that's 25 years of it. And 
it'll never be different. But that's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "Oh, this?" remarked one guest who eschewed black leather in favor 
of more season-friendly summer cottons. 'I call it 'Born to Be Mild.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Fondest Look Back: "I never did realize how pretty I was," said Black, who 
hadn't watched the film since it was first released. "All that stuff is from 
one's self, and when I was saying in the movie, 'Oh, I want to be pretty. Oh, I 
want to be pretty,' I really wanted to be pretty. I guess I already was and I 
didn't know it."

BOOK REVIEW: NOVEL; A WEST COAST LOVE STORY -- FOR SHORT-TERM VISITORS ONLY;

 I like Linda in spite of my, and her, self. She is, to put it lightly, unlucky 
in love, and that encompasses all kinds of love -- marital, step-parental, 
maternal, gal-to-gal. 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet her, she is trying to complete a coast-to-coast trek and settle 
in Southern California before her recently deceased husband's Mustang conks 
out. Her teen-age stepdaughter, Robin, is with her because Robin's real mother 
has less than sufficient interest in reclaiming her. So Linda, in her late 20s, 
is saddled with a stepkid, an unreliable car in auto-dependent Los Angeles and 
no discernible job skills. Moreover, she is pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's something about her that's irresistible (it's impossible to read 
this novel without thinking about it being a movie, so for the sake of 
reference, this is the Meg Ryan role). No sooner have they landed in a 
Hollywood apartment than Linda finds Manny, manager of the local Liquor Barn, 
divorced, available and so instantly smitten by Linda's naive honesty that he 
teaches her how to be a cashier so he can give her a job. 
</P>
<P>
 They fall into a cozy relationship so fast that I wondered how author Hilma 
Wolitzer was going to vamp to the end of the book. No problem. Manny takes a 
bullet in the eye; the sullen stepdaughter nicknames Linda the "kiss of death," 
and now the reader is fairly well hooked.  
</P>
<P>
 Will Linda ever find true romance? Will Robin survive puberty? Will Linda find 
a way to support both Robin and the new baby she and her husband conceived 
during their all-too-brief marriage? 
</P>
<P>
 Natch. Before you can say "liquor store holdup," Linda has been rescued by 
Nathan (I don't know; maybe Keanu Reeves), possibly the only adorable, 
hard-working young man in Los Angeles to be swept off his feet by an unemployed 
mom of two who can't even keep her car in tune. He gets her a job teaching 
dance exercise at an upscale body works emporium, which leads to work as a 
private trainer for the rich and powerful Cynthia Sterling, which leads to a 
truly nasty subplot that pits birth mother against acquisitive power-monger. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't figured it out by now, the entire book is the tunnel of 
love of the title -- dark, mysterious, a little unpredictable, but worth the 
ride for the strong of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 And heaven knows, Linda is a heroine for the ages, as plucky as they come, 
loyal to the members of her extended family no matter how they mistreat or 
disappoint her, a female Job without any of his crankiness.  
</P>
<P>
 Linda never seems to ask, "Why me?" Instead, she spends much of her time 
trying to fix things. She is the optimistic pragmatist: She truly, devoutly 
believes in her own ability to make things better, however long it may take. 
</P>
<P>
 On one level she's irresistible, which is why I kept coming back to this book, 
night after night, despite a nagging sense that there was marginally less here 
than met the eye. Linda gives the reader back the sense that happiness is 
possible, that love is available; if a demographic casualty can come out the 
other end so happy, why not those of us who are a bit more socially advantaged? 
It's like that pop song of a few years ago -- "Don't Worry. Be Happy." 
</P>
<P>
 A lovely sentiment, and one Wolitzer manages to convey without slipping into 
sentimentality or schmaltz. The problem is that Linda is a visitor, a newcomer, 
and something about her experience just doesn't ring true.  
</P>
<P>
 The setups and situations sound perilously like Big Orange cliches, the sorts 
of things that writers dream up, and civilians assume, after not enough time 
here. Cynthia is a central casting Hollywood bad girl; Nathan is a romantic 
descendant of Ricardo Montalban; Robin sounds like the doomed "Foxes." They're 
just a little too easy, a little too smooth. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes poor Linda can let faith get the better of her.  
</P>
<P>
 The first time Nathan gives her an excuse about not getting together (he's 
getting the flu or something, but no, he doesn't want her to bring him 
something to eat), all the reader's alarm bells go off: He's lying, you want to 
shout; get out of this before you get your heart broken yet again. But Linda 
literally braves fire when he doesn't answer his phone. What if his building's 
been burned? What if he's hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 Then she buys his explanation that he was so tired he didn't even hear her -- 
and oh, yeah, the car was gone because he loaned it to a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing more unbelievable than that is that she buys it. Linda buys 
everything and in the end gets more than her money's worth; something of a 
fairy tale, in these scared, suspicious times, set in an imaginary place where 
Cinderella prevails. It's not the great West Coast novel. It's a visitor's love 
story.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; BUMPY OUTING FOR PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in public isn't easy if you're still a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case with Stone Temple Pilots, the mega-selling young hard-rock 
band that has been thrust into the hit-maker's spotlight at a time when its 
four members are clearly unprepared to deliver a convincing stage show. 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially true of singer Scott Weiland, who earned poor marks for both 
charisma and comportment on Saturday at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 You could tell that Weiland was trying to be a nice guy, mainly addressing the 
audience in a friendly, if pro forma way. But before long he couldn't help 
flying into a foul-mouthed, incoherent rage at somebody in the audience for 
"invading my space" -- apparently he'd been hit by something hurled from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 If a star wants to zing someone in an audience who gets out of line, fine. But 
do it with some wit and coherence. Of course, wit and coherence aren't 
Weiland's strong suits as a lyricist, either, so perhaps it's too much to 
expect him to extemporize effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland was right about having his space invaded, though. Robert DeLeo's 
raging bass dominated the audio mix to the point where it frequently came close 
to obliterating both Weiland's grainy vocals and Dean DeLeo's guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a testament to the sweep and insistence of STP's melodic hooks that the 
crowd frequently sang along to a singer who couldn't be heard well. It's the 
catchy choruses and the meaty, Zeppelin-style riffing that have landed Stone 
Temple Pilots' just-released second album, "Purple," near the top of the charts 
at the same time that the band's grunge-oriented 1992 smash, "Core," is still 
doing brisk business. STP chose its material well, playing 10 of the 11 songs 
on "Purple" and including the better half of the "Core" stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a clear, sinewy sound, though, no band can flourish. Potential blazers 
such as the Nirvana-like "Unglued" were blunted by the mix. More music got 
through on such stately numbers as "Big Empty" and "Interstate Love Song." 
Clarity came only during a passable, three-song acoustic set that included a 
brisk if inconsequential rendering of David Bowie's "Andy Warhol." 
</P>
<P>
 As a frontman, Weiland simply doesn't have it yet. He did the boring Jim 
Morrison microphone cling, and he did a lot of odd little arm-waving, 
hip-waddling steps in a stooped position, which made him look like an arthritic 
old man trying to dance the limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 26-year-old with only two albums behind him, let's hope he's in the early 
stages of a rising learning curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Two heroes of the '80s indie-rock movement -- the newly successful Meat 
Puppets and the still-struggling Redd Kross -- formed a tasty undercard. Meat 
Puppets' honed instrumental flash, varied material and magical visions are a 
nice switch from the '90s gloom-rock norm; Redd Kross offered juicy pop 
harmonies and an affectionate, tongue-in-cheek take on the stage antics of such 
'70s funsters as the Kinks, Slade and Cheap Trick. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stone Temple Pilots, the Meat Puppets, Redd Kross and Whiskey Biscuit appear 
on Tuesday at the Greek Theatre, 2700 N. Vermont Ave., 6 p.m. Sold out. (213) 
480-3232 .

MUSIC REVIEW; GREATEST TENOR SHOW ON EARTH; PAVAROTTI, DOMINGO, CARRERAS STIR 
SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If bigger really is better, the megatenor show -- some called it a concert -- 
at Dodger Stadium Saturday night must have been one of the best. Perhaps the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 There they were on the stage in center field, beaming: a trio of contenders 
for the universal Golden-Larynx award. The three bases were loaded. And, thanks 
to massive microphone distortion, the three tenors were louded. 
</P>
<P>
 A few churls might dispute their status as the world's greatest exponents of 
high-wire and high-tessitura acts in opera and beyond. But everyone must agree 
that Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras are the most popular. 
Also the best paid. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to find them on the distant, sprawling stage, where they resembled 
ants in formal attire. No matter. They loomed nice and large on the massive 
DiamondVision screen beneath the Coca-Cola sign and above what used to be the 
left-field pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Used to be? The pavilions, dear reader, were transformed for this festive 
occasion into a glowing-chartreuse rainforest, complete with mock-exotic flora 
and 20 -- count 'em, 20 -- quasi-Grecian pillars imported strictly from 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, dear. I almost forgot to mention the matching pair of waterfalls. These 
picturesque forces of towering nature were considerately simulated by silent 
lights during the singing, and activated by noisy water at intermission time. 
</P>
<P>
 And the famous fauna? 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti, 58, looked svelte (by his standards) and just a smidge smug as he 
stoutly defended his de facto position of primo uomo . The tenorissimo may have 
sounded a bit rough, especially at the top, over the tinny over-amplification 
system, but his dreamy ardor remained undimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo, 53, looked urgently debonair -- the cameras revealed a lot of fancy 
eyebrow-work -- and he sounded urgently, heroically mellifluous as always. 
Contrary to predictions, he refrained from picking up the baton at any time, 
and no one seemed to object. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras, at 47 the baby in the group and the fellow with the lightest vocal 
resources, seemed almost self-effacing. He took over most of the finesse work. 
While his friendly rivals offered a lot of belting, he floated gentle 
pianissimo phrases onto the nocturnal breezes, and flirted with danger only 
when he pushed the relatively fragile tone at his command beyond the comfort 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All three protagonists had to contend with a little time warp. Their televised 
visages lagged disconcertingly behind their ever-echoing voices. So much for 
the technological miracles of synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic played everything with stoic bravura -- from 
soupy "Because" to a nutty "Traviata" drinking song in which three grown men 
took turns portraying the courtesan heroine. Players and singers responded with 
unflagging energy to the energetic urgings of Zubin Mehta. The supermaestro, 
who seems to like to commute from the sublime to the ridiculous, arrived on 
loan from the Munich Opera, where he is buried chest-deep in the zonking 
Wagnerism of "Tannhauser." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger Stadium audience, it must be noted, responded with energy of its 
own. The throng of incipient aficionados, estimated at 53,000, roared its 
unison approval at every Luftpause , and often between Luftpausen . 
</P>
<P>
 The fans had paid dearly for the privilege. A good (and in many cases 
not-so-good) seat cost $1,012. The average expenditure for the "Encore! The 
Three Tenors" may have further included $20 for parking, $40 for a souvenir 
polo shirt, and Verdi-knows-what for liquid refreshment. 
</P>
<P>
 The stargazers at this convocation of greatest high-voiced hits, runs and 
errors were especially happy, and especially demonstrative, when they 
recognized a tune -- the sacred strains of "Ave Maria," for instance. Those out 
front who came equipped with leather lungs and boundless optimism also yelled 
helpful programming suggestions. "Nessun dorma" seemed to be high on 
everybody's wish-list. I swear I also heard requests for "Melancholy Baby" and 
"Shortnin' Bread." 
</P>
<P>
 This certainly was an Event. Note the uppercase E. It certainly was Grand. Cap 
G. But was it a grand night for singing? 
</P>
<P>
 You don't want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, the singing seemed virtually irrelevant. This was a 
night for celebrating personalities and personality-cults. This was a night for 
self-congratulation en masse, and a night for making -- as well as spending -- 
a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it was just a night for fun. Chacun a son de gou t . Contrary to 
promises of an overworked hype-machine, it certainly wasn't a night for serious 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceedings probably made better sense, and better sound, at home on 
television. Unlike the rest of the universe, the host city had to wait for a 
delayed broadcast on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opted for the comfort of their living rooms enjoyed at least one 
indisputable advantage. They avoided the traffic marmalade that found at least 
one chagrined reporter -- this one -- stalled, along with thousands of fellow 
non-travelers, in a car cemetery masquerading as a freeway while Mehta and the 
Philharmonic dashed through the "Candide" overture. Also while Carreras 
mustered an aria from "Le Cid." Also while Domingo introduced an aria from 
"Luisa Miller." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival, it wasn't exactly easy, or speedy, for your befuddled scribe to 
wend his circuitous way from an assigned parking spot atop the stadium to a 
seat miles away at the far side of row 18 on the field. Still, all was not 
lost. It was possible to do some acoustical testing in transit. The testing 
suggested that the customers in the stands were noisy, and the low-fidelity 
sound-system was even noisier. 
</P>
<P>
 Who sang what? It was hard to tell, even with a $10 souvenir program. 
</P>
<P>
 All three tenors changed their minds about solo repertory choices, but no one 
deemed it worthwhile to inform the patrons about what was added, subtracted or 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio medleys arranged by Lalo Schifrin closed both halves of the rather 
skimpy program under vague umbrella-titles. The first was a misleading "Tribute 
to Hollywood" that included such strangers to the cinematic paradise as 
"Because" (1902) and "My Way"; the second was a multipurpose melange called 
"Around the World." In both cases, the individual songs, composers and 
lyricists remained unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavarotti was blasting Werther's "Pourquoi me reveiller" in a language 
curiously akin to French as we made our way to our folding chairs. The Massenet 
aria replaced the scheduled "Boheme" narrative. Later the divo delivered the 
intimate sentiments of "Non ti scordar di me" (De Curtis) rather robustly, "Ave 
Maria" rather operatically, and -- surprise -- "Nessun dorma" rather tightly. 
This wasn't his finest night. 
</P>
<P>
 Carreras' solos included "With a Song in My Heart," "Tu, ca non chiagne" (De 
Curtis again), and, in place of the scheduled Tomb Scene from "Lucia," "E 
lucevan le stelle" from "Tosca." He sang all three sweetly, some pitch and 
pressure problems notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Domingo, in remarkably vibrant voice, exulted in the extrovert passions of 
"Granada," an aria from Moreno Torroba's zarzuela "Maravilla," and "Vesti la 
giubba." 
</P>
<P>
 The innocuous "Hollywood" medley found the Big Three serenading Frank Sinatra 
in "My Way" and Gene Kelly in "Singin' in the Rain." Both, seated in the 
audience, waved their appreciation on DiamondVision. The song list also 
included "America" from "West Side Story," and something that sounded like 
"Moona Reevair," from "Breakfast at Tiffany's." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While bouncing in their "Around the World" grab bag, our heroes took turns 
with "America" again, followed by "All I Ask of You," "Funiculi, Funicula," 
"Sous les ponts de Paris," "Brasil," "Be My Love," "Marechiare," the "Merry 
Widow" waltz, "Santa Lucia Luntana," something that may have been "Te quiero 
dijiste" and "Torna a Surriento." 
</P>
<P>
 Encore time -- a very generous, very repetitive time -- brought two separated 
performances of Verdi's "La donna e mobile" with a competitive triple-cadence 
added, "O sole mio" with its now-famous trill lesson (Pavarotti trying, in 
vain, to show his emulators how to do it), the "Traviata" "brindisi" with 
Violetta in vocal drag, an all-too complete rerun of the "Hollywood" medley, 
and, finalmente , "Nessun dorma" in the beloved 
anything-you-can-sing-I-can-sing-too version. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puccini aria was preceded by the usual " you -do-it-no- you -do-it" 
pantomime routine. So much for mock spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The encores were sampled from relatively cheap seats (only $150!) in the low 
stands behind home plate. The sound here certainly wasn't realistic. It was 
cleaner, however, better focused and better balanced than in the presumably 
posh surroundings up front. The distant sightlines seemed more advantageous 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 * The vaunted pirates of the high Cs ventured nothing higher than a B.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'ACTION NEWS' LAYS ANOTHER STINK BOMB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The same TV column that once urged that separate channels be established for 
car chases, for Amy Fisher and for Michael Jackson is now asking -- make that 
begging -- for a specia O.J. Channel (OJC). 
</P>
<P>
 Puleeeeeeze . 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it would work: You're an O. Junkie? Fine. Switch to 24-hour OJC, 
because the rest of TV is mentioning the Simpson-Goldman murder case only when 
there's something legitimate to report, and then only in context with other 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure. Fat chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it's excruciatingly obvious now that television's expanding lunatic 
fringe -- the hot-panting, hyperventilating O. Jerks, O. Jesters and O. 
Jackasses of the airwaves -- will be laying down a daily trail of smelly news 
droppings all the way to Simpson's expected trial. Or are the lunatics now the 
mainstream? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's stinkiest "bombshell" exploded at KCBS-TV Channel 2, where 
reporter Harvey Levin's exclusive expose involving Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia 
Clark turned out to be exclusively bogus. 
</P>
<P>
 That the debacle starred the tenacious Levin was unfortunate, given the good 
reporting he has also done at times on the Simpson-Goldman case. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there he was late Wednesday night and on several newscasts Thursday, 
frothing over Channel 2 videotape that he said showed Clark on the grounds of 
Simpson's Brentwood estate June 13 a full 17 minutes before a judge signed a 
warrant authorizing a search of the house and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office insisted that Clark's arrival did not precede 
the warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the substance and tone of comments by Levin and an attorney he found to 
nourish his Clark-disaster theory left the strong impression that Clark's 
so-called premature arrival at the house had seriously jeopardized the 
prosecution's case against Simpson and clouded her future with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not likely, disagreed a multitude of legal experts on other stations. Yet 
boldly undeterred by facts, Channel 2 kept to its line throughout Thursday, 
failing to air the views of anyone who contradicted its own minority 
interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A bombshell!" anchor Michael Tuck said to Levin about the Clark story on one 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 That should have been the first tip-off that something was amiss, the last 
Channel 2 "bombshell" having been its unretracted erroneous exclusive about 
Simpson arriving in Chicago with a bloody golf bag not long after the knifing 
murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and Ronald Lyle Goldman. The 
second tip-off was that the "CBS Evening News" ignored the "bombshell" reported 
by its Los Angeles station. Its skittishness about Levin and Channel 2 was 
justified. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof of Clark's so-called premature arrival at the Simpson mansion, Levin 
repeatedly had noted a running time code or counter on the Channel 2 videotape 
showing that the footage was transmitted at 10:28. A judge didn't sign the 
search warrant until 10:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the D.A.'s office flipped? How could it dispute Channel 2's time counter? 
Why would it even bother, in fact, given the weight of legal expertise that 
repudiated Channel 2's assertion that Clark's time of arrival was significant? 
</P>
<P>
 All sorts of scenarios flew through your mind, including the most exotic one 
of all: Could it be -- and this was really off the wall -- that Channel 2 was 
wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Word leaked from Channel 2 early Friday morning that the 10:28 time on the 
daytime footage did not approximate when it was shot but merely when it was fed 
to the station's studios in Hollywood from one of its satellite trucks at the 
Simpson estate. Fed at 10:28, to be sure. 
</P>
<P>
 10:28 in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, it took a while for the truth to wriggle its way through Channel 
2's fatty protective layers. It was forced to publicly admit Friday that the 
Clark story -- which appeared trivial even if it were accurate -- had no 
substantiation. Increasing the resonance, that admission was also reported on 
the "CBS Evening News," CNN and other newscasts across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, a whopper error. It's that kind of incompetence that makes those 
kids at "Action News" so darned lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet something much more serious loomed here. 
</P>
<P>
 According to well-placed Channel 2 sources, news director Bob Jordan was 
informed about the correct time on the counter at 6:30 p.m. Thursday. But he 
still allowed a version of the fallacious story to run on the station's 11 p.m. 
newscast. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jordan did permit a story to air that he knew to be incorrect, that was 
journalistic fraud -- grounds for dismissal in most newsrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan says that although he was alerted Thursday night that the story was 
wrong, he didn't become convinced of it until Friday morning. Even accepting 
that explanation, it puts him in the position of approving a story for the 11 
p.m. newscast that was then known to be in doubt, at the very least. And the 
next morning -- some 12 hours after the story had all but disintegrated -- 
Channel 2 still ran a news promo in which the Clark story was touted as a 
"bombshell." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong, of course. Nor was Channel 2's appalling lack of ethics a bombshell to 
anyone who watches its newscasts with any regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced into a public confession, Channel 2 had Levin go on the air several 
times Friday to retract the story -- sort of -- and apologize. Even then, 
however, the station appeared to be trying to squirm away from taking complete 
responsibility. Tracking its mea culpas through various newscasts proved 
instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 A highly apologetic Levin said at noon only that the tape "could have" been 
fed at 10:28 in the evening instead of the morning, as if there remained doubt. 
He also said that news director Jordan learned of the error "last night" when 
the technician who recorded and logged in the tape "came forward" to reveal the 
discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
 His vagueness about the time, and his failure to mention that Jordan 
reportedly learned what had happened almost five hours before the story's last 
run, were significant, appearing to deflect blame from Jordan, the man 
ultimately responsible. And in using the words came forward , the statement had 
left the impression that the night-shift technician himself was the real 
culprit, the one who had something to confess. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, according to station sources, he was merely the innocent 
whistle-blower. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m. Friday, the profusely repentant Levin from noon was replaced by a 
Levin reading not a correction but a business-like "clarification." Channel 2 
"made a mistake" in a story, he reported. A mistake? The entire story was a 
mistake. Noting the time counter mix-up, Levin added that it was now "possible" 
-- not even probable -- that the tape had been fed to the station in the 
evening instead of the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the real burlesque, an exercise in blatant self-exoneration, as 
Levin was followed by a Channel 2 story pointing out goofs by other media in 
the Simpson-Goldman coverage. The story noted how hard the media were working 
to bring this story to viewers -- that's it, the public is to blame for the 
errors -- and flippantly concluded: "Media watchers say mistakes are 
inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 So we should relax and enjoy them? 
</P>
<P>
 By late Friday, meanwhile, suspicions arose that Jordan's evolving "spin" was 
being ghostwritten by the Mad Hatter. He told The Times that even though he 
wasn't confident that the time of 10:28 a.m. cited in Channel 2's now-retracted 
report was fact, "I'm not convinced that the time was in error." 
</P>
<P>
 If this episode were unique, you could accept it. As bad as Channel 2 is, 
however, it's merely the goofiest circus clown in the crowded Volkswagen. 
KNBC-TV Channel 4 is only marginally saner on its good days, and the rest of 
the TV pack has hardly distinguished itself in covering . . . and covering . . 
. and covering . . . and covering the Simpson-Goldman case. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the case may have become a seminal moment in the regression of TV 
journalism, with the electronic cannonballs careening out of control as never 
before. Amy Fisher was bad. Michael Jackson was worse. But now has come the 
ultimate horror, the recurring nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 Blared CNN's Larry King last week from somewhere in the pack of 
huffing-and-puffing marathoners pouring sweat over O.J. Simpson: "It's the 
story that won't go away!" 
</P>
<P>
 Kept alive by a media that won't go away.

 Houston at the Rose Bowl: Whitney Houston, who had canceled recent concerts 
because of a throat ailment, was able to keep her plans to sing before the 
World Cup final in Pasadena on Sunday. Houston, appearing on the field with 
soccer star Pele, belted out her songs to an enthusiastic crowd. Houston had 
postponed her sold-out concert at the Pond of Anaheim on Saturday because of 
the throat problem that also forced the cancellation of a Phoenix concert two 
nights earlier. Tickets for the Saturday concert will be honored at the 
rescheduled show on Aug. 21.

 Sitcoms Reflect Simpson Case: The producers of CBS' "Murphy Brown" and "Love & 
War" are developing a joint episode based on the O.J. Simpson saga. Simpson 
will not be mentioned by name but the plot will involve a major media event 
centering on a fictional hero-turned-suspect, so viewers should be able to 
recognize the similarities, production officials said. "This is a very 
interesting tightrope to walk because it's very current," Diane English, 
creator of the back-to-back Monday night comedy series, said at a British 
Academy of Film and Television Artists event last week. The hourlong program is 
planned for the first week of the new season in mid-September, which could 
coincide with the opening of the Simpson murder trial.

 Poet Laureate of the Tube?: Look for poet Maya Angelou to come to TV regularly 
if she and producer Norman Lear come up with a format suitable to her. Lear and 
Angelou have "just been talking" the past two months, says a Lear source, who 
suggests the two may have something definitive to say publicly about the 
project "in about a month." Lear approached Angelou about doing TV after he 
heard her give a motivational speech at a convention in New Orleans earlier 
this year. Angelou was a hit at President Clinton's inaugural with the reading 
of her "On the Pulse of Morning." MOVIES

 All About Hugh: Jody Tressider, identified as an old girlfriend, is working on 
a book called "Hugh Grant: An Intimate Biography." Tressider will recount 
gossip from their days together at Oxford. Tidbits include Grant's seduction 
technique, which involves reciting poetry and D. H. Lawrence, and his fellow 
students' suspicion that he was gay. "Hugh would probably prefer it if she 
didn't write the book," said Joanna Prior of Fourth Estate, the book's 
publisher, in the current Entertainment Weekly magazine. The reaction from 
Grant's spokesman: Tressider is "just trying to make money off his name." As 
for Grant's own writing career, the gentlemanly star of "Four Weddings and a 
Funeral" has refused an offer from Hyperion to write a book entitled "How to Be 
a Gentleman." MUSIC

can continue to offer grants to arts organizations. A proposed 36% cut would 
have dramatically affected the grants program, said the commission's executive

'NEXT GENERATION': NEXT STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading Park Bucker's Counterpunch (" 'Next Generation' Didn't Fly So 
Boldly," July 4), I wondered if he hadn't encountered some series from an 
alternate universe, because the "Star Trek: The Next Generation" I've watched 
for the last seven years is nothing like the show he described. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is true the original "Star Trek" was revolutionary in its casting 
minority and female characters, to suggest that "TNG" is a step back is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Bucker dismisses the contributions of Deanna Troi, Geordi La 
Forge, Worf and Guinan as token -- simply because they weren't commanders. For 
starters, Geordi La Forge was chief engineer, hardly a token responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Troi, Bucker states, "Her character belongs more to a talk-show panel 
than to the bridge of an exploring starship where her abilities have only 
marginal benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 I think when you have more than 1,000 people (including children) on a 
starship traveling through unexplored regions of the galaxy, the services of a 
ship's counselor are invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Star Trek" was innovative not because of multiracial casting -- that was a 
byproduct. "Star Trek" was innovative, and touched so many lives, because Gene 
Roddenberry had a vision of a future when people would put aside petty fears 
and hatreds and live in peace, respecting the inherent dignity within all life. 
In that respect, "Star Trek: The Next Generation" did not fulfill that vision. 
It went beyond it.

 When I watch a TV series, I'm more impressed with the quality of the stories, 
acting and production values rather than how many minorities are presented in 
the interest of being politically correct. In that respect, both "Trek" series 
more than deliver the goods. "Star Trek: TNG," your mission was accomplished.

 Bucker falls into the trap of believing that a character's value is in its 
place in the command structure. By this reasoning, Mother Teresa is important 
only because she heads an order of nuns, not because she sits beside dying 
people, holding their hands and giving them love.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'BANDIDO!' STEALS TRUTH OF EARLY L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB ESHMAN, Rob Eshman is a Santa Monica-based writer and a contributing 
editor to the Los Angeles Jewish Journal. His article about Emil Harris in Los 
Angeles Magazine was optioned for the movies by FTM Productions. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During intermission at a recent performance of Luis Valdez's new play 
"Bandido!" at the Mark Taper Forum, I noticed that only about half the audience 
had left their seats. The other half remained bent over their copies of the 
performance's program, looking less like happy theatergoers and more like 
students sweating out a blue book exam.  
</P>
<P>
 When I opened my program, I saw page after page of historical chronology, long 
excerpts of Valdez's rehearsal notes, an interview with the playwright and a 
"Chicano perspective" on the life of Tiburcio Vasquez, the 19th-Century outlaw 
on whose life the play is based. Not to mention the artist bios, an 
introduction to the play by Taper director Gordon Davidson, explanations of the 
Taper's programs for Latinos and an exhibition mounted just outside the 
theater, displaying facsimiles of old photos and documents from the life and 
times of Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't recall ever seeing a play accompanied by such annotation. It was like 
having to pass through the Museum of Natural History just to catch a screening 
of "The Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 Why did the Taper bookend Valdez's play with so much history and analysis? The 
answer is evident in Davidson's introduction. "Bandido!," he writes, "serves to 
explore and explode the myths about our complex relationship with our cowboy 
bandit heroes . . . by digging deeper into our cultural history, we are once 
again trying to further our understanding of the specifically Mexican-American 
roots of our area's history, and to therefore better understand the 
relationships we all have to one another and to Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is a noble goal. Unfortunately, "Bandido!" doesn't achieve it. Instead of 
giving us a better accounting of our city's past, the play offers up Valdez's 
own parochial, ethnocentric version. Vasquez doesn't exchange the Manifest 
Destiny myth that infects our understanding of the Old West for a more accurate 
and inclusive perspective. He merely replaces age-old Anglo-centrism with 
hipper Latino-centrism. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the pre-Statehood Mexicans (Californios) who settled, farmed 
and ranched these lands were victims of Anglo greed. Valdez tells us as much, 
repeatedly. What he leaves out is that those noble rancheros -- and the 
conquistadors and missionaries who preceded them -- slaughtered, enslaved and 
force-baptized the native native Californians who were here first. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilized diseases brought here by these proto-Latinos wiped out whole Indian 
villages, including, some historians claim, the Indian village of Yang-na, 
where settlers sent by the Spanish governor built the first adobes of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Those first 11 settlers weren't just Spanish, either. They included two 
blacks, two Indians and four mixed bloods. And they were followed, beginning in 
the early 1800s, by ranchers, merchants, farmers and miners from Western and 
Eastern Europe, the Middle East, China and, of course, North and South America. 
A complex mix of races and religions made up early L.A., not just whites and 
browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Time and again, Valdez glosses over this diversity in order to smooth out the 
edges of his morality play. Many of the merchants that the bandit Vasquez 
terrorized were European, Chinese and black, not the all-American, line-dancing 
land grabbers that Valdez depicts. If these immigrants were opportunistic 
newcomers, so were the Mexicans and Spaniards who preceded them. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the most vicious discrimination at the time was directed not at 
the Mexicans but at what the papers then called, "the heathen Chinee." On Oct. 
24, 1871, at least 17 innocent Chinese were lynched by a mob composed of whites 
and Mexicans. But Valdez will allow no other victims to his party. And as for 
villains, he represents the posse that tracked and captured Vasquez as a 
monolith of Marlboro Men -- white Anglo-Saxon males, all dressed in Stetsons 
and prairie dusters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In actuality, the Vasquez posse was largely led by a Polish Jewish immigrant, 
Deputy Emil Harris, who prosecuted the landed and the landless alike, 
protecting many accused Mexicans and Chinese from the lynch mobs. For his role 
in the Vasquez capture, the Yiddish-speaking Harris was made L.A.'s first chief 
of police. 
</P>
<P>
 Given these complex historical facts, it's easy to understand why Valdez opted 
to retell Western history in such an oversimplified manner, substituting 
cowboys with caballeros and Billy the Kid with Tiburcio Vasquez. What's hard to 
understand is how Valdez's misrepresentation of early Los Angeles can, in 
Davidson's words, "further our understanding" of the city in which we live.

POP; RODRIGUEZ GETS THIS PARTY GOING 
</P>

 "El Puma" and the Gipsy Kings? Together ? You better believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the World Cup Week, Venezuelan romantic singer-actor Jose Luis 
Rodriguez -- nicknamed the Puma after an early-'70s soap opera in which he 
starred -- came through impressively in what at first appeared to be a severe 
mismatch on Friday at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding the relatively challenging music of the Gipsy Kings, Rodriguez's 
conservative pop music might have been expected to seem even more lightweight 
than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 But the singer was smart enough to activate the party mode for most of the 
night, leaving the innocuous balladry for another occasion. Backed by his solid 
eight-piece band, he effectively got into the spirit of the World Cup 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 He also concentrated on singing, rather than exploiting his sex-symbol image. 
Rodriguez's main assets are still his voice and stage presence, and an 
above-average repertoire that mixes well-crafted ballads and an assortment of 
merengues, salsas and other Afro-Caribbean rhythms that add some color to an 
essentially unoriginal style. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez -- who still stops traffic everywhere he goes in Latin America -- 
did use his 90-minute set to present a few songs from his new album, "Razones 
para una sonrisa" ("Reasons for a Smile"). The new lyrics, though, were as dull 
and obvious as his old stuff. He belongs to the legion of performers who opt 
for the shortest route -- a kiss, a girl, a smile and some dancing -- as the 
best antidote to all problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez songs might not be Latin America's poetic pride, but give the guy 
some credit -- even if headliners the Gipsy Kings (who were reviewed here 
recently) had called in sick, the crowd at the Bowl appeared to have sweated 
enough with El Puma. 
</P>
<P>
 And the special ingredient of the World Cup added some spice to an unusual 
night -- its spirit was felt both offstage (Brazilian and Italian fans in the 
crowd engaged in some good-natured competitive cheering and flag-waving) and on 
(Rodriguez's conversation between songs touched on soccer as much as his new 
album). 
</P>
<P>
 To share the bill with the far more respected Gipsy Kings and the night with 
Julio Iglesias (who was performing at the Greek Theatre) was a real test for 
Rodriguez's credibility, and he responded to the challenge, attracting his own 
large audience and hushing those who expected the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 For once, there was more dancing than talking at the Bowl.

COUNTERPUNCH: MPAA'S BIG CHANCE TO CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAMONA RIPSTON and ALLAN PARACHINI, Ramona Ripston is executive director and 
Allan Parachini is director of public affairs for the American Civil Liberties 
Union of Southern California. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The recent announcement of a change in command at the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America's classification board affords an opportunity for the industry and the 
MPAA to partly mitigate the chilling influence of the ratings system on 
artistic expression ("Film Ratings Board Picks Mosk as Its New Leader," 
Calendar, June 29). 
</P>
<P>
 During the two decades that the MPAA's Classification and Ratings 
Administration was headed by Richard Heffner, it evolved as a Star Chamber 
body. CARA refuses to identify its members, screens films in secret and 
declines to give filmmakers specific reasons why their work has received, for 
example, an NC-17 instead of an R. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the power CARA and MPAA hold over film marketplace, the secret 
rating system effectively wields the power to kill any film without having to 
state reasons for the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The MPAA, led by its president, Jack Valenti, offers a stock response to 
criticism. If the MPAA did not exist, so Valenti says, filmmakers would have to 
contend with hundreds of local governmental rating boards. We reject this 
argument as unsubstantiated, self-serving and a weak attempt to justify 
arbitrary MPAA censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The power to bar a film from access to the broadest audience has long made 
CARA and the MPAA a force for filmmakers to fear. This fear is nowhere more 
pervasive than among the ranks of independent filmmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers today find they must play a game with their work in which they must 
somehow divine how a secret panel of viewers, employing criteria that have 
never been publicly enumerated, will react. When filmmakers question the 
reasons for ratings they have received, they are usually unable to obtain any 
specific response and are often smugly reminded they have the alternative to 
release their films unrated. In conveying such information, MPAA officials 
always know full well unrated films will have a difficult -- in some cities 
impossible -- time in getting theater bookings, being advertised and being 
reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of Heffner and arrival of attorney Richard Mosk, CARA and 
the MPAA have a unique opportunity for reflection. Although any industry-run 
ratings scheme like MPAA would have entirely too much censorship power, the 
fact is that the industry has accepted MPAA, for better or for worse. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, the Heffner-to-Mosk transition offers a challenge to CARA and the 
MPAA to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Identify members of CARA and produce criteria for what qualifies CARA's 
panel members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permit filmmakers to interact directly with CARA to address its concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 * Give filmmakers specific reasons for a rating. Often, something as cryptic 
as "too much skin in the bedroom scene" or "too much violence in the third car 
chase" would permit filmmakers to at least know why an otherwise arbitrary 
rating has been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say that the MPAA rating system would safeguard artistic 
integrity and free expression entirely, even if such changes were made. 
However, reform of the CARA-MPAA system could go a long way toward making an 
imperfect system less so and to making it easier for filmmakers to understand 
decisions that control their creative lives and their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope Mr. Mosk is open to such reform. As so many people in the creative 
community already know, it is high time for such a change.

JAZZ REVIEW; TAPSCOTT DISPLAYS MAGIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wearing a black skull cap with three glass stones affixed to its front, a 
black shirt and green trousers, Horace Tapscott had the look of a wizard as he 
sat Friday at the grand piano in the open courtyard of the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art. And produced his own brand of magic at the keyboard, as he and 
his longtime accompanists -- bassist Roberto Miranda and drummer Fritz Wise -- 
kicked off the first in a series of three Friday evening shows at LACMA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapscott, who has a 30-plus year career as a pianist and composer, has never 
gotten strong mainstream jazz acceptance. But he's acknowledged as a godfather 
of the Los Angeles avant-garde jazz scene, and his considerable talents are 
sought out by avid fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Tapscott proved again why he has such enduring appeal, as he offered 
improvisations that were based as much on spur-of-the-moment whims -- chords 
slammed down that sent slivers of color everywhere -- as smooth, detailed 
melodic runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lino's Pad," a classic Tapscott composition, segued mercurially between a 
section that was underpinned by an alluringly rhythmic bass figure and a 
quasi-march drum beat, another section that was rhythmically loose and two 
areas of driving swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two jazz waltzes were given muscular workouts. On John Lewis' "Skating in 
Central Park," Tapscott offered lines that wobbled like skaters off balance, 
then later he dropped in a clatter of chords that sounded like a Fifth Avenue 
traffic jam. 
</P>
<P>
 * Horace Tapscott's trio plays Friday and July 29, 5:30 - 8:30 p.m., at the 
Times Mirror Central Court, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire 
Blvd. Free. Information: (213) 857-6000 or 857-6115. ZAN STEWART

POP MUSIC REVIEW; VELOCITY GIRL: THE BEAT DRONES ON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington's Velocity Girl plays cute and fuzzy noise-pop that attracts the 
more wistful of indie-music fans, who eat up its sound the way a kid does 
cotton candy. The quintet is one of many watered-down Jesus and Mary Chain 
disciples who pit waif-like female vocals against guitar feedback but downplay 
experimentation in favor of a palatability. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday at the Whisky, the ineffectual nature of the band's sound was 
intensified by a weak delivery devoid of personality. Without any studio 
veneer, Velocity Girl's songs emerged as cookie-cutter and formulaic. There 
were no unique moments in the repetitive rhythms to hook you -- which didn't 
seem to diminish the enthusiasm of the capacity audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Sarah Shannon's voice went from flat to flatter as she cooed girlish 
highs that might have been cute from a 4-year-old but were sickeningly sweet 
from a grown woman. She hopped around in a flowery frock, throwing her body 
around like a rag doll while the four instrumentalists adopted college rock's 
obligatory "I'm bored" look. 
</P>
<P>
 For an encore, the group transformed New Order's delicately sad "Your Silent 
Face" into a lifeless guitar drone. Like sugary sister band Frente, which 
slaughtered a New Order song on its recent album, Velocity Girl turned a 
masterpiece into a stick figure. This group couldn't make even a great song 
fly. LORRAINE ALI

MUSIC REVIEW; HUAYUCALTIA PUTS ACCENT ON ITS MULTICULTURAL ROOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the growing ranks of ensembles that fall under the rubric of musical 
multiculturalism, consider the Los Angeles-based world music group Huayucaltia 
a veteran in the field. Now 9 years old, the group seems keenly aware of the 
diversity of cultural roots within its ranks, as heard Friday at the Ford 
Amphitheatre, in a concert that proved mighty generous -- in spirit and length. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's members hail from Peru, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina and Palo Alto. 
Likewise, the music hails from locales and genres far from Cahuenga Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Where once the group focused more on the political content of the Nueva 
Cancion (new song) movement, more recently the accent has been on instrumental 
pieces. No doubt that shift allows for the widened appeal that full houses such 
as Friday's are made from. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of the eclectic-yet-unified group sound is the tight, two-guitar 
weave of Ciro Hurtado, who pens most of the group's material, and Antonio 
Ezkauriatza. Primary percussionist Julio "Jimmy" Ledezma provides a bustling 
rhythmic grid over which Hernan Pinilla plays pan pipes, coloristic percussion 
and recorder, often in tandem with Cindy Harding. In this mostly acoustic 
setting, guest bassist Rami Yanni offered occasional electric bass foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 As a finale, Hurtado's song "Chicha" found a place for guest saxophonist Justo 
Almario -- whose group opened the concert with a dose of Latin 
tradition-cum-contemporary jazz (a.k.a. "happy jazz"). The Peruvian dance group 
Matices Peruanos, who livened the stage with its folkloric flair, also appeared 
for the final song, at one point luring audience volunteers onstage to dance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that kind of a warm, interactive show. For Huayucaltia, 
multiculturalism is less a lab experiment or politically correct gesture than 
it is fodder for a good time. JOSEF WOODARD

MUSIC REVIEW; DEFT PROGRAM LIGHTS UP ARABIAN NIGHT AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at Hollywood Bowl, 12,539 listeners took in a program conductor 
John Mauceri blithely dubbed "Aladdin's Lamp, or Not the Three Tenors." 
</P>
<P>
 This was actually quite an ambitious affair -- final event in the weeklong 
Bowl series celebrating "World Cup USA '94" -- by no means your run-of-the-mill 
pops concert, a neat compendium of things Arabian in film, Broadway and Russian 
music history and revealing Mauceri's knack for unearthing interesting 
curiosities. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the assembled masses cared much about reconstructions of lost scores 
by Miklos Rozsa and Cole Porter or even for never-missing ones by 
Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin -- this seemed an unusually loud and indifferent 
audience, even by Bowl standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The impressive quartet of veteran Broadway belters on hand -- Judy Kaye, Lea 
Salonga, Reece Holland and Richard White -- put their numbers across forcefully 
and engagingly, though the miking of one and all could be piercingly painful. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Bowl Orchestra sounded in good form as well, especially in the 
bigger moments of the first movement of Rimsky- Korsakov's "Scheherazade" and 
Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from "Prince Igor" (here aided by the Angeles 
Chorale). But less opulent, more intimate music sometimes found Mauceri and 
crew strangely beat-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 Breezily introduced by the conductor, who manages to slip in some astute 
musicology from time to time, the program also featured music from Bernard 
Herrmann's score to "The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad," and the U.S. premiere of 
Rozsa's "Eternal Love" from "Thief of Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
 The vocalists shone brightly in the restoration of Cole Porter's ill-starred 
(Mauceri blamed this on the critics) television score, "Aladdin," and 
selections from "Kismet" and Disney's "Aladdin," the whole highlighted by 
Kaye's boisterous account of Porter's "Come to the Supermarket in Old Peking."

THEATER REVIEW; GLOBE'S 'TWELFTH NIGHT': SHAKESPEARE BY DESIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Twelfth Night," Shakespeare's clever riff on mistaken identity that 
pre-Tootsied "Tootsie," has been living up to Shakespeare's alternate title "Or 
What You Will" in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 In a playful version by Shakespeare Orange County, Viola becomes Alice 
stepping into a Looking Glass World. The version that opened Saturday at the 
Old Globe Theatre, however, gets closer to the heart of Shakespeare's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Laird Williamson gives us a Viola beset with doubts about her journey 
from girl to woman. This "Twelfth Night" starts with Viola gazing at herself in 
a looking glass that rises up from the stage, trying out a frilly dress, 
rejecting it and falling into a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The story moves into Illyria, drawn with the lush, romantic and humorous 
colors of fantasy. The tempest-tossed ship that separates Viola from her twin 
brother Sebastian (and in this play, her female from her male self) becomes a 
toy ship in the hand of Feste, a fool played as a wispy-haired old wizard with 
a balloon contraption holding him aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is, on the whole, marvelous. The character that holds the key to the 
play is Viola who, shipwrecked, dresses as a boy, Cesario, and serves the Duke 
Orsino. Young, fresh-faced Marcia Cross registers every nuance of wonderment 
and discovery, catching the mischievous delight of the girl fooling everyone, 
illuminating the pain of a love for the Duke she cannot realize until she 
reveals her true self, and ultimately becoming more of a woman because of the 
time she spends as a man. 
</P>
<P>
 The only casting glitch is John Hutton, who seems uncomfortable in his role as 
the romantic Duke who sends "Cesario" to woo the faraway Countess Olivia. She 
in turn falls in love with "Cesario" instead of his master. 
</P>
<P>
 All the other performers seem to revel in their roles. Jacqueline Antaramian 
offers a sensuous Olivia, less foolish than funny, who finds herself 
susceptible to the charms of "Cesario" because Viola's blunt way of telling her 
off is much more refreshing than the Duke's sappy missives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefrey Alan Chandler is magical as Feste, an aging man whose power to pull 
other people's strings rests on his wits. Dan Shor amuses as Olivia's hapless 
suitor, Sir Andrew, whose hair keeps the shape of every hat he takes off. And 
Don Sparks creates a deliciously foolish, downright Dickensian Malvolio at the 
center of the subplot about Olivia's steward. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Williamson's many successes here is his fine integration of the plot 
with the subplot of Olivia's high-living uncle, Sir Toby, who taunts the 
humorless Malvolio and is boisterously played by William Anton. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlighted in this "Twelfth Night" is the idea that all who live by the 
illusion of romantic love lose. So Malvolio is made a fool of not just because 
he is a boor, but because he can be tricked by a fake love letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, those who get to know their loved ones see friendships blossom 
into marriage, from the high romance of Viola and the Duke to the low comedy of 
Sir Toby and Maria, Olivia's maid and Toby's partner in crime, wittily played 
by Katherine McGrath. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Funicello's set, with carnival-like bright colors and wooden planks that 
curve up like a wave of the sea, suggests a dreamscape, warmly lit by Chris 
Parry. Andrew V. Yelusich's elaborate costumes delight, from vaudevillian 
excess to handsome companion garb for Orsino and Olivia, Viola and Sebastian. 
Larry Delinger's compositions set Shakespeare's words off hauntingly, as befits 
such a memorable rendition of Shakespeare's comically tender, yet clear-headed 
look at lasting love.

THEATER REVIEW; A MAD, MERRY TEA PARTY IN 'NIGHT' AT THE WALTMAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carl Reggiardo has staged a "Twelfth Night" for Shakespeare Orange County, at 
Chapman University's Waltmar Theatre, that happily steals from Lewis Carroll's 
"Alice" books. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is that the land of Ilyria, on which Viola (Kamella Tate) is 
shipwrecked, is like the Looking Glass world into which Alice drops. Both works 
are about the perils felt by young women in a strange land filled with goofy 
characters who talk artful nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 But directors' concepts can be curious, to use Alice's favorite word; the more 
they take hold, the more one can begin to doubt the connection. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovelorn Olivia (Pauline Maranian), the countess who swoons for servant 
Cesario (actually Viola in disguise), wears a headdress reminiscent of 
Carroll's the Duchess. The pompous, self-loving Malvolio (Wayne Alexander) 
wears a wig shaped like rabbit's ears -- the White Rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sir Toby Belch (Daniel Bryan Cartmell) has some of Humpty Dumpty's portliness, 
and likes to sit on a wall. Court jester Feste (Michael Nehring) resembles, 
first, the Mad Hatter, then the Caterpillar as he curls up in a corner smoking 
a pipe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie-in begins to fray, though, with the costumes themselves (expertly 
crafted by Cathy Crane-McCoy). While Carroll was satirizing the British royal 
state and the Victorian one in particular, the costumes and Suzie Goff's set 
(though cleverly sprinkled with hearts and artificial facades) fix things in 
the Mediterranean Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the "Alice" connection is only skin deep. It isn't Viola who thinks 
the Ilyrians are mad, but her long-lost twin brother, Sebastian (Michael 
Strickland, who doesn't effectively twin with Tate). Belch is no hapless Humpty 
Dumpty, but a wily plotter of mischief. Malvolio is never late for a very 
important date -- just a fool-in-the-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, though, you have a very nicely read "Twelfth Night" that tends to 
balance the play's loving and clowning well. There could be far more sparks 
between Viola and Olivia, though Tate gets funnier as her Viola realizes the 
trap she has set for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggiardo's Duke and Alexander's Malvolio are cleverly mirrored here, more in 
love with the idea of being desired than with the one (Olivia) they each 
believe is desiring them. 
</P>
<P>
 The mischievous torture of Malvolio remains painfully drawn-out, but the 
plotters are a funny bunch: Cartmell's Belch suggests a legitimate power-seeker 
who took the wrong career track and John Shouse's Sir Andrew is modestly 
understated, while Nehring milks every moment of Feste's punning and singing. 
Long after the "Alice" echoes have faded, it's the confidence of Reggiardo's 
cast steering through "Twelfth Night's" many moods that remains. 
</P>

Orange. Thursdays through Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 3 and 8 p.m. Ends Aug. 6.

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / A SPECIAL REPORT: DRUG ABUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Tracy Weber 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NEW AGE: Forget the image of drug rehabilitation centers populated with 
low-class junkies or indulged celebrities. Today, many of Orange County's detox 
beds are filled with elderly patients hooked on toxic cocktails of cold 
medications, prescription drugs and alcohol, says Max Schneider, an addiction 
specialist at St. Joseph Hospital in Orange. . . . Groups of recovering elderly 
addicts now meet twice a week at the hospital, and Dr. Schneider has just 
finished up an educational film. "Seniors are the fastest-growing population in 
the country," he says. "As they get older, there's a spiraling decrease in 
their ability to cope." 
</P>
<P>
 IN UTERO: The biggest hangover of the '80s cocaine-fueled fast life now is 
hitting like a sledgehammer. Unfortunately, the folks feeling it are the young 
children of former coke abusers -- and those tending it are child-care workers, 
says Jane Bissell of UC Irvine's Drug-Free Schools and Communities Program. For 
the second summer, the UCI program is sponsoring a statewide series of 
workshops for child-care workers. Says Bissell: "We're trying to avoid a 
gloom-and-doom prognosis for these children." 
</P>
<P>
 ON EXHIBIT: OK, so it sounds a little hokey, but the Orange County Alcohol 
Programs and Drug Abuse Services booth at the Orange County Fair won "best of 
show," spurred by a talking horse who tells kids, "Just say neigh to drugs.". . 
. . "Last year we had a farmer and his wife. The horse has attracted a lot more 
attention," says spokeswoman and part-time talking horse Karen Mergeler, above. 
Drug abuse exhibits on pregnancy and dysfunctional families also have won 
praise. 
</P>
<P>
 FLASHBACK: Drug abuse counselors say the focus on the dangers of cocaine has 
some kids sampling other drugs. One of the most popular is LSD. . . . But while 
LSD makers in the '60s tried for a standard of purity, today's is a "mishmash 
of hallucinogenic junk," says Hospital Assn. spokesman David Langness. Orange 
County hospitals have seen a "marked increase" in LSD-related emergencies in 
the past two years, "ever since it infiltrated the grunge scene."

BODY OF WOMAN MISSING FOR 3 YEARS IS FOUND; DISAPPEARANCE: FROZEN REMAINS 
DISCOVERED IN A TRUCK IN ARIZONA ARE IDENTIFIED AS THOSE OF A NEWPORT BEACH 
WOMAN. A SUSPECT IS BEING HELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The frozen body of a woman found inside a stolen truck in Arizona was 
identified over the weekend as that of Denise Huber, a young Newport Beach 
woman whose mysterious 1991 disappearance sparked a nationwide search that 
frustrated investigators at every turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa detectives traveled to Arizona on Saturday to question a former 
Lake Forest man who has been held on suspicion of murder since Wednesday, when 
the frozen body was discovered inside a Ryder truck parked outside a home at 
the Prescott Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared, died of 
blunt-force trauma to the head, according to the medical examiner's office in 
Maricopa County (where Phoenix is located). She was identified through 
fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators in Yavapai County (where Prescott is located) found 
evidence that linked John Joseph Famalaro, 37, to Huber when they searched his 
father's country club home Thursday. Authorities declined to disclose the 
nature of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrest may help close the book on one of the most sensational 
missing-person cases in recent Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the end to one of this department's biggest frustrations ever," 
said Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Jerry Holloway. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was last seen alive about 2 a.m. on June 3, 1991, when she dropped off a 
friend in Huntington Beach after attending a rock concert at the Forum in 
Inglewood. Her 1988 Honda Accord was later found on a shoulder along the Corona 
del Mar Freeway, with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway said Famalaro had not been a suspect in the case. There was no 
indication that Huber knew Famalaro, a house painter who left Orange County to 
care for his aging father in Prescott, a mountain community north of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could not link him to the investigation before today," Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle at Huber's car, and police were never able to 
determine exactly what happened at the scene. Since the disappearance, police 
cars in Newport Beach and Costa Mesa have had bumper stickers soliciting tips 
from the public on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's disappearance was publicized on the television shows "America's Most 
Wanted" and "Inside Edition." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Dennis and Ione Huber -- the young woman's parents, who moved 
earlier this year to North Dakota -- had all but given up hope of finding her 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time goes on, I realize Denise is probably not alive," Ione Huber said 
last month on the third anniversary of her daughter's disappearance. "Just to 
know and not have to constantly wonder what happened would be easier to handle 
than this mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies went to the Famalaro home Wednesday after receiving a tip 
from Phoenix police that the Ryder truck he had rented in Lake Forest in 
January was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The body was found after deputies saw an extension cord running from a freezer 
in the truck to Famalaro's father's house, authorities said. The cord powered 
the freezer, which had been left on for days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested shortly after the body was found, but authorities said 
they had to wait several days for the body to thaw before performing an 
autopsy. The house painter kept a post office box in Lake Forest while living 
at the country club home and made several trips back to California, Arizona 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. His lawyer could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Prescott Courier, Famalaro, who was described by his 
customers as well-spoken, moved to Prescott to take care of his father, who has 
Parkinson's disease and is hospitalized. Famalaro's mother lives in another 
home at Prescott Country Club.

STATE QUAKE RECOVERY HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial of July 1, "It's a Long, Long Way to Sacramento," restates the 
mistaken interpretation of the earthquake recovery process that has 
characterized your commentary for several months. 
</P>
<P>
 All Californians, of course, appreciate the financial commitment of the 
federal government to the Northridge recovery. But the reality of the process 
is far different from the view that The Times persists in perpetuating. Your 
editorials give the impression that only the federal government has been 
responsive, while state government has been negligent and slow to react. 
Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first weeks after the earthquake, the state suggested to the Small 
Business Administration and to the Federal Emergency Management Agency that 
there was going to be a special problem of "ghost towns." Requests to consider 
new approaches fell on deaf ears and thousands of applications were denied. 
Isn't it ironic that The Times is now giving credit to SBA for finally agreeing 
to review over 25,000 applications? 
</P>
<P>
 School reconstruction has been slowed mainly because of FEMA reviewers denying 
portions of claims submitted on behalf of the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. These denials contradict the public expressions of policies that FEMA 
has been so eager to make. 
</P>
<P>
 Passage of the bond measures on the June ballot would not have accelerated the 
pace of recovery. Federal dollars always are provided in the beginning of the 
process; state and local funds are applied as projects are completed and final 
inspections made. Many delays in the pace of recovery are related to narrow 
interpretations by FEMA and SBA in applying their own policies, rather than any 
failure to act by state agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 A closer examination by The Times of the recovery process would demonstrate 
that most changes to accelerate the recovery -- how to fast-track housing 
assistance checks, procedures for handling claims of public agencies, expedited 
appeals processes, strategies for early use of hazard mitigation funds -- have 
come from proposals and pressures placed on federal agencies by state disaster 
officials. Without these efforts, it is questionable whether federal agencies 
would have taken the course they are now so loudly proclaiming. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, Gov. Wilson indicated that the state will pay the entire 
non-federal share for public recovery projects. That commitment remains. The 
issue is not, as The Times suggests, which method is adopted for providing 
state moneys. It is, rather, how quickly and intelligently federal agencies can 
implement their programs so that California's share is needed.

COST OF UCLA CONVOCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The actions of University of California regents Ward Connerly and Howard Leach 
in criticizing UCLA Chancellor Charles Young for spending $560,000 on UCLA's 
75th anniversary are both childish and shortsighted (July 12). 
</P>
<P>
 Any intelligent person would realize that the ceremony signified a historic 
achievement in the development of UCLA as one of the nation's elite 
universities. President Clinton's attendance is a source of pride for all UCLA 
alumni and students. Both the event and the President's visit obviously 
required money; but the amount spent was well within what is appropriate for an 
event of such magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Young has proven to be a spectacular manager of funds at UCLA 
during the course of his 25-year tenure. Perhaps Connerly and Leach are so 
singed from the regents' horrible fiscal management (i.e., David Gardner's 
retirement), that they are a bit gun shy about any expenditure.

 Chancellor Young thinks he is going to encourage us to donate $100 million 
over the next five years to the UC system by exciting us with how he just spent 
a half-million dollars on UCLA's 75th anniversary spectacle? 
</P>
<P>
 I quit giving money to the UC system awhile back when I noticed that royalty 
had taken over the leadership roles. If I ever consider giving money to them 
again, it's not going to be because of one of these dramatizations of their 
warped sense of grandeur and their lack of economic awareness. I know it's easy 
to criticize. But why make it so easy?

 The most telling aspect of the criticism is that Leach was not in attendance 
and, therefore, unaware of the event's impact on President Clinton. As Leach is 
aware, the regents were represented at the event by the regents' Vice Chair S. 
Sue Johnson, who spoke at the event. Leach should know that having the ear of 
the President of the United States with regard to issues impacting higher 
education will pay dividends to UCLA and the entire UC system far in excess of 
the cost for the event.

 Your article states the Chancellor Young justified the $561,524 expenditure 
because it boosted morale on campus. The cynicism embodied in that comment 
cannot go unchallenged. If Young cares to gauge morale on campus, he might 
speak with the inordinately large number of employees who are being laid off 
because of how he chooses to spend his discretionary funds. The morale of these 
employees, as well as that of the faculty who depend on them, was not improved 
by a half-million-dollar, as Young put it, "extravaganza." 
</P>
<P>
 The number of layoffs is unprecedented in UCLA history. For example, in the 
School of Public Health alone, 30 of 49 nonfaculty positions (about 60%) will 
disappear. Layoffs of similar magnitude are occurring in Nursing, Social 
Welfare and Urban Planning. Damaging layoffs of lesser magnitude are occurring 
in many other units on campus. These employees are the working people who do 
the mundane tasks that are required to make UCLA run. Without them, surely, the 
quality of education at UCLA will decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past decade, among other things, Young has chosen to spend his 
discretionary funds on a faulty real estate development into which faculty 
could not afford to buy; the Wadsworth, Westwood and Doolittle theaters, and 
the Armand Hammer Museum. Had his priorities been different, substantially 
fewer UCLA employees would be losing their jobs.

NIXON ORAL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-three years ago, now-retired Whittier College Prof. Carmelo Richard 
Arena undertook an important project to compile an oral history which included 
the remembrances of friends, family, and associates of Richard Milhous Nixon, 
37th President of the United States and distinguished alumnus of Whittier 
College. Approximately 400 people took part in Dr. Arena's comprehensive work, 
undertaken with the intent that one day it would be available for use by 
historians and the interested public. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1973, the work was entrusted to the National Archives for 
safekeeping until such a time as there was a Nixon presidential library. Today, 
one would imagine that this important work would be available to be studied and 
enjoyed by all with interest. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as your 
story points out (July 6 and 8). 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda is a private 
concern and is not managed by the National Archives, it is not recognized by 
the National Archives as an official presidential library. The National 
Archives has kept the oral history sealed and unavailable for review. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article was a bit misleading. The college has not to date claimed 
exclusive ownership of the oral history. We are merely seeking every possible 
means of realizing one of the primary intents of the work, namely, that the 
historical data therein be widely accessible to the general public.

YOUNG MARINES CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Indoctrinating children from the inner cities with military training -- 
"running . . . obstacle and assault courses and watching combat demonstrations" 
-- seems a strange way to help them refrain from violent behavior (July 10). 
The Times describes these young people participating in leadership building 
activities like "standing at attention . . . saluting officers and following 
orders." 
</P>
<P>
 It gets worse -- children as young as 8 years old "crawling under barbed wire 
and learning how to capture a city without injuring civilians." Perhaps when 
the 8 year olds master that last item they can pass on a few pointers to the 
rest of our military forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Commanding officer Leon Bucago says, "I would rather have them (in the Young 
Marines program) than out there doing drugs and getting involved in gangs." 
Apparently, these children were born guilty in his eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 How is it that caring for children has become synonymous with boot camp? It 
seems to me that his kind of "caring" has been the problem all along.

 As a long-time Brentwood resident who lives less than three blocks and well

one question: 
</P>
<P>
 In reporting in the tremendous inconvenience those of us who are neighbors 
have endured (July 13), what in heaven's name possessed you to print the most 
detailed yet map of exactly how to get here? As I went about my business today, 
I saw many more "visitors" than I have seen over the last few days.

 I am so sick of Brentwood homeowners whining about tourists in their 
neighborhood.One has to wonder -- if only the Brentwood homeowners had been 
half as vigilant to their streets and surrounding community before this brutal 
double slaying occurred, then perhaps they would have been able to detect the 
crime before it happened, and even somehow prevented it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late to peer through your mini-blinds and hedges calling the cops 
every few minutes, Brentwood residents. Just be thankful that you're still 
alive to see it. Two former residents, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman, 
aren't so lucky.

VALENZUELA ONLY ADDS TO DODGER WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers, acutely aware of the pounding footsteps of the San Francisco 
Giants and Colorado Rockies, spent Sunday morning in closed-door meetings, 
trying to figure out their offensive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, players were called in and talked to in a positive way about their 
situation, which can be summed up in one word: slump. Fred Claire, executive 
vice president, and Manager Tom Lasorda were there for most of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something the Dodgers couldn't factor in, a left-hander they had 
factored out on a lazy spring day four seasons ago in another closed-door 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at Veterans Stadium, the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Dodgers, 
9-7, behind Fernando Valenzuela, who had a four-hit shutout until the ninth 
inning, when Mitch Webster hit a cut fastball over the left field fence and 
began a seven-run rally. The late offensive outburst might have been enough to 
give at least a glimmer of hope, but it did nothing to calm Lasorda's ire. 
</P>
<P>
 "What . . . good is it? We lost," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dodgers lost for the third time in four games against the Phillies, 
the Giants won their eighth in a row to move to within 4 1/2 games of the 
Dodgers in the National League West. The Rockies have closed the gap to two 
games, giving the Dodgers a lot to worry about as they travel to New York for 
the start of a three-game series against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give up that many runs in two games and overcome," Lasorda said 
with controlled anger. "They battled back, but it wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies scored 25 runs and had 38 hits in the four games; the Dodgers 
also had 38 hits, but only 19 runs, indicating the problem -- they don't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get any runs for eight innings and then turn around and score seven 
and have the winning run at the plate," Lasorda said, pounding his fork into 
some chicken. "Funny game." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't very funny for the Dodgers four seasons ago on Aug. 21, 1990, when 
the Phillies, down 11-3 in the ninth inning of a game at Dodger Stadium, scored 
eight runs to tie the score and went on to win, 12-11. But as the seven-run 
rally progressed Sunday, that game was remembered clearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call it Black Tuesday," said Roger McDowell, who didn't call it that then, 
when he pitched for the Phillies and earned the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, against whom only one Dodger reached second base and who retired 
13 consecutive batters before the ninth inning, tired quickly in the ninth. He 
threw a mixture of cut fastballs, a pitch he learned after he left the Dodgers, 
along with his vintage screwballs and fastballs.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of hitters still think I am a screwball pitcher, so that's why I've 
come up with a cutter and throw the straight fastball," said Valenzuela, who is 
1-2 with a 2.84 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Valenzuela's first National League victory since Sept. 14, 1990, and it 
nearly escaped him. After Webster's leadoff home run in the ninth, Valenzuela 
issued his first walk, to Raul Mondesi, before Carlos Hernandez drove a 1-and-2 
pitch into the Dodger bullpen in left field, which had been pretty active 
during the game. Starter Pedro Astacio (6-7) gave up six runs in only 2 1/3 
innings, his shortest outing of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dodgers behind by eight runs after the top of the eighth, Lasorda 
inserted his reserves, including Webster and Hernandez, who replaced Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turned out to be a pretty good idea, right?" Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hernandez homered, which made the score 9-3, Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi 
walked to the mound, and Valenzuela spent the walk to the dugout trying to 
figure out how to acknowledge a standing ovation from the crowd of 49,998. He 
raised his glove half way, then touched his cap a couple of times, eyes still 
downcast. Finally, he looked at the crowd and took off his cap before heading 
into the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 With Valenzuela gone, the Dodgers loaded the bases on three consecutive 
singles against reliever Paul Quantrill before scoring two runs on a fielder's 
choice by Jeff Treadway and a pinch-hit single by Henry Rodriguez against 
reliever Larry Andersen. By then, Webster was up again, and with two out, he 
worked Andersen to a 3-and-2 count before walking, again loading the bases. The 
score was 9-5, and the tying run, Mondesi, was at the plate. Closer Doug Jones 
was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi was down two strikes when he hit a two-run single into center field, 
making the score 9-7. Hernandez, the potential winning run, was at the plate, 
but his hard-hit grounder wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to say that I'm showing something, I just like to say that I'm 
still pitching," Valenzuela said. "I know what I have, and the Phillies believe 
in me."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; VALDES GETS START AGAINST THE METS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ismael Valdes, at 20 the youngest player in the National League, will make his 
first major league start tonight against the New York Mets instead of Orel 
Hershiser, whose status remains day to day because of a muscle strain in his 
left side. Tom Candiotti will pitch on three days' rest Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, who felt the strain while warming up before Saturday's game and did 
not start, was still sore Sunday when undergoing tests by Dodger trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The muscle in that area of the rib is difficult to get a good assessment of," 
said Pat Screnar, team therapist.  
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser will be evaluated in a few days. If he is put on the disabled list, 
Chan Ho Park is a candidate to take his place in the rotation, said Fred 
Claire, executive vice president. But Valdes, depending on his start today, 
could have the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 He had always been a starting pitcher until he was promoted to the Dodger 
bullpen from triple-A Albuquerque on June 8. Since he made his major league 
debut on June 15, Valdes has pitched well in 10 of 12 outings. He has a 1-0 
record with a 3.14 earned-run average and only one of his five inherited 
runners has scored. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delino DeShields' left thigh muscle is bothering him again, and he is 
scheduled to see a doctor in New York. He was scratched from the starting 
lineup Sunday and Manager Tom Lasorda said he is giving DeShields a couple of 
days off. Jeff Treadway, who has been hot offensively, replaced him in the 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger players had a lot to say about Fernando Valenzuela. Mitch Webster, 
whose home run began the Dodgers' seven-run ninth inning, said that the cut 
fastball that Valenzuela throws is quite an adjustment. "It comes in at at 
right-handed hitters, so you look in, and he throws a screwball away," Webster 
said. "He is really pitching well." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler said Valenzuela's pitches look fat, but are anything but. "You 
want to hit Fernando so bad, the ball looks so big, it dips and doodles and he 
adds something on and takes something off, " Butler said. "Maybe you go out 
there and try to do too much." MARYANN HUDSON

QUICK DEFICIT HELPS BEAT ANGELS, 10-5; BASEBALL: PALMEIRO HITS A THREE-RUN 
HOMER IN THE FIRST INNING TO FUEL THE ORIOLES. LORRAINE IS INEFFECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels say this is a crucial home stand, 13 games that could make or break 
what they believe are realistic chances of contending for the title in 
baseball's sorriest division. 
</P>
<P>
 But the first of four teams to pass through Anaheim Stadium this month left 
Sunday with a bunch of fatter batting averages, inflated slugging statistics 
and a winning percentage closing in on .600. The Baltimore Orioles not only 
beat the Angels, 10-5, before 17,525, they left the home team searching for a 
way to win games in which it scores five runs. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first four games of the two-week stretch deemed so important, Angel 
starting pitchers are 0-3 with a 5.87 earned-run average. And Sunday's starter, 
Russ Springer, again put the Angels in a hole early. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the first Angel stepped into the batter's box, Baltimore led, 3-0, on a 
three-run homer by Rafael Palmeiro, who was nine for 15 with three homers and 
eight runs batted in during the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer has given up 23 runs in 24 1/3 innings over five starts this season 
and by the time he departed after three innings, the Orioles were ahead, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouyed by Saturday night's ninth-inning rally for a 4-3 victory, the Angels 
were quickly squashed by the Orioles' power parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough being down, 3-0, that fast, but that shouldn't have taken all that 
much wind out of our sails," Chili Davis said. "I'm not blaming the pitching, 
but it's even tougher when you start to come back and then they keep putting 
you down again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels scored in the second inning on Davis' homer, his 100th as an Angel. 
But the Orioles countered with two runs on a home run by former Angel Dwight 
Smith in the third. Baltimore scored again in the fifth and sixth innings, 
negating the Angels' two-run fifth. The Angels scored in the seventh and 
eighth, but only after the Orioles had scored three in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most frustrating thing when I was (with the Angels)," Smith 
said. "We were scoring a lot of runs, but still not winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and his new teammates are 53-37 and chasing the Yankees in the AL East. 
The Angels are 39-54 and chasing windmills in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating, no question," said right fielder Tim Salmon, who was 
removed in the seventh inning after his right hamstring was injured again. 
"Rafael and Dwight had us down early and then every time we scored, they came 
right back." 
</P>
<P>
 The only redemption on this day might come from a solid major league debut by 
Andrew Lorraine, a 21-year-old rookie left-hander who was called up from the 
minors after Friday night's game. But Lorraine, who is being groomed for the 
starting rotation, struggled.  
</P>
<P>
 He gave up nine hits and four earned runs in three innings, walking two 
without a strikeout and still he was praised by Lachemann, which might speak 
volumes on the state of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked what I saw," Lachemann said. "He pitched a lot better than his 
numbers indicated. He gave up nine hits, but there were a lot of squirrelly 
hits in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Brady) Anderson's (double) was the only one I remember being hit hard. The 
rest were all pretty cheap really." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel offense produced nine hits and five runs, but Lachemann seemed more 
upset with his batters than his pitchers, which also speaks to the state of the 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we played today was pretty disappointing," he said. "We didn't come 
out with a lot of fire and we gave away a number of at-bats late in the game. 
Three runs in the first inning on a Sunday afternoon in this park isn't going 
to beat you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you would like to win when you score five runs, but the reality in this 
league is that five runs is just about good enough to break even." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, of course, are a long way from breaking even and in reality 
teetering on the precipice of falling out of contention in the American League 
West, which could produce baseball's first winner with a losing record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question the rest of this home stand is crucial," Salmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got nine games left and we've got our work cut out for us. We've got 
Boston and then New York coming in, and those are teams that can bury you."

MORNING BRIEFING: THE FIRST CLUE WAS DIVULGED IN FIRST GAME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With each passing day, it becomes more apparent that this is the year of the 
pepped-up baseball, but according to Ross Atkins of the Christian Science 
Monitor, fans should have known it from opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "St. Louis' Ray Lankford, the season's first batter, hit a home run against 
Cincinnati April 3," Atkins noted. "The next day, in Wrigley Field's opener, 
Chicago Cub center fielder Karl Rhodes set a major league opening-game record 
with three homers in his first three at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the week, 186 homers were belted in 79 games, 58 more than were 
hit during 80 games in the first week of the '93 season." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Where was the first golf course in Los Angeles located? 
</P>
<P>
 One man's view: Charles Bremner, writing in the Times of London, says of 
cycling's three-week Tour de France: "(It) may be the only event that lasts 
longer than an English Test cricket match, but as far as the spectator is 
concerned, it takes about 45 seconds, the time for a gang of hunched, sweating 
men in Lycra shorts to whiz past in a blur of corporate logos. Bend down to 
uncork your bottle of Brouilly and you have missed them." 
</P>
<P>
 One-man band: Tony Gwynn started the season with more hits (2,039) than all 
the other players on the San Diego Padres roster combined (1,793). 
</P>
<P>
 The perfectionist: When Nick Faldo was a teen-ager, he put nail varnish on his 
thumbs to make sure they were in the right position on the club shaft when he 
was putting and practiced his stroke on shiny linoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutual admiration: Bulgaria soccer star Yordan Letchkov lives in Hamburg with 
his wife, Svetlana, his childhood sweetheart from Sliven. Above their bed is a 
photograph of Madonna. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a fan of her music," he said. "She is a full-blooded singer and I am a 
full-blooded soccer player." 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration: Hubie Brooks played 1,645 games in 14 seasons before being 
released last week by the Kansas City Royals, but he shares one unfortunate 
distinction with Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. Neither ever appeared in a 
postseason game. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a while: Don't hold your breath if you're hoping to catch an early 
glimpse of super NFL rookies Dan Wilkinson or Marshall Faulk. Or Trent Dilfer, 
the player Sam Wyche hopes will lead the Tampa Bay Buccaneers out of their 
misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Chances are you won't get a peek at them until the regular season, because the 
Cincinnati Bengals, Indianapolis Colts and Buccaneers won't appear on a 
nationally televised exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Priorities: When Michael Knisley of the Sporting News asked Alonzo Mourning if 
he worked for Nike or the Charlotte Hornets, Mourning replied, "I work for 
Nike." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Pico and Alvarado.

being the President of the United States, the best one was being able to play 
18 holes with Arnold Palmer." SHAV GLICK

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SALMON TAKEN OUT AFTER INJURING LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>

 Tim Salmon, who suffered a strained right hamstring in Boston on July 6 and 
sat out the next two games, was removed in the seventh inning Sunday after 
re-injuring his leg on a series of plays in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned," he said. "It feels worse right now than it did the first time 
I hurt it. I'm trying to be smart with it, but when you're in the outfield and 
chasing down balls, it's hard to govern that." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon said he first felt pain Sunday in the seventh inning while sprinting in 
pursuit of a triple down the right-field line by Baltimore's Jeff Tackett. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last 20 feet, I really extended and it was grabbing pretty bad," he said. 
"Then I had to go hard after the double by Brady (Anderson). And by the time I 
went into the gap to get the ball (hit by Cal Ripken Jr.) and made the throw to 
the plate, it was really sore." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 How impressed was Chili Davis with Baltimore starter Jamie Moyer, who gave up 
seven hits and two earned runs in 6 1/3 innings to earn the victory Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "We just weren't patient enough with him," Davis said. "He's the kind of 
pitcher you have to wait and make him make mistakes. It's not like he's a power 
pitcher. He can't throw the ball by you. Hell, he can't throw the ball by him. 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann took some of the blame for Sunday's loss, indicating 
he should have filled out the lineup card differently. "I'm kind of kicking 
myself," he said after the game. "I probably should have started Bo (Jackson). 
I should've put the big guy in there." . . . Rafael Palmeiro's first-inning 
three-run homer against Russ Springer marked a club-record 10th consecutive 
game in which an Angel starter has given up a home run. And Palmeiro continues 
to punish Angel pitchers this season. He has 22 hits in 45 at-bats, a .490 
average, with five homers and 17 RBIs in 12 games. . . . Lachemann on Springer 
giving up a three-run homer and a two-run homer in three innings: "The fact 
that they happened isn't nearly as bothersome as where they happened in the 
strike zone. He was up in the zone all day and you're not going to get away 
with that against this club." JOHN WEYLER

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The right team won for the wrong reason. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A best-of-five penalty-kick shootout deciding the World Cup? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was a World Series decided by a home run derby, an NBA championship 
series decided by a free-throw contest, a Super Bowl decided by a punt, pass 
and kick competition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic Games ice hockey championship also was decided by a shootout. That 
was even worse than Sunday's Cup final because I'm not so sure that Sweden was 
better than Canada. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Having developed into a bona fide soccer expert the last few weeks, I am 
certain that Brazil is better than Italy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians are so adept at dribbling, setting up plays, and controlling 
the flow of the game that their goalkeeper, Claudio (Two Names) Taffarel, could 
have taken a side job during his stay in the United States. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Italian defenders deserved enormous credit on a day when they 
couldn't count on an injured Roberto Baggio to supply the necessary offense. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The fairest way to decide the outcome would have been sudden death. To prevent 
exhaustion, unlimited substitution would be allowed during overtime. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 ABC's coverage rarely captured the color and pageantry of the tournament. A 
pregame show Sunday would have helped. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Naming the Cup all-star team last week was like naming the NCAA basketball 
all-tournament team before the championship game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers got their wake-up call a few hours late Sunday at Philadelphia. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 They made it easy for their old teammate, Fernando Valenzuela. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dodgers are playing as if they're waiting for something to happen," Rick 
Monday said on KABC, long before their seven-run rally in the ninth inning. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 They could have used some of the enthusiasm that was displayed at their home 
park Saturday night by the greatest combination since Tinkers-to- 
</P>
<P>
 Evers-to-Chance -- Carreras- 
</P>
<P>
 to-Domingo-to-Pavarotti. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Even most L.A. fans probably were rooting for Valenzuela to get a shutout when 
Mitch Webster homered to lead off the ninth. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, who knew at the time the Dodgers eventually would bring the winning 
run to the plate? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Say what you want about Bo Jackson, but no other Angel brings the excitement 
to Anaheim Stadium that he does. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball Night in America got off to a slow start on Channel 7 on Saturday 
when it stuck with Ramon Martinez warming up for 10 minutes after Orel 
Hershiser's pregame departure instead of switching to action elsewhere. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to imagine, especially this year, that Henry Aaron never hit 
as many as 50 home runs in a season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What Homer Dome? The Minnesota Twins have the fewest home runs in the major 
leagues. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price won the British Open in sensational style, but a lot of my interest 
was lost when first Tom Watson and then Fuzzy Zoeller fell out of contention. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 Some day, Peter Senior, who finished tied for 20th at Turnberry, is going to 
be a natural for a certain golf tour. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between first- and second-place money in the British Open is 
less than you might think. Price got $178,200 and runner-up Jesper Parnevik 
$142,500. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Sampras, who is skipping the L.A. Open next month, ought to play in his 
old hometown every year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 A motion picture about the Harlem Globetrotters is in the works. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference led the nation the past 12 months with seven NCAA 
team and 36 individual titles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's decision to join the Big East Conference will leave Oral Roberts 
alone as a basketball independent among the 301 NCAA Division I schools. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised that Winnipeg beat Edmonton, 50-35, the other night in a 
Canadian Football League game. Teams that pass for 713 yards usually don't win. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Rathman -- who can run, catch and block -- will help to bring some needed 
balance to the Raider attack. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Think the Giants regret having kept Phil Simms instead of Jeff Hostetler 
before the 1993 season? . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings can sign all the journeyman defensemen they want, but they won't 
make any progress until they re-sign Rob Blake. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to reports, the New York Knicks haven't yet talked to free agent 
Dominique Wilkins. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Pele nor Maradona must have read the book "No Cheering in the Press 
Box."

NEWSWIRE: RANGERS' ANGRY KEENAN IS HIRED BY THE BLUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Keenan, who coached the New York Rangers to their first Stanley Cup 
championship in 54 years and then vacated his job unexpectedly last Friday, 
became coach and general manager of the St. Louis Blues on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest in a series of surprising announcements concerning Keenan, the 
Blues confirmed the five-year deal while still meeting with Keenan at a 
restaurant in suburban St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has come around very quickly. I'm very fortunate to have the 
opportunity," Keenan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan turned down a more lucrative offer from the Detroit Red Wings, a source 
close to Keenan said. He was in Detroit on Saturday negotiating with the Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the Blue deal were not released, but team chairman Mike Shanahan said 
it was "comparable" to the $4.9-million, five-year deal Keenan had with New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan will replace coach Bob Berry, who coached the Blues for two seasons. As 
general manager, Keenan will replace Ron Caron, who was due to retire after 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be Keenan's fourth NHL coaching job in a nine-year career that has 
been marked as much by clashes as by success. His departure last week over what 
he called a breach of his contract -- the team's failure to pay him his playoff 
bonus within 30 days of the end of the postseason -- caught Ranger officials by 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers responded by saying they still considered Keenan an employee and 
would fight any attempt by another NHL team to sign him. Auto Racing  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Andretti ended Team Penske's seven-race winning streak and earned his 
fourth Toronto Molson-Indy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Andretti took control after bumping and passing Nigel Mansell for the lead on 
Lap 26. Andretti was virtually unchallenged the rest of the 98-lap, 174.44-mile 
race, beating Bobby Rahal to the finish by 6.8 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Bodine led 156 of 200 laps and beat Ward Burton by 1.26 seconds in the 
Miller Genuine Draft 500 at Pocono International Raceway in Long Pond, Pa.

</P>
<P>
 Miguel Indurain of Spain maintained his commanding lead in the Tour de France, 
as Rolf Sorensen of Denmark won the 14th stage. Indurain leads Richard Virenque 
of France by 7:56. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Ivan Lendl won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championship with a 7-5, 7-6 
(7-5) victory over MaliVai Washington in Brookline, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders re-signed strong safety Derrick Hoskins and offensive tackle Ken 
Lanier, leaving only first-round draft choice Rob Fredrickson unsigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Borotra, one of France's legendary "Four Musketeers" tennis champions who 
dominated the sport in the 1920s and '30s, died in Biarritz, France. He was 95. 
The death leaves 90-year-old Rene Lacoste as the sole survivor of the foursome. 
Jacques Brunon died in 1978 and Henri Cochet in 1987. . . . World and Olympic 
100-meter champion Linford Christie has withdrawn from the Goodwill Games 
because of a hamstring injury. . . . Trent Diguro, an offensive guard for 
Kentucky, was fatally shot in the head near the campus.

U.S. GETS A SPECIAL DELIVERY FROM COURIER; TENNIS: HIS DEFEAT OF ELTINGH GIVES 
AMERICANS 3-2 DAVIS CUP VICTORY OVER THE NETHERLANDS AFTER KRAJICEK UPSETS 
SAMPRAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Courier, rescuing the United States after a shocking loss by Pete Sampras, 
defeated Jacco Eltingh on Sunday in the deciding match of a Davis Cup 
quarterfinal against the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 After Richard Krajicek defeated Sampras earlier in the day to keep the Dutch 
alive, Courier downed Eltingh, 6-3, 6-4, 4-6, 6-1, giving the United States a 
3-2 victory in the best-of-five match competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd have to play another live match," Courier said. "But the 
bottom line is we got the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially satisfying victory for Courier, who has struggled this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't get any better than this for Jim Courier," said Tom Gullikson, 
U.S. Davis Cup captain. "He's well on his way back." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans will play Sweden in the semifinals Sept. 23-25. Sweden advanced 
with a 3-2 victory over France. 
</P>
<P>
 The other semifinal will match Russia against Germany, the defending champion. 
Germany downed Spain, 3-2, while Russia defeated the Czech Republic by the same 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States took a 2-0 lead Friday with easy victories by Sampras and 
Courier. But the Netherlands evened it with a doubles victory Saturday and 
Krajicek's 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7-5), 7-5 upset of Sampras, who is ranked No. 1 and 
this month won his second consecutive Wimbledon title. 
</P>
<P>
 That left it up to Courier and Eltingh to break the tie before a fiercely 
partisan crowd of 10,000 at a new hard-court complex next to the Rotterdam 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Courier, a two-time French Open champion, won the first set in 30 minutes and 
took the second set by breaking Eltingh in the 10th game. On set point, Eltingh 
appeared to hit a winner, but Courier chased down the ball, stretched to hit a 
tremendous passing shot and then raised his arms in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought everything was covered," Eltingh said. "It was just a great shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Eltingh came back to win the third set, but Courier dominated the final set. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the first set against Sampras, Krajicek rallied to defeat the 
American in a battle of big servers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I play well, I know I can beat anyone," Krajicek said. "I proved that 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, coming off an emotional Wimbledon, appeared to suffer a letdown 
against Krajicek. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little mentally fatigued," he said. "I've played so many matches in 
the last month, it's taking its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch fans chanted "boring, boring, boring" after Sampras served aces, and 
they repeatedly held up play with "the wave." 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd was very hostile, but that's the way Davis Cup should be," Sampras 
said. "I expected that."

 Perhaps nothing was more representative of the World Cup's effect in Los 
Angeles than a 1981 pickup truck parked outside the soccer field at Loyola 
Marymount on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the roof, in hopes of catching a glimpse of the Italian team over 
the fence, were a fan from Mexico, two Italians from Walnut and two Italian 
fans from Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 None had laid eyes on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been gone from Italy 20 years. This is the first time I see this team. 
I am so nervous just sitting," said Natalino Urbani, from Walnut.

 Said Luis Haro: "I let them sit on my truck because, with Mexico losing, I am 
now for the underdog." BILL PLASCHKE

<P>
 For Franco Baresi to end up as one of the players failing Italy in the penalty 
kick phase is almost as shocking as the failure of Roberto Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
 Baresi represents all that is good and heroic about Italian soccer.He is the 
veteran, with more international appearances than any player on the team. He 
is, at age 34, the focal point of Italy's defense, the emotional and spiritual 
leader. He plays for Italy's champion, AC Milan, which won the European title 
recently over Romario's FC Barcelona, 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Baresi played Sunday, even though he had undergone arthroscopic surgery about 
three weeks ago. He had played the first World Cup game and part of the second, 
then was injured and had the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the team biography, the following is said about Baresi: 
</P>
<P>
 "The first word that comes to mind when you talk about the captain Franco 
Baresi is reliability." 
</P>
<P>
 Also: "(He) is seen by many as the finest sweeper in the world, and will go 
down in history as one of the best ever to play the game." 
</P>
<P>
 So when Baresi stepped up to act as Italy's leadoff hitter in the penalty-kick 
lineup, everything pointed to a result other than an embarrassing shank over 
the top of the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Well after the match, when somebody other than Coach Arrigo Sacchi had to come 
out for Italy and face the press, Baresi was the choice. And when he was asked 
about his missed penalty kick, he gave a veteran answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Penalty kicks are like playing the lottery," he said. BILL DWYRE

 How well did World Cup '94 do financially? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that will take months to determine, but according to sources Sunday, 
there were a couple of indications that this event ended up with loads of black 
ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night's Three Tenors concert at Dodger Stadium, sponsored by the 
World Cup, generated $12.2 million in gross revenue. Sunday's World Cup final 
at the Rose Bowl, between Brazil and Italy, generated slightly more than $45 
million. BILL DWYRE

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; SPOTLIGHT; WHERE'S VALDO?

<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donde esta Valdo?  
</P>
<P>
 That question was asked more than a few times, in a variety of forms, of 
Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdo was the most notable Brazilian soccer player not to make Parreira's 
World Cup roster -- a creative playmaking midfielder who helped Paris St 
Germain win the French club championship this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira opted for the veteran Rai instead, a decision that had been 
second-guessed only about a couple of thousand times during the past month, 
particularly in light of Brazil's revolving door in the midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Rai did not play in Sunday's final, and after 105 minutes of nil-nil soccer, 
Parreira deposited another midfielder, Zinho, on the bench in favor of a third 
forward, Viola. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Valdo have made a difference? 
</P>
<P>
 At least one coach who has scouted Brazil, U.S. assistant Sigi Schmid, has his 
doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if they played him outside," Schmid said. "But he's very similar to 
Zinho -- left-footed as well. He might have been too similar." MIKE PENNER

 Attention was lagging in the press box early in the second half. One 
journalist was loudly commenting on how his flight was "leaving from LAX in 20 
1/2 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to a handful of Brazilian fans to liven up the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 A late-arriving family of five showed up in the second half and kicked the 
fans out of their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the Brazilians sat down in front of the press box and immediately 
attracted the attention of the ever-vigilant security guards. They refused to 
move and Thomas Lange, public relations director for the U.S. Soccer Federation 
jumped out of his seat to get help. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the fans saw the opening and took a new seat -- Lange's. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange came back and was not amused. "Get out of here," he said, looking 
flustered. "This is ridiculous."

 Italy's coach, Arrigo Sacchi, did not want to speculate Saturday, the day

 "It is difficult to plan ahead . . . so it is very premature at this time to

 Brazilian soccer players have long memories, which is why the World Cup 
victory tour will begin in Recife, a town 1,800 miles northwest of Rio de 
Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when Brazil suffered its first qualifying-round defeat--to Bolivia 
in La Paz--the team was besieged by criticism from throughout the country, 
where the loss was viewed as nothing short of a national disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in Recife. 
</P>
<P>
 There, people remained true, and the players were received so warmly that the 
federation decided to hold the rematch in Recife, where Brazil routed Bolivia, 
6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the new world champions will stop in Recife first. After that, they are 
scheduled to visit Rio, Sao Paulo and President Itamar Franco in Brasilia. In 
that order. ELLIOTT ALMOND

<P>
 Tartabull's 16th homer capped a six-run seventh inning that made the score 
9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyritz hit a two-run homer during a three-run first inning. He hit another 
two-run homer, his 15th, in a five-run ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing against their pitching staff, but I see the ball real well here and 
at SkyDome," Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees scored 84 runs against the Mariners this season and hit 12 homers, 
four by Leyritz. He has 15 home runs overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to games here and in Toronto because there are fewer 
distractions since the weather is never going to be a problem," Leyritz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Boggs went four for four and Bernie Williams had three hits for the 
Yankees, who scored 46 runs in the four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kamieniecki (6-5) earned his fifth victory in six career decisions 
against the Mariners. He gave up six hits, struck out six and walked four in 6 
2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Reggie Jefferson homered, his eighth, and Tino Martinez hit his 13th for the 
Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees scored three runs in the first against John Cummings (1-4). Bernie 
Williams singled and Boggs doubled. Don Mattingly followed with a run-scoring 
grounder before Leyritz hit a two-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 5, Cleveland 2 -- Frank Thomas and Joey Cora homered, helping the 
White Sox at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A split of the four-game series left the first-place Indians two percentage 
points ahead of the White Sox atop the AL Central. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox will play four times next weekend at Cleveland. The teams do not 
meet after that in regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Bere (10-2) gave up five hits in 5 2/3 innings and walked three with 
seven strikeouts. Dennis Cook gave up one hit in 2 1/3 innings and Roberto 
Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Morris (8-6) gave up nine hits in seven innings with five walks and six 
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 4, Detroit 1 -- Greg Gagne had a two-run double and Brian McRae 
made a great catch in center field to rob Alan Trammell of a probable two-run 
double at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 David Cone (13-4), in his first start since the All-Star game, gave up six 
hits over eight innings, striking out nine and walking three. Jeff Montgomery 
earned his 17th save. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers had runners on first and second with two out in the sixth when 
Trammell lined a shot into left-center that looked like a certain double. But 
McRae, who had misplayed a ball earlier, made a great diving catch to end the 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wally Joyner, 11 for 17 since returning from the disabled list, singled and 
scored twice and reached base for a 10th consecutive plate appearance, one 
short of the Royals' record, before grounding out in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Minnesota 3 -- Matt Mieske hit a three-run homer and Bob Scanlan 
pitched eight strong innings at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Scanlan (2-5) won his second consecutive start after not winning since last 
September. He struck out four and walked two before Mike Fetters pitched the 
ninth for his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Wrona hit a solo homer in the seventh to put the Brewers ahead by 5-3. 
His homer against Mike Trombley was his first since Oct. 1, 1989, when he was 
with the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Oakland 3 -- Tom Brunansky hit a foul sacrifice fly in the ninth 
inning to give the Red Sox the victory at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis Nixon drew a leadoff walk in the ninth from Mark Acre (4-1) and stole 
second. After Tim Naerhing walked, John Valentin sacrificed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mo Vaughn was walked intentionally, loading the bases. Brunansky hit a deep 
foul ball that left fielder Rickey Henderson caught, Nixon scoring easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 3, Texas 1 -- Dave Stewart, struggling with a 9.42 ERA over his 
previous three starts, held the Rangers to four hits over seven innings at 
Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart (6-8) ended a personal three-game losing streak, retiring the first 13 
Rangers before Juan Gonzalez hit his 14th homer into the upper deck in left. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Hall pitched the ninth for his ninth save.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; VANLANDINGHAM LEADS HOT GIANTS TO EIGHTH CONSECUTIVE 
VICTORY, 6-4 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William VanLandingham nearly made himself famous for something other than 
having the longest name in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
 VanLandingham, a rookie making his 10th start, no-hit Montreal for 7 1/3 
innings to lead the streaking San Francisco Giants to their eighth consecutive 
victory, 6-4, over the Expos at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous at first because nobody wants to be the guy to end the streak," 
said VanLandingham (5-1), who walked Rondell White leading off the first before 
retiring 22 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start thinking about it until the sixth or seventh," he said. "But 
coming out for the eighth, I was exhausted. I figured if it happens, it 
happens. It worked out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit his 34th home run and Darryl Strawberry had two hits and 
drove in a run for the Giants, who are 8-0 since Strawberry joined the club on 
July 7. 
</P>
<P>
 VanLandingham took his no-hit bid into the eighth before giving up a one-out 
double to Lenny Webster. He then walked Mike Lansing and was relieved by Pat 
Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Milligan's single against Gomez brought home the Expos' first run, and 
Montreal closed to 5-2 on Freddie Benavides' sacrifice fly. Rod Beck relieved 
Gomez and walked White before Cliff Floyd's run-scoring single cut the Giants' 
lead to 5-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Strawberry gave the Giants a three-run cushion with a run-scoring single in 
the ninth, but the Expos rallied again against Beck. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck gave up Lansing's run-scoring single, but got Lou Frazier to ground out 
with runners at first and second for his 20th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 10, St. Louis 6 -- Dante Bichette hit a grand slam and drove in a 
club-record six runs as the Rockies completed a four-game series sweep at 
Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Freeman (8-2) gave up one run and five hits in seven innings to help 
Colorado draw within two games of the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies drew 61,972 to establish another major league attendance record. 
The four-game total of 259,113 eclipsed their own record for a four-game series 
of 251,521, set against St. Louis on July 22-25, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado, posting its sixth consecutive victory over the Cardinals dating to a 
series in St. Louis this month, outscored the Cardinals during the series, 
43-17. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-RBI performance gave Bichette 89, one more than Houston's Jeff 
Bagwell. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 10, New York 1 -- Eddie Williams hit two home runs to lead a 19-hit 
attack and Phil Plantier drove in three runs at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams drove in four runs and Plantier also scored three times for the 
Padres, who scored four runs in the first inning against Pete Smith (4-9) and 
three in the fifth after two were out. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Hamilton (6-4) gave up four hits in eight innings. He walked one, struck 
out four and had a sacrifice fly for the first RBI of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 9, Pittsburgh 0 -- Steve Finley's grand slam highlighted an eight-run 
second inning and Shane Reynolds pitched seven scoreless relief innings after 
Doug Drabek was injured at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Astros couldn't win Friday despite a seven-run first inning, but there was 
no Pirate comeback this time as Drabek and Reynolds (7-4) combined on a 
five-hit shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Drabek, a former Pirate, had pitched two scoreless innings before being hit by 
Paul Wagner's fastball above the right elbow while squaring to bunt with 
Orlando Miller on first in the third. He will be examined today in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 3, Chicago 2 -- Reggie Sanders hit a bases-loaded single in the 
10th inning to give the Reds the victory at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Brumfield singled to open the 10th against Jose Bautista (3-4), his 
third hit, and advanced to second on Barry Larkin's sacrifice. After an 
intentional walk to Hal Morris and a walk to Kevin Mitchell, Sanders lined the 
second pitch off the left-field wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 2, Florida 1 -- Greg Maddux earned his 12th victory with his 
league-leading seventh complete game, and rookie Jose Oliva drove in two runs 
at Atlanta for the third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (12-5), who had lost three of four decisions, gave up nine hits and 
didn't walk a batter. He struck out seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliva, batting .444 since his recall from the minors on June 30 to fill in for 
injured third baseman Terry Pendleton, drove in both Atlanta runs with a double 
in the fourth against Rich Scheid (0-1).

HOLLYWOOD PARK; REGION WINS BEL AIR HANDICAP; SEA CADET IS LAST IN COMEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A horse returning from a layoff won the $160,300 Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood 
Park on Sunday, but his name wasn't Sea Cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea Cadet, who has earned $1.7 million, spotted Region two pounds and about 16 
months and couldn't pull it off. Region, idle since a last-place finish in the 
Santa Anita Handicap on March 5, carried 117 pounds to a narrow victory over 
Tinners Way, also under 117 pounds, in the Bel Air, while Sea Cadet, out of 
action since Nov. 21, 1992, ran last in a field of six as the 119-pound 
highweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where had that horse (Region) been?" asked Ron McAnally, the trainer of Sea 
Cadet, after the winner ran 1 1/16 miles in 1:40 1/5, matching the stakes 
record and missing Power Forward's 1987 track record by a fifth of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 Told that Region had been sidelined because of an ulcerated throat, McAnally 
said: "That sounds like my horse. He couldn't get any air after three-quarters 
of a mile. He was making a loud sound, some kind of a noise. He had epiglottis 
surgery the year before last, but he still makes a noise. But at least he came 
back sound." 
</P>
<P>
 Region was ridden by Gary Stevens, who was drafted by trainer Richard Mandella 
after Corey Nakatani suffered what is believed to be a minor injury to his left 
wrist in the third race. His mount, Stolen Loot, broke down near the quarter 
pole. At first Nakatani said that he would only sit out a few races and return 
for the Bel Air, but then he took off for the rest of the day. Stolen Loot 
suffered a broken right foreleg and was destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye, who had ridden Region in the Big 'Cap, might also have 
been a possible replacement, but he is recovering from nasal surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Region, a 5-year-old gelded son of Devil's Bag, the champion 2-year-old colt 
in 1983, and State, a Nijinsky II mare, races for his Kentucky breeder, 
Caliborne Farm. The third choice behind 3-2 Tinners Way and 5-2 Sea Cadet, 
Region paid $8.60 and earned $92,800 for his seventh victory in 19 starts. 
Tinners Way, beaten by a neck, finished three lengths ahead of Williamstown, 
who led the way until the top of the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens found room on the rail, an opening that might have belonged to Tinners 
Way and Kent Desormeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get outrun, we got outrode," Desormeaux said. "I was right where 
the winner was, and I elected not to take the chance of getting trapped. So I 
swung three-wide. Then the winner filled the spot that I was in. Unfortunately, 
that's what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens rides frequently for Mandella, recently winning the Beverly Hills 
Handicap with Corrazona. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hole opened at the five-sixteenths (pole)," Stevens said. "I moved a 
little earlier than I normally would. I was afraid it might be a little too 
early and that he was going to get a little tired, which he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens had ridden Region once before, finishing in a dead heat for first 
place with Finder's Fortune in an allowance at Santa Anita in 1993. The Bel Air 
was Region's first victory since the Skywalker Handicap at Santa Anita eight 
months ago. Other than the Big 'Cap, his only other start this year had been a 
third-place finish -- later changed to second after a disqualification -- in 
the San Antonio Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Region was coughing after he ran so poorly in the Big 'Cap. "We were pretty 
excited about him going into the year, and he ran a good race in the San 
Antonio," Mandella said. "When they found the ulceration, between the 
epiglottis and the soft palate, I took him to my farm and we spent a month 
flushing it out and cleaning it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the throat, another of Region's problems appeared to be that he didn't 
believe how good he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would get intimidated by horses, and that would make him hard to ride," 
Mandella said. "But now he's a sweetheart to ride. We started training him with 
inferior horses in the mornings, and he was so much better than them, that got 
his confidence up." 
</P>
<P>
 Region might give Mandella two runners in the $1-million Pacific Classic at 
Del Mar on Aug. 13. The other probable is Best Pal, who won the race in 1991, 
when Gary Jones trained him. Best Pal's Pacific Classic prep is expected to be 
the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on July 30. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis, the meet's leading jockey, appealed a five-day suspension, then 
dropped the appeal and will begin serving it on Wednesday. Solis leads Gary 
Stevens in winners, 76-64. . . . Laffit Pincay on Sunday rode at River Downs, 
the track near Cincinnati, and won the $150,000 Budweiser Breeders' Cup Stake 
with Highland Crystal, trained by Barclay Tagg. Pincay won the Gamely Handicap 
at Hollywood Park with Tagg's Miss Josh in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrett Gomez, a leading Midwest jockey, has arrived in California and will 
begin riding at Hollywood on Wednesday. On successive days in April, Gomez won 
the Arkansas Derby with Concern at Oaklawn Park and the Lexington Stakes with 
Southern Rhythm at Keeneland. Gomez finished third with Concern in the 
Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat, who isn't expected to run, was assigned high weight of 124 
pounds for next Sunday's $300,000 Vanity Handicap. The starting highweight 
probably will be Golden Klair at 119 pounds. . . . Grand Flotilla was given the 
high weight of 119 pounds for the $250,000 Sunset Handicap, which will also be 
run on Sunday.

BRITISH OPEN / DAILY REPORT; FRUSTRATION OF POOR PUTTING RETURNS TO HAUNT 
WATSON, END HOPES FOR TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tom Watson's bid for a record-tying sixth British Open title faded like a 
bleached shirt Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson began the day at eight under but finished with a disappointing 
four-over 74. Watson wasn't low American. He wasn't even low Tom. That went to 
Tom Kite, who ended the tournament at five under, one better than Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, it was Watson's putting that did him in. The new and improved stroke 
he had used earlier in the week betrayed him in the final round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 38 putts and that really says it all," he said. "I three-putted eight 
and nine for double bogeys. I couldn't make any putts. Only one remarkable putt 
at seven from two feet. It was very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, 44, isn't giving up. He said he will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I've got plenty of more chances," he said of his championship 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Nick Price and his caddie, Jeff (Squeeky) Medlen, walked off the 18th 
green, 13-year-old David Williams of Cornwall, England, asked for the historic 
ball used on the final putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlen tossed it to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wasn't satisfied. When Price emerged from the scorer's trailer and 
handed Medlen his putter, Williams asked for that too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gave you a ball," said Medlen, "don't get funny on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams slinked away. 
</P>
<P>
 "A joke," he said later. "A harmless joke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, who began the British Open as the defending champion, finished 
with a 69 and four-day total of 276. As did Watson, he blamed his putter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too happy with the defense of my title," he said. "Why? Well, I look 
at the scoreboard and see that I'm not enough below par. I should have made a 
lot more putts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my title on the putting greens. I missed more putts from 10 feet than 
I have in the past four years." 
</P>
<P>
 The gracious Norman, who left the course immediately after the round, called 
the media tent from his jet and left a message of congratulations for his 
friend Price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting a first-round two-under 68, John Daly plummeted quickly. His 
last three rounds: 72, 72, 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those players who made the cut, Daly finished last at 292. His final 
back nine of 44 included five bogeys and a quadruple bogey. The latter came at 
the 16th, where Daly twice landed his ball in the stream known as Wilson's 
Burn. At 18, Daly was in such a hurry that he took less than five seconds to 
take his third shot after partner David Gilford had played. 
</P>
<P>
 After the round, Daly didn't stick around long. After signing a few dozen 
autographs, he got in a car and sped off. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

HOT JOBS: LOVE OF THE ROAD KEEPS HIM TRUCKIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Doug Cruz, 47, took his first truck-driving job 25 years ago to earn money for 
college. But by the time he completed his degree, he was burned out on school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to be out on the road, and driving a truck paid well and the 
benefits were good," said Cruz, who originally wanted to be a football coach. 
"I stayed on and sooner or later, I had been driving for five years, and then 
10 years and so on. It's a good living." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, who drives for Food 4 Less Supermarkets in La Habra, begins his day at 
4:30 a.m. at the company's Los Angeles warehouse. Workers load the truck and 
Cruz performs a safety check. Then he heads out to make his first delivery at 
one of several Orange County stores on his route. 
</P>
<P>
 "The safety check is very important, because the company gives you the option 
of not leaving the yard if you think the load is unsafe. If something bad 
happened on the road, and you could have spotted the problem in advance, then 
you'd have only yourself to blame," Cruz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on demand, Cruz hauls general merchandise and produce to two to four 
stores per day. That means as many as three round trips from Los Angeles to 
Orange County. "It's hard when the traffic is heavy and I have lots of trips to 
make," said Cruz. "I have to be alert and watch for the other guy, since I'm 
hauling about 85,000 pounds of equipment and need space the size of a football 
field to stop. People forget that and make dangerous moves in front of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, whose workday ends at 1:30 p.m., prefers local hauls and daytime hours 
to out-of-state runs that keep drivers away from home overnight. "That's a 
different kind of life. I'm really lucky to have worked days most of my career. 
However, some guys prefer working nights when the traffic is lighter. I have 
good pay and benefits. I get lots of overtime, especially during holidays." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz advises beginning truck drivers to avoid working for companies that bend 
the rules and push drivers to the limit. "There are lots of non-union 
truck-driving jobs out there where drivers end up spending too many hours on 
the road without sleep, just to get the loads in on time. It's not safe," he 
cautioned. "Also, it's harder to get full-time truck-driving jobs these days, 
since many companies are only hiring part-time drivers. But you just have to 
keep trying." OCCUPATION: Truck driver 
</P>
<P>
 * What's involved: Transporting goods from point to point. Size and type of 
vehicle depends on amount and type of cargo. Some drive large moving vans on 
cross-country trips. Others haul products from warehouses to retail outlets in 
surrounding communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Qualifications: Driving large tractor-trailer rigs requires a Class A 
license. This involves several hours of training, including instruction in 
traffic laws, weight and safety regulations and the physical operation of the 
rig. Drivers must pass written and driving tests administered by the DMV. A 
physical exam, including drug test, is required. License must be renewed every 
four years and physical exam must be repeated every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: By 1998, the number of truck drivers is projected to increase by 
7.4% to 7,140. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salary range: $8-$17 per hour 
</P>
<P>
 * Pros: Work is performed outside an office environment, away from constant 
supervision. Often involves a variety of destinations, including out of state. 
Many truck-driving jobs are unionized and provide paid medical and retirement 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cons: Long hauls and overnight stays can be disruptive to family life, and 
are often more popular with young, single drivers. Shorter trips on crowded 
freeways and surface streets can be stressful, because drivers must meet 
delivery schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advancement: Drivers may become dispatchers, schedulers, routers or 
supervisors. Some advance to administrative positions, such as transportation 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quote: "I like being out on the road and talking with people at the stores 
on my route. It's a good living." -- Doug Cruz, truck driver, Food 4 Less

BUMPY OUTING FOR PILOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growing up in public isn't easy if you're still a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case with Stone Temple Pilots, the mega-selling young hard-rock 
band that has been thrust into the hit-maker's spotlight at a time when its 
four members are clearly unprepared to deliver a convincing stage show. 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially true of singer Scott Weiland, who earned poor marks for both 
charisma and comportment Saturday night at Irvine Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 You could tell that Weiland was trying to be a nice guy, mainly addressing the 
audience in a friendly, if pro forma way (greeting the packed house early in 
the show, he chose that scintillating subject, the weather). But before long, 
he couldn't help flying into a foul-mouthed, incoherent rage at somebody in the 
audience for "invading my space" -- apparently he'd been hit by something 
hurled from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 If a star wants to zing someone in an audience who gets out of line, fine. But 
do it with some wit and self-possession. Weiland never made it clear just what 
had gotten him stirred up as he spat out a long, addled stream of invective, 
ending with a sarcastic sexual invitation to the offender. Of course, wit and 
coherence aren't Weiland's strong suits as a lyricist, either, so perhaps it's 
too much to expect him to extemporize effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland was right about having his space invaded, though. Robert DeLeo's 
raging bass dominated the audio mix to the point where it frequently came close 
to obliterating both Weiland's grainy vocals and Dean DeLeo's guitar. There 
ought to be a commandment for sound engineers: No matter what else happens, 
thou shalt make the singer audible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a testament to the sweep and insistence of STP's melodic hooks that the 
crowd frequently sang along to a singer who couldn't be heard well. It's the 
catchy choruses and the meaty, Zeppelin-style riffing that have landed Stone 
Temple Pilots' just-released second album, "Purple," near the top of the charts 
at the same time that its grunge-oriented 1992 debut, "Core," is still doing 
brisk business at nearly 4 million copies and counting. STP chose its material 
well, playing 10 of the 11 songs on the much-improved "Purple" and including 
the better half of the "Core" stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a clear, sinewy sound, though, no rock band can flourish. Potential 
blazers such as the Nirvana-like "Unglued" were blunted by the mix. More music 
got through on stately numbers such as "Big Empty" and "Interstate Love Song." 
Clarity came only during a passable three-song acoustic set featuring "Pretty 
Penny," "Creep" and a brisk if inconsequential rendering of David Bowie's "Andy 
Warhol." Weiland buried himself in a plush rocking chair during the unplugged 
bit and puffed on a cigarette between lines. One wondered why the acoustic 
interlude was being played on a homey living room set -- there was no byplay or 
interchange between band members as the disengaged Weiland stayed sunk in his 
chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were there sparks when the band was rocking. As a front man, Weiland 
simply doesn't have it yet. As a 26-year-old with only two albums behind him, 
let's hope he's in the early stages of a rising learning curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiland did the boring Jim Morrison microphone cling, and he did a lot of odd 
little arm-waving, hip-waddling steps in a stooped position, which made him 
look like an arthritic old man trying to dance the limbo or the hula. 
</P>
<P>
 On record, despite the songs' lyrical ungainliness, emotional hues come 
through: world-weariness, resentment and titanic expressions of pain, tempered 
by some hopeful moments. The combination of a hostile mix and his own lack of 
stage stature made it impossible for Weiland to conjure any vivid feeling in 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
 He got no help from his band mates. The DeLeo brothers and drummer Eric Kretz 
were just there to keep their heads down and play. A fancy light show is one 
telling sign of a band in need of a crutch, and STP's went for overkill. The 
band played on a proscenium-like set hung with curtains and dominated by two 
huge imitation lava lamps whose shades served as screens for psychedelic 
projections. Often it was hard to spot the players amid clouds of stage smoke. 
During several songs, blinding strobe lights made it hard to look at anything 
at all. 
</P>
<P>
 With no crisp sound, no sign of comradeship or mutual mission, and a 
hot-headed front man with a mile-wild churlish streak and no gift for the 
stage, Stone Temple Pilots was left with just one thing going for it: quickly 
familiar melodies and dramatic arrangements that are like rock candy to a hard 
rock fan. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-billed Meat Puppets are enjoying the first hit of their long career 
with the song "Backwater" and the album, "Too High to Die." The Arizona trio 
apparently has spent some of its newly gotten gains to hire a fourth, 
unidentified member who played rhythm guitar and freed Curt Kirkwood to solo at 
will. Not much else has changed, judging from this no-nonsense 45-minute set 
(well, a little nonsense, in Kirkwood's brief, spacey musings on the 
possibilities of the Earth being obliterated by a comet). 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkwood is probably the most accomplished and versatile guitarist of the '80s 
indie-rock movement, and he lived up to that reputation with all manner of 
psychedelic wailing, shimmering electric glides, and assured, country-accented 
acoustic picking. 
</P>
<P>
 His singing remains creaky, although harmonies by his bassist brother, Cris, 
helped Meat Puppets attain a certain raggedy rightness along the lines of the 
Grateful Dead's Jerry Garcia-Bob Weir tandem. In a surprising move, Curt 
Kirkwood sang an old-line R & B ballad, "Nothing Takes the Place of You," and 
the sheer fervency of his delivery helped his stringy, over-taxed yowl get the 
song across. It served as a rootsy lead-in to a countrified acoustic set that 
included a gleaming "Up on the Sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The Meat Puppets also suffered from a bass-heavy mix, though not so intrusive 
as Stone Temple Pilots. The band is a valuable, if belated addition to the 
mainstream because of its ability to change stylistic hues, and to remind us 
that music can evoke magical, transporting moments. Just the right antidote to 
the monolithic anguish, ire and gloom that have become so tired and 
commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing gloomy about Redd Kross, another long-lasting product of 
'80s alternative rock. The band played its set as a lark, filling the big stage 
with all manner of scampering about in affectionate, tongue-in-cheek imitation 
of such '70s funsters as the Kinks, Slade and Cheap Trick. They may have gone a 
bit overboard with it: Maybe these perpetual underdogs felt a sense of 
absurdity playing for 15,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was plenty of purely musical enchantment in juicy pop choruses 
featuring Jeff McDonald's Lennonesque leads and the sharp harmonies of his 
brother Steve. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening band was Rust, a drab Soundgarden knockoff from San Diego. 
Somebody said that rust never sleeps. This Rust might induce it.

BITTEN BY THE LEGAL BUG; FLEAS MAKE LIFE TOUGH FOR STAFF IN TEMPORARY 
COURTHOUSE TRAILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Christopher Koch was minding his own business, doing the chores that fill a 
courtroom clerk's day, when he sensed the swirl about his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 He peeked under his desk in Van Nuys. Fleas were sampling his shoes. Fleas 
were dining on his socks. Fleas were nipping on his pants. Incredible numbers 
of fleas were in the air, swarming about like a cyclone, leaping up through a 
hole in the courtroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw fleas everywhere," Koch said. "It was absolutely, positively 
disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the jokes began. Why, the courthouse is abuzz with flea bargaining. 
Anyone want to cop a flea? 
</P>
<P>
 In trailers just north of the main seven-story courthouse, structures pressed 
into service as make-do courtrooms because of the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, there exists what an internal memo concedes is a "severe 
infestation of fleas." 
</P>
<P>
 No cases have been scratched from the dockets, court officials said. But court 
staffers and judges are itching for a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Koch was the first to notice the "pest problem," as the July 8 memo terms it, 
when he became a flea feast earlier this month. "I couldn't believe it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailers, about the size of mobile homes, are semi-permanent fixtures on 
the court landscape. They were once used for Juvenile Court duty. That ended 
about two years ago and, for many months, they stood empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the earthquake, which put the San Fernando Superior Court out of 
commission until at least next spring. San Fernando judges moved into the Van 
Nuys courthouse; to make room, judges had to be farmed out to the seven 
courtrooms in the trailers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like mobile homes taken off the road, the trailers do not sit directly on the 
ground. Instead, they are perched a few inches off the soil, fixed on blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 That arrangement creates a crawl space -- perfect for cats, rats, possums, 
squirrels and other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, some of these animals do have a tendency to take refuge under 
a trailer or a house, any structure, because they want to have their own hiding 
places," said Frank Hall, chief of the county health department's Vector-Borne 
Disease Program, which oversees the fight against such disease transmitters -- 
or "vectors" -- as fleas, ticks, rats and mites. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, well, these animals do tend to have flea problems, especially in the 
summer, because the reproduction cycle increases as the temperature rises." 
</P>
<P>
 In early July, Koch, a clerk for Superior Court Judge John Farrell, saw the 
swarm beneath his desk, coming up through a hole cut in the floor for an 
electrical cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to assess the damage, Koch said, he took his shoe off and rolled up his 
cuff. He found fleas "all the way across" the top of his sock.  
</P>
<P>
 In another room in the trailers, attorney Mary Sauve also began encountering 
fleas. She ended up with 30 bites. 
</P>
<P>
 A security guard in the hallway, R. F. James, topped that -- 42 bites.  
</P>
<P>
 Koch, meanwhile, got ticked off. He trapped seven fleas and taped them to a 
sheet of paper from a telephone message pad. He presented the evidence to 
Farrell, who quickly called for help from court administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made the rest of us start scratching, just thinking about it," Yaras said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, according to the July 8 memo written by court administrator Timothy 
Adams, it was believed that stray cats were the source of the fleas.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, security guard James said, the crawl space has yielded six dead 
kittens and two possums.  
</P>
<P>
 A first blast of fumigation, the weekend of July 9-10, was apparently not 
enough to kill all the fleas, Adams said. It also left behind a chemical stench 
so strong that most of the trailer courtrooms doors were open throughout the 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the doors open, the noise and fumes of buses lurching down the street, 
just a few paces away from the front entrance to the trailers, roared regularly 
into the courtrooms. Occasionally, trucks from the fire station down the block 
contributed more fumes and sirens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very loud. Very hard to hear," said Judge William MacLaughlin. "But it's 
preferable to (the fumigation) odor." Jurors have not registered any 
complaints, at least officially, bailiffs and clerks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exterminators are due back. Adams promises that fumigation will continue until 
"the problem with the fleas no longer exists." He also vowed to board up the 
crawl spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the flea-eradication campaign, Adams said, is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not an earthquake, it's fleas," Koch said in a burst of biting social 
commentary. "It's always something."

FINANCIAL SCAM'S VICTIMS GO AFTER LOTTERY WINNER'S JACKPOT IN COURT; LAWSUIT: 
THEY SAY EX-OFFICIAL OF FIRM IGNORED OR OVERLOOKED FRAUD. THE DEFENDANT, WHO 
WON $10.3 MILLION, DENIES NEGLIGENCE OR KNOWLEDGE OF WRONGDOING.

<P>
 In retrospect, Jan. 6, 1990, could be viewed as the luckiest, and possibly the 
unluckiest, day of A. Bernard Silver's life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on that otherwise quiet Sunday that the retired civil servant from Palm 
Springs won big in the California lottery, beating out 15.3 million other 
entries for $10.3 million, a sum that came to $415,200 a year, after taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 But today in Santa Monica Superior Court, a trial is scheduled to begin to 
determine whether Silver and his wife will be entitled to keep their riches. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his big jackpot, Silver was chief financial officer of the 
Marshall Plan, a now-closed Santa Monica-based investment group whose president 
was convicted last year of defrauding 200 investors of about $26 million. 
Silver, his wife and the company's corporate secretary have been sued by 
investors seeking to reclaim losses of approximately $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Although attorneys for the investors say Silver did not overtly participate in 
fraudulent behavior, they argue that he either ignored, or chose to overlook, 
the longtime unscrupulous dealings of the group, which brokered mortgages and 
bought and sold trust deeds, and which preyed mainly on elderly investors. And 
that, say attorneys, makes Silver and other board members liable for the 
investors' lost money. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the CFO, he was better positioned than anyone else to know what was going 
on in the company," said attorney Eric Edmunds, who is representing the 
investors. "And he was alerted to a lot of signs. He should have known that it 
all smelled funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Characterized by attorneys for both sides as a flamboyant figure who openly 
cultivated celebrities and politicians, the company's president, Nell Marshall, 
cut a swath through Westside society with her high-profile lifestyle. According 
to Edmunds, Marshall's world was one of lavish soirees, annual trips to 
Churchill Downs to watch the Kentucky Derby, and expensive homes in Beverly 
Hills and Marina del Rey. Silver, he said, accompanied her for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked the lifestyle and he liked rubbing shoulders with the celebrities 
and politicians," Edmunds said. "He went along with it." Beginning in the 
mid-1980s, however, Marshall began to experience reversals resulting from the 
recession and bad investments. It was then, say attorneys from both sides, that 
she began taking investors' money to settle corporate debts, as well as pay for 
personal expenses. In April, 1991, said Silver's attorney, Eric Olson, Marshall 
suddenly dropped from sight, leaving control of the company in the hands of the 
board of directors, which included Silver. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1991, the state closed down the Marshall Plan, acting on complaints 
from investors that their dividend checks were bouncing. When the state 
investigated the group, officials found that company trust funds were depleted 
and that investors had walked off with company files to track down their 
investments, said Diedre Hill, one of the attorneys representing the investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall surfaced in July, 1991, and last year was found guilty of five counts 
of grand theft and sentenced to seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson said there is no evidence that Silver was negligent in his duties or 
knew of any wrongdoing. The attorney characterized Silver's role in running the 
company as mostly ceremonial, given that he had retired from a civil service 
job and moved with his wife out of the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 While investors are unclear about the role of Silver's wife, Betty Jane, also 
a retired civil servant, they believe she was involved in running the company, 
Edmunds said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have is a pair of retired civil servants who happened to be living 
off the winnings from a lottery," Olson said. "That the unpaid directors or 
officers of the company were doing this (illegal) stuff . . . is implausible." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson also contends that Silver's wealth should not be a factor in deciding 
whether he was culpable for any of the investors' losses. Silver, he says, was 
himself an investor in the Marshall Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 While Edmunds declined to say that Silver's wealth was the overriding 
motivation behind the suit, he did allow that it was a significant factor.  
</P>
<P>
 "It helps us to know that there's a solvent defendant good for the damages we 
might get," he said.

STREET SMART / AARON CURTISS: FROM ELECTRONIC NERVE CENTER, CALTRANS COMBATS 
TRAFFIC TIE-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Over just a few minutes, it happens -- just as it happens five mornings a week 
52 weeks a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:45 a.m. the tiny lights embedded in the giant road map on the wall 
flicker green, then many change to yellow, then many more to red. In muted 
colors, the television monitors on the wall show a steady stream of cars moving 
mostly fast, then mostly slow, then not at all through Downtown's four-level 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly and quickly, the morning rush hour has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 And while traffic on the Santa Monica Freeway crawls a few miles away, the 
workday is just starting to speed up inside the California Department of 
Transportation traffic operations facility -- the electronic nerve center for 
Los Angeles County's 527 miles of freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here in a windowless room in a drab 1960s Downtown office building that 
the Big Brothers of the Open Road scan the freeways electronically for problems 
-- stalled cars, wayward ladders or other road problems -- and try to solve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 What the cadre of traffic engineers and dispatchers can do now is fairly 
limited. They can dispatch crews or California Highway Patrol officers to scoop 
up debris or help clear accidents. They can flash messages on the lovable 
Freeway Condition signs, warn the media of nasty tie-ups and, in extreme 
situations, change the sequence of on-ramp meter lights. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this helps move traffic along, but it is not exactly an Orwellian 
Ministry of Traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Caltrans folks say, they will be able to solve many of the 
freeways' everyday headaches without ever leaving the room. In time, new 
computers and new equipment will allow them to coordinate signals on city 
streets with freeway traffic and thus manipulate real cars just like toys with 
a few double-clicks of a computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, workers such as Alex Reyman watch and wait and do what they 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From his desk, Reyman can watch images transmitted via microwave by 18 video 
cameras installed along the freeways. Intended to show the current condition of 
certain freeway stretches, the cameras can be rotated or zoomed in to get a 
clearer picture of a problem area. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyman said the images are not clear enough to catch unwitting motorists in 
subtle but embarrassing situations, such as being face-first in a cheese danish 
or knuckle-deep in a nose scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 They are clear enough to catch more obvious events. "We see people bump into 
each other all the time, fender-benders," said Reyman. "Sometimes we see people 
running across the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a box of sombreros fell off a truck and was hit by a car as traffic 
engineers watched on their monitor. The engineers thought they had a 
"situation" on their hands until, as they watched, every last sombrero rolled 
unaided off the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger problems are not so easy. Traffic congestion has grown faster than 
traffic technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, motorists drove about 81 million miles a day on the freeways and 
highways of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Eight of the 10 busiest freeway 
interchanges in the country are in Los Angeles. And the busiest -- the East Los 
Angeles interchange -- cycles through 570,000 vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodating all this traffic is a freeway system that was designed in the 
1950s and built over the 1960s and 1970s. The traffic operations center was 
built in 1971 to make the most efficient use of the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant map on the wall of the operations center displays Southern 
California's freeways illuminated by hundreds of tiny lights. The map's lights 
are connected to a computer, which in turn is fed by hundreds of sensors 
embedded every half-mile or so in the freeway -- one for every light on the 
map. 
</P>
<P>
 As congestion around a sensor increases, the lights change from green, which 
indicates free-flowing traffic, to yellow, which indicates some slowing, to 
red, which indicates traffic as usual. In other words, practically stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right around 8 a.m., most of it goes red," Reyman said, his spotless desk 
occupied only by a half-filled plastic-foam coffee cup and a logbook filled 
with careful entries. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was dedicated by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, the giant map was state of 
the art, a twinkling testament to the region's passion for making the freeways 
free-moving arteries of freedom and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 More advanced computers now sit on desktops in the center, churning out more 
detailed data and giving engineers a clearer picture of what the road ahead 
holds for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 The map is mostly for show now -- a funky prop that looks good when the 
occasional television news crew comes by to film, as occurred in the first 
hectic weeks after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a routine day the center runs along quietly. Radios carrying the 
conversations of CHP officers and Caltrans crews and tow truck drivers drone in 
the background. Computer cooling fans hum quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, new equipment such as the video cameras have come on line. The 
Freeway Service Patrol tow truck fleet is monitored in one corner of the room 
by Julie Jefferson, a no-nonsense woman who keeps tabs on her 144 drivers via a 
computer screen. Computers also relay information from CHP officers in the 
field. And they update a cable television program that displays current road 
conditions -- presumably for those with TVs at the wheel -- called "Freeway 
Vision." 
</P>
<P>
 But all of this seems almost antique when compared to the complexity of a new 
program being installed as part of a pilot project along the Santa Monica 
Freeway. The $50-million Smart Corridor program will allow engineers Downtown 
to manipulate road conditions and to relay information to drivers to reduce 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of your life in Los Angeles is spent in your car that any little 
change, even a minute, can get really annoying," said Caltrans spokesman Russ 
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the future, Big Brother will not only be watching. If the engineers can 
pull it off, he may also help out.

COLOMBIAN COCAINE PROSECUTOR CALLS WORLDWIDE DRUG WAR FUTILE; NARCOTICS: 
LEGALIZATION WOULD REDUCE CARTELS' PROFITS, DE GREIFF TELLS FORUM. HE SAYS U.S. 
HAS BEEN TRYING TO DISCREDIT HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD LEE COLVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The message is that the worldwide war on drugs should be abandoned, and the 
man responsible for prosecuting Colombian cocaine cartels brought that 
controversial view here on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks by Gustavo de Greiff were the highlight of a forum on the subject 
sponsored by local business and entertainment leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 De Greiff, for the past two years the point man for the Colombian government's 
anti-drug campaign, has been bluntly criticized by the U.S. Justice Department 
for negotiating plea bargains with traffickers, and for arguing that 
legalization would deny the cartels billions of dollars in profits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war as it has been conducted is a failure," said de Greiff. 
"Narco-trafficking is a big business and business stops being good business 
when it stops profiting." 
</P>
<P>
 He told a Beverly Hills audience of several hundred at a drug policy forum 
that more land than ever is being cultivated with coca, the plant from which 
cocaine is derived -- despite U.S.-assisted efforts to crack down on drug 
kingpins and to stanch the flow of the narcotic into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, less than 15% of the cocaine shipped out of Colombia is 
seized before it reaches markets in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking back at his critics, de Greiff accused the U.S. government of trying 
to discredit him by pressuring convicted drug traffickers to claim him as an 
ally in their illicit trade. 
</P>
<P>
 He also charged that the United States was behind a campaign to smear 
Colombia's newly elected president, Ernesto Samper, orchestrating the release 
of audiocassettes of a conversation in which a top drug kingpin discusses plans 
to contribute to Samper's election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, de Greiff said, Samper will not be able to reach plea bargains 
that require traffickers to dismantle their operations, without seeming like he 
has been corrupted by the cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new president will not be able to move in any way but repression," said 
de Greiff, who will soon leave office. "That is stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 De Greiff was one of seven panelists at the forum sponsored by Town Hall of 
Los Angeles, a business group, and Show Coalition, an entertainment industry 
public affairs group. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its leaders, actor Richard Dreyfuss, who acknowledged his own past 
cocaine problems Sunday, moderated the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists included high-profile professors, researchers, policy experts 
and writers who all agreed that America's drug war -- like the Prohibition-era 
campaign against alcohol -- is misguided and creates more misery than it 
eliminates. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers said they invited U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders and 
other Clinton Administration officials to participate, but none accepted. Last 
fall, Elders said that legalizing drugs would "markedly reduce our crime rate," 
and she called for further study of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans and Democrats alike immediately criticized Elders for that view, 
and the Administration quickly distanced itself from her remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's strategy has been to emphasize treatment for hard-core 
drug users, and to target drug producers in countries such as Colombia. But 
panelists said the Administration hasn't budgeted enough funds for treatment 
and education. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge who in 1992 suggested legalizing the use 
of marijuana, cocaine and heroin appeared on the panel Sunday. James P. Gray 
called de Greiff a hero for his stand on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said his support for legalization does not mean he condones drug use. 
Rather, he said, it recognizes that "we have never had a drug-free society and 
we never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of treating drug users like criminals, he said, they deserve 
compassion and help out of their addictions. Gray joined the others in calling 
for an independent commission to re-examine the nation's drug strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Gray, an author and screenwriter who is finishing a book on Prohibition, 
said that like Prohibition, the drug war has created massive police corruption, 
an exploding prison population and a rise in street violence, with no 
noticeable drop in drug use.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MAKING A DIFFERENCE; 
YOUNG ARTISTS LEARN TO DRAW ON THEIR TALENT

 Most California public schools offer some kind of art instruction, but 
students whose talent races ahead of the pack lack access to expert 
instruction, advanced materials and career guidance. Public and private schools 
faced with hard budget choices usually feel they can't spare the funds for 
gifted art-student programs. The Herbert D. Ryman Living Masters Program fills 
that gap, offering art students enriched instruction by successful artists and 
professionals in related fields. The program is named for the late artist who 
created the original drawings of Disneyland, when it was just a gleam in Walt 
Disney's eye. It is supported by Ryman's friends, relatives and the Los Angeles 
Children's Museum. Each Saturday, the students, selected by an expert panel, 
meet downtown at Los Angeles' Otis College of Art & Design to attend drawing 
and painting classes taught by professional instructors and by guest 
architects, designers and fine artists. More than 150 students from 68 Southern 
California schools have graduated since the program began in 1990. This fall 
classes will be relocated to USC's School of Fine Arts, where the students will 
have access to campus studio space, art facilities and libraries. HARD TIMES

 "Being a part of this helped me to become more serious about school and 
becoming an artist. To be an artist you have to think, you have to study hard. 
You start seeing the relationship between English and literature with art. My 
grades got better, too. I'm going to junior college this fall and then I'll go 
to art school."

</P>
<P>
 "I took art classes on my own, but after a while I couldn't afford it. The 
best part about the training is that it's free -- including all of the 
supplies. Because of the program my skills really improved and I have contact 
with other artists -- my teachers and classmates. We talk and look at each 
other's work and we help each other. I get to learn about how other people 
think about art." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikki Anderson, 15, junior at Notre Dame High School, Sherman Oaks 
</P>

 "The Ryman students are from all over the L.A. area. I made friends who live 
too far away for me to visit, but we write. I didn't notice how diverse we were 
at first, but my classmates were Asian, Latino, African American. I was the 
only Caucasian student.  
</P>
<P>
 You can't take art all the way through most public schools. They had to cut 
what they think is extracurricular stuff. The reason I went to a private school 
was because it has an art program."

VALENZUELA ONLY ADDS TO DODGER WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers, acutely aware of the pounding footsteps of the San Francisco 
Giants and Colorado Rockies, spent Sunday morning in closed-door meetings, 
trying to figure out their offensive problems. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, players were called in and talked to in a positive way about their 
situation, which can be summed up in one word: slump. Fred Claire, executive 
vice president, and Manager Tom Lasorda were there for most of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was something the Dodgers couldn't factor in, a left-hander they had 
factored out on a lazy spring day four seasons ago in another closed-door 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at Veterans Stadium, the Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Dodgers, 
9-7, behind Fernando Valenzuela, who had a four-hit shutout until the ninth 
inning, when Mitch Webster hit a cut fastball over the left field fence and 
began a seven-run rally. The late offensive outburst might have been enough to 
give at least a glimmer of hope, but it did nothing to calm Lasorda's ire. 
</P>
<P>
 "What . . . good is it? We lost," Lasorda said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Dodgers lost for the third time in four games against the Phillies, 
the Giants won their eighth in a row to move to within 4 1/2 games of the 
Dodgers in the National League West. The Rockies have closed the gap to two 
games, giving the Dodgers a lot to worry about as they travel to New York for 
the start of a three-game series against the Mets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give up that many runs in two games and overcome," Lasorda said 
with controlled anger. "They battled back, but it wasn't good enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The Phillies scored 25 runs and had 38 hits in the four games; the Dodgers 
also had 38 hits, but only 19 runs, indicating the problem -- they don't score. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't get any runs for eight innings and then turn around and score seven 
and have the winning run at the plate," Lasorda said, pounding his fork into 
some chicken. "Funny game." 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela, against whom only one Dodger reached second base and who retired 
13 consecutive batters before the ninth inning, tired quickly in the ninth. He 
threw a mixture of cut fastballs, a pitch he learned after he left the Dodgers, 
along with his vintage screwballs and fastballs.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of hitters still think I am a screwball pitcher, so that's why I've 
come up with a cutter and throw the straight fastball," said Valenzuela, who is 
1-2 with a 2.84 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Valenzuela's first National League victory since Sept. 14, 1990, and it 
nearly escaped him. After Webster's leadoff home run in the ninth, Valenzuela 
issued his first walk, to Raul Mondesi, before Carlos Hernandez drove a 1-and-2 
pitch into the Dodger bullpen in left field, which had been pretty active 
during the game. Starter Pedro Astacio (6-7) gave up six runs in only 2 1/3 
innings, his shortest outing of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Dodgers behind by eight runs after the top of the eighth, Lasorda 
inserted his reserves, including Webster and Hernandez, who replaced Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hernandez homered, which made the score 9-3, Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi 
walked to the mound, and Valenzuela spent the walk to the dugout trying to 
figure out how to acknowledge a standing ovation from the crowd of 49,998. He 
raised his glove half way, then touched his cap a couple of times, eyes still 
downcast. Finally, he looked at the crowd and took off his cap before heading 
into the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 With Valenzuela gone, the Dodgers loaded the bases on three consecutive 
singles against reliever Paul Quantrill before scoring two runs on a fielder's 
choice by Jeff Treadway and a pinch-hit single by Henry Rodriguez against 
reliever Larry Andersen. By then, Webster was up again, and with two out, he 
worked Andersen to a 3-and-2 count before walking, again loading the bases. The 
score was 9-5, and the tying run, Mondesi, was at the plate. Closer Doug Jones 
was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi was down two strikes when he hit a two-run single into center field, 
making the score 9-7. Hernandez, the potential winning run, was at the plate, 
but his hard-hit grounder wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to say that I'm showing something, I just like to say that I'm 
still pitching," Valenzuela said. "I know what I have, and the Phillies believe 
in me."

BULLFROGS PULL ONE OUT AGAINST SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After losing two of their previous three games, the Bullfrogs used some 
fourth-quarter savvy to pull out a 10-8 victory over San Diego on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Savo Mitrovic scored with 2 minutes 49 seconds remaining to break an 8-8 tie 
and his Bullfrog teammate, Rick Judson, scored his third goal with 1:18 left to 
secure Anaheim's victory before 10,101 fans at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my mind, Savo was the star for tonight's game," Bullfrogs Coach Grant 
Sonier said. "In addition to the game-winning goal, he was finishing his 
checks. He set the tone for us." 
</P>
<P>
 On the game-winning goal, Bobby McKillop, who finished with three assists, 
passed to Mitrovic near the top of the left faceoff circle where the Bullfrog 
forward blasted a slap shot past San Diego goalie Francis Oulette. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bobby drew two players before he passed me the puck, but I knew he was going 
to get it to me," Mitrovic said. "I had a good look at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the league is better now and we have to play hard every night. We 
just have to stay composed and stay out of the penalty box." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs (11-3), who lead Roller Hockey International's Pacific Division, 
stayed out of the penalty box early and scored four unanswered goals in the 
opening 3:12 before San Diego (6-6-2) even attempted a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad McCaughey, the Bullfrogs' assistant coach-player who had one goal and 
three assists, scored the first goal then assisted on another by Victor Gervais 
34 seconds later for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, McCaughey scored a league-record seven goals in Anaheim's 16-10 
victory at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brad was the Mario Lemieux of roller hockey," Sonier said. "He had seven and 
he could have easily scored 10. He missed two shots when there was a wide-open 
net." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs left their net open to attack in the first half, leaving goalie 
Rob Laurie to face two-on-none situations twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy Norton converted one of those opportunities and Marc Savard scored off 
an assist from Alan Leggett on the other to bring the Barracudas to a goal 
down, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Bullfrogs pushed their lead to 7-4, San Diego's Scott Gruhl, who 
finished with three goals and one assist, scored twice in the third quarter. 
The Barracudas took advantage of several defensive breakdowns by the Bullfrogs, 
and Norton's second goal with 8:26 remaining in the game tied the score at 8-8, 
setting up Mitrovic's heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Beadle and Gervais each had two goals and Kevin Kerr and Jim Brown had 
two assists apiece for the Bullfrogs. Laurie had 28 saves and broke a personal 
two-game losing streak. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Bullfrog forward Shayne Arsenault suffered a knee injury in Anaheim's victory 
over San Jose on Friday and could miss three to four weeks of action, Coach 
Grant Sonier said. Defenseman Yuri Krivokhija, who has missed seven games with 
a bruised rotator cuff, also did not play Sunday. Sonier hopes Krivokhija will

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; SPOTLIGHT; IN SUPPORT OF REVOLUTION

 "In the space of a month the most popular sport on the planet has been subtly 
and irrevocably reshaped. This quiet revolution might one day be considered no 
bad thing, even if its genesis can be found in expediency and compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The essence of football has remained unspoilt for more than a hundred years. 
The universal wisdom was that there was no need to tinker. But it is blindingly 
obvious that the 1994 World Cup has been tailored to meet the demands of a 
virgin audience, the affluent American division of the two billion people 
around the world who have paid handsomely to witness the experiment. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Few would argue with the claim that this has been the cleanest World Cup of 
them all, certainly the most vibrant, the most accessible. . . ."

 Is it possible to stain the reputation of the National Enquirer? 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently so. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission by parent 
company Enquirer/Star Group show that Ian Calder, editor in chief of the 
supermarket tabloid that regularly skewers celebrities ranging from Roseanne 
Arnold to Michael Jackson, has entered into an employment agreement with a 
$600,000 base annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the documents, Calder's employment agreement says he can be 
terminated with "cause" that includes such things as doing something company 
directors find is "injurious to the business or reputation" of National 
Enquirer Inc. Case of the Missing Coins II 
</P>
<P>
 It was mentioned here last week that Merrill Lynch has an embarrassing 
problem: 399 coins bought for $3.3 million are mysteriously missing from a rare 
coin partnership it formed in 1990 with Los Angeles sports mogul Bruce McNall. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the company has a new problem. 
</P>
<P>
 A class action lawsuit was filed Friday in San Diego Superior Court, accusing 
Merrill Lynch and some McNall companies of "rampant fraud." (McNall, who 
recently sold a majority share of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team, isn't 
named because he filed for protection from creditors under U.S. bankruptcy 
laws). 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed by the firm Aguirre & Meyer in San Diego, says investors 
have been told that the coins were stolen. But a Merrill Lynch spokeswoman 
points out that the firm has never used that term, only disappeared and 
missing. The firm has, however, confirmed that it reported the incident to Los 
Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, also alleges that the fund has 
been a bum investment from the start, losing $2.5 million from 1990 through 
last year while paying out $2.4 million to McNall-related companies in fees and 
commissions over that period. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch said it has not seen the lawsuit and declined comment. So did a 
McNall lawyer. Operators Are at Hand 
</P>
<P>
 Is Henry the K headed for QVC next? 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a rare Henry Kissinger book signing and fund-raiser Wednesday at 
the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, people who call in 
((714) 993-5075) can order a personalized, signed copy of the former secretary 
of state's new book, "Diplomacy." Briefly. . .

 The Santa Monica-based Future News Network astrological forecasting newsletter 
says that in the days after the collision of the comet Shoemaker-Levy with 
Jupiter "the financial press and the markets are likely to be searching for 
Jupiter-related astronomic interpretations for current business, financial and 
political events." . . . Canada's favorite pastime: Team Marketing Report 
newsletter reports that Kraft is selling in Canada marshmallows shaped like 
baseballs and "Blue Jays Jell-O mold." . . . Where is he now? A Newport Beach

 Bay Area Rapid Transit District train operators and station agents rejected

strike deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1555 voted against the pact, 338 to 12, 
according to union spokeswoman Colleen McCarthy. The vote followed one earlier 
in the week that saw the 71-mile rail line's clerks and maintenance workers 
vote down the proposal.

DISABLED COMPETITORS MAKE LEAPS, BOUNDS; VENTURA: KIDS AND ADULTS ARE WINNERS 
AT SPECIAL OLYMPICS EQUESTRIAN EVENTS. MORE THAN 1,000 BIKERS RAISE FUNDS 
DURING BEACH RIDE.

 Bobby Metcalf carefully guided the 21-year-old dark bay mare as she trotted 
around a series of markers that substituted for wooden barrels at the Ventura 
County Fairgrounds on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old Sun Valley man gave Cookie a few quick heel kicks as she 
galloped through the arena and scurried across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Metcalf let out a scream as his name was announced as the gold 
medal winner in the barrel-racing competition of the California Special 
Olympics State Equestrian Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a double winner," Metcalf said, two medals draped across his chest. He 
had captured a silver medal earlier in another competition. "I try really 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Metcalf was among more than 130 Special Olympians who participated in the 
contest Sunday, the closing day of the two-day annual championships designed to 
give developmentally disabled children and adults a sense of pride and 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first of two events held Sunday for the benefit of developmentally 
disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the coast at San Buenaventura State Beach, more than 1,000 motorcyclists 
converged for the third annual Beach Ride, a fund-raiser for the Los 
Angeles-based Exceptional Children's Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the equestrian competition said the California Special Olympics 
offers disabled adults and children a chance to take stock in themselves and 
work toward a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're out there in the arena all by themselves," said Pete Peters, who 
coached the Ventura County team. "It builds a hell of a lot of self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven teams from Ventura, Los Angeles, Orange and Santa Barbara counties 
competed in barrel racing, trail riding, jumping and other categories, with 
medals awarded to each participant. 
</P>
<P>
 "They practice all year for this," said event director John Panagakis. "The 
beauty of the Special Olympics is that everyone's a winner. What they've 
accomplished over the last year is fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
 One young girl from Camarillo stole the show, as far as one judge was 
concerned. Eight-year-old Laura Cox, who has only one arm and one leg, won four 
gold medals over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no question about it," said contest judge Barney McGeary of Granada 
Hills. "I gave her five points. She was sitting up there with the biggest smile 
you ever did see." 
</P>
<P>
 About 2 miles south of the Ventura County Fairgrounds, more than 1,000 
tattooed and leather-clad bikers congregated at San Buenaventura State Beach 
for an afternoon party that culminated a 100-mile motorcycle ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going great," said Art Naddour, a vice president of the Exceptional 
Children's Foundation. "We expect to make a $50,000 profit." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation is a nonprofit group dedicated to enhancing the lives of more 
than 1,500 developmentally disabled people throughout Southern California. It 
spends about $10 million a year teaching adults and children life skills and 
job-hunting techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Naddour, a retired automobile restorer from West Los Angeles, said bikers -- 
who came from as far as San Luis Obispo and Palm Springs for Sunday's beach 
ride -- get a bad rap when it comes to their image. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the people here are RUBs, and that stands for rich urban bikers," 
Naddour said. "But bikers are a part of the community. They want to feel like 
they're contributing to the community, and they can do that by participating in 
these fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the others attending the Beach Ride agreed with Naddour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came because I'm a giver," said Tom Foster, a Los Angeles communications 
supervisor covered in colorful tattoos and wearing a black leather vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything to help kids I'm all for, 100%," Foster said. "I do all the benefit 
runs." 
</P>
<P>
 Near a display of finely maintained Harley-Davidsons with license plates that 
read "Looseel" and "Mthr Mlk," year-old Teal Bergquist stood mesmerized by a 
coral-colored '86 Sportster. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's ridden almost 3,000 miles," said Teal's father, Kenny Bergquist of Simi 
Valley, a weekend biker who is always ready to support a worthy cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate to have a healthy baby," Bergquist said, "but I can see how 
(difficult) it is when a child is not entirely healthy."

THEFT CASE AT CENTER OF '3 STRIKES' CONTROVERSY; COURTS: PROSECUTORS SAY LAW 
WILL KEEP REPEAT OFFENDER OFF STREETS. DEFENSE ARGUES THAT LIFE TERM IS TOO 
SEVERE FOR NONVIOLENT OFFENSE. 
</P>

 Roosevelt C. McCowan tried to swipe 18 bottles of drugstore cologne -- and 
could wind up spending the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 8, McCowan entered a Sav-On store in Oxnard, picked up a backpack and 
loaded it with the fragrance bottles bearing labels from Pierre Cardin to 
Chaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopped by security before he got out the door, McCowan later pleaded guilty 
to petty theft and expected a short prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 Then prosecutors discovered something McCowan did not want them to see: his 
rap sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan had more than half a dozen felony convictions, ranging from 
residential burglary to robbery and assault with intent to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan, 52, eventually took back his plea, after prosecutors decided to 
employ California's new "three strikes and you're out" law against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a trial set to begin today, the accused cologne thief faces 25 years 
to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is an example of the new three-strikes measure at its best, 
prosecutors say. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was designed to rid the streets of habitual offenders such as McCowan, 
who has a 32-year criminal record, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the case where you look at it and say, 'Man, this is a good law,' " 
said Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Brian S. Rafelson, who uncovered 
McCowan's criminal past while digging through decades-old court files. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys say McCowan's case exposes the cruel and unusually 
punitive nature of the three-strikes measure, adopted last March one day before 
McCowan was stopped by security officers at Sav-On. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's charged with what is essentially a petty theft," said McCowan's lawyer, 
Deputy Public Defender Douglas W. Daily. "He didn't even make off with 
anybody's property. In spite of his criminal background, I don't think anybody, 
even if they were guilty of that activity, should be subjected to that sort of 
penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan is not the only defendant facing 25 years to life in prison for a 
nonviolent third felony. In courts across California, a wave of defendants 
accused of petty theft, drug offenses and other nonviolent crimes are facing 
prosecution under the three-strikes law, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 Take San Diego County, where 141 three-strikes cases have been filed. There, 
three out of every four defendants charged under the law are accused of 
nonviolent crimes, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Nickel. "The substantial 
majority are non-serious felonies," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed the three-strikes bill after repeat offenders were 
charged in connection with several sensational crimes, most notably the 
kidnap-slaying of 12-year-old Polly Klaas of Petaluma. But even most crime 
fighters urged legislators to pass a bill that excluded nonviolent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty overwhelming that the district attorneys believed a narrower 
approach was the more proper one," Nickel said. "We thought the law cast too 
wide a net. But we lost, and D.A.s are not in a position to pick and choose the 
law we want." 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires a sentence of 25 years to life in prison for any felon 
who has committed two prior violent or serious felonies, crimes that range from 
burglary and arson to rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, five defendants have been charged under three strikes, 
including two for nonviolent third offenses, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Patricia 
J. Kelliher, a felony division supervisor. But prosecutors have not applied the 
law consistently, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Ventura County prosecutors refused to file a three-strikes 
allegation against a two-time robber who admitted cultivating seven marijuana 
plants -- a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 But a spokesman says there were technical problems with the 
marijuana-cultivation case that precluded prosecution under three strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 A stocky man with a goatee and shaved head, McCowan believes authorities are 
making an example of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have no idea they would try to make a misdemeanor into something 
like this," he lamented during a jailhouse interview. "They're talking about 25 
to life. Murder is only 26 to life, and second-degree murder is only 15 to 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan said he believes the charge against him is unfair. For instance, his 
cellmate was convicted of four counts of petty theft -- the same crime for 
which McCowan is charged. That inmate received 130 days in jail, McCowan said, 
shaking his head in disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan admitted, however, that he is no stranger to the criminal-justice 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1964, he has been charged in 26 criminal cases and sentenced to 37 years 
of state prison time on various convictions. In that 30-year period, he has 
spent only about five years outside prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan's supporters trace his criminal activity to his tough childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Born April 21, 1942, in the small Texas town of Brenham, near Houston, McCowan 
was raised by his grandmother, who was single. His mother, an unwed 
15-year-old, died while giving birth to him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not meet his father until age 16. That was when his grandmother could 
no longer control him and sent him to Oakland to live with the man, Edwin 
Porter. Yet by that time, McCowan said, he was too undisciplined even for 
Porter's strict parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1959, McCowan was living in Oxnard with a maternal aunt. Here, he fathered 
four children -- but two died -- and married a woman who had a child of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he turned to selling drugs to supplement his laborer's wages and 
support his family. He also began using drugs and getting into trouble with the 
law. "All my crimes are drug-related," McCowan said. "When I'm not on drugs, 
I'm scared to do a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, when he was 21, McCowan was sentenced to state prison for the first 
time for selling $25 worth of heroin to a plainclothes police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 He was released within a year, but was sent back for five more years after 
being accused of kidnaping and raping a Santa Barbara woman. He was never 
convicted in that case, but his parole was revoked nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 Paroled for a second time in 1970, he landed back in the penitentiary two 
years later for assault with intent to commit murder. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, he clubbed a man with a stick after a card game, according to 
court records. McCowan says the man was high on drugs and hit him first. "That 
was a self-defense case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan believes that case marked him for a career behind bars. It was 
prosecuted by a young, ambitious deputy prosecutor named Michael D. Bradbury. 
Bradbury is now Ventura County's top prosecutor, who McCowan claims has held a 
grudge since they first faced off in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury lets out a hearty laugh when told of McCowan's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "He probably feels we are out to get him, and we are. He's a dangerous 
criminal," said Bradbury, who promised to "chase him right back to Folsom" 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After being paroled again in 1977, McCowan was sent back to prison within 
months, after his fingerprint was found in an apartment that had been 
burglarized. Prosecutors are using that crime as his first strike. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan spent the next 10 years in and out of prison -- mostly in -- until 
securing his release in 1987. Within months, he reverted back to his old 
habits. That October, he and an accomplice burst into an Oxnard motel room and 
robbed an oil-field worker at knifepoint, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery conviction -- which represented strike 2 -- kept him off the 
streets for six more years, until last October. 
</P>
<P>
 This time out, McCowan vowed to change his ways and took steps to do that. He 
re-established contact with his children -- including son Lonnie McCowan, 
senior pastor at the Solid Rock Christian Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 He started attending the church, and even lectured youth members on the 
pitfalls of drugs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a lot of questions for him," recalled Lonnie McCowan, 35. "For some 
of them -- I guess you call them (gang) wanna-bes -- it was a real eye-opener. 
He hit them with straight talk. It was good for them to get a taste of 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 When one young tough seemed indifferent to the scare stories of the older man, 
McCowan described a prison rape for him. The boy changed his attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie McCowan enjoyed having his father around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different because I didn't know what it felt like to have a father," 
he said. "What I found real interesting was, I would look at him and I could 
see me in him. I think boys miss something when they don't see that in another 
man. There's some type of legacy you see there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him, 'Are you going back?' And he said, 'Son, this is it. I'm never 
going back again. If I go back, I'd probably never make it out alive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The three-strikes law went into effect at 2:45 p.m. March 7, when Wilson 
signed the bill and promised to turn "career criminals into career inmates." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt McCowan did not hear Wilson's speech, nor did he know the 
three-strikes law had taken effect. He knew such legislation was in the works, 
but believed that it applied only to those with three prior violent or serious 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan wasn't paying much attention to the news. He had gone back to using 
drugs. But this time it was crack cocaine and not his old standby -- heroin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I smoked crack, and found out it was worse than heroin," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, March 8, McCowan was high on crack when he stepped off a city bus 
and walked into the Sav-On drugstore on Ventura Road in Oxnard, court records 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 He picked up a backpack and headed for the cosmetics area, loading 18 bottles 
of cologne valued at $340 into the bag, according to records. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could get out the door, however, McCowan was stopped by a security 
guard and an off-duty police officer. His rights were read to him. But instead 
of being arrested, he was handed a citation and told to appear in court -- a 
sign he took to mean that he was not in serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, he pleaded guilty to petty theft in Ventura County Superior 
Court. As part of his plea, McCowan admitted that he had been convicted of 
petty theft twice before -- which made his latest crime a felony. Prosecutors 
did not know about his prior felony convictions at the time, and McCowan was 
not about to tell them. 
</P>
<P>
 He expected a sentence of maybe three years when he showed up May 23 for 
sentencing. By then, though, prosecutors had learned more about him, including 
the fact that he had been convicted of at least one prior serious felony. 
</P>
<P>
 They charged him as a two-strike defendant, a provision of the new law that 
mandated that the judge double whatever sentence McCowan would get for felony 
petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered, McCowan rescinded his guilty plea and requested a preliminary 
hearing. That is when Deputy Dist. Atty. Rafelson combed through old court 
records and pieced together McCowan's full criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a rap sheet that would wrap around a house," Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is why McCowan is being prosecuted as a three-strikes defendant, 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man assigned to prosecute the case, Deputy Dist. Atty. William G. Karr, 
said he has no qualms about putting the accused cologne thief away for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is an appropriate three-strikes case," Karr said. "It's because 
of his record." 
</P>
<P>
 McCowan's supporters disagree, saying prosecutors are abusing their 
discretionary powers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad to hear the events have turned out like this," said Lonnie McCowan. 
"It's unfair. Here's a person who didn't get picked up for a violent crime. . . 
. If you use this law across the board, you're going to throw away some 
diamonds that are just surrounded in some crud." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Daily believes the three-strikes law should be stricken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any civil person, if they really got to know what this case was 
all about, would agree that this is the proper punishment," Daily said. 
"Obviously, if McCowan is guilty, he should pay a price. He's got a very bad 
background, a long criminal history. But even in spite of that, you don't send 
someone to prison for essentially the rest of his life for this type of 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt McCowan said he's all for the three-strikes law -- for violent 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person is hurtin' people, and he continues hurtin' people, he should get 
what's coming to him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my case, I wasn't trying to hurt nobody."

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC SIGNAL'S BRAIN IS A SMALL BUT COMPLICATED THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Something must be done about the stoplight at the intersection of Oxnard 
Boulevard and Vineyard Avenue in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 I've recently suffered through some serious problems because of signal 
malfunctions at this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the light stayed red for traffic for more than half an hour. Eventually, 
cars started running the light. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion the light turned green for both the Vineyard traffic and 
for the left-turn traffic from Oxnard Boulevard. I saw several near-misses that 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this light be checked before there is a serious accident? 
</P>
<P>
 Felicia Henry, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The brain of a traffic signal is a small but complicated thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes signals go haywire for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 So traffic engineers monitor the signals regularly to make adjustments and 
check for malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal at the intersection of Oxnard Boulevard and Vineyard Avenue is 
maintained by Caltrans, which checks the electronic traffic-control box, or 
brain, every two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Ciriaco, who handles signal timing, says he last checked that signal in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has heard no other complaints about the light, but will check it to 
make sure it is operating correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if you run into a traffic signal problem at this intersection 
again, you can report it to Caltrans at 654-4651. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I was thrilled to read in your column last week about the program to ticket 
cars parked illegally in spaces marked for the handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
 As a disabled person, I am only too familiar with the frustration of not being 
able to park in the handicapped spot because someone else is there illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Another big problem in shopping centers is stray shopping carts. People seem 
to think handicapped spaces are designed to hold their discarded carts. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times I end up having to get out of the car, hobble over and take the 
shopping carts away before I can park. 
</P>
<P>
 Are there any plans for a program for Camarillo similar to the one in Oxnard? 
</P>
<P>
 If so, would it be possible to include shopping cart removal from handicapped 
parking spaces? 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Ullman, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo does not have a program tailored exclusively to ticketing 
handicapped parking violators. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the city's three parking cadets regularly monitor streets and public 
parking lots in search of illegally parked cars, says Deputy Mike Berg. 
</P>
<P>
 The cadets are also authorized to enter private parking lots in search of cars 
parked illegally in spaces marked for the disabled. They are allowed to monitor 
the private property under the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also respond to phone calls from the residents reporting 
illegally parked cars. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a report, call the Police Department at 482-9844. Violators are 
subject to a $280 ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, ticket duty does not include shopping cart removal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for shopping carts, Berg suggests you inform the manager of the store and 
ask that the carts be removed. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans recently made a confusing change at a Moorpark Freeway off-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltrans repaved the off-ramp at Olsen Road in Thousand Oaks, they 
changed the striping. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the change, drivers in either of the two lanes at the bottom of the 
ramp were allowed to turn right after stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, drivers may only turn right from the right-hand lane. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there is no stop sign for the right lane, I assume drivers are not 
required to stop before turning. 
</P>
<P>
 But many drivers are used to the old way and stop anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 If I'm right and drivers are not required to stop, could Caltrans post a sign 
saying no stop is required? 
</P>
<P>
 If a stop is required, I suggest a sign be posted immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Graham, Simi Valley 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists are no longer required to stop before turning right at the bottom of 
the Olsen Road off-ramp in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans made the change because motorists complained that traffic backed up 
all the way to the freeway as motorists waited to turn, says Luu Nguyen, senior 
traffic engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a general policy, Caltrans tries to keep the number of signs it posts to a 
minimum, so it has not posted a sign telling motorists they don't have to stop, 
Nguyen says. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Caltrans has received several calls from motorists who are confused 
by the change, so engineers are studying the intersection to figure out the 
best way to clear up the problem. RAMP CLOSURE 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four ramps at Kimball Road and the Santa Paula Freeway will be 
closed for a month starting today. Only the eastbound on-ramp will remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramp closure is part of a major project to overhaul the entire 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The ramps will reopen Aug. 19.

WATERTIGHT APPROACH TO MANAGING RESOURCES; UTILITIES: UNYIELDING CALLEGUAS 
BOARD MAKES DECISIONS AFFECTING 500,000 USERS. SOME APPLAUD ITS

<P>
 Howard Hamilton was trying hard to plead the sad case of the Pleasant Valley 
School District at a recent meeting of the Calleguas Municipal Water District 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 He stood in front of the five-member panel asking for a break -- specifically 
a waiver of a debt the school district owes Calleguas in capital construction 
costs for Tierra Linda Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to know how serious trouble we're in," Hamilton said earnestly. He 
related a series of financial misfortunes: First there were building fees owed 
to the Camrosa Water District, then the school district discovered it owed fees 
to Calleguas as well, then those fees more than doubled from a rate hike in 
December, adding up to a debt of $24,528 to Calleguas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just about floored us," Hamilton said. "I don't recall seeing notification 
of the rate hike." 
</P>
<P>
 Five solemn faces stared back at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not an indictment of you people," he hastened to add, shifting 
uncomfortably on his feet. "Somehow we never got the message. Maybe that's our 
fault." 
</P>
<P>
 Next Hamilton evoked heart-string-tugging images of young children running 
around a school so destitute it would not even be able to afford furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 The board remained unmoved. Patrick Miller, the chairman of the board and a 
member for 26 years, gave Hamilton a small, polite smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made no exceptions to these fees in the past," said Miller, a 
pleasant-faced and dapper man in a pale-blue sport jacket. "We feel we have to 
be consistent. We're just being good business people. We don't want to start a 
trend." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton and three others from the school district filed from the room 
defeated. 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful, consistent and unyielding except when told to yield by the agency 
that controls it, the Metropolitan Water District, Calleguas is the largest 
water district in Ventura County. It delivers water to nearly 500,000 users, 
including the whole of the east county as well as Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 All five members of its Board of Directors are men, and four of them are in 
their 60s. They are paid $178 per meeting and usually meet at least twice a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members are elected by voters in general elections on even-numbered 
years to serve four-year terms, though they traditionally remain on the board 
much longer. Elections for two positions will be held this year, the three 
others in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calleguas service area is carved into five districts, and each district 
elects one of its residents to the board. Division 1 is Simi Valley. Division 2 
is most of Thousand Oaks and Oak Park; Division 3 runs from the Conejo Grade to 
Newbury Park; Division 4 is most of Camarillo and part of Oxnard; Division 5 
includes most of Oxnard and part of Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recent years, Calleguas elections were rarely contested and most members 
stayed on the board considerably longer than one term. Board members are not 
afraid to characterize themselves as conservative -- even cautious -- and they 
rarely disagree with each other, at least not contentiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has ever raised their voice (in meetings)," Division 2 representative 
Jeffrey Borenstein said. "It just hasn't happened. I'm delighted in the 
chemistry that exists on our board." 
</P>
<P>
 Borenstein, 40, is the youngest member of the board. He was elected in 
November, 1992, after defeating incumbent L. B. (Les) Kovacs. Before that, the 
Thousand Oaks accountant had been the water district's auditor for about a 
dozen years. 
</P>
<P>
 What the five members have most in common, other than age and gender, is a 
strong belief that without careful preparation, Ventura County faces a dry and 
dismal future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have another drought," said Bill Seaver, 64, the board's newest 
member. "There is no doubt of that. And we're going to have earthquakes. We 
have got to do everything we can to make sure we keep a safe and reliable 
source of water coming into the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who interact with the board on a regular basis say that there 
has been a change in its mind-set in the last five years, a turn toward a more 
proactive approach to water conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking at water now as something different from the way they looked 
at it five years ago," said Thousand Oaks Director of Public Works Don Nelson. 
"Before, I think they looked on their role as just the middleman between 
Metropolitan and the purveyors." 
</P>
<P>
 When the drought hit in the late 1980s, Nelson said the board seemed to revise 
its way of thinking. Metropolitan cut water supplies to Calleguas and prices 
nearly doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they started to look at themselves not so much as a sub-agency of 
Met," he said. "They began to look at ways to drought-proof the area. They are 
doing some marvelous things now. Ten to 15 years from now, people are going to 
look back and say, 'These people really knew what they were doing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson pointed to several reclaimed water projects Calleguas is taking part 
in, using treated sewage water to irrigate median strips, parks, golf courses, 
and eventually home gardens. One project in Oak Park is near completion and two 
more are planned for Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calleguas board also wins praise from John Foley, the chairman of the 
Metropolitan Water District's 51-member board, for its development of reclaimed 
water facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are one of the premiers in getting in there early on reclaimed water," 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the Calleguas directors showed foresight in using the North Las 
Posas Basin for underground storage. To encourage districts to prepare for 
future droughts, Metropolitan offers nearly 50% discounts on water for storage. 
Calleguas estimates the basin can hold up to 300,000 acre-feet of water. One 
acre-foot is enough water to fill the needs of two families for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 If there are criticisms of Calleguas, they focus mostly on high water costs. 
But even those complaints don't frequently wind their way up the hill to the 
Calleguas offices, high above Olsen Road in Thousand Oaks. Since Calleguas 
merely delivers the water to smaller water agencies within the district, 
usually it is the subcontracting firms that get an earful from angry consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who in 1991 asked the county's grand jury to 
investigate Calleguas for failure to justify a 28% rate increase, said he has 
been frustrated with the district many times in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some reason, they can raise the water rates and people don't get mad at 
them," Stratton said. "They get mad at us instead." 
</P>
<P>
 He accused the board of going ahead in the past on major capital improvement 
projects without seriously seeking public input. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the surprises they've sprung on us," Stratton said. "Over the years 
it has been amazing what they would do. They'd say, 'Show up at our meeting and 
we'll tell you about our $300-million capital plan.' Without looking at it 
ahead of time, there would be no way for our staff to comment on it 
intelligently." 
</P>
<P>
 The same determination that brings praise from Nelson draws criticism from 
Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take the attitude that we know what we have to do to bring you water and 
this is what we're going to do to do it, at any cost. That's frustrating," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton said he believes the current board is much improved over the 
boards of the 1970s and '80s. In particular, he said, having Ted Grandsen, a 
former Simi Valley mayor and county supervisor, serving on the board from 
Division 1 has made a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted brings a sensitivity to the concerns of those of us who are elected," 
Stratton said. "He knows that we can get blamed when rates go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Grandsen, 61, was handpicked by Vincent Hardy as his successor when Hardy 
retired from the Calleguas board in 1990. The Simi Valley native was then 
elected to the board in 1992. He is also on the Metropolitan board. 
</P>
<P>
 As a longtime nursery owner who now works for the Green Thumb nursery in 
Canoga Park, Grandsen said he brings to the board a certain sympathy toward the 
needs of agricultural water users, which include nurseries. But not too much 
sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 When the water deliveries to farmers began, Grandsen said he heard from other 
nursery owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was called by a lot of people saying, 'But we can't cut back,' " he said. 
"And I'd say, 'You're part of agriculture, you've got to cut back.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Grandsen said Bill Seaver, who was appointed last year to fill the Division 5 
spot of Carl Ward, who retired at 81, is most like him. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're two political animals," Grandsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaver, a Camarillo resident who proudly refers to himself as a 
third-generation Californian, was superintendent of the Conejo Valley schools 
for 10 years. He was a teacher before that, and has lived in the county for 38 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was fascinated with the topic of water rights since he was a child 
on a Hayward farm. In addition to reading "everything I can get my hands on" 
about water, he took pleasure trips to see the state water project and the 
Colorado River project. 
</P>
<P>
 When he heard the board was accepting applications to fill Ward's spot, he 
submitted a resume. He said his background with the school district prepared 
him for dealing with big budgets -- Calleguas has about a $40-million budget -- 
and also gave him a good sense of how to work with people. Like Grandsen, he is 
jovial and friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Hauser, 62, also lives in Camarillo and represents District 3. He 
unseated incumbent Kurt Reithmayr in 1992 without putting up a single campaign 
sign or knocking on any doors. 
</P>
<P>
 As a civil engineer and former employee of the county's Flood Control 
District, Hauser said he brings the perspective of having been "on the other 
side of the counter" to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided that there was only one thing I hadn't tried and that was the 
political arena. I wanted to see if I could make some of the rules and 
regulations easier to deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 Still sporting a crew cut from his military days, Hauser wears a tiny lapel 
pin that says "Calleguas" to board meetings. His fellow board members all 
admire his engineering expertise, which he said enables him to understand plans 
for Calleguas projects in "one glance." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members heap praise on Chairman Patrick Miller, 63, an Oxnard resident 
who represents District 4, calling him "an encyclopedia of water for Ventura 
County," respectful, fair and straight-laced. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Miller served for several months as acting chairman of the 
Metropolitan board, arguably the most powerful position in the Southern 
California water world. 
</P>
<P>
 "He fights very hard at Metropolitan to preserve Calleguas' status and to 
represent their needs," current Metropolitan Chairman Foley said.

WASTELAND NO MORE; SIMI VALLEY PLANS ARTS CENTER, HOPING FOR BETTER REVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Cultural black hole. Artistic wasteland. Theatrical vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Simi Valley has borne the stigma of being branded a city without a 
creative soul. It is an unfortunate and undeserved reputation, some residents 
argue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is home to three movie theaters, two bowling alleys, a pool hall and 
a drive-in complete with an enormous Sunday swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Cultural Center, however, is wedged into a tiny space alongside the 
records division of the city's Police Department, the stage of its 98-seat 
theater no larger than a multiplex movie screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to say this, but you mention Simi Valley and culture in the same 
sentence and people say 'black hole,' " said Jan Glasband, president of the 
Simi Cultural Assn., which runs the theater on Cochran Street. "At this point 
it's a cliche." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy Mikels, a former association president, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tremendous amount of creative talent in Simi Valley," Mikels said. 
"But when it comes to the arts, there's this misimpression of the city as some 
kind of wasteland." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the city is taking a major step to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 After many false starts and years of pleading, haggling and maneuvering, Simi 
Valley is getting its own full-fledged arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 It will not be a grand pavilion on a par with the nearly completed 
$63.8-million Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it will be a modest, 300-seat hall, housed in a 70-year-old former 
Methodist church that has also served over the years as a mortuary, Jewish 
temple and haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The size is perfect because it will give the city a chance to get accustomed 
to having a theater, to grow into the space," Glasband said. "I don't think we 
could have asked for anything better." 
</P>
<P>
 Funded with $2.55 million in city redevelopment revenue, the decaying gray 
structure is being restored to retain its majestic neoclassical style and 
adjusted to suit the needs of a soundproof theater and arts hub. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the 15,000-square-foot space at 3050 Los Angeles Ave. will 
house not only the main theater auditorium, but a smaller theater, art gallery 
and community room. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the theater is not scheduled to open until March, arts supporters are 
already making plans for the new venue. 
</P>
<P>
 For director Irene Silbert, the larger space means freedom to do bigger, more 
ambitious projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Silbert, whose production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" is now playing at the 
theater on Cochran Street, said squeezing the cast onto the tiny stage has been 
a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a cast of 35 and an audience capacity of 98," Silbert said. "I can't 
wait to have a larger space." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Silbert has scheduled a free, outdoor performance of the play 
at the Rancho Simi Park Amphitheater for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did that in part to have the extra space so that everyone who wants to see 
it can come," Silbert said. "It's just incredibly exciting for all of us to 
know that soon we will have a real theater." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council has appointed a five-member Simi Valley Cultural Arts 
Commission to run the center. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners, all Simi Valley residents, are: Lee Altmar, a training 
coordinator at Countrywide Funding Corp. in Simi Valley; Jay Bloom, a program 
adviser for the Los Angeles Unified School District; Peggy Sadler, 
administrative assistant at Simi Valley Presbyterian Church; Sharon Stewart, a 
senior engineering writer at Litton Guidance and Control in Woodland Hills; and 
Dudley Wynkoop, a self-employed architect. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next several months, the commission will hire a full-time manager to 
oversee the center's day-to-day operations and begin planning programming for 
the theater. The commission will also act as the theater's board of directors, 
raising funds to support productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly appointed commissioners said one of their main goals is to keep in 
close touch with the community by actively participating in cultural events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being involved is fun, and it will make it easier to understand the needs of 
the community," said Altmar, who is also an amateur actor who eagerly agreed to 
play the role of Nick Bottom in Silbert's Shakespearean production. "I'm just 
pleased as punch to be serving on the commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynkoop designed the stage sets and also has a small role in the play -- his 
first on-stage performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will do whatever I can to be of service to the performing arts in Simi 
Valley," Wynkoop said. "This is a huge step forward for the city and for the 
arts." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadler, a 31-year Simi Valley resident, jumped at the chance to serve on the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Sadler has been involved in several attempts to build a theater 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've waited more than 30 years to see this happen and I'm just thrilled," 
Sadler said. "We're not only bringing a great new theater space to the city, 
we're preserving one of the few buildings in this city worth saving." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, she helped persuade the City Council several years ago to include a 
$15-million, 750-seat arena in its long-range plans for public land near City 
Hall. The city has postponed that project indefinitely because of the 
recession. 
</P>
<P>
 As an interim step, the city paid $821,000 for the crumbling Methodist church 
in 1991, with the hope of transforming it into a theater. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan met with resistance from some residents and from Councilwomen 
Sandi Webb and Barbara Williamson, who argued that private business, not public 
funds, should pay for the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton and council members Bill Davis and Mikels supported the 
project, ultimately overruling the opposition and agreeing to fund the theater 
renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in March council members feared the project would hit another snag. 
</P>
<P>
 They worried that the increased demand for construction labor after the Jan. 
17 earthquake would prompt contractors to increase their fees, pushing the cost 
for the theater project out of the city's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 But bids on the project came in within the city's funding range and 
reconstruction began in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all breathed a big sigh of relief," Mikels said. "So many people 
have worked so long and hard on this that it's a huge thrill to see it finally 
happening."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; FOUNDER FAMILY SHARES TRADITION OF OLD 
ADOBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 81-year-old Robert J. Olivas, the best thing about Sunday's Old Adobe Day 
celebration at the Olivas Adobe wasn't the delicious Mexican food, traditional 
dances or the original crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 The best part of the annual event, said Olivas -- the great-great-grandson of 
adobe founder Don Olivas -- was sharing the 147-year-old ranch house as a 
symbol of early California history and Latino culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very satisfying to me to see people come and learn about who was here 
working the land," Olivas said. "It's nice to know that people are still 
curious." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people -- many in period costume -- crowded the adobe's 
courtyard,taking in displays of traditional early California life, crafts, 
dance and music. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, guided tours of the 12-room ranch house on Olivas Park 
Drive and adjoining museum were given as child and adult members of the Ballet 
Folklorico Regional Dancers presented traditional dances and Los Bandoleros 
Mariachis performed songs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dancers and mariachis performed in traditional garb -- vibrantly colored 
dresses for the girls and women and black-and-white suits with black cowboy 
boots for the boys and men. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Senate, the adobe's resident historian, said the event isn't so much a 
fund-raiser as it is an "awareness-raiser," although half of any proceeds will 
go toward the adobe's restoration efforts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place gives people a taste of what early California was like," Senate 
said. "It gives them a sense of our rich Latino culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the dance stage, leather workers, quilters and other artisans 
displayed the fruits of their labors as the smell of fresh tortillas wafted 
through the air. Outside the adobe's courtyard, families enjoyed the sunny 
weather with picnics and lawn games. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Greavs, 42, of Oxnard, brought his two children so they could experience 
authentic Latino culture and the early history of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a fun way for the kids to see something different and 
perhaps learn something at the same time," Greavs said. "It's been an enjoyable 
day." J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PURCHASE OF DESIGNS FOR RETROFITTING URGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura should spend $210,000 on engineers' designs for retrofitting five 
street bridges and underpasses, a city staff report says. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider tonight whether to contract for redesign of the 
San Jon underpass, the Main Street Bridge over the Ventura River, the Seaward 
Avenue underpass, and the Vista del Mar and Telephone Road overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to pay for the sketches comes from gas taxes reserved for 
transportation and street improvements, said Rick Raives, a city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has agreed to pay for the seismic retrofitting of all the bridges and 
underpasses except the Telephone Road overpass, which the agency maintains is 
not in urgent need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members recommend that Ventura pay for the redesign sketches because 
that will speed up the retrofitting process, which could take years if the city 
waited for Caltrans to find the funds for the engineers' drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is commissioning sketches for the Telephone Road overpass even though 
Caltrans may not pay for the retrofitting, Raives said. If Caltrans will not 
fund that improvement, the city might, he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HEARING PLANNED ON FREEWAY INTERCHANGE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura residents can sound off at a City Council hearing tonight on plans for 
redesigning the troublesome interchange at Seaward Avenue and the Ventura 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 One Caltrans plan, which would cost $9.5 million to carry out, calls for 
widening the Seaward freeway overpass and constructing a new southbound on-ramp 
on Peninsula Street to relieve the congestion at the crowded interchange.In 
addition, the Peninsula Street on-ramp would replace the one on Seaward Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the Ventura Keys objected to a previous Caltrans plan, which 
called for knocking down a bluff that shields the properties from 
freeway-generated noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan calls for retaining most of the bluff. But some Keys residents 
oppose the redesign because they say it would cause too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to inconvenience local residents," said Bob Therrien, who lives on 
Beachmont Street in the Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Two City Council members say they also have their doubts about the wisdom of a 
new on-ramp at Peninsula Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really vacillating between (moving the on-ramp) and keeping it at 
Seaward," Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. She said she is worried about 
the traffic problems a Peninsula Street on-ramp would cause for nearby 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jack Tingstrom said he is "dead-set against the Peninsula Street 
on-ramp" because of traffic concerns. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; ANNIVERSARY TEMBLOR CAUSES NO DAMAGES

<P>
 Six months to the day after the Northridge earthquake rocked the county, an 
aftershock centered in the San Fernando Valley jolted some Fillmore residents 
but caused no injuries or damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3.4-magnitude aftershock of the Jan. 17 earthquake hit at 8:29 a.m. Sunday 
and was centered one mile southeast of Chatsworth, according to a Caltech 
seismologist. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, Mayor Linda Brewster said she was reading the morning newspaper 
when the temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little eerie, because I was sitting reading about the January quake 
when I felt this jolt," Brewster said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Simi Valley police dispatcher said the small shock was barely discernible 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County police and sheriff's deputies said there were no reports of 
injury or damage and no calls for service linked to the brief jolt. J.E.

<P>
 East county sheriff's deputies are looking for a heavy-set, Caucasian man who 
held up a Domino's Pizza outlet in Thousand Oaks at gunpoint and clubbed an 
employee with a telephone receiver before cleaning out the cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the suspect, who weighs about 230 pounds and is about 6 
feet, 3 inches tall, pointed a handgun at employee Mark Robertson, 19, as he 
was returning from a delivery minutes before midnight Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson and the suspect both entered the store at 290 Moorpark Road, and the 
suspect ordered another employee, Farrokh Iranshahr, 49, to open the safe. 
</P>
<P>
 When Iranshahr refused to open the safe, the suspect clubbed him with a 
telephone receiver and grabbed the cash from the register, fleeing with an 
undisclosed amount of money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iranshahr was treated at the scene for a cut ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the suspect is between 19 and 23 years old, with brown hair 
and a goatee. JEFF McDONALD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COUNCIL WILL REVIEW LIBRARY REPAIR 
PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The books, magazines and videos are all there, but the Thousand Oaks Library 
still doesn't look normal. And readers, while patient, are eager to see the 
building repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, City Council members will review a plan for completing work on the 
quake-damaged library, which needs a new ceiling, a new lighting system and a 
new community meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule calls for repair work to begin on the roof, which had leaked for 
years even before the earthquake rattled the building. The city recently 
received $1.28 million from the architect and contractors who built the roof, 
as part of a legal settlement. With the money in hand, work should begin by 
early August. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a solid, drip-proof roof is installed, workers can begin installing the 
new interior ceiling, lights and carpet. That stage of the project should begin 
in November, project manager Ed Johnduff said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials estimate the total repair tab at $2 million, which will be 
funded through federal aid and private insurance money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the library will remain open during the roof work, the 
interior repairs will require a two- to four-week closure late this year or 
early next year. STEPHANIE SIMON

 A series of thefts from the parking lot at The Oaks mall has led Ventura 
County Crime Stoppers to offer a $1,000 reward for information helping to 
identify the thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators said thieves have targeted cars parked near The 
Broadway in the south lot of the mall. Both vehicles and car stereos have been 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts occurred July 2, 7 and 9. The stereos were stolen around noon, 
while thieves waited until after 8 p.m. to take the cars, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are asking anyone with information about the crimes to call 
Crime Stoppers at 494-TALK. Callers may remain anonymous. If the information 
leads to an arrest, the caller will receive $1,000. MARY F. POLS

<P>
 The hodgepodge of stores along Thousand Oaks Boulevard may soon get some 
uniform landscaping, with 30 new potted trees to be scattered along the 4-mile 
strip. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilwoman Judy Lazar, the City Council on Tuesday will 
consider spending $15,570 in gas tax funds to buy the trees and deliver the 
hefty concrete planters. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar has recommended filling the 800-pound planters with three different 
species: bronze leaf loquat, fern pine and Western redbud. Tending the trees 
would cost about $2,700 a year, she estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprucing up Thousand Oaks Boulevard with a bit more greenery would fit into 
the council's longstanding plan to renovate the aging downtown. "I think on the 
whole, we do need to do something to soften the boulevard," Councilman Frank 
Schillo said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STUDENTS GIVEN VOTE AT BOARD MEETINGS

<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board has decided to allow elected student advisers 
to cast non-binding, advisory votes at board meetings on all public matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting this fall, four student advisers representing the district's four 
high schools will rotate as voting members of the school board.Their votes will 
become part of the official record, but will carry no weight in official 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, student representatives must be allowed to cast advisory 
votes if at least 500 students sign a petition supporting the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks High School student presented district officials with a 
petition carrying the necessary signatures in early June. The board amended its 
policy on student representation Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, student advisers to the board gave brief reports at the beginning 
of each meeting but did not participate in policy discussions or cast votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio said she hopes the new policy will encourage 
more student involvement in school district issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The rotation will begin with the elected student from Conejo Valley High 
School, who will serve as the student adviser for the first meeting. Didio said 
the students will begin serving on the board when they return to school in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Each school will establish its own procedure for selecting its student 
representative. Those procedures will likely include either schoolwide 
elections or elections within the student body government, district officials 
said. TRACY WILSON

VALLEY CHRONICLE: PONY INSPIRES OWNER'S PICTURE-PERFECT HOME-BASED BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home-based businesses are booming, what with the economy bottoming out, and 
many have used the computer to get a start. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jaimee Rupe found her inspiration in an 11-year-old pony named Cinnamon 
Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Jaimee and her husband, Jeffrey, moved with their son Ricky, 
now 5, to a chaparral-covered lot on Old Topanga Road. They spent six months 
clearing the rented land, bringing in a trailer and building an addition with a 
Jacuzzi. Jaimee started coaxing a garden out of the long-dormant land. 
</P>
<P>
 Then one day she saw an ad for a pony with a $100 asking price. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaimee, 28, had always been a horse person, having ridden horses almost as 
soon as she was walking. She grew up in Woodland Hills and attended Hughes 
Junior High School and El Camino High School, where she and Jeffrey began 
dating. 
</P>
<P>
 Marriage changed things. She worked as a bookkeeper, secretary and manicurist 
while her husband went into the fence-building business with his father. Then 
Ricky was born. She got too busy for horses -- until she saw that ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the canyon, almost, knew that sweet little pony," Jaimee says. 
"She had been born and raised right here and belonged to a longtime resident." 
</P>
<P>
 She convinced the owner that she was the one who could give the animal the 
best and most loving home. Then she took the pony home, very carefully, 
tethered in the back of a pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, who now works at building roads for Los Angeles County, was 
something less than enthusiastic. "He couldn't figure out what I was going to 
do with a pony, but when he saw how excited Ricky was, he accepted the 
situation," Jaimee says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaimee, while puzzling over how to justify the pony's feed expenses, realized 
how many pictures she had taken of Ricky on the animal. A new home-based 
business was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out taking pictures of the children of friends on Cinnamon and then 
I thought, why not turn this into a business? The pony loves the attention and 
I like to take the pictures, so it's working out fine," Rupe says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaimee now takes Cinnamon Girl to private parties and public festivals. It's 
the beginning of what could become a good business, Rupe says. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to be outdone, her husband has set up his own home-based business. In his 
spare time, he makes sculptures out of old horse shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really don't have to be stuck inside to have a business," says Rupe, 
whose success has encouraged her to enroll in the Pierce College equestrian 
program this fall in hopes of finding ways to expand what she has started. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not be making a lot of money, but I'm having a lot of fun," she says. 
Book Buyers Seem to Be Turning Down the Juice 
</P>
<P>
 Since one topic has dominated conversation and television recently, could 
anyone be surprised that there are those trying to cash in on the phenomenon by 
writing quickie books about O.J. Simpson? 
</P>
<P>
 At least three are now in the offing, including Pinnacle Books' "O.J. Simpson: 
American Hero, American Tragedy" by Marc Cerasini; Globe Communications 
Corporation's "Juice: The O.J. Simpson Story," and St. Martin's "Fallen Hero: 
The Shocking True Story Behind the O.J. Simpson Tragedy" by Don Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerasini book seems to have hit the bookstore shelves first and is 
creating something less than a buying frenzy. Here's what local bookstore folks 
have to say about the not-so-brisk sales: 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the Cerasini book about a week ago and so far we have sold only a few 
copies," says Diane Ranaldi at Super Crown Books in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto, B. Dalton in Topanga Plaza and Bookstar in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Kami at Crown in Granada Hills says they have the Cerasini book 
prominently displayed by the register, but that only a couple of books have 
been sold so far. "I think people are tired of these instant books that don't 
really say much," Kami says. 
</P>
<P>
 One bookseller in Van Nuys says his store has the Cerasini book on Simpson and 
has ordered the other two, but he doesn't expect booming sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about the Cerasini book but don't buy it. They seem to have made 
up their minds about his guilt or innocence from what they've seen on 
television and aren't interested in rehashing what they already know," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dutton Books in North Hollywood, Dave Dutton says he has not ordered any of 
the books and doesn't expect to. One of his clerks says he has only had two 
inquiries about the books, including one from someone in the television 
industry who could have been interested in making a TV project from one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe these stores are anomalies. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the other books will sell better. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, maybe the bucks aren't going to be squeezed out of this tragic 
situation like so much orange juice. Monsignor Could Have Been a Comedy 
Contender 
</P>
<P>
 Msgr. Michael O'Connor of St. Mel's in Woodland Hills has been a priest since 
1934 and says he didn't miss his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 But if he had decided to do stand-up comedy, he might have made it big. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that when he was born, the doctor slapped his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his favorite reading material, he says history books and The 
Racing Form. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what it takes to be made a monsignor, he says it has to do with living a 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 He says all people seem to talk about these days is sex, sex and more sex, 
adding that in his parents' day they were too busy having children to talk much 
about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80-something monsignor was born in Anonascal, near Killarney, in Ireland. 
He was one of 11 children. Two of his brothers are priests, and one sister 
entered a religious order. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor studied theology at St. Patrick's College in Ireland and was then 
ordained and put on a boat headed for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 After serving at parishes around the Southland, he was sent, in 1955, to build 
a church in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I saw when I came to the site was a lot of vacant fields filled with 
weeds," says O'Connor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the church built and then the rectory and convent, then the school, 
library, science building and computer building," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he adds, St. Mel's Parish in Woodland Hills is 5,000 families strong. 
</P>
<P>
 The monsignor no longer teaches, nor does he handle the administration of the 
school and church. He keeps busy celebrating Mass and visiting the sick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do whatever I'm asked to," says O'Connor, who recently celebrated his 
Diamond Jubilee Anniversary in the priesthood. He has also been known to play a 
round of golf or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he ever thought he might have liked doing something else with his 
life, he answers, "What, like rob banks? I don't think so." Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't find a European vacation to fit my pocketbook, so I'm going shopping 
for a bigger pocketbook."

BRUSH FIRE BREAKS OUT IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A brush fire broke out in the hills of southwest Simi Valley on Sunday night, 
causing Ventura County Fire Department officials to declare a second alarm and 
to dispatch at least one water-dropping helicopter to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire broke out around 8:45 p.m. near Trickling Brook Court and as of 10 
p.m. had burned at least 2 acres, according to a fire department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Daley, a resident on Trickling Brook, said the fire at 9:30 p.m. was 
within a half-mile of structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far we're just sitting tight," Daley said. "The fire department hasn't 
told us to leave yet. At this point I estimate it's about half-mile away." 
</P>
<P>
 Daley estimated that as many as 10 acres may be consumed by the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 As of 10 p.m. fire department officials began releasing engine companies from 
the scene, but no further information was immediately available. J.E. MITCHELL

AID FOR FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I couldn't agree more with Bea Olvera Stotzer (July 8) that we should look at 
Aid to Families With Dependent Children as an investment rather than a burden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there are always people who take advantage of the system.However, 
setting a two-year limit for aid does not eliminate our social problem. If we 
don't deal with the problem now, we may have to pay a higher cost in the 
future. I would rather spend my tax dollars to support and educate the children 
who are in need than build prisons with accessories such as air-conditioning 
and TV. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about the role of father in this issue? Raising children is both 
father's and mother's job. To solve the problem, we need to find the root. 
Perhaps we should educate men better so there are less of them walking away 
from their responsibilities in the future.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; BRAZIL WINS PASADENA LOTTERY; SOCCER: THE 
NATION'S FOURTH CHAMPIONSHIP IS WON ON PENALTY KICKS, 3-2, AFTER SCORELESS TIE. 
BAGGIO'S MISS IS THE CLINCHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soccer is cruel, fate is relentless and the most coveted championship in the 
world hinged on the caprice of a leather boot striking a leather ball on a 
chalk spot 12 yards from a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthlong efforts of the national teams of Brazil and Italy -- toiling in 
the twin caldrons of summer heat and passionate expectations in their nations 
-- came to the most dramatic, sudden, and, for Italy, heartbreaking conclusion 
Sunday afternoon in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 scoreless minutes of regulation play and 30 scoreless minutes of 
overtime, the World Cup championship was decided by penalty kicks. Brazil won, 
3-2, and thus won a historic fourth World Cup title, its first since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy, which had again and again in this tournament fought back from the 
brink, watched in horror as Franco Baresi, the oldest and most experienced 
player on the field, missed the first penalty shot taken. Minutes later a 
nation shuddered as the team's savior, the injured Roberto Baggio, sent his 
make-or-break shot high over the crossbar, soaring on the same arc as Brazil's 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian Coach Carlos Albert Parreira, pilloried in his country for every 
decision he has made, was drained but jubilant after the game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was like Frank Sinatra," he said. "I did it my way, I did it my way. I've 
never played a more dramatic game in my life. I felt we were going to get the 
victory, it was just a matter of capitalizing on opportunities. This was just 
like life." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the crowd of 94,194 in the Rose Bowl had chosen to become Brazil fans 
for a day, those arrayed in the national yellow and green swaying to the 
ever-present drumbeat. Those newly converted soccer acolytes saw a game 
dominated by defense in which the premier offensive players made negligible 
offerings in the face of smothering defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy played Brazil only slightly differently than the rest of the champion's 
opponents. Whereas most teams pack the defense and look for a counterattack, 
Italy had vague notions about attacking, but Brazil's underrated back line and 
Italy's depleted roster made successful forward runs impossible. Always 
overshadowed by the team's brilliant offense, few noticed Brazil's defense had 
given up only three goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio, the world player of the year in 1993, was reduced by a hamstring 
strain to half-speed forays to get to space where, a week ago, he would have 
been dangerous. Before the game, the tactical discussions centered on whether 
to man-mark Baggio or stay in a zone. As the game wore on, Baggio did not even 
merit a defender to pick him up. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil, too, lost a key player to injury. Jorginho, the right back given the 
responsibility of bringing the ball up the wing, injured his thigh muscle early 
in the first half and was replaced by Cafu. Without Jorginho's service to 
Romario and Bebeto, Brazil attacked through the middle, with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Present in body but absent in impact was Bebeto, who became Romario's silent 
partner Sunday. Defender Paolo Maldini was moved by Coach Arrigo Sacchi in the 
first half to deal with Bebeto and Maldini shut him down. He might have been 
the best player on the field for either team. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few chances in the tightly played first half, and Brazil had them, 
for the most part. The best came when Branco teed up a free kick that was 
punched out by Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca at the near post. Mazinho 
rushed in for the rebound but topped the ball and didn't get a clean shot at 
the open net. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil had a dangerous chance again in the second half. Mauro Silva let loose 
a hard shot that Pagliuca saved and tried to gather while in a crouch. The ball 
bounced off his knee and spun toward the net. It bounced off the post and back 
into Pagliuca's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's only credible chance came late in the second half. Roberto Donadoni 
crossed the ball in from the right wing. Baggio's first touch controlled the 
ball and with his second he turned and shot. In an awful foreshadowing, 
Baggio's shot flew over the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The players gathered themselves for overtime that produced a few close calls 
but little else. Romario had a chance in front, but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Having failed to score in overtime, the teams were sent, for the first time in 
a World Cup championship match, to penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Before they began, Brazil's team arranged itself into a circle and held hands, 
praying. "We really felt the hands of God on us," goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it happened, his were the divine hands, making a key save of a penalty 
kick, against all odds and the shooter's great advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Baresi went first, stepping up and shooting high. The Italian captain sank to 
his knees at the mistake and Taffarel threw a comforting arm around Baresi as 
he left the goal for Pagliuca. The Italian keeper saved Marcio Santos' shot and 
suddenly everything was very, very tense. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetrio Albertini made his shot and Romario made his to draw even, 1-1. 
Alberigo Evani and Branco each made a left-footer to make it 2-2.  
</P>
<P>
 Daniele Massaro lined up and aimed right. Taffarel guessed as much and his 
save, in turn, saved Brazil. Dunga faked left and shot right to give Brazil a 
3-2 lead before Baggio was to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio carefully placed the ball and strode forward. His shot went higher and 
higher, over the bar and into the stands, where Brazil's fans were already 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious that Baggio was not himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Baggio was really hurting," Brazilian defender Aldair said. "I 
think he can do much better than that. Baresi is not a kicker. And Baggio made 
a mistake." After the miss, Baggio was inconsolable and walked alone. Pagliuca 
rolled on the grass, as if in physical pain. Brazil's team stood in a yellow 
and green knot in the center of the field, draped in flags and basking in the 
cheers that rained down. 
</P>
<P>
 As Baggio had said before the game, Hope is the last to die.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is 3:20 p.m. in Pasadena and 7:20 p.m. in Rio de Janeiro and 20 minutes 
past midnight in Rome and the World Cup has just been won by Brazil on a shot 
by Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole, ole, ole, ole. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 3:21 p.m. in North America and people from South America are singing and 
Pele is leaping and Dunga is running and Romario is wearing a flag and 
Brazilian players are doing a madcap jumping-jack dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole, ole, ole, ole. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 3:22 p.m. in the United States and 94,194 people who have been sitting 
on the edges of their seats are now standing and cheering and crying and 
hugging and shaking their heads with amazement over a classic climax to a 
classic drama that had to be seen to be disbelieved. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A., L.A., L.A., L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 A month of soccer that came down to one final shot. 
</P>
<P>
 A scoreless championship game won by one final miss. 
</P>
<P>
 A perfectly wonderful tournament with an imperfectly wonderful ending. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 3:33 p.m. at the Rose Bowl and 7,000 miles from the Roman Colosseum and 
Italians are suffering. Franco Baresi is crying in his coach's arms and Roberto 
Baggio is in emotional and physical distress and no one back home is singing or 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian athletes collapse to the grass. Blue on green. Exhausted. Played out. 
</P>
<P>
 All they can do now is watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Multicolor fireworks snap, crackle and pop above the bowl. A single-engine 
airplane hovers overhead, carrying a wing-walker. Brazilian flags flap in the 
breeze. The triumphant coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, is being tossed up and 
down by a human trampoline. The team leader, Dunga, is clutching the golden 
trophy with both palms as though having just discovered the Holy Grail. He 
kisses it, then passes it to Mauro Silva, to Branco, to Zinho, to Viola, to 
Marcio Santos, who all do the same, kiss and pass along, kiss and pass along. 
</P>
<P>
 Off they go, running, somehow summoning up life in their legs from some 
unknown resource, suddenly not tired in the least. They have the strength of a 
zillion Brazilians. They take a victory lap. They lug with them the 11-pound, 
14-inch, 18-carat dingus, the golden goddess of victory, the trophy created by 
a sculptor, Silvio Gazzaniga, an Italian. But now all any Italian can do is 
watch. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 3:40 p.m. at the end of the road, and Rome is in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrigo Sacchi, coach of the conquered, pats players on the heads, helps them 
to their feet, takes them into his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 He says: "The players were fantastic. They gave everything they had to give." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. 
</P>
<P>
 He says: "It has been a wonderful experience. . . . I only wish we could have 
brought our Italian spectators the championship." 
</P>
<P>
 They did not. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn back the clock. It is 12:30 p.m. in Pasadena and no one knows how this 
will go. Whitney Houston is on a stage belting a number and Kenny G is in a 
jazzy Team USA uniform blowing sax. And then team captains Dunga and Baresi are 
exchanging gifts, and goalkeepers Claudio Taffarel and Gianluca Pagliuca are 
clasping hands, and superstars Bebeto and Roberto Baggio are paying their 
respects, and at midfield Brazil gets the ball rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 And the players give everything they have to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Legging all out for a ball, Nicola Berti goes crashing over a rail. A 
point-blank shot misses and Daniele Massaro pinches his temples in relief. A 
free kick by Branco shanks wildly and keeps Italy's goalkeeper on his toes. A 
dipsy-do by Romario fools opponent Luigi Apolloni, over whose foot Romario goes 
toppling, face down into the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 No one scores. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 1:40 p.m. and we begin the second half. A header by Bebeto sends 
Pagliuca diving to his right. A long topspinner by Silva yo-yo's backward off 
the goal post, which the goalkeeper promptly kisses. A shot by Mazinho has a 
chance, but the alert Italian keeper smothers it. 
</P>
<P>
 And no one scores. 
</P>
<P>
 We go overtime. A trainer holds Italy's Antonio Benarrivo by the ankles and 
jiggles his limbs, trying to revive them. A teammate splits Marcio Santos' legs 
like a wishbone and kicks his thighs, hoping to awaken them. On the ground, 
Branco douses himself with Evian and shampoos it with his fingers deeply into 
his scalp. The heat is intense. So is the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one scores. 
</P>
<P>
 We go to penalty kicks. Baresi, a ball, high and outside. Santos, a ball, low 
and smothered by the catcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetrio Albertini, a strike, high and hard. Romario, a strike, on the outside 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The count is even. Alberigo Evani, a left-footer, goes down the middle to give 
Italy the lead. Branco answers with a long, long approach and a left- footed 
shot to the keeper's left. 
</P>
<P>
 Massaro misses, his shot smothered by a tumbling Taffarel. Dunga does not 
miss, netting one nonchalantly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is 3:20 p.m. and Baggio, the best Italy has, steps to the task. It is his 
game to win or lose. There is no better man for the job, this beatific 
Buddhist. He concentrates on the ball as millions back home make the sign of 
the cross. He makes his approach. He makes his mistake. He boots the ball over 
the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The boot of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a Sunday afternoon in suburban Los Angeles and it is a shot heard around 
the world. The World Cup does not end with a bang. It ends with a blank.

BRITISH OPEN; PARNEVIK DOESN'T LOOK, GETS RUN OVER BY PRICE; GOLF: SWEDE

 If only Jesper Parnevik had stolen a glance. Sneaked a peek. Overheard a 
whisper from the gallery. Maybe then the 123rd British Open championship would 
belong not to Nick Price, but to Parnevik, who picked the worst time Sunday to 
ignore the two largest scoreboards in all of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's what he did, and Price has the prized Claret Jug and a second major 
title to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, boy," said Price, whose four-under 66 put him at 12-under for the 
tournament, one shot shy of the Open record set last year. "I think it was back 
in 1982 I had my left hand on this trophy. In 1988, I had my right hand on this 
trophy. Now at last I finally got both hands on it . . . and does it feel 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 Price knows his history. Twelve years ago at Troon, he blew a three-stroke 
lead in the final round and finished tied for second. At Royal Lytham in 1988, 
almost the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, though, he was losing to the likes of Tom Watson and Seve 
Ballesteros. Sunday on the Ailsa Course he faced Parnevik, who was making only 
his second British Open appearance. It showed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a fairy tale," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was Price's fifth victory of the year, his 15th since winning the PGA 
Championship in 1992. But it was the first time all season that he played a 
major as if he belonged. Price didn't break par in four rounds at the Masters 
and didn't make the cut at the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he arrived at Turnberry, saw the way the course was set up, saw the 
forecasts for warm weather in the final days, Price knew he had a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how much I've wanted this day to happen," said Price, who 
kept alive the streak of non-American victories in this year's majors. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened because Price, of Zimbabwe, finished the final three holes 
birdie-eagle-par while the rest of the contenders couldn't keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 Try doing that with your heart beating 250 times a minute, as Price said his 
was with a championship at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened because he recorded a great up-and-down from almost the back of a 
BBC trailer positioned near the green of the 440-yard par-four 14th. 
</P>
<P>
 And it happened because of Parnevik's stubbornness. 
</P>
<P>
 Parnevik had stood over his second shot barely off the fairway on the 432-yard 
18th hole needing only a par four to finish at 12-under for the tournament, 
good enough to stay two strokes ahead of Price, who was back on the par-five 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parnevik, playing in only his second British Open, had other ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I needed another birdie on 18 to win," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he really needed was a look at one of the two scoreboards that flanked 
the 18th green. Had he done so, Parnevik would have realized what everyone else 
on the Ailsa Course, including the desperate Price, already knew: that a par 
meant safety, meant Price would have to make up two strokes in two holes to 
tie, three to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, Parnevik decided way back on No. 12 not to consult the 
scoreboards for the rest of the final round. He figured if he kept making 
birdies it wouldn't matter what the rest of the field was doing. 
</P>
<P>
 But it did matter. Every time Parnevik sank a birdie putt -- and he did so at 
11, 12, 13, 16 and 17 -- someone in the two twosomes behind him birdied, too. 
Except Parnevik didn't know who was sinking the putts. 
</P>
<P>
 Was it Fuzzy Zoeller or Brad Faxon, the two Americans who began the day at 
nine under and tied for the lead? Was it Price or Ronan Rafferty, who started 
at eight under? 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, the same sort of thing happened to Ernie Els at the U.S. Open. But 
Els recovered. Parnevik didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not knowing the exact situation, Parnevik kept pushing, instead of pausing. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the light rough of the 18th, Parnevik took a pitching wedge from 
his bag and went for the pin. The ball landed short and left of the green and 
then settled down in the lush grass. Parnevik could put the chip no closer than 
six feet from the hole. He missed the putt for par. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it turned out, maybe I should have taken a glimpse on 18," Parnevik 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price looked at scoreboards. Early and often. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the five-way tie for the lead shortly after making the turn at No. 9. 
He knew he was flirting with a bogey, maybe worse at No. 14. And he absolutely 
knew he had to birdie the par-four, 410-yard 16th and at least birdie No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not one of those who say they don't look at the leader board," Price 
said. "You have to base a lot of your tactics and strategy on what the other 
guys are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Price's improbable par save on No. 14 was the beginning of the real charge. 
With marshals and spectators holding up TV cable near the back of a BBC trailer 
positioned near the green, Price used a seven-iron to chip within four feet of 
the cup. It was a shot he had been practicing all week. He made the putt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got up and down from there?" Faxon said. "Wow. From that pin?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Price's caddie, Jeff (Squeeky) Medlen, who carried John Daly's bag when 
he won the 1991 PGA: "That chip shot that he ran -- that saved the tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The eagle on No. 17 won it. On the edge of the green in two, Price found 
himself on the flattest part of the putting surface. As he and Medlen walked 
toward the ball, Price said, "We haven't made a long putt all week." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he studied the line and sank the downhill, 51-foot putt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it went in," Price said. "I just about jumped out of my 
skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Parnevik, who was in the scorer's trailer at the time, didn't see the putt on 
television. In fact, Watson had congratulated him on the supposed soon-to-be 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came a roar from the gallery as Price's score was put on the giant 
scoreboards around the 18th. A red star -- for leader -- was placed next to his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Price still needed a par to win. But unlike Parnevik, he played it safe. Left 
with only a seven-iron -- his favorite club -- to the green, Price stuck the 
shot in the middle, two putted and got his trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, there were hugs aplenty. Price hugged his coach, David Leadbetter, 
who then declared Price the runaway No. 1 player in he world at the moment. No 
one argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Price hugged his caddie, who then hugged his fiance. The victory meant Medlen 
could afford to get married in Hawaii. Nearby, a tournament official used a 
Swiss army knife to cut off the top of the 18th flagstick. Squeeky wanted the 
flag for his collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Medlen could keep the flag. Price had his Claret Jug. 
</P>
<P>
 "The golfing gods certainly shone down on me today," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe next time Parnevik will remember the moral of Price's story: Look before 
you hit.

JIM MURRAY: WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; HOKEY FINISH CAN'T CHEAPEN VALUE OF 
PRIZE 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, dear! Or, rather, oh-oh! 
</P>
<P>
 The two best soccer teams on the planet struggled through three periods of the 
game Sunday and neither could score. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil won the World Cup, 0-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil won it from the free-throw line, so to say. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like watching two woolly mammoths struggle in a tar pit all afternoon 
and end up gumming each other to death. 
</P>
<P>
 It's kind of embarrassing. What they do in situations like this is, after 22 
guys run and kick and dribble and trip each other for 120 minutes, they put the 
ball at point-blank range and give each team five kicks at it. Even then, they 
miss. It's only 12 yards into a goal eight yards wide, but the World Cup went 
flying down to Rio when the guy who is supposed to be one of the two best 
strikers of the soccer ball in the world, Roberto Baggio, kicked the ball over 
the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can picture a World Series scoreless tie in Game 7 in which they decide 
the championship by a home run derby with key players or a base-stealing 
contest, you get the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first World Cup final decided this way. It's really a kind of 
crapshoot. Like cutting the cards or maybe deciding a heavyweight championship 
fight after regulation by having the fighters held by someone and letting the 
opponents see who can score the most knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 As unclassical as it was, it was exciting. You can bet Brazil likes it just 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 So, strike up the marimbas! Get Carmen Miranda to put a bunch of bananas in 
her hat and give us a chorus of Chicky-chicky-boom-boom. Get the conga line 
going. Tell the gang at Copacabana beach to break out the rum and Coca-Cola for 
all hands. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the forces from Forza Italia, hold the fettuccine. Nobody feels like 
eating. Tell Pavarotti to forget "Funiculi, Funicula." Maybe "Laugh, Clown, 
Laugh" would be more like it. Sorry, paisan. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if they have "goats" in World Cups like World Series, but if they 
do, I hate to say this, but I have to feel Roberto Baggio must fill the bill. 
Poor guy! He came up to the postgame showdown with his team down 3-2 in penalty 
kicks. If he makes it, he at least forces the fifth Brazilian kicker to make 
his shot to win. 
</P>
<P>
 He kicked it clean over the top of the goal. That's 8 feet high. He had just 
kicked the Cup to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 His chief rival for player of the tournament, a flamboyant Carioca who, like 
Picasso and Napoleon and Madonna and Cher, goes by one name -- Romario -- made 
his penalty kick. But I have to say it hit the post first. 
</P>
<P>
 If it was inartistic by football purists' standards, it was probably better 
than the alternative. The way these two teams were going, they might have gone 
the rest of the year without scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 You know how that announcer became famous in Cup contests shouting 
"G-o-o-o-o-l!" Well, Sunday, he would have had to yell "S-a-a-a-v-e!"or 
"O-o-o-ps!" Even uncontested from the 12-yard line, four of nine missed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like having a putt-off to decide the U.S. Open. But you have to say the 
Great Soccer Experiment was a crashing success. You know, we export our 
national sports to other countries. But not the World Series. Not the Super 
Bowl. Not the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 We export exhibition games, demonstration sports. These guys gave us the whole 
enchilada. The United States got the greatest soccer spectacle in the world. We 
got the greatest players, the greatest teams and an event that occurs only 
every four years. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a great party. More than 3.5 million spectators jammed nine venues. The 
gross, figuring an average of $100 a ticket, was $350 million not counting TV 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, you cheerfully do penalty kicks. Penalty kicks ordinarily are 
awarded for infractions in the penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the victorious goalkeeper, Claudio Taffarel, described the postgame 
kick-off as "a lottery." He blocked only one of the three shots Italy missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Does this now mean Brazil is the best team in the world? Well, you play by 
house rules whether it's in a Vegas casino or a floating crap game. After all, 
Brazil penalty kicks went in the goal. The one miss was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history books, it goes down as a victory. Same as 5-0 even though FIFA 
will list the score as 0-0. Brazil won, it is the World Cup champion by house 
rules. As the golfer Lloyd Mangrum, when criticized for not playing classic 
golf from tee to green but proceeding to one putt his way to victory, asked 
sweetly: "Are we playing how or how many?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil can say the same. It was playing how many -- and it had the most. Can't 
wait till 1998.

SMITH ENJOYS THE TASTE OF VICTORY WITH ORIOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three months ago, Dwight Smith celebrated his first home run in an 
Angel uniform with a bottle of expensive champagne compliments of teammate Bo 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did Smith celebrate his two-run homer in the third inning that helped 
the Baltimore Orioles beat his former Angel teammates Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 The working man's ale -- Bud Light. 
</P>
<P>
 And he thought the brew tasted just as sweet as the expensive stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 After being traded to the Orioles June 14 for minor leaguer Bo Ortiz, Smith 
came back to haunt the Angel pitching staff Sunday by going three for five with 
three runs batted in and two runs scored in a 10-5 Oriole victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good," Smith said of beating his old teammates. "I was telling some 
of my (Baltimore) teammates that it was hard to get a killer instinct against 
the Angels because I know the guys. Today, I tried to get a little serious, not 
talk as much and focus on the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was still hard to go out and play against these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith left an Angel team that has been sinking in the AL West standings, and 
he's now in the thick of the AL East race with the Orioles. Besides that, 
winning three of four games against his former team was, well, let Smith 
explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was especially satisfying after I broke all my bats in the first three 
games of the series," he said. "All of my bats were in the damn stands, and 
when we went out at night after the game, we all have a laugh about it. I had 
to get one laugh out of a game." 
</P>
<P>
 A platoon player with the Angels, Smith became expendable when new manager 
Marcel Lachemann made Jim Edmonds the everyday left fielder. Baltimore Manager 
Johnny Oates has given Smith a little more playing time, and he has increased 
his batting average to .275. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dwight has played really well for us," Oates said. "He has been hitting over 
.300 against right-handed pitching since we got him." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith has fit in nicely in the sixth spot in Baltimore's batting order, behind 
Brady Anderson, Chris Sabo, Rafael Palmeiro, Cal Ripken Jr. and Harold Baines. 
The veteran lineup, Smith said, was a far cry from the Angels' youth movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Angels) are rebuilding over there and they have to live and die with a 
lot of young (players') mistakes," he said. "Over here, it's all veterans. We 
win and it's out the door. It ain't no: "We'll get them tomorrow.' " Ripken, 
who's chasing Lou Gehrig's major league record of 2,130 consecutive games 
played, has been particularly influential on Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal's like a big kid," Smith said. "I can't say enough about him. I've 
learned from him that everyday ball players have good attitudes. I came in here 
and saw how loosey-goosey he is and I thought, 'No wonder he hasn't got hurt 
all this time.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And usually you find that a lot of great players are stuck up, you know, like 
a pretty girl. But Cal's not that way at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Although his uniform has changed and so has his team's fortunes, one thing 
about Smith has stayed the same with the Orioles. His teammates still like to 
rip on him. 
</P>
<P>
 As reporters crowded around Smith's locker, Oriole pitcher Mark Williamson 
shouted to anyone within earshot: "What do you want talk to him for? What did 
he do today? What, is he the Pizza Hut player of the game or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith just took a sip from his beer and smiled.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; INSIDE JOB: BAT APPARENTLY BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bat confiscated from Albert Belle of the Cleveland Indians that had been 
switched during a break-in at an umpire's dressing room has been returned -- 
apparently -- and will be X-rayed to see if it was corked. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would say who was responsible for slipping through a ceiling into the 
umpires' dressing room at Comiskey Park during Friday's game and making the bat 
switch.And no one could say for certain whether the bat that showed up Sunday 
was the same one originally taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian General Manager John Hart would not reveal the name of the person 
involved in the break-in, nor would he say if it was an Indian player. But he 
left little doubt that the person was affiliated with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it was someone internally with the Indians," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be disciplinary action taken at some point, I'm sure, and that 
will be determined with the Indians, the commissioner's office and the league 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire crew chief Dave Phillips said he couldn't be 100% positive that the 
returned bat was the one he confiscated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult for me to say that it is unequivocally the same bat 
because I don't know," Phillips said. "It appears to be the same bat that I 
took off the field." 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager Ron Schueler of the Chicago White Sox said he would wait until 
the investigation was completed to determine the next course of action. He said 
the break-in, in his opinion, shows that Belle's bat was indeed corked. 
</P>
<P>
 "By switching it, it almost shows me guilt," Schueler said. "Maybe I'm 
presuming too much. Why would somebody bother to go in there if they didn't 
think anything was tampered with? 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't be pushed under the carpet. . . . It's serious to break into a 
locked room."

COWBOYS' SMITH SUFFERS MINOR INJURY WHEN CART STRIKES UNOFFICIAL MASCOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dallas Cowboy running back Emmitt Smith suffered a slight head injury Sunday 
when a small motorized cart he was riding ran into unofficial team mascot Ray 
Jones, 63, known as "Crazy Ray." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, last season's regular-season and Super Bowl most valuable player, 
underwent a CAT scan at St. David Hospital. Test results were negative and 
Smith was released. Jones was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred shortly after noon as players gathered at the Cowboys' 
training camp on the campus of St. Edward's University. Smith was riding a cart 
driven by teammate Tommie Agee when they hit Jones.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; ANALYSIS; UNFAIR RULE PUTS AN END TO FAIR FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY A. KISSINGER and ANTHONY DAY, Henry Kissinger is the unpaid honorary 
chairman of World Cup USA 1994. Anthony Day is Los Angeles Times senior 
correspondent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now Brazil has the 1994 World Cup championship -- and on penalty kicks, 3-2. 
You can make a plausible case that either team could have won. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the "dream game" some people had hoped for from these mighty soccer 
powers. Each team played the game it knows best. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy played a brilliant defensive game. Its offense was obviously hampered by 
the hamstring injury of Roberto Baggio, who did not seem up to par. Its 
goalkeeper, Gianluca Pagliuca, made some improbable saves and kept his team 
from defeat in regular time. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil played its visually strong attacking game. It had more chances to 
score. But it had trouble finishing its attacks, as it had trouble before. 
</P>
<P>
 The patent unfairness of the penalty-kick resolution of the game after a 
scoreless tie in regular time and overtime was there for all to see. It was 
heartbreaking to see the Italians sitting there, crushed, on the field. But 
then, it would have been heartbreaking to see the Brazilians in the same 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 A European friend called the other day to say that July had been a great month 
for America. As it turned out, he was not referring to the economy or to 
foreign policy but to the World Cup. He loved the filled stadiums, he said, but 
above all, the enthusiasm, the good nature and the joyfulness of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 And he was right. The World Cup celebrated fierce, but non-confrontational, 
nationalism. The spectators, while passionate, were friendly. The teams, while 
physical, were fair. And the new FIFA rules discouraged violence. Though 
Kissinger had the title of honorary chairman, his duties essentially ended when 
the World Cup was awarded to America. He can, therefore, pay tribute to the 
American organizing committee, which found the stadiums, adapted them to soccer 
and arranged the hospitality -- all of it in a country that has no local teams 
to provide the administrative support. The organization was thoroughly 
efficient. Kissinger attended five previous World Cups; he has never seen the 
performance of this year's host country surpassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, the soccer was much better -- more offensive, livelier, more 
imaginative -- than that of World Cup '90 in Italy, where defensiveness and 
rough play smothered too many games. 
</P>
<P>
 The two best teams got to the final. The Netherlands team was about as good 
but, through the accident of the draw, had to face Brazil in the round of 16. 
Argentina began the tournament playing a powerful combination of Latin American 
flair and European decisiveness. But after the forced departure of Diego 
Maradona, it lost to Bulgaria in a game that did not matter, and in the round 
of 16 to Romania in a game that was one of the highlights of the World Cup. Had 
Argentina made that hurdle, it could have gone to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden's journey to the third-place game showed the importance of grit but 
offered few new vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's challenge, like that of Romania, might foretell a stronger role by 
Eastern European countries. The fall of the Iron Curtain opened Western Europe 
to Eastern players and freed them from the stereotyped game of the centrally 
planned societies. You can expect to see more African and Asian soccer in the 
World Cup in France in '98 and beyond as the sport grows in popularity. 
Nigeria, with a little more experience and tactical skill, might have made the 
semifinals. Its players were among the most skilled of the tournament but 
lacked tactical experience and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 The most ambiguous future is Germany's -- since 1974 a two-time champion and 
four-time finalist. The problem is not, as many critics claim, that the team is 
too old but that no replacements seem available. The German coach, Berti Vogts, 
was right in saying that, though nine of his players had played on the team 
that won the World Cup in 1990, they happened to be the best players available. 
But this means that almost the entire team has to be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 What of the game itself? Could more rules changes encourage more attacking 
soccer? 
</P>
<P>
 One suggestion has been to limit the number of defenders in the penalty area 
during corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Corner kicks figure also in suggestions for eliminating the use of penalty 
kicks as tiebreakers. Penalty-kick tiebreakers in the round of 16 and after can 
be heart-stopping, as Sweden's defeat of Romania demonstrated. But who can be 
left who thinks they are a measure of quality? 
</P>
<P>
 Because corner kicks indicate the attacking team has been playing in the 
defenders' area, you could break a tie by awarding it to the team with the most 
corner kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggestion has been to break a tie by alternating corner kicks until a 
team scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1986, FIFA rules prescribe penalty kicks as the tiebreaker for the final 
too. Until 1986 a tied final was always to be played again. (It never had to 
be.) Returning to the pre-1986 system would at least prevent the sport's most 
important game from being decided by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The third-place game, in which this year Sweden easily beat an exhausted 
Bulgaria, 4-0, has no meaning and offers no particular incentive to those who 
play it. Four years from now there will be 32 instead of 24 teams in the first 
round. Currently, the previous champion and host gain automatic places in the 
round of 24. Why not give automatic entry to the round of 32 to the top three 
winners of the previous tournament? That would make the third-place game an 
important one. 
</P>
<P>
 And what of America and soccer? The stirring performance of the American team 
did much to popularize the game. But without a league playing regularly it will 
not prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is for a league of 12 teams to get under way in April. The season 
would run through July. 
</P>
<P>
 The players probably would have to be a mix of Americans and foreigners. The 
soccer writer Paul Johnson recommends in his book "The Simplest Game" that the 
Americans look for style and technique, not to Europe but to Brazil. The more 
exciting kind of Brazilian soccer, he says, would have a wider appeal, and a 
distinctive American style might eventually emerge. It might look something 
like Argentina's, he suggests -- a combination of fluidity and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The main point, he argues, is to shift emphasis from speed and size to ball 
control and player initiative. He suggests that such a style would have a great 
appeal to the rapidly growing number of fans who don't have to be taught to 
love the game.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; SOCCER / GRAHAME L. JONES; A DAY FOR HEROES 
PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE

By GRAHAME L. JONES

<TEXT>
<P>
 They loped off the field together, the old wolf and the young cub. 
</P>
<P>
 The old wolf's mane was white. In his eyes, a tear or two might have 
glistened. Perhaps it was the memories that came flooding back, memories of 
1958, 1962, 1970 and, now, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Or perhaps it was that his players, his beloved Brazilians, had just been 
tossing him into the air, not once, not twice or thrice, but four times, one 
for each World Cup he has won. 
</P>
<P>
 And that sort of celebration takes some getting used to when you're going to 
turn 63 in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six years after he starred as a left wing on Brazil's 1958 World 
Cup-winning team in Sweden, Mario Jorge (Lobo) Zagalo won the Cup for an 
astonishing fourth time Sunday, this time as Brazil's technical director. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has done that before. 
</P>
<P>
 Alongside padded the cub, christened Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima but already 
far better known simply as Ronaldo. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo is 17 and his proudest possession as of this morning is a World Cup 
winner's medal. Pele was 17 when he won his first World Cup. Ronaldo did not 
play in this tournament, but just as Zagalo represents Brazil's past, Ronaldo 
represents its future. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagalo already had won two World Cup tournaments as a player and a third as 
Brazil's coach by the time Ronaldo was born in 1977, but the youngster is being 
touted as the nation's next star. More than 50 goals for Cruzeiro, his 
Brazilian club, have earned him that accolade. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of being the next Romario or Bebeto was not on Ronaldo's shoulders 
in this World Cup. That will come later. For now, he was content simply to 
learn, to be part of the team, accepted well enough so that during Brazil's 
celebratory dances Ronaldo went about smacking his fellow players with a large 
yellow balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 The innocence is still there for Ronaldo. Innocence that was sadly lacking 
during a World Cup final that, while incident-filled, never rose to any great 
height as a spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 The announced Rose Bowl crowd of 94,194 (a highly suspicious total in a 1994 
World Cup filled with too many heavy-handed public-relations gimmicks) sat 
through two hours of defensive soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not boring -- there were too many fascinating one-on-one battles for 
that -- but neither was it exhilarating. This was a game for those who enjoy 
their soccer as played by Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Aldair and Marcio 
Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 All four were excellent, with Maldini enjoying the game of his life, 
especially once he had been restored to his usual left-back position. Baresi, 
who is not quite as old as Zagalo but probably felt like it by the end of 120 
exhausting minutes, was equally superb. 
</P>
<P>
 Between them, and with significant help from the relatively inexperienced but 
astonishingly composed Antonio Benarrivo and Luigi Apolloni, they completely 
nullified the twin threats of Romario and Bebeto. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the field, Aldair and Marcio Santos, dealt equally capably 
with the disappointingly rare Italian offensive forays. Roberto Baggio, Italy's 
great hope, was hobbled by a hamstring strain and was never able to escape the 
attentions of Mauro Silva. 
</P>
<P>
 It added up to a frustrating afternoon for both teams' attacks, and it was 
hardly surprising that it finally required penalty kicks to tell world champion 
from runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira did what he had promised. Despite intense and ugly criticism of his 
team's style, he brought the Cup back to Brazil. More than that, the fans 
cannot ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parreira is a good coach, but he doesn't have any luck," a Brazilian 
journalist said before the tournament. "Zagalo is not a good coach but he has 
good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they made the perfect combination. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil is now holder of three world championships, having won the Under-20 
World Championship in Australia last year as well as the FIFA Five-a-Side 
(Indoor) World Championship in Hong Kong, also last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian team that defeated Ghana in the Under-20 final in Sydney is 
light years removed from Parreira's side. It played the way Zagalo used to, 
full of flair and imagination, with surprises around every corner. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the team Ronaldo now can join for the next Under-20 World Cup, in 
Nigeria next year. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the young cub is wise, he'll find a way to take the old wolf with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Just for luck.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; PAGLIUCA STANDS ALONE, WITHOUT FEELING OF LUCK; 
SOCCER: ITALY'S GOALKEEPER TURNS IN A SHUTOUT, BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The victorious Brazilians were doing something closely resembling jumping 
jacks in the midfield, and several yards away, Italian goalkeeper Gianluca 
Pagliuca was flat on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates were respectful, letting him remain alone with his thoughts. 
Finally, a couple came over and comforted him. Forward Gianfranco Zola put an 
arm around Pagliuca. 
</P>
<P>
 How bittersweet could it get? 
</P>
<P>
 Pagliuca had not allowed a goal but lost the World Cup championship game when 
Brazil defeated Italy on Sunday on penalty kicks, 3-2, at the Rose Bowl. He did 
exactly what a goalkeeper is supposed to do -- shut out the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario couldn't score. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Bebeto. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga, Branco, Cafu and Viola were unable to get it past Pagliuca. 
</P>
<P>
 For 120 minutes, there was nothing in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to get a grip on losing on penalty kicks, not exactly commonplace. 
The final game had never been decided by penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a terrible emotion," Pagliuca said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the goalkeeper with movie-star looks did not lash out against the use of 
penalty kicks. "It was right because that's the rules," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After overtime and before the penalty kicks, his teammates gave him 
encouragement. Defender Luigi Apolloni hugged him, and in an immense show of 
class, Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel walked over and hugged him before 
the penalty kicks. Perhaps Taffarel realized the injustice, a sentiment he 
expressed before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Taffarel: "We are great friends. When we walked together toward the goal, 
we agreed that whichever team would persevere was predetermined to win the 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, Pagliuca and his teammates did not have the necessary feeling of luck 
about the unprecedented way to decide a championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a good game, but we made too many mistakes," Pagliuca said. "When 
it came to penalty kicks, you've just got to have a feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure was on Pagliuca, even before he faced the first kick, because 
Italian defender Franco Baresi started the series by missing. But Pagliuca 
immediately put Italy back in it by making a save on Marcio Santos. 
</P>
<P>
 But Romario, Branco and Dunga scored, and the result was taken out of 
Pagliuca's hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not able to finish this game. We made too many mistakes," Pagliuca 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He got away with a major error himself in regulation. One of Brazil's best 
opportunities came in the 76th minute when Pagliuca bobbled a 25-yard blast by 
midfielder Mauro Silva. But the ball bounced harmlessly off the post and 
disaster was averted. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagliuca, dramatically, kissed his own hand and patted the post. 
</P>
<P>
 For him, it was a tumultuous tournament from start to finish. The 27-year-old, 
who plays for Sampdoria of Genoa, was the first goalkeeper to be ejected from a 
World Cup game when he was given a red card for handling the ball out of the 
penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 It came in the 21st minute against Norway in the first round, and Pagliuca was 
tossed and promptly suspended for two more games. And Italian Coach Arrigo 
Sacchi went with Luca Marchegiani for the second round and was criticized for 
going back to Pagliuca for the quarterfinals against Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Marchegiani had been the starter during World Cup qualifying but lost his 
position when he committed two major errors in a 2-2 tie against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagliuca, a reserved and self-contained man, took over and was the starter 
through the rest of qualifying. He often has one stock phrase for the Italian 
media when asked about his performance, saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "You lot, judge for yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's not exactly much to criticize when a goalkeeper records a 
shutout and still loses. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Pagliuca's lot.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; TEAM LEFT WITH NO SMILES -- OR APOLOGIES; ITALY: 
PLAYERS BELIEVE THEY FINISHED SECOND TO NONE AFTER LOSING CHAMPIONSHIP ON 
PENALTY KICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 La commedia e finita.  
</P>
<P>
 The drama is ended, but it was the curtain that fell -- not the sky -- on 
Italy's dream of a world soccer championship Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two missed penalty kicks spelled the difference after a 120-minute standoff 
across a green field where the temperature reached 97 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an artificial end for an organic game, and if there were tears of 
frustration on the field, there were no apologies afterward by the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything we could. We have to accept the result with tranquillity," 
Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi said. "I would be happy to repeat the experience. 
We should not look for alibis. We failed at penalty kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 There weren't any smiles after the game, but no heads hanging either. 
</P>
<P>
 "A shootout is like a lottery. You never know who will win," said Italian 
captain Franco Baresi, who, like Roberto Baggio, hit his shot over the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the team bus, Baggio swept up his 4-year-old daughter and clutched 
her tight, playing kissing games, looking happier than he ever did on the field 
in USA '94. Her baseball cap was on backward too. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Brazilians who won, the Italians who lost are professionals. To have 
lost on the field might have hurt; to have lost on penalty kicks simply stung. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played 120 minutes, exhausted at the end of a long tournament. It's a 
shame to end on penalty kicks like this," midfielder Roberto Donadoni said. 
"Losing this way is sad, but I believe we come out of this game second to 
nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel, a veteran of the Italian first 
division: "Of course a penalty-kick decision doesn't mean that the best team 
will win. Nobody likes a penalty kick decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of a penalty-kick defeat was not lost on anybody in Italy, where a 
semifinal shootout against Argentina ended Italian championship hopes in Italia 
'90. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a world champion, or else we would have tied. We have to 
accept the rules with a great serenity. But today I felt we played a 
championships caliber match," Sacchi said. "When I am old I can say that I lost 
the championship on penalty kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Baresi, who returned from a leg injury as part of a stout Italian defense that 
again and again frustrated Brazil with some of the best individual play of the 
day, left the game with cramps a few minutes before the end. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to kick Italy's first penalty shot because Sacchi asked him to. 
</P>
<P>
 "The few times we have gone to penalties, he was the first one to shoot," 
Sacchi explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Italy lacked the flair of its last two games against Spain and 
Bulgaria, Sacchi thought his Azzurri played even against the pressing 
Brazilians: "A very balanced match that could have gone either way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, Italy's defeat was far less dramatic than the last-gasp victories 
that brought it as far as the Rose Bowl Sunday. Among the pre-Cup favorites for 
its heritage and the quality of its players, the Italian team stuttered under 
Sacchi. 
</P>
<P>
 It qualified for USA '94 with great difficulty and then played indifferently 
in the first round, finishing third in a division the Italians expected to win. 
In second-round play and the quarterfinals, it took last-minute operatics by 
Baggio to get past Nigeria and Spain before a semifinal breather against 
Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 "We almost seemed destined to end up like this, in a penalty shootout. To lose 
this way is disappointing, to miss so many," said goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca, 
who stopped the first penalty shot against him but was beaten by the next 
three. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Donadoni: "I never thought anyone would miss. Bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there in body and spirit for the penalty. I don't know why I sent it 
over," Baggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in defeat, Sacchi, a coach who thrives on unpredictability has made 
believers of his hyper-critical countrymen. Early in the tournament, more than 
80% of them were telling pollsters he should be fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, Italy can return with honor and the prospect of more demanding 
innovation from Sacchi, whose contract lasts another two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Italians filed thoughtfully from the stadium Sunday, fullback Antonio 
Benarrivo wrote the epitaph: "We're not bad. We're good. We showed our class. 
Tomorrow we start anew."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; GOALKEEPER IS LOOKING FOR A REAL JOB NOW; 
SOCCER: BRAZIL'S TAFFAREL WAS DROPPED BY ITALIAN LEAGUE TEAM BEFORE THE START 
OF THE WORLD CUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Now that Brazil's Claudio Taffarel has been thrust into the storied history of 
World Cup soccer, he can attend to more mundane pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Namely, finding a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The goalkeeper who won the first World Cup title decided by penalty kicks is 
unemployed today. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, I have no job," he said. "But beginning (today) I will begin 
thinking about a new employer." 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel's predicament is the result of a poor 1994 season. He began the year 
with Parma in the Italian league, but was sent to Reggiana. Although he helped 
the club stun AC Milan, 1-0, Taffarel was cast aside by Reggiana before the 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than a few in Brazil who wanted Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira 
to dump him too. They wanted Zetti to start over Taffarel because, frankly, he 
was playing better. It was not the first time the keeper weathered controversy 
during a World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 in Italy, Taffarel's fiancee, Andrea, who is now his wife, told 
Brazilian reporters that the goalkeeper was unhappy with the team's strategy. 
In Brazil, it amounted to a national scandal. When the Brazilians were 
eliminated by Argentina in the second round, Taffarel's complaints were blamed. 
</P>
<P>
 By holding steady against Italy on Sunday at the Rose Bowl, Taffarel reserved 
a place in Brazilian soccer lore. After the teams played to a scoreless draw, 
Brazil won the title on penalty kicks, 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rarely challenged during the tournament, his moment arrived after 120 
exhausting minutes Sunday before 94,194. 
</P>
<P>
 How did he prepare for it? 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel put his arm around Gianluca Pagliuca, Italy's goalkeeper, and told 
his rival: "The team that wins was predestined to." 
</P>
<P>
 And after Italy's Franco Baresi blasted the first kick way over the goal, then 
fell to his knees, Taffarel rushed out of the net to console him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knowing just how much pressure there is on the kicker, and how great a player 
he was, I told him he still was a great player," Taffarel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension mounted after the teams each took three kicks and were tied, 2-2. 
It might have been a disappointing way to determine a world champion, but it 
made for high drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's Daniele Massaro stepped to the line, facing Taffarel from 12 yards 
out. Taffarel committed to his left and knocked it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I guessed right, it was easy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dunga gave Brazil a 3-2 lead with a shot deep to the right corner, 
Taffarel faced Roberto Baggio. A nation that had waited 24 years for its fourth 
World Cup title held its collective breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to pass all the responsibility on to the kicker," Taffarel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio stepped to the line with the same pressures. Italy was seeking its 
fourth world championship and he was his country's only hope of continuing that 
pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of the most electrifying players of the World Cup against a 
goalkeeper who had not done much. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taffarel did not even have to move. Baggio launched into the ball as if he 
wanted to kick a field goal. It sailed over the net, and Taffarel, 28, was able 
to erase the memories of a frustrating year. 
</P>
<P>
 As Baggio sat near where he kicked in disbelief, Taffarel walked by without 
showing much emotion. But he quickly joined a Brazilian samba line as the 
players danced around the Rose Bowl in celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of the penalty kicks, I don't consider myself the hero of this 
team," Taffarel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Sunday's penalty-kick situation has made Taffarel's career, he was 
not looking forward to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of luck is involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagliuca, his Italian counterpart, agreed: "It all comes down to luck." 
</P>
<P>
 But each goalkeeper said he accepted the fate that led to such a moment in 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Taffarel, the tension showed. Three times, he hung on the back of the 
net before moving into position. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a way for me to step back and take a little more time to relax 
and concentrate before I faced the kicker," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He later called it a difficult situation to endure. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the result was just because we played better," he said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; DUNGA BENDS, BUT ONLY BREAKS DOWN AT END; 
SOCCER: HIS TWISTING PENALTY KICK FOOLS PAGLIUCA AND PROVES DECISIVE.

<P>
 He wasn't going to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a tough guy," said Carlos Caetano Bledorn Verri, the Brazilian 
midfielder known as Dunga. 
</P>
<P>
 He had just made the winning penalty kick in his country's World Cup 
championship victory over Italy, but he wasn't going to break down. 
</P>
<P>
 Not him. Not the team captain. Not Dunga. 
</P>
<P>
 After the goal he thrust out his right fist, gave a thumbs-up sign and stalked 
back toward midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 After Roberto Baggio missed his penalty kick to give Brazil the championship, 
Dunga grabbed a green-and-yellow Brazil flag and continued stalking. 
</P>
<P>
 All around him teammates were falling to their knees and sobbing with joy, but 
not Dunga. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the Brazilians were summoned into the awards area to receive the golden 
ball symbolic of a World Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
 As captain, Dunga was chosen to accept the trophy. He took it in his hands, 
kissed it, and perhaps felt like swaggering away with it when the strangest 
thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 A number came into his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the number one, for his penalty kick goal, the first time he has kicked a 
ball into the net in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the number two, for the number of errant shots he took Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the number four, for the times his country has won the World Cup 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he thought of the number 150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that 150 million Brazilians are kissing the cup with me," he said. 
"And I. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 You guessed it. Like a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a tough guy, but this time, I cry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunga's tears surprised his teammates far more than his winning penalty kick, 
which featured both the calmness and intensity that have marked his one-year 
tenure as captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Dunga," teammate Aldair said, "this team is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 This is, after all, a man who has spent most of his life living with a 
nickname that, in Portuguese, means "Dopey." As in Snow White's little buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a man who has had to get tough or succumb to jokes about his size 
(small), his ears (large) and his hair (does Sergeant Carter of "Gomer Pyle" 
ring a bell?) 
</P>
<P>
 And tough he was Sunday after watching his goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel guess 
right on Daniele Massaro's penalty kick, diving to his left and knocking it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 This gave Dunga, as the fourth of five scheduled kickers, a chance to make the 
kick that would give Brazil a 3-2 shootout lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Taffarel leaped from the grass and ran past Dunga, waving one finger, 
symbolizing one more needed save. If Dunga was inspired, he didn't show it. 
</P>
<P>
 He calmly carried the ball to the 12-yard spot, gently laid it down, then took 
nine careful steps backward. The world was watching, but Dunga was not even 
sweating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to block everything out," Dunga said. "I tried to block out the fans. 
Block out the screams. Block out the noise. I tried only to concentrate." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine strong strides later, he kicked the only sort of ball that Italy 
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was not expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the only sort of ball that Pagliuca, in fact, had probably never even 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in America could a guy win a soccer game with a changeup. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, the ball was light," Pagliuca said. "Then it changed 
directions." 
</P>
<P>
 The ball left Dunga's right foot, bound for the right corner of the goal. 
Pagliuca, momentarily frozen like so many major league hitters, fell in the 
other direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball found the back of the net, and soon thereafter, the tough guy broke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a man with great faith," Dunga said. "Today, this helped me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as that faith helped him in 1990 when, as a member of that underachieving 
World Cup team, he awoke one morning to read the headline, "Error, Dunga." 
</P>
<P>
 And just as that faith helped him after he was removed from the national team 
for his lack of playmaking skills, only to be brought back by Coach Carlos 
Alberto Parreira for his toughness. 
</P>
<P>
 With a team-leading 14 fouls in this tournament, he showed that toughness. And 
late Sunday afternoon with the trophy, his teammates and his vision, he 
revealed another side. 
</P>
<P>
 Dopey? We hardly think so.

 "Magic moments" from the World Cup, according to some notables: 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major: "Having returned hot and tired from the 
Naples Summit, I particularly enjoyed settling down to watch the second half of 
the Bulgaria vs. Germany match.The game really hinged on one man -- (Yordan) 
Letchkov. Giving away a penalty only galvanized him to greater efforts -- 
wherever the ball was, so was he, it seemed. His match-winning goal was 
magnificent. . . . It was the very essence of the beautiful game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgarian President Zhelyu Zhelev: "My abiding memory will be of Yordan 
Letchkov. His goal meant so much to the Bulgarian people. I have written to him 
to tell him that the victory gave the whole country a new confidence and belief 
in their achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer and TV executive Melvyn Bragg: "When Ireland scored against Italy, all 
I wanted to do was be in a bar in Dublin." 
</P>
<P>
 Novelist and politician Jeffrey Archer: "The tension of the penalty shoot-out, 
realizing that just one mistake means you have to wait another four years 
before you can redeem yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA President Joao Havelange: "No single moment for me. Just the whole 
competition. I have been to every World Cup since 1954 and USA '94 has been the 
best. There is no question about it."

 O , what a show this World Cup final promised to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggi- O ! 
</P>
<P>
 Romari- O ! 
</P>
<P>
 Bebet- O ! 
</P>
<P>
 Maestros of the sweet sound of soccer ball hitting net, that's how they were 
billed. Virtuosos. Magnificos . The Three Tenors of the unstoppable shot on 
goal, brought together for the biggest performance of their lives -- live, 
Sunday, at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 So we watched and waited, waited and watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Score after 45 minutes: O to O. 
</P>
<P>
 Score after 90 minutes: O to O. 
</P>
<P>
 Score after 105 minutes: O to O. 
</P>
<P>
 Score after 120 minutes: O to O. 
</P>
<P>
 They are supposed to be the three greatest strikers in the world, give or take 
a Stoitchkov or a Klinsmann, and all they had done was go down swinging. Strike 
one, strike two, strike three. 
</P>
<P>
 They were forced to endure the striker's ultimate indignity -- the game of 
their careers, decided by penalty kicks -- meaning they had failed before all 
the world to do their jobs, meaning that the World Cup, the prize jewel of 
their sport, would be won and lost for the first time in history in a 
crapshoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our responsibility to win the game," Bebeto had to somberly concede in 
the aftermath. And his team was the penalty-kicks champion. "But in soccer, 
there are always surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not quite. Pele never needed penalty kicks to win his three World Cups. 
Maradona, Paolo Rossi, Gerd Muller -- the greatest strikers of their day all 
managed to strike when their countries needed it the most. 
</P>
<P>
 But Romario and Bebeto, the Goal Dust Twins for the first Brazil side of the 
post-Pele era to reach the World Cup final, hemmed and hawed and turned Italian 
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca into a two-hour hero. Bebeto never put a serious 
shot on net and Romario spent most his time playing bumper pool off the legs of 
blue-shirted defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Roberto Baggio, what can an Italian fan possibly say without reaching 
for a handkerchief? Baggio played in pain, played while dragging his right leg 
around the yard, but when all was said and done, Baggio had four chances to win 
the game and punted every time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrice, he went high and over the crossbar -- in the 83rd minute, in the 97th 
minute and on the last kick of this World Cup, the penalty kick that will live 
forever in Azzurri infamy. 
</P>
<P>
 But it never should have reached so dire a strait -- that's the point, the 
only one evident during regulation and overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto had combined for eight of Brazil's 11 goals through the 
semifinal round. Baggio had five of Italy's eight, including two in the 
semifinal triumph over Bulgaria (the score was 2-1) and two in the great 
round-of-16 escape against Nigeria (that score again: 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Romario was awarded the Golden Ball as outstanding player in 
this World Cup. Baggio won the Silver Ball. (Bulgaria's Hristo Stoitchkov won 
bronze.) But during the game, both were kicking leaden balls. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Baggio had an excuse from his doctor, even if no one in Italy wants 
to hear it this morning. Baggio's pulled hamstring would have kept him out of 
any game that didn't have the bragging rights of modern civilization riding on 
it. Under any other circumstances, Baggio should have had that right leg 
wrapped and propped up on the Italian bench, basking in the cooling misting 
jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Baggio decided to take the heat. Ninety-plus degrees on the field and 
who knows how many Fahrenheit in the tabloids back home. He played every single 
minute, albeit not with quite the same panache as he had along the road to 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Would a fit Baggio have spun in the box in 24th minute of overtime, with the 
far corner of net yawning at him, and squibbed a one-hopper that Brazilian 
goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel fielded like a shortstop? The Baggio of the 
Bulgaria game would have netted that one before Taffarel could have blinked. 
Roma would be closed today for the national holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Taffarel made the save and Baggio sat dejectedly in the area, legs 
splayed in front of him, like a 6-year-old deprived of his birthday cake. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto, meanwhile, were largely hamstrung. Italy's backline was 
makeshift and injury-depleted, but Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini and the 
others surrounded Romario like a police escort. Bebeto managed a few blunted 
crossing passes, dribbled a ball off his foot in the box and generally played 
the part of invisible man. 
</P>
<P>
 He even failed to make an appearance during penalty kicks, as World Cup trivia 
buffs are sure to some day note. 
</P>
<P>
 When Baggio swung and missed, Bebeto was the man on deck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an injustice for us to win this game on penalty kicks," Bebeto 
reiterated. "We were the best team." 
</P>
<P>
 On a day when all the best players struck out.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FINAL; THE BIG PARTY'S ONLY BEGINNING IN BRAZIL; 
REACTION: EMBATTLED CITIZENS SEE VICTORY AS A SIGN OF BETTER THINGS TO COME. 
DRINKING, DANCING AND FIREWORKS ARE ORDER OF THE DAY.

<P>
 In what was probably the world's biggest one-day party, millions of 
Brazilians, starved for 24 years since last winning the World Cup, poured into 
the nation's streets Sunday night, singing, dancing and most of all drinking in 
celebration of their country's victory over Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nation where football is more religion than sport and heroes take on 
mythic proportions, the win takes on a significance much larger than a mere 
sports victory. For people who have suffered through one political scandal 
after another, battled inflation that last year was nearly 3,000% and earn a 
median income of only $300 a month, it is a temporary salve for the ills of a 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victory is an omen of the good things that are going to come," teacher 
Margarite Studart shouted between leaping up and down at a local restaurant 
where throngs had gathered to watch the game. "I know it. I know it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It restores our spirit," said physician Atila Machado, 54. "Our spirit has 
been down -- the economy, politics and the death of (race car driver) Ayrton 
Senna. You lose someone like Senna and it brings down the country." 
</P>
<P>
 President Itamar Franco has already declared today a holiday for federal 
workers, and in true Brazilian fashion, other workers are expected to piggyback 
on the federal decree and stay home, still basking in the glow of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 So, for one night, the young and old, the rich and poor put aside concerns 
over the stumbling economy and a divisive upcoming presidential election to 
embrace each other over the one thing that brings this often fractious nation 
together -- soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited fans, most who had been holed up in their homes nervously watching the 
game on television, poured into near-empty streets, jamming the famous beaches 
of Rio de Janeiro and clogging the avenues of the country's other urban 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is beating so fast," said Carlos Olivera, a security guard standing 
outside the city's posh beachfront apartment buildings. "I was so nervous 
during the game, I was shaking. I drank 20 cups of beer to calm down. But now, 
let's drink! Let's drink!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the Girl From Ipanema restaurant, the birthplace of the famous song of the 
same name, Gloria Regina was in tears, kissing a piece of green-and-gold ribbon 
she had pulled down from the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that comes close to this is the birth of my daughter," she 
said as the crowd yelled "Champion! Champion!" 
</P>
<P>
 On Rio's famous Ipanema, Copacabana and Flamengo beaches, singing and chanting 
men, women and children danced in glee to the sounds of samba emanating from 
bands atop huge sound trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's Tijuca neighborhood, throngs gathered under a huge canopy of 
streamers, singing samba songs along with the national anthem.  
</P>
<P>
 In Sao Paulo, a city of 17 million, more than 200,000 celebrated on Avenida 
Paulista under skies filled with brilliant fireworks. In Belo Horizonte, 
thousands clogged the city square, dancing beneath a 20-foot-tall stage to a 
large, colorful samba band. 
</P>
<P>
 In the northeastern resort city of Fortaleza, more than 20,000 people gathered 
along the shore, dancing into the night. Throughout the nation, cars raced up 
and down city arteries, drivers honking their horns while their passengers 
waved large Brazilian flags from the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 And everywhere, huge fireworks explosions punctuated the night air. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration actually began hours before the game began. Fireworks began 
early in the afternoon, and an hour before the game, many Brazilians donned 
green and gold, the country's national colors, and headed for restaurants and 
bars throughout the country. 
</P>

 In Rio, on nearly every corner, the salute was " Brasil ! Brasil !" Some 
became so excited that they became sick, most due to high blood pressure. 
Hospitals in Rio reported a 30% jump in the number of patients coming to their 
emergency room, almost all related to the World Cup.

ITALY SEES ONLY A CUP HALF EMPTY; REACTION: CITY STREETS, GATHERING PLACES 
DESERTED AS NATION MOURNS TEAM'S LOSS TO BRAZIL. 
</P>

<P>
 A funereal silence shrouded Italy's city streets, beach resorts and 
countryside Sunday as Italians mourned their soccer team's loss to Brazil in 
the World Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Small pockets of cheers resounded around the Brazilian Embassy in downtown 
Rome, while huge crowds of disillusioned Italians walked away from the piazzas 
and stadiums of Italy where the game was shown live on huge television screens. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few celebrations that could be heard during the otherwise silent 
night was at the Brazilian Embassy, where a jubilant crowd of Brazilian soccer 
fans watched the game in an overflowing auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Customary television talk shows after the game showed a brief panorama of 
deserted city piazzas and streets pocked with police ready for the crowds that 
failed to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 The city centers of Naples, Turin and Palermo were scenes of desolation after 
the match, with nothing but empty beer cans and broken bottles to mark the 
passage of thousands of eager, hopeful fans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rome's central Piazza del Popolo, the giant screen that had shown every 
Italian game to thousands of fans broke down Sunday night, causing a massive 
protest by a crowd of about 15,000 spectators, some of whom clashed with police 
before dispersing to other makeshift television setups. The city water company 
had turned off the water supply for those fountains that could become impromptu 
swimming pools for would-be revelers. 
</P>
<P>
 While many Italians had gone away to watch the game at weekend hide-outs and 
resorts, others had flocked back to city homes to see their team play what 
Italian Soccer Federation president Antonio Matarrese called "one of the most 
exciting World Cup finals." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the first time the World Cup was won on penalty kicks," he pointed 
out in an interview from Los Angeles. "And perhaps it would be a good idea to 
abolish this system."  
</P>
<P>
 Azeglio Vicini, the Italian national team coach of 1990, said, "We watched it 
with our hearts in our mouths." 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts showed little surprise, however, at the travails of the suffering 
Italian team, several members of which played injured. "The team was in 
disastrous physical condition," said Gianni Rivera, a former national team 
player. "The result was not unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus was that Italy had achieved an honorable second place against a 
more aggressive, fitter team. "To reach the finals in this World Cup was 
already a remarkable achievement for Italy," was the upbeat comment from Enzo 
Bearzot, who coached the victorious 1982 national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former national great Paolo Rossi: "Brazil is a stronger team and Italy's 
is an honorable second place, but it grieves me to see a World Cup final 
decided on the basis of penalty kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's honor was its strong defense, rather than its attack, which showed, 
according to another former national team player, Roberto Rosato, that "we 
were, in effect, the second team of the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Italian defense was great, but Brazil deserved to win -- they had more 
chances to score," said one fan, Marco D'Arro. "But I'm very, very sad just the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Arrigo Sacchi came under predictable criticism from soccer experts and 
fans for not substituting attacker Giuseppe Signori, leading goal scorer in 
Italy's national championships, at least in the final, decisive minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 As disconsolate and weeping fans went home with their banners and flags still 
furled, newspapers were coming out with their disappointed headlines: "Shot 
Down Only on the Penalty Kicks," said the Turin daily La Stampa. . . . "Thanks 
Just the Same," said the Roman left-wing newspaper L'Unita.

DANA HILLS USES BASS TO KICK SOME HABITS; FOOTBALL: CONSULTANT HOPES TO PUT ONE 
ASPECT OF THE HIGH SCHOOL VARSITY TEAM ON SOLID FOOTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after accepting the job as football coach at Dana Hills High in January, 
Trace Deneke assembled the returning varsity players for a look-see. 
</P>
<P>
 Deneke called the meeting more for an informal introduction rather than a 
structured evaluation session. On meeting his charges, however, Deneke realized 
the Dolphins' talent might not allow him to pursue the power game plan he would 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Scott Covington, last season's starting quarterback, will be 
attending Miami this fall. The quarterback who might take over is less than a 
grizzled veteran, having thrown one pass in a varsity game. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dana Hills was only 1-9 with Covington in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 So facing questions about power and skill, Deneke figured he better find an 
area in which Dana Hills had a fighting chance to produce points consistently 
-- and help itself in the battle for field position in the South Coast League. 
He believes he has: The kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the tutelage of private kicking consultant David Bass, Deneke has 
seen rapid improvement in his kickers' skills. Although the season's opening 
kickoffs are more than a month and a half away, Deneke expects a major boost 
from the Dolphins' kicking game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to be able to beat people every week with our offense or stop 
them every week with our defense," Deneke said recently. "But we think our 
kicking game is something we can count on week in and week out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping our kicking game will be our equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass, Deneke said, makes such optimism possible. 
</P>
<P>
 An assistant coach at Palomar College in San Marcos, Bass is well versed in 
the world of competitive football. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Tom, is a former NFL coach, and Dave has worked at every level of 
the sport from high school to the pros. Currently, Bass is special teams 
coordinator and linebacker coach at Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
 It is through Bass' coaching at Palomar that Deneke learned of his work with 
kickers. Deneke, who formerly coached at Encinitas San Dieguito High, said Bass 
is known in San Diego County for developing standout kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a tremendous reputation," Deneke said. "He has a keen eye for an area 
most football coaches know little about. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have that type of knowledge and ability to instruct so close, I just felt 
I had to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Deneke contacted Bass shortly after his initial inspection and asked for 
consultation, which Bass was eager to provide. The job was exactly what Bass 
was looking for, especially since he just formed a company, KickBass, to offer 
private instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kicking is a very psychological position," Bass said. "Some coaches try to 
coach kickers like inside linebackers, and that's not going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard horror stories about coaches grabbing kickers' face masks right 
before they head out to attempt (last-second) kicks and screaming, 'You better 
not miss this!' You have to understand kickers, and I bring that experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass conducted a private clinic for Dana Hills kicker Eric Knip and punter 
Scott Maynard on July 6, and they attended another clinic he operated for 
several clients July 8-10 in San Diego. Knip and Maynard gave rave reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," Knip said. "He helped me a lot in every aspect of kicking." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Maynard: "It was really beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Knip, who will be a senior, handled the majority of kickoffs, field-goal and 
point-after attempts for Dana Hills last season. Knip, though, said he had no 
clue of how to kick properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I learned about kicking, I learned from (Bass) in a few days," 
Knip said. "He completely changed my form. He showed me how to approach the 
ball, how to lock my leg properly, how to make sure I was taking the correct 
angles. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever showed me how to do that before." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Maynard, also a senior this year, found out how much he did not 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had any punting instruction," said Maynard, who might also start 
at quarterback. "It's not too often you get instruction in high school. 
Sometimes when you do get instruction, it's from guys who have never kicked 
before trying to tell you what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Bass agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most coaches never played the position so they have no practical experience," 
Bass said. "At most points in a kicker's career, he's not going to have coaches 
who understand the intricacies of the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to my approach to coaching kickers is an extremely common sense 
approach. I don't come in and say, 'This is how you have to do it. . . . I just 
say, 'This is nature.' Once you show them, hopefully it works and they believe 
what you're saying." 
</P>
<P>
 They are believers at Dana Hills.

ANGUISH -- AND RELIEF -- FOR HUBER FAMILY; REACTION: 'IT'S BEEN A HORRIBLE 
THREE YEARS,' FATHER SAYS, BUT NOW THE SEARCHING IS OVER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The question that haunted Dennis and Ione Huber for three years has been 
answered. And although they finally learned their missing daughter, Denise 
Anette Huber, is dead, there was a feeling of profound relief Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very thankful that we have an answer," said 51-year-old Ione Huber. "We 
needed that, even though it wasn't the answer that we wanted to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Their home filled with family and friends, the couple was composed as they sat 
in their living room Sunday afternoon and spoke of what they called the 
"agonizing roller coaster" that began when their 23-year-old daughter vanished 
on June 3, 1991, while on her way home from a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a horrible three years," said Dennis Huber, 55. "It's always on 
your mind, and you go through so many frustrations. You wonder if she's OK and 
what she's going through. There's not a day that I didn't think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's search for their only daughter ended Saturday, when they learned 
that Denise's frozen body was discovered in a stolen truck in Arizona, and 
former Orange County resident John Joseph Famalaro was arrested in connection 
with her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically the best of a bad situation," Dennis Huber said. "We have a 
body with clues and someone is in custody. That's better than just finding a 
skeleton." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the certainty of her death, Dennis Huber had continued to search for 
Denise in crowds, on the freeway and around the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still had that hope that we would find her alive, I didn't give that up," 
he said. "So it's a big shock to know that it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother said that as the weeks stretched into months, then into years, she 
began to accept the fact that Denise probably was dead. Still, she was 
tormented by the mystery of it all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers, with the help of police, family, friends and scores of volunteers, 
had launched an extensive publicity campaign seeking clues to Denise's 
disappearance. They appeared on television shows, hired private detectives and 
psychics and raised a $10,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign included bumper stickers, billboards and banners asking for help. 
The most prominent banner bearing Denise's likeness continued to hang on Sunday 
near the place on the Corona del Mar Freeway where her car was found. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for that banner to come down now that we have the answer," Ione 
Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the most crucial question has been answered, the Hubers still await 
more information on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still a lot of questions in our minds," the father said. "How did 
she die? How did she get into (Famalaro's) possession? We want to know all of 
the things that happened between the day she disappeared and when she was 
found." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber said he remains bitter that no witnesses ever came forward with 
information after his daughter's disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a busy freeway like that, I find it hard to believe that no one saw 
anything," he said. "I think someone saw what happened, but they just don't 
want to get involved. Those people are almost as guilty as who did this. I 
can't stand that people can be indifferent to their fellow man." 
</P>
<P>
 But the family, which also includes a son, 24-year-old Jeff Huber, his wife 
and 21-month-old daughter, said they are grateful to those who stood by them, 
particularly members of the Aliso Creek Presbyterian Church in Aliso Viejo, 
where they worship and attended services Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "These three years have been difficult, but people have been so great," Ione 
Huber said. "We appreciate the prayers and support we got from so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers believe it was "God's plan" that their impending move back to their 
native North Dakota was delayed a month for reasons unrelated to their 
daughter's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't understand why the move got pushed back a month," Ione Huber 
said. "But this was why. Now we will be able to close this chapter and move on. 
This will help us to have a fresh start." 
</P>
<P>
 They said that only after their daughter is buried will they be able to turn 
their full attention to the suspect, Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they both want to see Famalaro, if tried and convicted, 
sentenced to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just pray for justice," Ione Huber said. "So much pain and suffering has 
been caused by this. (The killer) has snuffed out a life, and execution is the 
only justice that I can think of." 
</P>
<P>
 The family said they are planning to hold a memorial service in Orange County, 
although a date and time have not yet been determined. Then, after they are 
given possession of their daughter's body, they will have a funeral for her in 
South Dakota, where she will be buried next to her beloved paternal 
grandfather, Edward Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to make me angry not to have a grave to visit," Dennis Huber said. 
"Now we'll have that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll miss her forever. She was everything to us."

FROZEN BODY MIGHT NOT SOLVE ALL MYSTERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The temperature outside sizzled at 109 degrees as the Yavapai County Sheriff's 
undercover narcotics agent crept into the dark interior of the stolen Ryder 
rental truck looking for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But inside the truck was a top-loading freezer humming quietly. And in its 
contents, a gruesome discovery: a young woman face down and hunched over at the 
waist, her naked body swathed in layers of dark garbage bags, her features 
frozen in icy perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 Fingerprints identified the woman as Denise A. Huber, missing three years from 
her Newport Beach home. But, forensics experts say, the cold that preserved her 
identity may forever obscure when the 23-year-old was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no way to tell if the body has been properly preserved at the 
time of death," said Dr. Cyril Wecht, a Pittsburgh pathologist who was 
post-mortem consultant in the cases of John F. Kennedy and Elvis Presley. "When 
you allow the body to thaw it doesn't necessarily bring it back to that time in 
the post-mortem biological clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Coroners who have dealt with frozen remains in northern states say it is not 
unusual to find bodies maintained in near-perfect condition under winter ice 
and snow or in the frozen depths of lakes. But the corpses still leave many 
questions unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic pathologists say microscopic clues may show whether Huber had been 
partially thawed at one point and moved or whether she had been sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maricopa County Coroner has said there was no indication of sexual assault 
nor any sense of when Huber was murdered by a series of blows to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we don't when she was killed or where she was killed," said 
Laurie Berra, Yavapai County Sheriff's Department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wecht said coroner's investigators may be able to determine from the contents 
of Huber's stomach if she was killed immediately after she was abducted or died 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can find out from her family or friends if she ate a certain kind of 
food at a certain time, say an egg roll," Wecht said. "If death occurred a 
short time afterward and she was frozen immediately, the egg roll will still be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Notman, a Minneapolis paleoradiologist, said under the right conditions 
bodies can remain frozen in near-perfect conditions for dozens of years. Notman 
said he helped unearth the bodies of three men who perished during the Franklin 
Expedition 145 years ago while attempting to cross the Arctic Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had been preserved by the permafrost all that time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Notman said pathologists can sometimes determine if a body had been thawed 
at one point in time by looking at cell breakage. When a body is frozen and 
thawed, Notman said, blood cells rupture and leak intracellular fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 There might also be small signs of decomposition, particularly if the 
intestines and stomach were full at the time of death. But Notman said it would 
be difficult to determine whether the body began to decompose before the 
freezing or during some thawing point -- such as when it was moved from one 
place to another. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Nelson, the Lewis and Clark County coroner in Helena, Mont., said 
bodies his department has found after a winter's freeze have remained near 
perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a plane crash up on a mountain, and they weren't able to get up there 
for two months," Nelson said. "As soon as they thawed out, we had virtually no 
problem identifying them. We just left them out at room temperature." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said incidents in the near-freezing lakes of northern Montana have 
proven that bodies can remain in icy suspension for years. One man who fell off 
a boat into the 37-degree deep of Holter Lake about 10 years ago, Nelson said, 
floated to the surface perfectly preserved two years after he disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The identification was accomplished without dental work," Nelson said. "He 
never froze, but he was under optimal conditions."

POLICE DIG FOR BODIES IN HUBER CASE; INVESTIGATION: ARIZONA HOME OF SUSPECT IN 
DEATH OF O.C. WOMAN IS SEARCHED FOR POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL VICTIMS. POLICE SAY 
EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THE WORK OF A SERIAL KILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Costa Mesa and Arizona authorities were digging for more possible victims 
Sunday at the country-club home of a 37-year-old house painter charged in the 
murder of Denise A. Huber, whose frozen body was found in a stolen rental truck 
parked in the suspect's driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the continuing search of John Joseph Famalaro's hilltop 
property in this affluent community was partly due to police finding evidence 
at the house suggesting the work of a "serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said the discovery of Huber's checkbook, 
purse, identification cards and the near-flawlessly preserved body is 
consistent with murderers who keep personal mementos or bodies as "trophies of 
their killings." 
</P>
<P>
 A special canine unit from Utah discovered "two points of interest" late 
Sunday inside the home, said Yavapai Sheriff's Lt. Kathleen McLaughlin. Two 
cadaver-sniffing dogs from the Rocky Mountain Rescue Team began brushing their 
paws up against two places in the downstairs portion of the home, prompting 
authorities to plan a possible excavation inside the house starting today, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know what might be there," McLaughlin said. "This case is so unique 
there might be others (bodies). . . . At the very least, this could be more 
disturbing for the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Also of particular concern to law enforcement officials is an existing, 
partial excavation in a lower cellar area in Famalaro's split-level home next 
to the Prescott County Club. Authorities were digging in that area Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what we're going to find," Smith said, as authorities -- some 
donning surgical masks -- removed thousands of paint cans and other material 
from Famalaro's cluttered home early Sunday. "I hope we don't find anything, 
but I wouldn't be surprised if we've got something here." 
</P>
<P>
 In an investigation that Smith and others described as reaching a "new height 
of bizarre," Huber's nude body was found Wednesday inside a freezer chest 
wrapped in layers of plastic trash bags. The freezer was plugged into an 
extension cord that ran from the Ryder rental truck inside Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy showed that Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared in June, 1991, 
died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the Maricopa County 
medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber appeared to suffer at least half a dozen blows to the head from a blunt 
object with "sharpened" edges, police said. No murder weapon has been 
recovered. Smith said it could not immediately be determined whether Huber had 
been sexually assaulted. But the body was so well preserved, Smith said, that 
authorities had little trouble lifting fingerprints from Huber's hands to make 
a positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the corpse was frozen, Yavapai County Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie 
Berra said, forensic experts are having a difficult time determining exactly 
when Huber died. It is possible that time of death may never be determined, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to think that (death) was immediate," Berra said. "I don't like 
to think of her being toted around for three years as somebody's slave." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held on $250,000 bond, charged with murder and felony theft 
in connection with the stolen Ryder rental truck, which authorities believe he 
rented in January from a franchise in Orange County. According to records, 
Famalaro had worked as a painting contractor based in Irvine using the name 
Maintenance Doctor. He also used a Lake Forest mailing address. Famalaro moved 
from Lake Forest to Dewey within the past year to be near his parents and help 
care for his father, who reportedly has Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The case has been referred to the Yavapai County Grand Jury for further 
investigation and a preliminary hearing has been tentatively set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County district attorney's office has been in contact with Costa 
Mesa police in Arizona about the investigation. It remains unclear what role 
the office will play. "We have to see how this unfolds," said Chief Assistant 
Dist. Atty. Maury Evans. "It's a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 The grim discovery last week marked the end of Orange County's most baffling 
missing person case, which began three years ago when Huber disappeared after 
attending a rock concert at the Forum in Inglewood. Her blue, 1988 Honda Accord 
was found the next morning on a shoulder of the Corona del Mar freeway in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's parents, who spearheaded a massive and enduring search effort, 
appeared to be shaken Sunday. The family recently announced their intention to 
leave the state where they had raised their daughter to move to North Dakota.

 "We're glad we finally have an answer," Ione Huber said at the family's 
Newport Beach home. "We were praying for an answer for a very long time. But 
this is not the kind of answer we were praying for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they had never heard of Famalaro before the discovery of their 
daughter's body and had no plans to travel to Arizona as the investigation 
continues. The family has found some comfort in reports from authorities, who 
believe that the 23-year-old victim died quickly after her abduction three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sign of torture, and she did not appear to be malnourished," Lt. 
Smith said. "That would mean to me that she died very soon after she was picked 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Hubers were finally free to grieve for their long-lost daughter, 
another family -- the Famalaros -- was in the Yavapai County Jail waiting room 
wrapped in a different kind of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hearts are breaking over this," said Anne Famalaro, the suspect's mother. 
She was accompanied by the suspect's father, Angelo Famalaro, who appeared ill 
and extremely weak. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the kind of people who keep to ourselves," the mother said. "We're 
conservative Christian people. I believe in Jesus, and He will pull us through 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who lives next door to her son in a fashionable golf course 
community and reportedly owns the split-level house now surrounded by police 
crime-scene tape, described her son simply as "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, you must understand," she said at the jail, "I shouldn't say anything 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 About her son's business, Famalaro said only that she knew he was attempting 
to sell the thousands of cans of paint and other materials that investigators 
moved into the home's driveway. At one point Sunday, law-enforcement officers 
called in a hazardous-materials team to sift through the paint and other 
potentially toxic solvents and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was arrested Wednesday after authorities were alerted to the Ryder 
truck sitting in the driveway, determined it was stolen and found Huber's body 
in a freezer chest in the back of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who alerted police was Marvin Fields, an Irvine businessman who was 
trying to close a deal with Famalaro at the suspect's house, authorities said. 
Fields became suspicious when he spotted the extension cord from the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview Sunday, Fields confirmed that he had called police but 
declined to comment about what he had seen. "I think it's best to follow the 
lead of the police and not say anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields said he had been aware of the Huber case. "I'm sure they (family) are 
glad to finally know." 
</P>
<P>
 Berra said Famalaro initially cooperated with investigators until they began 
questioning him about what was inside the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "He immediately asked to have an attorney represent him after that," Berra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In short order, defense attorney Larry Katz, well-known locally for his 
combative courtroom style, was representing the lanky defendant, who is 
described as approximately 6 feet, 1 inch tall and weighing about 150 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jail officials said Sunday that no one could visit Famalaro other than family 
members or his legal defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody sees him unless Mr. Katz clears it," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent events have shaken this city, a suburb of Prescott, which Money 
magazine recently rated as one of America's most attractive places to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can go weeks and weeks telling reporters that there is no news to report 
here," Berra said, adding that there were six murders reported in Yavapai 
County last year. "This isn't like Los Angeles or Phoenix. Crime is minimal 
here. I don't think we've ever had a drive-by shooting. This is really shaking 
some people up." 
</P>
<P>
 For Costa Mesa's Lt. Smith, the dark details of the Huber case have been his 
life's work over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end here, ranks as kind of weird any way you put it," he said. "This was 
the biggest case of my career. I lived this case. I became close to the family. 
I'm glad she has been found, but I'm not happy about the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every anniversary of her disappearance has been emotional for me. You think 
of what you could have done differently. But I don't think we could have done 
anything more." 
</P>

CUP MANIA ENDS SOCCER WORLD'S DOUBT ABOUT U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It was the World Cup the world had had its doubts about, staged in the only 
nation on earth that supposedly didn't give a hoot about the sport. But as the 
clock ran out Sunday on the raucous, filled-to-capacity finale between Italy 
and Brazil, it was the United States that scored the upset in the planet's 
eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 As the old-moneyed streets of Pasadena swarmed body to body with conga lines 
of soccer fans, the championship playoffs that had set world records for 
skepticism topped the popularity charts instead. Movie stars jockeyed with 
Mexican laborers for a berth in the Rose Bowl. Scalpers were hawking tickets 
marked down to $1,000 a pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Schwarzenegger and Vice President Al Gore and Silvio Berlusconi, the 
Italian premier, were there. So was a New York construction worker bearing a 
three-foot-tall statue of St. Anthony of Padua. There were girls from Ipanema 
and Mercedes Benzes wrapped in Italian flags. There was a guy dressed as Uncle 
Sam, begging for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Every third person on the face of the Earth -- an estimated 2 billion viewers 
-- was believed to have watched Sunday's playoff game, which was beamed by 
satellite to 120 nations. No other event -- not the opening ceremonies of the 
last Olympics, not the Royal Wedding, not the landing of the first man on the 
moon -- has ever been seen by so many eyes at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance, too, was unprecedented, despite the stiff ticket prices. In all, 
the 52-game series drew about 3.5 million fans, surpassing previous World Cup 
attendance records. For soccer enthusiasts, the biggest surprise was that 
two-thirds of those tickets were sold in the United States, a nation notable 
mainly for its tepidity toward the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been fantastic for this country," said Bob D'Alessio, a native of 
Italy who traveled from his adopted home of Florida to be at Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the foreigners who have been buying the tickets. When you look 
around, you see a lot of kids in the stands. Those are the ones who will keep 
it going." 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer, wildly popular in most of the civilized world, has historically been a 
sports stepchild in the United States. It is baseball that has been this 
nation's "national pastime" and football that has aroused the passions of its 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 So when it was announced that the 1994 World Cup would be played in the United 
States, the world reaction was skeptical; even after the games opened June 17 
to huge crowds, one international sports columnist gently mocked the 
indiscriminate cheering among Americans for "a game they do not understand 
between two nations of which they have not heard." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help that an American football hero was arrested for a double murder 
on the opening day of the event. As that case unraveled live on national TV, 
the split was a metaphor for Yankee tunnel vision -- here was America riveted 
to O.J. Simpson, and here was the rest of the planet glued to the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But as world enthusiasm mounted, sports fans looked to their roots, and 
Southern California's immigrant communities rallied en masse. Businessmen from 
the suburbs showed up at the Rose Bowl with their faces painted to look like 
the Swedish flag. High school kids in Huntington Park rioted in the streets 
when the Mexican team took to the fields. Central American housekeepers -- 
whose nations were not even among the 24 who competed in the games -- packed 
the stands anyway, rooting for whatever Latin American team was in town. 
</P>
<P>
 And die-hard Americans found that they, too, could cheer, after the U.S. team 
scored a surprise victory over Colombia and made it into the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 The momentum built despite suffocating heat, scandal and tragedy. At one game, 
the temperature on the field at the Rose Bowl soared to 120 degrees. Another 
saw Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona stuck in the stands after banned drugs 
were found in his system. Still another game began with a moment of silence in 
memory of Andres Escobar, the Colombian player who was assassinated in Medellin 
after the top-ranked team returned home in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In another country, perhaps, interest would have dropped off as the one team 
after another was eliminated. But, oddly, fans only cheered harder as the 
finalists were winnowed down to two. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sunday's game got under way, aerial views of the stadium were patchy with 
the bright colors of the Brazilian and Italian flags; but a close inspection 
revealed that the Rose Bowl crowd was as polyglot as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Langan, a 39-year-old writer from Dublin, came toting a sign that said 
"Brazilians are Irish with tans." Arturo Cerna of El Salvador -- waving a sign 
pleading, "TICKETS?" -- worked the crowd outside the stadium while yelling at 
the top of his lungs: "Salvador, Brazil! Salvador, Brazil!" 
</P>
<P>
 The massive, inflated black-and-white soccer balls bedecking the stadium were 
covered with the scribbled graffiti of a hundred lands: Javier Correra, 
Guayaquil, Ecuador. Brigid, Paris. Wakko, Japan. Sergio Santini, Roma. 
Meanwhile, as the band struck a pre-game chorus of "La Bamba," scores of 
gyrating fans were joined by a couple dressed in the day's most cross-cultural 
garb -- giant ersatz cans of Coke. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love events, I'm partial to decadence," said Eric Squire, a University of 
San Francisco law student who ducked out of a bachelor party at dawn to make 
his plane down to Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Most Americans don't realize that, 
and they won't until it's over. You don't get this sort of genuine enthusiasm 
at any U.S. sporting event.' 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a sellout crowd at the 91,794-capacity Rose Bowl, demand for tickets 
persisted well beyond kickoff time. When the series opened, tickets for the 
last three games were available only as part of a package that cost up to 
$2,500; individual tickets did not go on public sale until July 5. Face values 
for tickets to the final game ran from $180 to $475, but they swiftly 
disappeared, and prices began to inflate. 
</P>
<P>
 As game time approached Sunday, ticket holders milled around the stadium 
entrances, hawking extras at 200% markups, then dropping their prices as the 
morning waned. By the game's end, Pasadena police reported, eight people had 
been arrested for scalping outside the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans, meanwhile, held out for last-minute bargains, hoping that the scalpers 
would get desperate after kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe, after the game starts, I can get a ticket cheap," hoped Tato Duran, 
who paced outside the stadium with a Brazilian flag around his waist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else can they do with them? Eat them for lunch?" 
</P>
<P>
 By game time, however, it was clear that, as with so much in America, the 
tickets were going where the money was. As play got under way, scores of fans 
who were not lucky enough to get them clamored around a TV in a booth outside 
Gate A, straining for a glimpse of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a dozen fans pushed over a trash can and climbed on top, just to 
get a better look at the game on the small screen, while a gaggle of 
drum-beating Brazilian fans danced around the can. 
</P>
<P>
 While thousands more meandered around outside the stadium, looking lost, the 
stands within the Rose Bowl were studded with celebrities -- Gore, 
Schwarzenegger, former President George Bush, actor Dustin Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the championship of the world was at stake, the mood at first was less 
raucous than at some earlier contests, perhaps because of the hoity-toity 
crowd. But when Italy's Roberto Baggio overshot his penalty kick in the game's 
key, final moment, soccer's legendary passion overcame even the blue-blood set 
-- fans on both sides burst into tears and began to sob. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, Andrew Bettene, a San Francisco resident who is a native of Sao 
Paulo, Brazil, attributed the relative restraint to the "big-money crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid $450 a piece for these tickets. Big-money people don't make big noise. 
If you want to see the excitement, check out the TVs in some of the local 
bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even before the bars on Old Pasadena's Colorado Boulevard opened at 10 
a.m., the lines were already a block long. As those without big money and hot 
tickets settled for small screens and cold beer, every club and restaurant on 
the historic thoroughfare filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mendoza, 27, of Whittier, joined a group of cheering Brazilian fans 
inside the 35er bar. He said he cheered first for the United States, then for 
Mexico and finally for Brazil to "support my Latino brothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inside Q's, 10 billiard tables sat abandoned as the crowd watched a 
bank of TV sets tuned to a Spanish-language station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Old World versus the New World," exulted Bill Martin Jr., 29, of 
Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the Americas versus Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The bar crowds -- who celebrated prodigiously but peacefully last week after 
Brazil won the semifinals at the Rose Bowl -- continued the tradition of 
affable revelry as Sunday afternoon wore on. Colorado Boulevard was partially 
blocked off as hordes of triumphant fans continued to pour into the street 
hours after the game ended, kicking soccer balls three stories into the air, 
gyrating down the sidewalks in impromptu conga lines, beating drums and 
breaking into wild renditions of Brazil's national dance, the samba. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours after the final soccer kick at the Rose Bowl, people were still 
arriving in Old Pasadena -- about 20,000 by 7:30 p.m. Rafael Jacinto, 29, of 
Scottsdale, Ariz., was so exhausted from partying that he lay flat on his back 
in the street, using a Brazilian flag as a beach mat, and weakly tooted a horn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm dead tired," he said. "I'm going to rest a little bit, then I'll party 
all night." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, revelers marched down Colorado Boulevard with a half-block-long 
green-and-yellow banner, the Brazilian colors. The banner soon became a rope 
for a giant game of tug-of-war, and finally, the crowd began ripping it to 
pieces for souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the crowd was Macsuara, 36, a shaman from the Kadiweu tribe in the 
Amazon region, who had reportedly blessed the team before before their first 
playoff game in the U.S. Wearing a head dress of toucan and macaw feathers, his 
face striped with paint, he shook a metal rattle as the crowd danced around 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some fans spritzed the crowd with champagne from the balconies as shirtless 
young men waited, open-mouthed, below. At one corner, two women appeared in a 
second-story window wearing one yellow "Brasil" T-shirt with two holes cut for 
their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ole, ole, ole, ole -- Bra- sil ! Bra- sil !" the crowd yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, law enforcement officers -- who patrolled Old Pasadena aggressively 
during the past month for violations of alcoholic beverage control laws -- 
maintained a close watch. By early evening, 44 people had been arrested on 
charges ranging from assault with a deadly weapon to gambling and reckless 
driving and public intoxication, according to Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary 
Schander. 
</P>
<P>
 Both on the streets and in the stadium, security was the tightest yet for this 
World Cup, with uniformed police officers stationed every 20 feet in the bowl. 
Several hundred sheriff's deputies, on foot and horseback, patrolled the crowd, 
some of them with video cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Security preparations, 18 months in the making, had been considered of 
paramount importance. U.S. apathy notwithstanding, soccer fans in other 
countries have been known to let their passions get the best of them, and past 
games have erupted in lethal rioting. 
</P>
<P>
 But as game after game passed without serious incident -- no matter how 
agonizing the defeat or how thrilling the victory -- the 1994 World Cup 
gradually became notable for its paucity of hooliganism. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun. No one's giving us a hard time," said Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Deputy Joe Martinez, as he kept tabs on Sunday's Rose Bowl crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the revelry, the biggest question was whether soccer mania might finally 
catch on in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer brings everyone together," exulted Meire de Farias, a 28-year-old 
teacher from Sao Paulo, as she threw her arms into the air and danced her way 
out of the stadium after Brazil's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope the Americans will come to love soccer like we do." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian columnist Alberto Helena Jr. remained skeptical, but predicted "at 
least an incremental interest" in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 But Magid Mazen, an Egyptian who now lives in Boston and who traveled across 
the country with his 11-year-old son to see the game, was substantially more 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the United States that won today," Mazen said. "Soccer has been born 
in the United States . . . (and) what makes me happiest is my son is here to 
share this with me. He is going to be a soccer fan and his children will be 
soccer fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Diane Bishop, a Beverly Hills fan, agreed. "I hope it takes off now, and I 
think it will," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Bishop added, she is sorry to see the World Cup come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a great party," she sighed. "The rest of the summer will be 
pretty boring after this."

MICROSOFT ACCORD REFLECTS LIMITS OF ANTITRUST LAW; BUSINESS: U.S. ATTORNEYS 
FOUND THEMSELVES PLAYING BRINKMANSHIP. SETTLEMENT MAY DO LITTLE TO SLOW GIANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM and JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 When government antitrust investigators began their probe of Microsoft Corp. 
back in 1989, they were almost laughably off target: They were looking into 
possible collusion between Microsoft and IBM Corp. just as the long 
relationship between the two firms was dissolving into a bitter feud. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Federal Trade Commission lawyers learned their way around the 
industry, they quickly found themselves awash in an ocean of discontent over 
Microsoft's business practices. Now, 4 1/2 years later, the most important 
antitrust probe in recent history has ended with a settlement, one that forces 
Microsoft to change some of its business practices but still leaves it sitting 
comfortably atop the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department staffers were celebrating what they viewed as a victory 
Sunday, sipping champagne at the home of department antitrust chief Anne K. 
Bingaman. Settlement talks had begun in June with a call from the Justice 
Department to Microsoft general counsel William Neukom -- "I think it was 
around Father's Day," Neukom recalled -- and ended Friday when Microsoft 
Chairman Bill Gates agreed to terms after a long phone discussion with 
Bingaman. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the rocky start of the government case against Microsoft now looks like a 
revealing sign of the difficulties involved in modern-day trust-busting. 
Instead of underscoring the Clinton Administration's strong commitment to 
antitrust enforcement, as Bingaman had intended, the case may have revealed the 
limits of antitrust law in the complex and fast-changing world of high-tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Government lawyers working for two different agencies gathered hundreds of 
thousands of documents from dozens of software companies over the years, and 
they ultimately painted a picture of Microsoft as a ruthless, sometimes 
unscrupulous monopolist. But when it came to bringing charges, they found 
themselves playing a highly politicized game of brinkmanship with Microsoft and 
its strong-willed chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, the Federal Trade Commission deadlocked over whether to bring charges. 
The Justice Department then picked up the case, but it was also of two minds. 
The settlement that was finally reached will do little to slow the Microsoft 
juggernaut, many in the industry say, and yet it still promises to shape the 
industry in many subtle ways. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was one Microsoft competitor especially determined to see the 
government "do something" about allegedly monopolistic practices, it was Novell 
Inc. The company's product family included a personal computer operating system 
that competed with Microsoft's dominant MS-DOS product. But even though the 
software was getting good reviews, it wasn't selling. 
</P>
<P>
 A big reason seemed to be Microsoft's "lockout" contracts, which provided 
heavy discounts to computer manufacturers that agreed to pay royalties for 
every machine they shipped whether or not they came with Microsoft software. 
Manufacturers thus had little interest in offering operating systems from 
companies like Novell. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell's avuncular chairman, Ray Noorda, was bitter about what he saw as 
Microsoft's predatory practices. When asked why he didn't sit down with Gates 
and resolve the increasingly bitter dispute between the two companies, he 
replied: "To have a heart-to-heart with someone, you need two hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 With the FTC's interest, industry complaints against Microsoft crystallized 
into a strong alliance. In September, 1992, Novell met with 10 other angry 
Microsoft competitors to coordinate lobbying efforts and assure that the FTC 
had enough evidence to expand its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the group was Carlsbad-based Stac Electronics, which had just sued 
Microsoft for selling so-called file compression software that was similar to 
software that Stac had proposed licensing to Microsoft. Stac recently won a 
lawsuit over the incident, and Microsoft agreed to pay $20 million in damages 
and invest in Stac shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1992, the FTC investigation was bolstered with a controversial bit of 
research. Andrew Schulman, a Cambridge-based programmer, contended in a book 
that Microsoft had secretly embedded special error messages in its Windows 
software to make it appear incompatible with Novell's competing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft denied the charges, claiming that the error messages were only put 
in to warn users that Windows hadn't been tested for compatibility with 
operating systems other than MS-DOS. And Gates continued to insist publicly 
that he was unconcerned about the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I worried?," he told Business Week. "Do I worry about someone walking up 
and shooting me in the head? It's a possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, though, Microsoft was far less sanguine. The company hired a 
battery of powerful lawyers, including former FTC commissioner Patricia Baily, 
a close friend of FTC chairwoman Janet Steiger. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell and its allies wheeled out some big legal guns of their own. The lead 
attorney for Novell's law firm, Michael Sohn, was the FTC's general counsel 
during the Jimmy Carter Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, even as the investigation continued, Microsoft grew. It was rapidly 
gaining market share with products that ran better on its Windows operating 
system than that of competitors. Competitors again cried foul, arguing 
Microsoft unfairly uses its position in operating software, which controls 
basic PC functions, to compete in building applications like word processing 
and spreadsheets. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of 1993, the FTC staff believed it had enough evidence to 
file charges. There was little political support for broad charges that might 
be hard to prove -- this was, after all, one of America's most successful and 
admired companies, not to mention one of its biggest exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the staff felt confident in pursuing narrower measures, including a 
preliminary injunction barring Microsoft from offering the hated "lockout" 
contracts and preventing Microsoft from purposely creating incompatibilities 
between its software and other operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in February, 1993, the issue came to a vote at the FTC. But with one 
commissioner recusing himself over a possible conflict of interest, the FTC 
deadlocked, 2 to 2, on whether to bring charges. Gates had won the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's competitors weren't giving up. All spring and summer, lawyers for 
Novell, Lotus Development, Borland International, Sun Microsystems and even IBM 
trekked through the halls of the FTC, explaining why Microsoft should be 
contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates and his team of lawyers made their own visits to Washington to talk 
to the FTC commissioners, with mixed results. He impressed at least one of the 
commissioners, who found him "passionate" about his company. But he also 
managed to offend, calling another commissioner's ideas "communistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates' strongest argument? That Microsoft was a key source of growth in the 
American software industry and generated $2 billion a year in exports. Any 
shackles on the company would only open the gate for foreign competition. At a 
time when the Clinton Administration was experimenting with expensive 
industrial policies to get American industry up to speed, the argument was a 
potent one. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 21, the FTC split once again on the Microsoft case, and it seemed 
Gates had won for good. But a week later, urged on by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum 
(D-Ohio), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Department of Justice 
took an unusual step and asked the FTC for copies of its file on Microsoft. 
</P>

 Assistant Atty. Gen. Bingaman had been promising to strengthen the 
department's antitrust efforts, and Microsoft was a promising and high-profile 
case, albeit a risky one. Justice Department lawyers then spent months poring 
over more than 200 boxes of documents and 50 to 60 boxes of depositions 
received from the FTC. Bingaman also hired a prominent San Francisco antitrust 
lawyer named Sam Miller as outside counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 The antitrust division of the European Union joined in the negotiations, and 
half a dozen lawyers met in Brussels last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Justice Department was ready to deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a call in early June, I think it was around Father's Day, from a 
Justice Department staffer who proposed settlement talks and a few days later 
Anne Bingaman called; I was surprised," said Microsoft general counsel William 
Neukom. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, which had repeatedly insisted it wouldn't settle, abruptly changed 
tack when it discovered that the department had dropped many of the broader 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Justice Department didn't think there was a case to be made on those 
other claims . . . they seemed to be interested in getting this case out of the 
way and breaking the deadlock," said a source close to Microsoft.

BRAZIL BEATS ITALY FOR WORLD CUP IN DRAMATIC PENALTY-KICK SHOWDOWN; SOCCER: 
FIRST TOURNAMENT IN U.S. IS ALSO FIRST WITH CHAMPIONSHIP GAME THAT ENDS IN A 
SCORELESS TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a dramatic finish to the first World Cup in the United States, two teams 
with long and proud soccer traditions seemed to give everything they had for 
120 minutes in the Rose Bowl on Sunday. Then they were asked to give more to 
decide which would become the first four-time world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Brazil was rewarded, but the game was so close and the method of 
determining the winner so fickle that it would have been difficult for the 
crowd of 94,194 or the worldwide television audience estimated at 2 billion to 
find fault with Italy as champion. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the World Cup originated in 1930, the championship 
game ended in a scoreless tie as both teams, acknowledging their respect for 
each other, played cautiously for 90 minutes of regulation time and 30 minutes 
of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension then was turned up a notch as the weary teams engaged in a 
penalty-kick showdown, a controversial system of settling tie games that many 
coaches and players believe is as fair as roulette. Introduced into the World 
Cup in 1982, this was the first time it had ever been required for the final 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 With the grueling battle reduced to a game of chance, the gods of soccer 
anointed Brazil. Italy scored on only two of its five shots from the penalty 
spot 12 yards in front of the goal, eliminating the need for the Brazilians 
even to take their fifth shot after they had converted three of their first 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 The last man with a chance to keep the Italians alive was forward Roberto 
Baggio, who had scored five goals in his last three games to enhance his status 
as the nation's soccer hero. He did nothing to alter that Sunday, running all 
afternoon with a strained hamstring that had threatened to keep him on the 
sideline for the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came time for him to face Brazilian goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel in 
the shootout, Baggio was spent. His shot sailed high over the net. 
</P>
<P>
 While Brazilian players gathered in the middle of the field to celebrate, 
Baggio stood on the penalty spot with his head down for several long moments 
before sagging to one knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil is again No. 1," said the Brazilians' coach, Carlos Alberto Parreira, 
of their fourth championship, their first since Pele led them to titles in 
1958, '62 and '70. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, champions in 1934, '38 and '82, did not argue the point, but 
they knew that it could have just as easily been they who were holding the 
World Cup trophy at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only luck," Italian defender Luigi Appolloni said. "Unfortunately, it 
is more difficult to lose this way." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how the championship game is judged as a test of strategy, tactics 
and skill, soccer enthusiasts no doubt will conclude that the one-month, 
52-game World Cup -- played at nine sites in the United States -- was a triumph 
for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country with little soccer tradition, the total number of spectators was 
3,567,415. That is more than a million more than the previous record set four 
years ago in Italy. The average attendance also was a record, 68,604 as 
compared to 53,675 in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight games at the Rose Bowl attracted an average crowd of 89,478. Those 
who attended Sunday, including Vice President Al Gore and George and Barbara 
Bush, were treated to an American-style pregame ceremony that featured a 
flyover by Air Force jets, fireworks and six songs by Whitney Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they sat back in anticipation of a game that figured to have as many high 
notes as the one Kenny G hit with his alto sax near the end of the "The 
Star-Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not seem too much to ask. The first 51 games had produced considerably 
more action than there was in 1990 in Italy, a tournament so devoid of 
excitement that even the sports purists in the international soccer federation, 
FIFA, recognized that rule changes were necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes worked. Through Saturday's 4-0 victory by Sweden over Bulgaria in 
the consolation game at the Rose Bowl, 30 more goals had been scored than in 
Italy. More significantly, the ball was in motion seven minutes more per game. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither Italy nor Brazil was completely committed to the attack Sunday. 
Perhaps it was because the six previous games had taken their toll, or perhaps 
it was because of the heat on the field at the Rose Bowl, or perhaps it was 
because both teams were undermanned. While Baggio had the celebrated hamstring 
injury, another crucial Italian player, defender Franco Baresi, was playing 
only three weeks after undergoing arthroscopic knee surgery. Brazil lost one of 
its most versatile players, defender Jorginho, in the 21st minute. 
</P>
<P>
 If the game had been scored like a prizefight, the Brazilians would have won 
on points because they were more aggressive. But even they did not allow their 
midfielders and central defenders to advance in support of forwards Romario and 
Bebeto as often as usual in fear of the Italians' dangerous counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 There, however, was nothing very dangerous about the Italians on Sunday. They 
mustered only eight shots, two by Baggio. The Brazilians took 22, but no more 
than four tested Italian goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen minutes from the end of regulation time, a hard shot by midfielder 
Mauro Silva glanced off Pagliuca's hands and toward the goal. But the ball 
bounced harmlessly off the left post, which he gratefully kissed. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game was finally over, Parreira admitted, "It was not the most 
eloquent way to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto agreed, saying that it was "sad that the game was decided on penalty 
kicks." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, there will be no sad faces in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this lifts the morale of all of Brazil," he said. "The economics and 
financial picture there is bad. The lack of jobs and the poor children are a 
very big problem. I hope this victory will stimulate the government to improve 
the economic conditions."

FORCE OF COMET IMPACT AMAZES ASTRONOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The collision of a rogue comet and Jupiter is quickly unfolding as a fierce 
and sobering celestial cataclysm, astronomers around the world reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Keck Telescope in Hawaii captured images of two comet fragments exploding 
into giant, gaseous fireballs hotter than the surface of the sun. The Hubble 
Space Telescope photographed a 2,500-mile-wide mushroom cloud erupting hundreds 
of miles into space from a detonation more powerful than any nuclear weapon on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are all flabbergasted at what we are seeing," said planetary scientist 
Heidi B. Hammel, who is leading the team of scientists gathered in Maryland to 
analyze the images taken by NASA's space telescope. "We can be very glad that 
this comet was heading for Jupiter and not Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time humanity has seen a comet hit a planet, although many 
planetary experts believe that Earth -- like the other planets in the solar 
system -- has been hit thousands, if not millions, of times in eons past. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Sunday, seven clumps of comet debris had smashed into Jupiter at 
speeds in excess of 130,000 m.p.h. Another 14 major pieces of the shattered 
comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are expected to hit by Friday. At least four of the 
fragments nearing the planet are believed to be about two miles in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest fragment to hit so far -- a half-mile-wide ball of compacted ice 
and rock that struck Jupiter on Saturday -- released so much explosive energy 
that on Earth it would vaporize a city the size of Los Angeles in an instant, 
comet scientists said. At the same time, it would hurl enough dust and debris 
into the upper atmosphere to dangerously disrupt the world's climate, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and astronomers estimated the force of its impact at 10 million 
megatons of TNT. It left a spreading plume of hot gas and debris almost as big 
as Earth itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that had hit North America, it would probably be the worst natural 
disaster ever witnessed by man, and that's from the small fragment," said 
Eugene Shoemaker, co-discoverer of the comet. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest pieces, with a mass about 25 times greater, was expected to 
strike Jupiter early this morning. More than 200 major observatories were 
poised to record the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the World Cup of astronomy," said Stephen P. Maran, a senior 
scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, which is 
coordinating reports on the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the impacts occur on Jupiter's dark side, out of direct view of Earth. 
Therefore, almost nothing of the comet's violent interplay with Jupiter is 
visible to the naked eye or with the small telescopes used by many amateur 
comet watchers. Very little of the celestial fireworks is visible under normal 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional astronomers are relying on the artificial eyes that science has 
given them, discerning the true extent of the cataclysm by peering deep into 
the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths as the impact sites rotate out of 
shadow and into view of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the infrared photographs, conventional pictures of Jupiter taken 
through major telescopes this weekend show the impact sites as dark smears or 
splotches against the giant planet's candy-striped bands of ammonia clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists speculated Sunday that the dark material could be a fountain of 
dust and debris rocketing skyward from the disintegrating comet fragment. 
Others suggested it could be gases stirred up from deep within Jupiter's 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 But to the infrared sensors of the Keck, the Hubble and other telescopes, 
which are sensitive to the heat generated by each impact, the plumes stand out 
as white-hot blazes. Hammel said the temperature of the swirling gases at the 
center of each fireball could top 53,000 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Orton, a scientist from Pasadena's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who is 
observing the impacts through NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii, 
easily detected two of the impact sites. "I am very ecstatic," he said Sunday. 
"Witnessing this is kind of amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers at the South Pole observatory, which because of its unique 
location is able to keep Jupiter under continuous observation during the 
collisions, reported that they easily detected the plume from the first 
fragment that struck the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 From its site atop Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii, the Keck Telescope was 
expected to have the best view of the severe impact expected about 12:30 a.m. 
today. The Keck is the largest of the world's ground-based telescopes and was 
the only observatory Sunday to report having observed any traces of the second 
comet fragment, which hit Jupiter on Saturday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw a distinctive signature of the plume," said James Graham, an 
astronomer from UC Berkeley who is a principal investigator at the W. M. Keck 
Observatory. "It surprises us how bright these impacts are." 
</P>
<P>
 Astronomers suspect that the second fragment may have been fainter than the 
first because it might have been a more loosely compacted swarm of gravel and 
ice crystals -- a flying rubble pile -- that exploded high above Jupiter's 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first and second fragments looked equally big prior to the impact," said 
Maran at his base in Maryland. "The difference in the impacts might have been 
the difference between a real hard-packed snowball a nasty adult makes and the 
kind of loosely packed snowball a kid makes." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial observations suggest that the clouds spreading from each impact site 
may persist for weeks. "It looks pretty clear that this whole band of latitude 
around Jupiter will be pock-marked with these impact sites," Hammel said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most dramatic photo sequences recorded by the Hubble Space 
Telescope this weekend was a series of five images taken by its Wide 
Field/Planetary Camera, designed and built by JPL engineers, that shows the 
growth of a mushroom cloud from the first impact. The images were taken at 
three-minute intervals as the impact site rotated out of the dark side of 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 They profile the explosion as it erupted more than 600 miles above the 
planet's highest cloud layer, and "this knocked our socks off," Hammel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unconfirmed reports from observatories in Israel and western Massachusetts 
suggested that observers had been able to spot the lightning-like flash from at 
least one of the impacts, flaring near the planet's horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that other flashes could be visible to people with small 
telescopes," said David H. Levy, who helped discover the comet in March, 1993. 
"This is a red alert for amateur astronomers."

<P>
 It was the ultimate Southern California fantasy for a struggling young actor 
from the Midwest: a rent-free stay in the guest house of O.J. Simpson's 
multimillion-dollar Brentwood estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Kaelin, the tan, blond-mopped Hollywood hopeful better known as Kato, 
gave a tantalizing glimpse of that world when he testified during Simpson's 
preliminary hearing about the good fortune of finding discount accommodations 
in one of the city's toniest enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "To live in a star's guest house, especially for people who aren't from here, 
is like, oh God, the ultimate dream," said Jennifer Young, an aspiring Beverly 
Hills songstress and daughter of realtor-to-the-stars Elaine Young, who sold 
Simpson his Rockingham Avenue mansion in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 In a region where real estate is a measure of fame, where a mere ZIP code is 
nationally renowned for its cachet, guest houses have long permeated the 
mythology of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Garbo stayed in one during West Coast visits, as did a young Bill 
Clinton, who for years enjoyed a place in Brentwood owned by the parents of his 
longtime friend, Occidental College professor Derek Shearer. A guest house on 
John Barrymore's estate -- used by the cavorting Errol Flynn for many of his 
escapades -- is now home to Butterfield's, a trendy West Hollywood eatery. In 
the haunting 1950 movie "Sunset Boulevard," a down-on-his-luck screenwriter 
meets an untimely end when he accepts an apartment in the Mediterranean villa 
of an aging and demented silent film star, Norma Desmond. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to town and finding a guest house is a grand old Hollywood cliche," 
said one publicity-shy real estate agent. "It's as old as coming to town on a 
Greyhound bus and being discovered at Schwab's. The reality is you're probably 
going to end up in some dreadful sublet with plastic over the furniture, no air 
conditioning and lots of cottage cheese on the ceiling." 
</P>
<P>
 Rental agencies say they are deluged every day with calls for the treasured 
guest houses, pool houses and carriage houses that dot many large Westside 
estates. Some agencies devote more than half of their listings to such 
properties. An exclusive word-of-mouth network controls the choicest locales -- 
richly landscaped haciendas with hot tubs, tennis courts and panoramic views. 
</P>
<P>
 In more modest neighborhoods, such living quarters tend to be known as granny 
flats or, even more pointedly, bootleg garages. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Los Angeles' moneyed communities, from Hancock Park to Whitley Heights 
to Bel-Air Estates, guest houses represent a foothold in paradise -- a chance 
for Tinseltown wanna-bes to savor the amenities of success at a fraction of the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, why take a Pinto if you could have a Mercedes?" said the 
29-year-old Jennifer Young, whose friends pepper her for help in the guest 
house market. 
</P>
<P>
 David Lewman, a thirty-something comedy writer from Chicago, was lucky enough 
to score at least a Volvo of a place. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, he called his old friend, actress Lisa Darr, to announce that he 
was heading to Los Angeles to seek fame and fortune. Darr, who starred in the 
murder-mystery play "Tamara" and has appeared on TV's "Murphy Brown," "Wings" 
and "Northern Exposure," offered him the small cottage behind her rustic 
Sherman Oaks ranch house. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in my adult life, I have my own little house without 
anyone walking over me or walking under me," said Lewman, who is living off his 
dwindling savings and probably would have found himself in a seedy bachelor 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 For $500 a month, he gets full run of the onetime chicken farm, which features 
a Jacuzzi, hammock, fruit trees and lush garden patio, all shaded by a forest 
of towering pines. For her part, Darr enjoys the extra cash, as well as the 
security of knowing that a friend is always nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "The writer out in the guest house and the actress in the big house -- it's 
classic," Lewman said shortly after rushing out to audition for a beer 
commercial. "It's a cliche . . . but there's something very romantic about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Over in Hancock Park, on a 1920s-era Mediterranean-style estate not far from 
the Getty House, a coveted guest house with French windows has never failed to 
attract creative souls. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners, both retired veterans of the New York theater, have asked not to 
be identified because the rental unit violates city zoning law -- despite the 
fact that such codes seldom are enforced. But they take glee in recounting the 
tenants who later became celebrities, including Andy Summers, guitarist for The 
Police, and Patrick Stewart, Capt. Jean-Luc Picard of TV's "Star Trek: The Next 
Generation." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our place is the lucky guest house," said the family matriarch. "Every one of 
them has been our friends, except for one little snot." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, she said, was their first tenant back in the early '70s. A 
then-unknown musician, he agreed to teach guitar to their teen-age son in 
exchange for lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, she said, they rented the guest house to the niece of famed 
director-producer Sydney Pollack. Their son, by then grown and living on his 
own, fell in love with her at the Christmas dinner table. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me one day and said, 'Ma, would it be OK if I moved into the guest 
house with her?' " his mother recalled. "He got music lessons and a wife." 
</P>
<P>
 America's best-known guest house denizen, Kato Kaelin, certainly got more than 
he bargained for. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-year-old Milwaukee-born actor, who came to California a decade ago, had 
struggled through a series of low-budget films and a stint producing cheesecake 
calendars of swimsuit-clad models. Among his previous addresses, according to 
public records, was a shabby East Hollywood duplex wedged against the freeway. 
Then, at the end of 1992, he took a ski vacation to Aspen and met Nicole Brown 
Simpson, who later invited him to a party at her spacious Gretna Green Way home 
in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't help but notice a vacant cottage behind the house, Kaelin later 
told Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark during O.J. Simpson's preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did that give you some idea?" the prosecutor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "To move in," replied Kaelin, his bluntness triggering a chorus of courtroom 
chuckles. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying $450 to $500 a month, Kaelin lived there for most of 1993, occasionally 
taking care of the Simpsons' two young children in exchange for a break on his 
rent. At the beginning of 1994, Nicole Simpson moved into the Bundy Drive 
condominium where she later was killed. She had no separate guest quarters 
there, and O.J. Simpson was uncomfortable with Kaelin living inside her home 
while the divorced couple was trying to reconcile. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Kaelin had become a friend to the entire family, so it was not 
considered odd for Simpson to invite him to his Brentwood mansion. Kaelin lived 
in one of the estate's three guest houses -- a feature treasured by Simpson, 
according to realtor Elaine Young, because they provided the ideal natural 
light that his first wife, Marquerite, needed for painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Simpson faces trial in the deaths of his ex-wife and a friend, 
Kaelin's relationship to both suspect and victim has made him one of the most 
intriguing figures in the closely watched Simpson saga. He held a nation 
transfixed recently as he described how he spent the day of the murders -- 
using the former NFL star's Jacuzzi, riding with him in a Rolls Royce to 
McDonald's, then hearing a suspicious thud against his guest house wall. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kaelin, who has since moved to an undisclosed location, has tried to 
remain discreet. He has turned down numerous interview requests, according to 
his attorney, including an offer of $100,000 from the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kato had a good perspective on who he was and what his role was," said a 
source close to Kaelin, who asked not to be identified. "It's not like he was a 
groupie who went around telling people he lived with O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few tragic cases, guest house residents have lost far more than their 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 shotgun slayings of three teen-age girls in Pasadena's affluent 
Annandale district occurred at a pool house owned by one of the victims, who 
hosted frequent beer blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 British filmmaker Duncan Gibbins, the first fatality of last fall's 
firestorms, died after trying to rescue his cat from the guest house he rented 
on a 10-acre Topanga Canyon estate. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year in Glendale, a guest house tenant was charged with murder in 
the fatal stabbing of his landlord, an 89-year-old grandmother who allowed him 
to stay free in exchange for odd jobs. A search of the suspect's bedroom, 
according to court testimony, revealed a collection of more than 100 books on 
satanic practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Little could be said about guest houses, however, to dampen Stefanos 
Polyzoides' enthusiasm. The USC professor of architecture is one of the most 
ardent champions of such living arrangements, both for personal and 
professional reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apartment living is just completely depressing," said Polyzoides, who took 
out a newspaper ad with his wife five years ago in search of guest house 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 They ended up in a delightful three-room cottage behind a $1-million 
Spanish-style home near the Rose Bowl. They had trussed wooden ceilings, a view 
of the San Gabriel Mountains and their own vegetable garden, all for a rent 
that Polyzoides said was a fraction of what such luxury would otherwise cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an extraordinarily pleasant experience," he said. "We actually felt 
sorry about leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Some communities, such as Whittier and Ojai, have tried to tighten the rules 
on such back-yard structures in response to complaints about congestion. But 
Polyzoides is more inclined to side with the handful of affluent cities, such 
as San Marino and Rolling Hills Estates, that have sought to use maid's 
quarters and caretaker's cottages to meet state-mandated quotas for affordable 
housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rather wonderful, ancient way of having people live," he said. "It 
increases the density of a city without taking away any of its livability or 
single-family character." 
</P>
<P>
 The only greater tale of guest house devotion comes from a real estate agent 
who was trying to sell one of Hancock Park's most elegant estates. 
</P>
<P>
 A young music critic was living in the guest house and feared relinquishing 
his privileged pad should the estate be sold. One day, while some prospective 
buyers were inspecting the house, the tenant struck back: He waited for the 
agent to wander off, then ambushed the newcomers, telling them fabricated 
horror stories about muggers lurking in the bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a valiant effort, the agent said, but not enough to block the tenant's 
eviction.

RIOT ERUPTS AT BORDER OF ISRAEL, GAZA; MIDEAST: 2 KILLED, 118 HURT IN WORST 
CLASH SINCE PALESTINIAN SELF-RULE BEGAN. RIOTERS BATTLE ARAB, ISRAELI POLICE, 
WHO REPORTEDLY FIRE ON EACH OTHER.

<P>
 In the bloodiest clash since the start of Palestinian self-rule in May, 
thousands of Palestinian workers angered by long delays in crossing into Israel 
rioted here Sunday, battling both Palestinian police and Israeli troops, who 
then opened fire on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Palestinians were killed and 98 were wounded in the daylong clashes, 
according to Palestinian Authority spokesmen. Israel said 20 of its soldiers 
and police officers were wounded, one of them critically. 
</P>
<P>
 With gunfire coming from all sides and fires blazing fiercely through the day, 
the Erez border crossing took on the appearance of a war zone -- a frightening 
image for those Palestinians and Israelis who had seen Palestinian 
self-government as a major step toward peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely sad day both for the Palestinians and for us," said 
Mordechai Gur, Israel's deputy defense minister. "If both sides don't take 
immediate steps . . . it might deteriorate into something difficult for anyone 
to control." 
</P>
<P>
 As news of the riots spread with reports that as many as 10 Palestinians had 
been killed, demonstrations broke out in the occupied West Bank. Israeli police 
flooded Jerusalem's Old City amid fears that the disturbances would spread 
there as thousands of Jews gathered for a day of prayer commemorating the 
destruction of Israel's ancient temples. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes began at the Erez Checkpoint about 4 a.m. Sunday as an estimated 
2,000 Palestinian workers, infuriated by slow security procedures holding up 
20,000 workers waiting to board buses for their jobs in Israel, broke through 
Palestinian police lines, overran two Israeli army guard posts, forcing the 
soldiers to flee, and threatened to charge across the border into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police began firing into the air to subdue the rioters, according 
to most accounts of the incident, but failed to turn them back. Israeli troops 
managed to contain the surging mob with tear gas and gunshots over the heads of 
the rioters, but they were forced back again in a hail of stones and then 
firebombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rioters burned about 20 Israeli buses, a bus terminal, an Israeli-owned gas 
station and a firetruck sent to put out the blazes. A cloud of black smoke was 
visible 15 miles away in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really a war situation," gas station owner Felix Cohen said after 
fleeing across the border into Israel. "Even during the intifada (the 
Palestinian rebellion against the Israeli occupation), it never got to this 
point. This was worse than anything we have seen in years." 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour and a half, the fighting intensified, with hundreds of 
Palestinian youths joining the rioters even as the bulk of the workers fled, 
according to Israeli officers. Some of the Palestinian police then opened fire 
on Israeli forces, raising fears of an all-out clash along the Gaza frontier, 
Israeli sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis were the ones who started the shooting, so we had to defend 
ourselves and we fired back at them," Palestinian police Lt. Amar Fayad said. 
"It was not our intention to get into a firefight with the Israelis, but in 
shooting at the rioters they were also shooting at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions soared as a number of Israeli settlers raced to the checkpoint, 
firing on the Palestinians, and then drove across the border, their guns still 
blazing, to take shelter behind the Israeli armored personnel carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 As they saw the confrontation with the Palestinian police growing almost by 
the minute, Israeli commanders pulled back their troops and ordered them to 
avoid contact with the Palestinian forces and simply defend the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforcements were rushed to the area when fighting flared again in the early 
afternoon, but they were given the same orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "If not for the remarkable self-control of the border police and the brigade 
officers who were present, this would have ended in a much heavier price in 
blood on both sides," Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak, the Israeli army chief of staff, 
said after touring the battle zone. "We expect an investigation of the 
Palestinian policemen who shot at and wounded our border police." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Palestinian security officials met in the midst of the clashes in 
an effort to end the fight, but their talks devolved first into an angry 
argument over who was to blame and then into a shoving match. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police also pulled back at one point under orders from Palestine 
Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat, who heads the Palestinian 
Authority, to avoid causing more deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Hisham Abdel Raziq, an official of Arafat's Fatah organization, said the 
Palestinian police "did not shoot at the workers. They shot in the air in order 
to disperse the mass of workers this morning." He said Israeli troops had, in 
fact, panicked and opened fire too quickly, not giving the Palestinians time to 
restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrest began, he said, when a worker, caught trying to slip through the 
citrus groves into Israel without going through the checkpoint, grabbed an 
automatic rifle from a Palestinian police officer and began firing into the 
air. Although police overpowered the man, they fired their own weapons -- 
setting off the stampede toward the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 The clashes continued until late afternoon, when Palestinian police finally 
were able to disperse the rioters, driving them away from the border crossing 
and declaring it a closed military zone. Israel also closed all exits from the 
Gaza Strip, saying new arrangements would have to be made to avoid future 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things have to be changed," Gur said, "and that is mainly the 
Palestinian procedure in checking for security. It takes too much time. The 
workers have to get (to Erez) at 2:30 in the morning, and it takes three hours 
to cross. This is much too much for any worker. They should not have to go 
through this hell every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Palestinian police must treat their people as human beings but still 
ensure Israeli security. . . . It is urgent for Arafat to control the 
population and ensure a normal life. He has to find his own steps and then 
coordinate with us." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ariel Sharon, Israel's hard-line former defense minister and a critic of 
the autonomy accord, saw in the clash evidence of a fatally flawed pact with 
the PLO. "What sort of peace is this?" he demanded. "What sort of (security) 
arrangements? It only shows one thing -- the government was mistaken from the 
beginning in signing an agreement with Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinians, however, blamed Israel for the clash and warned of the impact on 
the overall Arab-Israeli peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hold the Israeli side fully responsible for the development of this 
situation," the Palestinian Authority said in a formal statement. "We demand 
the Israeli government take the necessary steps to bring those responsible to 
account." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, in a message to the United Nations and to the United States and Russia 
as co-sponsors of the peace negotiations, called for the immediate deployment 
of international observers in the Gaza Strip under terms of the peace agreement 
signed with Israel last September. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the Clinton Administration, Secretary of State Warren Christopher 
expressed "deep regret" over the incident Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tragedy in Gaza today underscores the need for ongoing coordination, both 
to deal with the consequences of today's tragedy as well as to try to prevent 
the recurrence of similar incidents in the future," he said en route from 
Washington for a week of talks in the region.

TIMING IS RIGHT FOR VALLEY'S HAVEN FOR BATTERED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was 1977 and domestic violence just didn't exist in the San Fernando 
Valley. Or so Jacquie Gordon and Cheryl Cornell were told repeatedly before 
they opened Haven Hills, the San Fernando Valley's first emergency shelter for 
battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody talked about it," Gordon said. "The mind-set was that it was happening 
in poverty areas. Nobody really believed that it could happen in an affluent 
area because the women would have money and they could just leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a shock to find it was the woman next door or the woman at the 
office who really didn't fall down those stairs -- or the Cub Scout leader." 
</P>
<P>
 While few people talked about domestic violence in 1977, they certainly are 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers in the Van Nuys division took the most reports of any division 
in the city -- 1,005 -- in the past three months. From January to March, Van 
Nuys police took 829 such reports. 
</P>
<P>
 And the underlying domestic violence issues in the O.J. Simpson murder case 
have caused crisis hot lines to jump off the hook. Patricia Giggans, the 
executive director of the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women, 
said their hot line calls skyrocketed from about 1,300 calls a month to about 
3,000 during the month of June. "We were off the map," Giggans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, Haven Hills, the Valley's first and only shelter, is 
embarking on an ambitious plan to open a 25-unit housing complex for battered 
women and their children. The so-called transitional housing complex received 
its first big financial boost last week when Gov. Pete Wilson included $100,000 
in his budget for Haven Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the long-term housing would be the first of its kind in Los 
Angeles county -- where emergency shelter beds are in woefully short supply and 
stays are often limited to 30 to 45 days. At the proposed new complex, women 
and their children could stay as long as 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing is right for this," said Betty Fisher, the executive director at 
Haven Hills. "We've just hit this crest at the right time. We've done 
everything including jumping up and down and screaming (for funding and 
recognition), but we always knew it would take something like this." 
</P>
<P>
 And "something like this" might just help Haven Hills avoid any potential 
problems with neighbors in the residential area where the complex is being 
proposed. Haven Hills officials, who have been developing the plans for two 
years, say the focus on domestic violence might make residents in the area more 
receptive to it. Haven Hills officials, who are in escrow on the property, 
requested that the location of the proposed complex be kept confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, whose district includes the proposed complex, said 
he believes the residents will go along with the plans as long as the design of 
the 25-unit project is compatible with the rest of the neighborhood. "I can't 
picture people opposing the nature of the project," Wachs said. "It's a matter 
of building it in a way that the design fits in with the area." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills officials estimate that the project could cost between $1.5 
million and $2 million and that -- for the first time -- the money will not be 
hard to raise. The shelter had to cut back on services three years ago but 
officials now say there is no shortage of grants and federal and local agencies 
with money available. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood), who maneuvered 
behind the scenes to get Wilson to retain the $100,000 in his budget, said the 
low-cost housing is long-needed both in the Valley and throughout the city. 
"The need is everywhere and it is immediate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Cathy, who is staying at the Haven Hills shelter with her young son. 
Cathy says she will stay at the "safe house" for the maximum time allowed -- 30 
days. Then, she says, she might be forced to go live with her parents -- where 
her husband of two years will probably find her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to move from shelter to shelter but if I go back to my 
parents, he'll be able to find me," she said. "When there's somewhere they can 
find you, it makes it very hard to stay away. I have to figure out a way to get 
a place to live and a job in a pretty quick amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 She's not alone. More than half of the 362 women and children who stayed at 
the shelter last year returned to relatives or friends, almost all saying they 
had no other choice. About 7% of the women went directly back to their abuser, 
all but one saying it was because they were concerned about housing and didn't 
believe they could make it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey of the women at the Haven Hills shelter last year, more than 80% 
said that 30 days was not enough time to do all the work -- emotionally, 
legally and otherwise -- that must be done to eliminate the violence from their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been extremely frustrating to us," said Gordon, who was president of the 
Canoga Park Women's Club when she founded Haven Hills with Cornell. "To have a 
place where women could feel safe for some length of time -- with child care -- 
has been our dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy says she decided to call the Haven Hills hot line after a particularly 
frightening episode in which her husband, who was drunk, started screaming at 
her, pulled her out of bed, threw her on the floor and began hitting her. Cathy 
is three months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was abusive, violent," she said. "When he fell asleep, I left." 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy says she has left between 10 and 20 times, only to return again. "He 
calls and calls and calls until we're so worn down," she said. "And then you 
just give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the city, domestic violence counselors and shelter administrators say 
they can't do enough for these victims of intensely private wars. While there 
are fewer than 300 shelter beds in Los Angeles County, there are just 30 in the 
San Fernando Valley at Haven Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Without adequate funding and unable to compete with other high-profile 
charities and nonprofit groups, the providers say they have been unable to 
expand. Haven House in Pasadena, which was the first shelter in the county and 
is not affiliated with the Valley's Haven Hills, turns away at least 55 women 
and their children a month due to a lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous," said Sheila Halfon, the executive director. "The economy 
has really made it hard to expand. It's difficult enough to get the funds to 
operate without asking for more." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills, in the Valley, has an annual budget of about $560,000, which 
includes counseling programs, the hot line and the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter life is anything but easy. Most women are required to quit their jobs 
and pull their children out of school so they can't be followed by their 
abusers back to the shelters. Some will not accept teen-age boys and most 
require that the women stay at the shelter for the first 72 hours without any 
outside contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the conditions might appear to be harsh and tough to meet, they are 
all intended to protect the abused women and their children. "It's not Club 
Med," said Giggans, of the Commission on Assaults Against Women. "It's really 
for people who are escaping to save their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills has gone one step further than most of the emergency shelters: It 
has a one-room schoolhouse complete with a credentialed teacher and an aide. 
The walls are brightly adorned with childrens' paintings and drawings and boxes 
of toys sit in the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 On one wall a child has drawn a picture of a house and written: "I will miss 
Haven Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 Because so many children pass through Haven Hills, officials decided to open 
the classroom. While admitting that the focus isn't entirely academic, 
officials say they want the children to continue reading and writing and 
drawing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in a business and residential neighborhood, the shelter has six small 
apartments that sleep five -- plus cribs, if needed. Haven Hills provides food, 
and each unit has a kitchen. A small playground sits in the center of the 
complex, where two young children sat on top of a slide on a recent afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's well hidden from the street with a locked security gate and the address 
is not publicized to protect the women's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-term housing complex would be similar but there would also be on-site 
child care, individual and group counseling and job training. 
</P>
<P>
 While the majority of the 25 units would have two bedrooms, four apartments 
with three and four bedrooms would be available for larger families. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dream would be to open more emergency shelters but then be able to move 
the women and the families to longer-term, transitional housing where they can 
get some stability," said Giggans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is when you go to a shelter, you are really changing your life. 
Thirty days is awfully short to do that."

VANISHING STILL A VEXING MYSTERY; SEARCH: DENISE A. HUBER DISAPPEARED WITHOUT A 
TRACE IN JUNE, 1991, BUT FAMILY, FRIENDS AND DETECTIVES WOULD NOT GIVE UP UNTIL 
SHE WAS FOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For more than three years, the disappearance of Denise A. Huber has been one 
of Orange County's most vexing and tragic mysteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Family, friends, and law-enforcement officials agonized over how the popular 
23-year-old Newport Beach woman vanished June 3, 1991. Many assumed the worst, 
yet most were unwilling to stop searching until she was found. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, law-enforcement officials were unraveling the mystery, having found 
Huber's nude body wrapped in garbage bags and stuffed in a freezer kept in a 
stolen rental truck in Dewey, Ariz. John Joseph Famalaro, a 37-year-old 
handyman formerly from Orange County, has been charged with Huber's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Information about her death still remains limited. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is that she attended a Morrissey concert at the Forum with a 
friend that June evening, went to a bar afterward and then dropped the friend 
off about 2 a.m. She was never heard from again. 
</P>
<P>
 The only clue left behind was her 1988 Honda Accord. It was stranded on the 
side of the Corona del Mar Freeway, near the Bear Street off-ramp, with a flat 
rear tire. The doors were unlocked, the windows were left slightly open. There 
was no apparent sign of a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perhaps the most frustrating case I've ever worked," said Logan Clarke, 
a private investigator hired by the family shortly after Huber's disappearance. 
"It was baffling." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said he was horrified by the discovery in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like throwing up," he said. "I've done cases where people have been 
stabbed 42 times, slaughters and satanic cults, but this was the worst. This 
girl is what every mother and father would want. She was as American as apple 
pie. She was fun and full of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said he spent many hours trying to locate Huber's abductor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a tremendous amount of searching," he said. "Everybody did." 
</P>
<P>
 He speculated Sunday that the suspect might have treated her as a "prize 
catch. . . . She was so beautiful and so sweet and because of that he may have 
wanted to hang onto her." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Calvert, 27, of Huntington Beach who attended the concert with Huber 
the night she disappeared, said he frequently thinks about her apparent 
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think about her and the good times that I've had with her. It's like 
it's finalized now," he said. "In a way it's a great relief. I've been trying 
to get on with my own life, and it's been tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said he was relieved that a suspect has been arrested in connection 
with Huber's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought they would just find some bones in the desert and they'd 
never be able to find out who did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said he was appalled to hear that Huber's body had been preserved and 
stuffed in a freezer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put this up with the (Jeffrey) Dahmer thing," he said. "It's bizarre. I 
hope that Denise didn't suffer too greatly. There are a lot of questions that 
need to be answered."

SLAYING STUNS RETIREMENT COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of the Prescott Country Club -- a sprawling, sun-drenched retirement 
community -- say the last serious crime around here involved pranksters 
toppling porta-potties at home construction sites. 
</P>
<P>
 This has become a mecca for Southern Californians who are up in age and eager 
to leave the crime, smog and congestion far behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Yavapai County Sheriff's Department investigated only six 
murders, and the county's biggest city, Prescott -- population 100,000 and 
rapidly growing -- was declared the nation's No. 1 retirement spot by Money 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of the country club in a suburb of Prescott were stunned Sunday 
by the grisly discovery of a young Newport Beach woman's body in a freezer 
humming away inside a truck parked at a neighbor's home. 
</P>
<P>
 It has made them realize their orderly retirement community is not immune to 
crime -- even murder -- after all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really shocking, because that kind of thing just doesn't happen here," 
said Richard Joseph, a transplant from Thousand Oaks. "That's why we came here, 
to get away from all of that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you have to expect this in a growing community," said Mardelle Kean, 
who lives across the street from John Joseph Famalaro, charged in the death of 
Denise A. Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared in 1991. "But it's just 
amazing that this young woman has been missing for three years and turns up 
right here." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents wonder whether they will ever feel as secure as they did before, 
knowing that behind a neat home landscaped desert-style with gravel, boulders 
and native vegetation -- a neat home that matches all the others in the 
retirement community -- lay a nude, frozen corpse wrapped in garbage bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaken neighbors peered from behind curtains and blinds Sunday as 
investigators and volunteers swarmed Famalaro's home during the search for 
possible additional bodies. Some yelled at reporters while others eagerly 
agreed to be interviewed. Some residents ventured out beside television camera 
crews, taking their own pictures.

SUSPECT LIVED SECRETIVE LIFE; PROFILE: JOHN JOSEPH FAMALARO, 37, GREW UP IN A 
STRICT, CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIAN HOME. HIS MOTHER SAYS, 'I THINK HE'S A GOOD 
BOY.'

 As authorities began digging up the basement of John Joseph Famalaro's home 
Sunday, his neighbors in the Prescott Country Club community described the 
murder suspect as a troubled loner who took pains to avoid contact with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, was arrested Wednesday after a tip about a stolen moving truck 
turned up the frozen body of Denise A. Huber, 23 of Newport Beach, who 
disappeared without a trace in June, 1991. Her nude body was found wrapped in 
garbage bags and stuffed in a freezer inside the moving truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's apparent abduction sparked a nationwide search as her parents, Dennis 
and Ione Huber, refused to give up hope that they would someday find out what 
happened to their daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the pieces of the long-unsolved mystery began to fall into place as 
investigators focused on Famalaro, who, by all accounts, lived a secretive 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the suspect's mother, who lives next door to him, said Sunday she knows 
little about her son's life and asked reporters for more information about the 
crime he is accused of. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what he had in there," said Anne Famalaro, who is active in 
local politics and is well known in the Prescott Country Club community. "I 
thought he was moving paint." 
</P>
<P>
 As her eyes welled up with tears, she said, "I really can't tell you much 
about him. I just don't know. I think he's a good boy. I don't know what to 
make of all this. Pray for him. Please pray for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a strict, conservative Christian home where education was stressed, 
John Famalaro attended several years of college in Southern California but 
never managed to get a degree. Instead, he made his living as a house painter 
and handyman. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lost his contractor's license in Arizona early this year after unhappy 
customers complained that he performed shoddy work and refused to fix his 
mistakes, law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints came from people with freshly painted homes that were peeling 
and newly fixed roofs that were leaking. Some employees who worked for Famalaro 
contended that they never got paid, law-enforcement authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local newspapers, Famalaro's clients described the tall, lanky, 
bearded man as a silver-tongued salesman who could usually seal a deal with 
eloquent pitches. But one neighbor, who agreed to speak if his name were not 
used, said he believed Famalaro pelted his house with dozens of eggs after the 
man hired someone else to paint the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a good talker, but he wasn't happy when I found somebody cheaper," the 
resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they rarely saw much of Famalaro even during recent months when 
he was unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just always inside with his paint cans and truck," said one neighbor. 
"He never talked to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 According to law-enforcement officials and court records, Famalaro has no 
criminal record here or in Orange County, except for two minor traffic 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Since moving next to his mother at the Prescott Country Club, he has lived 
quietly and on occasion has complained to police about noisy neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said Famalaro moved here from Orange County about a year and a half 
ago to help care for his parents, especially his father who suffers from 
Parkinson's disease and was recently hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Orange County, he was likely aware of the well-publicized quest by 
Denise A. Huber's parents to learn of her whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 When taken into questioning Wednesday, he was cool and calm, agreeably 
answering questions about his age and background. But he invoked his right to 
remain silent when investigators asked him about the body, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since retained high-profile defense attorney Larry Katz, regarded as 
one of region's most tenacious litigators. 
</P>
<P>
 As his parents visited him Sunday at the Yavapai County Jail, investigators 
scoured his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Painting tools, remodeling equipment and thousands of paint cans cluttered 
Famalaro's back yard and basement, slowing down investigators who methodically 
removed the items during a search that even involved looking into paint 
containers for evidence, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said they were often upset over the unsightly clutter around 
Famalaro's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro had a yard sale earlier in the year to get rid of items left behind 
by the previous tenant. Included was a metal basketball stand, which he placed 
on his terraced, multicolored gravel-and-rock garden. It remains there, much to 
the chagrin of neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always been an eyesore over there, but no one would dare complain to 
him," said another neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just the kind of guy who kept to himself," said neighbor Nick Kean. 
"We would see him come out in the morning to pick up his mail and paper, and 
his gaze was always down. It was a big effort to get him to say hello. I can't 
say I'm surprised by all this. You just got an odd feeling from him."

BODY OF WOMAN MISSING FOR 3 YEARS IS FOUND; CRIME: FROZEN REMAINS DISCOVERED IN 
A TRUCK IN ARIZONA ARE IDENTIFIED AS THOSE OF A NEWPORT BEACH WOMAN. 
AUTHORITIES HAVE A SUSPECT IN CUSTODY AND ARE SEARCHING FOR MORE POSSIBLE 
VICTIMS.

 Orange County and Arizona authorities were digging for more possible victims 
Sunday at the country club home of a 37-year-old house painter charged with 
murder in the death of an Orange County woman, whose frozen body was found in a 
stolen rental truck three years after she vanished from alongside a freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the search of John Joseph Famalaro's hilltop property in this 
affluent town was continuing partly because of evidence suggesting the work of 
a serial killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said the discovery of Denise A. Huber's 
checkbook, purse, identification cards and near-flawlessly preserved corpse is 
consistent with cases in which people keep personal mementos or bodies as 
"trophies of their killings." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body was found Wednesday in the truck, inside a freezer, naked and 
wrapped in layers of plastic trash bags. The freezer was plugged into an 
extension cord that ran from the Ryder rental truck to Famalaro's house. 
</P>
<P>
 A special canine unit from Utah discovered "two points of interest" inside the 
house late Sunday, said Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Kathleen McLaughlin. The 
two cadaver-sniffing dogs began pawing at two places downstairs, prompting 
authorities to consider an excavation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could probably start digging (there today)," McLaughlin said Sunday. "You 
never know what might be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials are also concerned about a partial excavation they 
found in a lower cellar area in the Famalaros' split-level home, where 
authorities, some in surgical masks, were digging Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an autopsy found that Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared in 
June, 1991, died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the Maricopa 
County medical examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber appeared to have suffered at least a half-dozen blows to the head from 
an object with "sharpened" edges, police said. No murder weapon had been 
recovered Sunday night. Smith said it could not be immediately determined 
whether Huber had been sexually assaulted. But the body was so well preserved, 
Smith said, that authorities had little trouble lifting fingerprints to make a 
positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the corpse was frozen, Yavapai County sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie 
Berra said, experts are having a difficult time determining exactly when Huber 
died. It is possible they will never know, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held on $250,000 bond on suspicion of murder and felony 
theft related to the stolen truck. The case has been referred to the Yavapai 
County grand jury for investigation, and a preliminary hearing has tentatively 
been set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim discovery last week marked the end of Orange County's most baffling 
missing persons case, which began three years ago when Huber disappeared after 
attending a rock concert at the Forum in Inglewood. Her blue 1988 Honda Accord 
was found the next morning on a shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's parents, who spearheaded a far-reaching, lengthy search, appeared 
shaken Sunday. The family recently announced their intention to leave the state 
where they had raised their daughter and move to North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad we finally have an answer," Ione Huber said at the family's 
Newport Beach home. "We were praying for an answer for a very long time. But 
this is not the kind of answer we were praying for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they had never heard of Famalaro until this week, and have no 
plans to travel to Arizona. Rather, the family has found some comfort in 
reports from authorities, who believe that Denise Huber died quickly after her 
disappearance June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sign of torture and she did not appear to be malnourished," Smith 
said. "That would mean to me that she died very soon after she was picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Hubers were finally free to grieve for their long-lost daughter, 
another family -- the Famalaros -- was in the Yavapai County jail waiting room 
wrapped in a different kind of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hearts are breaking over this," said Anne Famalaro, the suspect's mother. 
"We are the kind of people who keep to ourselves. We're conservative Christian 
people. I believe in Jesus, and he will pull us through this." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who lives next door to her son in a fashionable golf course 
community and reportedly owns the split-level house now surrounded by crime 
scene tape, described her son simply as "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber grew up in Northridge, where her family moved in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 When Huber's parents moved to Texas before her senior year in high school, she 
decided to stay behind for her final year of high school. After graduation, she 
joined her parents in Texas, and, after a brief stint at a Bible college, 
returned to California to attend UC Irvine when her parents moved to Newport 
Beach in 1987.

UNION'S FOCUS ON FIELDS STARTS TO BEAR FRUIT; LABOR: SINCE RETURNING TO 
GRASS-ROOTS ORGANIZING THIS SPRING, UNITED FARM WORKERS HAS SURPRISED GROWERS 
WITH ELECTION WINS AND NEW CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When the United Farm Workers union marched from Delano to Sacramento in April 
to announce a return to organizing campesinos in the fields, many growers 
throughout the state derided the event as a publicity stunt with more bark than 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the months since the pilgrimage, the UFW appears to be making good on 
its promise. It has won three elections outright and possibly a fourth at fruit 
and vegetable companies from Coachella to Kings County involving more than 
1,000 workers. It has negotiated two new contracts -- one with a Coachella 
table grape grower, the first grape contract in nearly a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 And the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, mostly silent in recent 
years, has filed more than a dozen complaints since May against growers who 
allegedly refused to bargain in good faith -- a clear response to the renewed 
field activity. 
</P>
<P>
 While these gains may be small in the overall picture and no one is claiming 
the union has recaptured its old glory, at least some growers are looking over 
their shoulders at the UFW's growing shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do see a heightened level of concern among our growers now that the UFW has 
returned to organizing," said Richard Matoian, head of the California Grape and 
Tree Fruit League, which represents 350 growers from Coachella to Mendocino. 
"No one is panicking, but I'd say the industry is on guard." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest aftershock seems to have come from the UFW's lopsided victory last 
month at Warmerdam farms in Kings County, which is just north of Kern County. 
Of the 263 workers who cast ballots, 220 voted for the union. The state labor 
officials who oversaw the election were said to have been stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warmerdams had been criticized for losing touch with their work force and 
using abusive labor contractors or middlemen to deal with the workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It caught us by surprise," said Bill Warmerdam, a third-generation fruit 
grower who conceded that his critics may be partly right. "We're still trying 
to figure out what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 UFW President Arturo Rodriguez said the vote was the union's first-ever 
victory in Kings County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major, major accomplishment for us," said the 44-year-old Rodriguez, 
the son-in-law of the late Cesar Chavez, who led the UFW for its first 30 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers at Warmerdam did it all. They took the message that every worker 
is an organizer. They are the ones who formed the committees and signed up 
their co-workers." 
</P>
<P>
 None of this seemed possible just months ago with the UFW reeling from a 
decade of losses and the sudden death of Chavez. Even some longtime supporters 
found little reason for optimism. In the early 1970s, the UFW had contracts 
with 80% of the grape growers in the San Joaquin Valley. Two decades later, not 
a single contract remained. 
</P>
<P>
 The union had retreated from the fields, former top organizers complained. Its 
almost singular reliance on the table grape boycott and the issue of toxic 
pesticides was doing little to improve the lot of farm workers, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 While publicly dismissing the criticism, Rodriguez, co-founder Dolores Huerta 
and others huddled in strategy sessions at the UFW's La Paz compound in the 
Tehachapi Mountains 100 miles north of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 They emerged this spring with a Delano-to-Sacramento pilgrimage that retraced 
the path of the union's first trek 28 years earlier and announced a major shift 
in strategy: No longer would the grape boycott be the centerpiece. The union 
would return to the difficult work of organizing farm laborers, enlisting new 
members, confronting growers and pushing for new elections and contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the eve of the monthlong pilgrimage in April and at stops along the way, 
growers and farm groups dismissed the event as so much nostalgia. "It's the 
last gasp of a dying man," said Richard Baiz of the Grapeworkers and Farmers 
coalition, a longtime foe of the union. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the three months since 10,000 supporters marched the final leg of the 
330-mile trek to the steps of the state Capitol, UFW organizers have kept up 
the pressure on growers and fruit companies up and down the state. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been rallies at Dole Food Co. in Los Angeles and at Oceanview 
Produce in Oxnard. There have been picket lines at date companies in Coachella 
and at vegetable farms in Salinas. There have been protests at the offices of 
the Agricultural Labor Relations Board, the state agency set up to enforce a 
landmark 1975 law that gave farm workers the right to collective bargaining. 
The union argues that the board has served only the interests of growers during 
the Deukmejian and Wilson administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The dividends have been modest but real. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Warmerdam farms in Kings County, the union won two elections 
last month at small date companies in Coachella. Before the UFW can actually 
represent workers at the three companies, the state labor board must certify 
the vote and dismiss any grower objections, which have been filed in two of the 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The UFW appears headed for a big victory at Oceanview Produce. Workers voted 
275 to 231 in favor of the union, but the farm labor board has yet to certify 
the election because 87 additional votes are disputed. The company would have 
to win 66 of those votes to prevail. The labor board is reviewing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Because table grapes are a $750-million-a-year industry that relies heavily on 
field workers for pruning, thinning and picking, the success or failure of the 
UFW is often measured in its impact on grapes. Chavez waged his most bitter 
battles against the state's table grape giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Grower Lionel Steinberg of David Freedman farms in Coachella said he expects 
to sign the first table grape contract in nearly a decade with the UFW in the 
next few weeks. He is already honoring its terms, which include a wage increase 
from $5.80 to $6 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not had a contract with a table grape grower for eight years," 
Rodriguez said. "Even though (Steinberg) is not a large grower, this puts 
pressure on the rest of the industry. And it tells our organizers that if we 
can do it in Coachella, we can do it elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 But others dismiss the importance of the Steinberg contract, pointing out that 
the grower has been a longtime supporter of the UFW and that the new contract 
is merely a resumption of an older one that went into hiatus because of a small 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lionel Steinberg is hardly an example of a major victory," said Bruce Obbink 
of the California Table Grape Commission. "The two sides just picked up where 
they left off several years back. It's another example of the UFW using smoke 
and mirrors to make things bigger than they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg himself characterized the contract as a "morale booster" to the UFW 
but agreed that other grape growers were much bigger quarry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new agreement isn't much of a change in my relationship with the UFW, 
which began on April 10, 1970, when I was the first grower to sign a contract 
with Cesar Chavez." 
</P>
<P>
 The union concedes that it will be harder pressed in the next few weeks as the 
harvest and picket lines move north to Kern County, where the big table grape 
growers pay workers some of the better wages in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a strategy for the San Joaquin Valley too," Rodriguez said. "But it 
would be stupid of me to tip our hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The union points to several key negotiations now taking place with other 
growers around the state. And it highlights numbers from the state that show a 
significant rise in complaints against growers over allegedly unfair labor 
bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the farm labor board has issued nearly as many complaints this year 
-- 25 -- as it did in all of last year. And a small staff with few resources is 
feeling the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question the UFW has been more active these last few months," 
said Don Pressley, Agricultural Labor Relations Board general counsel, who 
files the complaints. "They have some very good people out in the field who are 
giving their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether or not they can sustain it. Whether or not they can 
win elections and get contracts. That remains to be seen."

POLITICS COLOR SHOWDOWN ON GAMING PANEL; LEGISLATURE: A RE-VOTE ON THE BILL TO 
CREATE A GAMBLING COMMISSION WILL TEST LAWMAKERS' LOYALTY TO WILLIE BROWN, WHO 
OPPOSES STATE LICENSING AS UNNECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the potential of organized crime infiltrating California's 
card rooms, the Legislature is debating whether to establish a state gambling 
commission, which would license and regulate the popular and lucrative clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren and Assemblyman Phillip 
Isenberg (D-Sacramento), chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the bill creating 
the commission was approved by a 49-10 vote in the Assembly late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was prevented from moving to the state Senate by opponents -- led by 
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) -- who used a parliamentary 
maneuver to stall the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says the legislation (AB 2803) is "untimely and unnecessary" and would 
make Lungren "the gambling czar of California." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the attorney general's office would conduct thorough criminal 
background checks on card club license applicants and make license 
recommendations to the seven-member commission, whose members would be 
appointed by the governor, the Assembly Speaker and the Senate Rules Committee. 
Currently, both state and local entities make background checks, but the bill's 
supporters say such checks are limited in scope and not coordinated with other 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need for the commission is self-evident," Lungren said in an interview. 
"You have $7.5 billion estimated to be wagered across card room tables yearly 
in California. When you have a vacuum of appropriate oversight, you create a 
tremendous opportunity for organized crime to move in with the enormous amounts 
of cash involved. This is preventive medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren discounted Brown's criticism, saying: "Far from me trying to become 
the gambling czar of California, I'm trying to set up a commission to do that 
job. Willie knows that. So Willie is just plain wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 An undercurrent in the debate over the gambling commission is the political 
animosity between Lungren and Brown, who have been at odds at least since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Brown voted against Lungren's confirmation as state treasurer. 
Lungren, then a former Republican congressman from Long Beach, was appointed to 
the post by then-Republican Gov. George Deukmejian as a replacement for the 
late Jesse M. Unruh. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was confirmed by a 43-32 Assembly vote, Lungren was rejected by 
the Senate. The state Supreme Court ultimately ruled that he could not be 
treasurer with the approval of only one house, which temporarily sidetracked 
Lungren's political career. 
</P>
<P>
 The gambling commission bill, supported by Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman 
Block and various law enforcement groups, is one of the most heavily lobbied 
bills of the 1994 session. 
</P>
<P>
 Big and small card clubs, Las Vegas gambling interests, horse racing tracks, 
labor unions and Indian tribes who run bingo and casino-style games, all with a 
substantial interest in legalized gambling, have hired a raft of well-connected 
and expensive lobbyists to work the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, former Assembly Republican floor leader Bob Naylor of Redwood 
City represents Las Vegas gambling interests; Rod Blonien, former top aide to 
Deukmejian, represents the California Commerce Casino in the city of Commerce; 
and Sacramento City Councilman Jose Pane represents several Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Democratic Assemblyman Richard Floyd of Carson is working for the small 
card clubs; Terrance Flanigan, another former Deukmejian aide, represents 
Southern California card club owner George Hardie, who operates the Bicycle 
Club in Bell Gardens; former Republican Assemblywoman Bev Hansen of Santa Rosa 
speaks for Hollywood Park, and former Republican state Sen. Dennis Carpenter is 
representing several card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, most of the large card clubs favor the bill, while most of the 
smaller ones are against it. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 265 card clubs in California, with the Bicycle Club reporting 
a record-high $97 million in gross revenues in 1992, the last year for which 
figures are available. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential to reap enormous profits has prompted other groups to propose 
new, large card rooms, according to an attorney general's report earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last February, seven large card clubs were under various stages of 
development, while 27 more were being proposed in various regions of the state. 
A new card room at Hollywood Park opened July 1 with 150 tables. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Assembly debate, Isenberg, a former Brown aide, warned his 
colleagues it would be wise to move as soon as possible to set up the watchdog 
gambling commission before a scandal occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Isenberg said the state of Nevada spent 30 years working to wipe out the 
infiltration of organized crime into its casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like gambling," Isenberg said, "but if it's going to be here, it 
ought to be honest, even and aboveboard. We should make sure gambling is at 
least free from the criminal element." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, though, says the issue hasn't been studied enough. He wants the 
Assembly to wait for Assemblyman Curtis Tucker Jr. (D-Inglewood), chairman of 
the Governmental Organization Committee and considered to be a gambling 
legislation expert, to look into the issue and come up with recommendations. 
Ironically, Tucker, who said Isenberg had a good bill, voted for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure then served notice they would seek reconsideration of 
the vote, which has blocked the bill from moving to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Assembly and Senate are scheduled to return here Aug. 8 after a 
monthlong summer vacation recess, and the gambling issue is expected to come up 
again after that. 
</P>
<P>
 A legislative summation of Isenberg's measure says its intent is "to provide 
uniform, minimum standards of regulation . . . (and) to insure that gambling is 
free from criminal elements and is conducted honestly and competitively." 
</P>
<P>
 The gambling commission would have three members appointed by the governor, 
two by the Assembly Speaker and two by the Senate Rules Committee. Its main 
responsibility would be to issue card club licenses, currently left mainly to 
local government. The commission also would be empowered to revoke licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Any applicant found to have a background in organized crime or a felony 
conviction involving dishonesty or moral turpitude within 10 years would be 
prohibited from obtaining a license. Cities and counties, which currently issue 
licenses and have operating jurisdiction over card clubs, would continue to 
control locations, hours of operation, number of tables, wagering limits and 
other requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bill applies only to card room licensing, the measure could be 
expanded to cover other casino-type gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd, the former Democratic Assemblyman who represents the small card clubs, 
charges that Lungren is using the theme of preventing organized crime in the 
card room industry as an issue he can use in running for governor in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's running for governor on it right now," Floyd said. "He'll get huge 
campaign contributions from Las Vegas gambling interests, and he'll let them 
come here and run the small clubs out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Lungren: "Being criticized by the former assemblyman on the question 
of ethics is like being accused of giving a mad dog rabies when he bites you. 
That's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the gambling commission bill by a 49-10 bipartisan vote June 29 
was unusual because Brown rarely loses on bills he doesn't like. Adding spice 
to the political equation is that Isenberg is usually a member of Brown's inner 
circle on politically sensitive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one Democrats defied the Speaker and voted yes. So did 28 Republicans. 
Only seven Democrats, including Brown, voted no. 
</P>
<P>
 It's now up to Brown to find nine yes votes and persuade them to switch. If he 
can, Isenberg's bill will fail.

GORE TAPS A NERVE ON HEALTH CARE; EDUCATION: TEACHERS UNION CONVENTION APPLAUDS 
VICE PRESIDENT'S CALL FOR UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. THE HIGH COST OF INSURANCE HAS 
BEEN A PROMINENT ISSUE AT THE CONVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Vice President Al Gore ran through a laundry list of hot-button '90s issues -- 
family, the economy, school violence -- in a speech to the nation's 
second-largest teachers union Sunday, but he scored best with the delegates 
with his call for universal health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Stumping for the help of the American Federation of Teachers, the vice 
president told delegates: "The poor in this country have many problems, but 
they have health care. The wealthy in this country have health care. 
Middle-class Americans in this country are at risk of losing their health 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 His mention of Senate Republican Leader Robert Dole elicited a prolonged hiss 
from the audience. Gore told the teachers that the Kansas Republican "thinks it 
is unfair and unsportsmanlike to point out that every Republican senator who 
opposes universal health care reform already has health care coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 The high price of health care has been a prominent issue at the union 
convention, as delegates debate the burgeoning costs both for themselves and 
for their students -- many of whom lack coverage of any kind. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this week, the union's 4,000-plus delegates will consider a resolution 
calling for union backing of a health care reform plan that would guarantee 
coverage for all Americans and require employers to contribute to the cost. The 
union leadership has already urged delegates to use boxes outside the 
convention hall doors to drop off letters asking Congress to approve universal 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gore's speech, health care still held the teachers' attention. Many 
delegates sounded torn between their fear about what universal health care 
would cost them -- union contracts already guarantee health care for virtually 
all members -- and their concern for their students, many of whom cannot afford 
to see a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over the past 2 1/2 years of negotiating, I have seen the cost of health care 
escalate 150% for one of the (insurers)," said Maya Decker, president of the 
Newport Mesa Unified School District Federation of Teachers. "It makes hanging 
on to some kind of health care tougher and tougher each year." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also made life tougher on the students, said Monroe Morgan, a business 
teacher from Chicago. Today's teachers know that many of their students are not 
getting proper care in areas ranging from eyeglasses to more serious medical 
problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many times I've talked to parents and they say, 'We're going to take him to 
the doctor,' " he said. "But, of course, they don't have the money or the 
health coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 45-minute speech, Gore spoke of a "family friendly" executive order 
signed July 11 by President Clinton. It presses federal agencies to make the 
workplace more supportive of families by allowing job-sharing, flexible work 
schedules, telecommuting and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to set a standard in the federal government that can spread 
throughout the American workplace, a standard that keeps families together 
instead of driving them apart," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vice president also talked up his pet issue -- access to the so-called 
information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than three-quarters of our children don't even have an information 
footpath going to the classroom," Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 22% of the nation's classrooms have telephone lines that could link 
classroom computers to outside on-line services, and only 4% have modems, Gore 
said. He asked teachers to support legislation that would connect every U.S. 
classroom by computer to a national information infrastructure by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, Gore said, would ensure that the "students in Watts have 
access, not just students in Brentwood." 
</P>
<P>
 For many of these teachers, the need for computers was not as pressing as the 
need for students to have good nutrition and up-to-date textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having access to information doesn't answer fundamental questions: Do you 
have enough food? Shelter? Housing?" said Tom Edminster, a delegate from United 
Education of San Francisco, echoing the sentiments of many teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 For Bill Taxerman of United Teachers-Los Angeles, Gore's speech didn't offer 
much to ease the problems facing their classrooms, but the vice president was 
an effective cheerleader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a general, feel-good speech," Taxerman said.

U.S. HAS AUTHORITY TO LAUNCH HAITI INVASION, PANETTA SAYS; CARIBBEAN: INCOMING 
CHIEF OF STAFF INSISTS PRESIDENT HAS MADE NO DECISION. SEN. DOLE QUESTIONS NEED 
FOR ACTION. 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. government has ample authority under U.S. and international law to 
invade Haiti if President Clinton chooses to take that step, incoming White 
House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Panetta said the Administration would consult closely with Congress 
before ordering U.S. troops into action, he said the President does not have to 
seek advance authorization from Capitol Hill. And he said additional action by 
the U.N. Security Council probably is not necessary either. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have to exercise the military option, the authority is there," he said 
on the NBC-TV program "Meet the Press." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta insisted, as have other Administration officials in recent days, that 
the President has not decided if he will authorize military action. But he said 
the Administration is determined to restore democracy to Haiti by whatever 
means necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The bleak conditions in the impoverished island nation, which have prompted 
thousands of refugees to flee in recent weeks, cannot be allowed to continue, 
Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can sit back and allow that kind of turmoil to continue," he 
said. "We've got to act. We cannot sit back and allow the status quo to eat us 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 While Panetta, who takes over as chief of staff today, and other 
Administration officials continue to maintain that Washington hopes economic 
and political pressure will be enough to cause the military government of Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras to step aside and allow exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide to return, congressional critics of the Administration policy say that 
the likelihood of an invasion is growing by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said it would be a mistake to risk 
U.S. lives in Haiti, "but I think they are right on the edge" of sending in 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole made it clear he is unconvinced by the President's rationale for his 
Haiti policy. He rejected the Administration's assertion that the brutal Cedras 
dictatorship is responsible for the large number of refugees, arguing instead 
that U.S.-backed economic sanctions are causing the hardships forcing Haitians 
to flee. And he said the United States should not use military force only to 
restore democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Interviewed on the CBS-TV program "Face the Nation," Dole said it would be a 
mistake for the U.S. government to "run around invading countries because of 
democratic principles. If there (are) American interests threatened or American 
lives threatened, that's another thing. But that hasn't happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching the issue from the opposite end of the political spectrum, Rep. 
Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, also said the 
Administration is moving steadily toward an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The options are quickly running out," Mfume said. "And, unfortunately, we're 
getting closer and closer to military action." 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume shares the Administration's stated objective of restoring Aristide, 
Haiti's only freely elected president, to the office he lost in a September, 
1991, coup. But the lawmaker complained that the Administration's inconsistency 
on tactics has undercut its policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume urged the Administration to increase the pressure on Cedras and his 
associates by tightening the embargo and possibly using air power instead of 
invading. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of force to topple the regime has been conditionally endorsed by the 
general secretary of the National Council of Churches and the presiding bishop 
of the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate statements issued in New York on Friday, the Rev. Joan B. Campbell 
of the National Council of Churches and the Most Rev. Edmond L. Browning of the 
Episcopal Church said bloodshed and suffering on the island must end quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 While both church leaders said they had hoped military intervention would not 
be necessary, they said it may be the only course left in view of what Browning 
called the continuing specter of terror against the Haitian people and the 
refusal of the Haitian military leaders to step down.

FOR THE PEOPLE OF INDIA, MANGOES ARE A LUSCIOUS TREAT -- AND BIG BUSINESS; 
ASIA: BUT OF THE MORE THAN 1,000 VARIETIES OF THE FRUIT GROWN THERE, ONLY A FEW 
ARE POPULAR ABROAD. 
</P>

<P>
 It is July, and the thoughts of Indians have turned to mangoes, their juicy 
and golden reward after months of torrid heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Benazir and the Bhutto are again in season, almost as green as the 
Pakistani flag. The walnut-sized Angoor Dana (Grape Seed), the blushing 
Husn-ara (Beauty) and the lime-like Laila are now in markets and people's 
pantries. 
</P>
<P>
 So, across India, are more than 1,000 other varieties graced with the names of 
royalty (Prince, Sultan and Viceroy), castes (Thakur and Pandit), locales 
(Calcutta Amin and Bombay) and attributes (Silky, Delicate and Seedless -- 
plus, for unknown reasons, Lame, Quicksand and Fragile Body). 
</P>
<P>
 In India, mangoes are simultaneously a part of history, culture, mythology and 
religion -- and a big, thriving business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mango is indeed India's gift to the world," said Gokul Patnaik of the 
Commerce Ministry, whose job is to sell as many as possible abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Though an exotic, even unknown, object in parts of the Western world, the 
mango is as inextricably bound up with the land of its origin as the olive tree 
is with Greece or the grapevine with Italy's Tuscany. Even the scientific name, 
Mangifera indica, proudly proclaims the mango's native land. 
</P>
<P>
 The mango has been an integral part of India's diet and life for at least 
4,000 years. It is supposed to have delighted the invading Alexander the Great 
in 326 BC, and one of the most celebrated of Mogul emperors, Akbar, is said to 
have had an orchard with 100,000 mango trees, some of which still bear fruit in 
the present-day state of Bihar. 
</P>
<P>
 The glories of the mango brought verse to the appreciative lips of one of the 
most celebrated of Urdu bards, Mirza Ghalib, who praised its flavor by 
asserting that "even the sweetest of sugar canes is bland beside it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since time immemorial, the mango has been the symbol of love, pleasure and 
auspiciousness to Indians. In Hindu mythology, love arrives with the blossoming 
of the mango tree. Kama, the god of love, tips his arrow with five flowers, one 
of them the mango blossom. Its leaves are used to sprinkle sacred water in 
Hindu rituals. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ancient holy books, the mango tree is called Kalpavriksha, or 
"wish-granting tree," and Buddha, who founded a religion of his own, is 
supposed to have meditated in its shade. 
</P>
<P>
 To honor this "king of fruits" -- and try to earn some tourist revenue during 
a slack season -- the Indian capital played host earlier this month to the 7th 
International Mango Festival. Events included a quiz about mango lore and 
legend, a messy mango-eating contest and an eye-popping display at Talkatora 
Indoor Stadium of more than 500 domestic varieties, from the egg-size Anda to 
the Kakram Jabisaheb, as large as a gourd. 
</P>
<P>
 Madan Lal Khurana, the chief minister of the national capital territory of 
Delhi, inaugurated the festivities with a rousing speech praising the mango as 
so incredibly delicious that "even a diabetic is tempted to take a slice after 
meals." 
</P>
<P>
 It is also, Khurana said democratically, a fruit so cheap and plentiful that 
any Indian can afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the rain-soaked pavement outside, growers hawked mangoes from crates and 
their customers happily demonstrated the correct five-step eating technique: 
</P>
<P>
 Squeeze the mango all around to liquefy the inside; rip the skin off the top; 
suck the yellow-orange pulp as though eating an ice pop; when the seed emerges, 
chew the pulp off it and discard; continue to suck the mango until no pulp 
remains. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Patnaik, the Commerce Ministry's salesman, the mango's motherland 
accounts for about two-thirds of current global production. In the 12 months 
ending in April, India exported 21,000 tons of fresh whole fruit and 33,000 
tons of mango pulp for sauces, yogurt flavoring and tropical fruit juice, 
earning the country more than $34 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the richness of mango varieties masks the truth about the nature of 
today's international market and India's problems, he said. About 90% of the 
country's exports, it turns out, are Alphonso mangoes, primarily from the area 
around Bombay. The overwhelming majority of other varieties never leave the 
country because they simply don't please the foreign eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go by taste, we don't go by color, when we Indians decide what mango we 
like," said Patnaik, chairman of the ministry's Agricultural and Processed Food 
Products Export Development Authority. "Unlike you." 
</P>
<P>
 When Westerners buy a mango, Patnaik explained, they opt first for fruit whose 
skin has a rosy, peachlike blush. No matter how good its flavor, a green 
variety like the Benazir (the name means "peerless" and, like the Bhutto, is 
only coincidentally shared by the prime minister of India's archenemy, 
Pakistan) consequently appeals to few non-Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 To alert Indian mango growers and shippers to what the competition is up to 
and what pleases Western taste buds and eyes, Patnaik had rosy-cheeked mangoes 
from Kenya, Gambia, Jamaica, Venezuela and other producing countries flown into 
Delhi and put on display at the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unpopular varieties have trouble competing for a place in the supermarket," 
he noted in a speech at the festival opening. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an open invitation to the growers of India, his country, who have more 
than 1 million acres planted with mango trees, to reflect on whether their crop 
is the right variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian producers are faced with an additional, and very formidable, hurdle 
when it comes to the United States: They don't meet current Agriculture 
Department guidelines designed to guard against an infestation of the Oriental 
fruit fly. 
</P>
<P>
 That should now change, Patnaik said. The Japanese, who have similar 
regulations, are donating a pilot vapor-heat fruit treatment plant, to be 
constructed in the Delhi area, that would eliminate the fruit fly danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The next U.S. requirement would be on-site inspection to verify that the fruit 
is being properly treated, and Patnaik said his government has already asked 
that an Agriculture Department inspector be based in India. 
</P>
<P>
 As well as the whole fruit, Indians eat at least a score of mango dishes, 
including "hot mango pickle," where the mango is doused with an incendiary 
mixture of red chili powder, mustard powder, turmeric, fenugreek, salt and 
other spices. 
</P>
<P>
 For Indians, the mango is the symbol of life's pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 "But most Americans don't even know what a mango is," Patnaik charged. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to open the U.S. market to the Indian-grown delicacy that 
conquered Alexander the Great.

PLUTONIUM TRACED TO RUSSIAN PLANT, GERMANS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weapons-grade plutonium seized in Germany this spring -- the first known case 
of fissionable material falling into unauthorized hands -- originated at a 
plant in Russia, German media reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 One report said German intelligence sources believe high-ranking Russian 
officials were involved in the smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-fifth of an ounce of plutonium, discovered by police May 10 in a 
search for counterfeit money in the western state of Baden-Wurttemberg, is not 
enough to build a bomb but sufficient to poison a water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 But its existence, publicized by FBI Director Louis J. Freeh this month during 
a visit to Moscow, has caused alarm among authorities worried that such 
materials could fall into the hands of terrorists or outlaw states.

U.S. OPTIMISTIC SYRIA WILL JOIN PEACE PLAN; MIDEAST: CHRISTOPHER EMBARKS ON 
TRIP, WILL MEET ASSAD. NO BREAKTHROUGH EXPECTED THIS WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As Secretary of State Warren Christopher left Washington for the Middle East, 
U.S. officials expressed optimism Sunday that the momentum created by last 
week's Jordan-Israel breakthrough will help bring Syria into a comprehensive 
peace settlement by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 35-minute conversation between President Clinton and Syrian President 
Hafez Assad on Friday, the Syrian leader indicated that he is still committed 
to the peace process. He also said he would not stand in the way of Friday's 
decision by King Hussein of Jordan to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin in Washington on July 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assad made clear that as far as he is concerned, he is focused on what he is 
doing with us and the Israelis," a senior Administration official traveling 
with Christopher said. Of the breakthrough with Jordan, "He as much as said, 
'That's King Hussein's business.' He said it wasn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Syria has often either played spoiler in peace efforts from which 
Damascus was excluded or punished the parties who participated. During a 
mid-1980s peace effort, the Assad government was blamed for the assassinations 
of Jordanian diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he feels there is a chance of movement, he is committed to peace 
and to not spoiling the process pursued by others," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a July 4 letter to Clinton in honor of American independence, Assad also 
took the unusual step of reaffirming his commitment to peace, Administration 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. officials conceded that Christopher is unlikely to make any serious 
progress in negotiations between Syria and Israel during his weeklong trip. 
Talks with Assad are instead likely to be hand-holding exercises underscoring 
the U.S. commitment to a comprehensive peace in which Syria is a cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's going to want more reassurance that he's not going to be 
isolated," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the announcement Friday, a senior U.S. analyst had expressed concern 
that Assad would, at minimum, "go off in a corner and pout. He's likely to feel 
he's been ganged up on." Analysts feared he might try to slow down the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet since Friday, Syria's normally outspoken, state-controlled press has been 
unusually silent on the Jordanian breakthrough. It reported the news of the 
scheduled meeting between Hussein and Rabin without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also said they have not detected any movement of surrogate 
forces in Syrian-controlled regions of Lebanon, the traditional battleground 
between Israel and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 During Christopher's sixth Mideast shuttle, international attention is likely 
to focus primarily on talks among U.S., Israeli and Jordanian foreign ministers 
on Wednesday. But U.S. officials said Israel is also still tightly focused on 
Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis are ready to do serious business. They understand that without 
Assad they can't assume what they have now with the Palestinians and Jordan is 
not irreversible," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he added, is that the gap between the Syrian and Israeli 
positions on a land-for-peace swap centered on the strategic Golan Heights is 
still wide. And the danger is that the Jordan track will move even further 
ahead of Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Assad comes to believe there will be no progress on his track, then the 
risk of him playing spoiler goes up dramatically," the official added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher is not bringing with him any package of incentives to ensure 
Assad's cooperation or to encourage a Syria-Israel breakthrough. U.S. officials 
said they thought awareness that Syria stands to be left behind should serve as 
sufficient incentive.

 The World Cup Soccer championship was fought with passion and verve over 
buffalo wings and beer at a local watering hole Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, some fans were hanging their heads in apparent despair while 
others were dancing on the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel vivacious, man!" Waldir DaCosta, 36, a Brazilian immigrant who's lived 
in Costa Mesa for 11 years, said excitedly after watching his team eke out a 
3-2 victory over the Italians in a game that went into overtime and was finally 
decided on penalty kicks. "I've been waiting for this day; that's my Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ron DeViso, 28, also of Costa Mesa, saw things differently. DeViso, who 
claims Italian descent, had promised victory as a birthday present to his 
31-year-old fiancee, Stacy Harter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel awful," he said, holding his head as if in pain. "I'm kind of 
depressed, to put it mildly." 
</P>
<P>
 Both fans were among the estimated 400 soccer enthusiasts who turned out at 
Legends Sports Bar on Sunday to watch the World Cup's final game on 28 
television screens. The crowd was about the same size as that usually watching 
the Super Bowl, but a lot more lively, manager Eileen Derham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some pretty boisterous people here," she said of the 
standing-room-only crowd, which seemed to erupt into pandemonium at every 
near-goal, save or forceful play by anyone on the field. "This is great. I love 
it. We're doing very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fans said they or their ancestors had come from countries where 
soccer has long been a national sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're European, so we're rooting for Italy," said Helen Fletcher, 23, who 
moved to Orange County two years ago from England to work as a nanny. "I love 
this; it reminds me of home. We're all soccer bums over there." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Prado, describing himself as an Orange County resident of Latino descent, 
said he felt strongly enough about the Brazilian team to have bet $350 on its 
victory. "This is a blast," he said. "There's no sporting event in the world 
like this; it's the best." 
</P>
<P>
 And Stuart Timms, another fan from England, said that he had bet $200 on the 
Brazilian team simply to spite his friends. "They're all going for Italy," said 
Timms, 24, a carpenter who now lives in Newport Beach. "I wanted to go against 
them to get an atmosphere going." 
</P>
<P>
 Most agreed on Sunday afternoon that the atmosphere was definitely going . 
</P>
<P>
 As tables of fans bellowed soccer chants, others frantically waved Brazilian 
or Italian flags. They stood on tables or sat in the aisles. They hugged each 
other and gleefully swigged their beers. And whenever something exciting 
happened on the screen, the roar was almost deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ruckus, though, most fans agreed that the competition was 
good-natured and ultimately unifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only sport that brings the world together," Timms said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Prado: "You sing your heart out and it takes you away from your 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they had come fairly recently to the sport, drawn by the fact that 
the World Cup games were taking place in Pasadena, with the winning Brazilian 
team staying at the nearby Fullerton Marriott Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a sports fan," said Rhonda Seiter of Huntington Beach. "You have to 
pull my leg to go to a sporting event; I think baseball and football are too 
slow." 
</P>
<P>
 But after watching a few World Cup games, the 33-year-old travel agent said 
she became hooked. "It's a fun game," she said. "I wanted to go to the stadium, 
but it cost $800, so this was the next best thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Kearns, a 27-year-old mortgage banker from Woodland Hills, said he viewed 
the phenomenon as much a cultural as a sporting event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't call myself a fan," he said, "but this is the World Cup. I'm 
enjoying the way the crowd is getting into it; you don't see this kind of 
enthusiasm in American professional sports." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused a moment before offering his final thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think half the people here give a hoot who wins," observed Kearns, 
describing himself as an Irishman rooting for the Italians. "I think they're 
just getting into the nationalism of it."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Haven Hills offers counseling, a crisis hot line and an emergency shelter for 
battered women and their children. The hot line was established in 1977, 
followed by a counseling program in 1978 and the shelter's opening in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, the shelter served 127 battered women and 235 of their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Of these women and children, 25% were African Americans; 30% were white; 41% 
were Latino; 2% were American Indian, and 1% were Asian Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty percent of the shelter residents were age 5 or younger; 20% were between 
6 and 11; 3% were between 12 and 17; 9% were between 18 and 23; 26% were 
between 24 and 44; 1% were between 45 and 54, and 1% were aged 55 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993-94, Haven Hills also provided 753 individual counseling sessions for 
302 women, and held 156 group counseling meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,849 women received crisis intervention counseling on the 24-hour hot 
line last year. BETH SHUSTER

SUSPECT LEADS AUTHORITIES TO BURIED BODY 
</P>

<P>
 After a murder suspect showed them where to search along a road in the Angeles 
National Forest, authorities Sunday unearthed what they believe are the remains 
of a 73-year-old man missing for 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said they were led to the makeshift grave by Michael Benanti, 
37, a Palmdale landscaper arrested last week in the murder of James Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives said that after several hours of questioning, Benanti led 
them along Lake Hughes Road in the national forest and pointed out the spot 
where he had buried Young. The Quartz Hill resident had been missing since he 
left for a Las Vegas vacation in February, 1993, said Sheriff's Detective Mike 
Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti "decided there was too much on his conscience and he told us Mr. Young 
was dead and he buried him and he would take us to where he was," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's autopsy is expected later this week to determine the cause of 
death, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti lived in Young's house for a year after the older man disappeared, 
telling neighbors and authorities that Young had met a Mexican woman in Las 
Vegas, fallen in love, moved to Mexico and left him to tend to his business 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti is to be arraigned today.

FOOD-STAMP FRAUD, ERRORS COST U.S. $1.8 BILLION

 Thousands of Americans pocketed more than $1.8 billion in food-stamp benefits 
they were not entitled to receive last year -- a record loss that the 
Agriculture Department blames on mistakes and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to key members of Congress, the Agriculture Department said 
that 8.29% of food-stamp benefits went to people who were ineligible or 
collected more than they were entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, thousands of low-income people were denied benefits totaling 
$559 million because of mistakes made in running one of the welfare programs.

TOBACCO INDUSTRY STRIKES BACK TO CURB ANTI-SMOKING ONSLAUGHT; PUBLIC RELATIONS: 
NEW STRATEGY INCLUDES PORTRAYING RESTRICTIONS AS AFFRONTS TO INDIVIDUAL CHOICE. 
DISCREDITING RESEARCH IS ALSO A TACTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reeling from an unprecedented assault on smoking, the tobacco industry has 
revamped its lobbying and public relations strategy in recent months and is 
aggressively striking back with campaigns that include attempts to portray Big 
Government as the enemy of individual choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes reflect a new reality in Washington, where the tobacco lobby has 
lost a lot of clout in the last year, and in state capitals, where proposed 
anti-smoking regulations and class-action lawsuits on behalf of smokers have 
proliferated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The intensity of the attacks the industry is faced with have clearly gone up, 
and clearly, we have to do something different to get our message out," said 
Brennan Dawson, a vice president of the Washington-based Tobacco Institute, the 
long-established voice of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is under fire on many fronts. The Food and Drug Administration is 
considering a proposal to regulate the nicotine content of cigarettes, Congress 
is weighing a big tax increase on tobacco products and a ban on smoking in 
virtually every public building, and the Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration has proposed a ban on smoking in any workplace, including bars 
and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks started coming at a time when tobacco companies, who were reducing 
their own payrolls, began to cut back sharply on funds for the big-spending 
Tobacco Institute. The institute's budget was chopped from $40 million last 
year to $15 million in 1994 and its staff was cut in half, from 80 to 40. 
</P>
<P>
 To respond to the attacks, companies are now individually aiming at trying to 
discredit government findings on the dangers of secondhand smoke. Other new 
tobacco tactics include appearances by tobacco company scientists on radio talk 
shows, presentations before newspaper editorial boards and even school 
educational programs. RJR Nabisco said it is conducting a campaign to win 
public approval by urging middle-school students not to start smoking before 
they reach legal smoking age. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, tobacco farmers and tobacco workers are being enlisted for 
grass-roots lobbying efforts to promote the product. Also, while Congress and 
federal government actions remain a major concern, tobacco companies are 
focusing more on state legislatures and local governing bodies in an attempt to 
stave off regulations they oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991-92 election cycle, for example, California's state lawmakers got 
an average $10,000 each from tobacco interests. Total contributions to 
congressional candidates totaled $2.3 million over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Tobacco Institute's role diminished, tobacco giants Philip Morris and 
RJR Nabisco led the counteroffensive with separate advertising blitzes to 
advocate "peaceful coexistence" between smokers and nonsmokers as part of a 
campaign to avert more government controls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to let smokers and nonsmokers work out their differences without 
government coming in," said Thomas C. Griscom, executive vice president for 
external relations of RJR Nabisco. "Accommodation clearly has broad appeal and 
broad support . . . . The question is at what point does government become 
intrusive in making choices for people." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, industry leaders have mounted a concerted, although belated, 
attack on a 1993 report by the Environmental Protection Agency concerning the 
dangers of secondhand smoke. The report said secondhand smoke can cause cancer 
and estimated that 3,000 nonsmokers die each year because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 That report got wide attention and gave impetus to those who wanted to ban 
smoking in public places, such as restaurants, office buildings and factories. 
It led the Pentagon, for example, to sharply curtail smoking at military bases 
around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris recently placed ads in eight major newspapers to reprint a 
magazine article critical of the EPA report, challenging the scientific basis 
for the findings by the federal agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The article was written by the former managing editor of Reason magazine, 
published by the Reason Foundation, a Santa Monica-based think tank. It said, 
in effect, that the federal agency juggled statistics to make its case and 
lowered its standards for judging the harmful impact of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of EPA's science in the article, however, relied heavily on 
researchers who have received significant tobacco industry funds in the past, 
such as Alvan Feinstein, a Yale epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, both Philip Morris and its subsidiary, Kraft General Foods, were 
listed as "major donors" in the Foundation's 1993 annual report. Ellen Merlo, 
vice president for corporate affairs at Phillip Morris, said there was no 
connection between the donations and the article. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that her company is a major advertiser, spending far larger sums with 
other publications, Merlo said: "I don't believe a small grant to the Reason 
Foundation is going to influence them." 
</P>
<P>
 The article did include a conclusion that was contrary to the tobacco 
industry's view -- that scientific evidence has clearly demonstrated that 
smoking causes lung cancer and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), a leading anti-smoking advocate in Congress, 
doubted that the advertising campaign would have much impact, saying: "They are 
grasping for respectability . . . . When you buy full-page ads that read like 
Pravda, people are not going to rally to your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the effect of the public relations effort, the tobacco lobby 
still shows its muscle on Capitol Hill. A group of 20 House members from 
tobacco-growing areas have managed to reduce a proposed tax increase on tobacco 
products by warning they would not support any health care legislation with a 
larger tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco state lawmakers also remain entrenched on key committees where bills 
to regulate tobacco must originate and, by getting cooperation from House 
members concerned with other specialty crops such as rice and sugar, often 
prevail in committees. 
</P>
<P>
 But congressional views are changing. A recent survey by Roll Call, a Capitol 
Hill newspaper, showed that only six of 100 senators and 37 of 435 House 
members listed themselves as smokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco company officials said they are still evaluating the results of their 
more aggressive strategy.

GOVERNORS ATTACK DOLE'S PLAN FOR HEALTH REFORM; SPENDING: BIPARTISAN GROUP 
CRITICIZES PROVISION IN GOP PROPOSAL TO CAP MEDICAID PAYMENTS. CONCERNS ARE 
ALSO RAISED OVER DEMOCRATS' MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Republicans' major health care reform proposal came under bipartisan 
attack at the National Governors' Assn. meeting Sunday on charges that it would 
gouge tens of billions of dollars from state treasuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors also voiced concern about the fiscal impact of Democratic reform 
measures at the opening of the three-day conclave. President Clinton's 
strategists view the meeting as a key battleground in his effort to prod 
Congress into overhauling the nation's health system before its mid-August 
recess. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main focus of criticism Sunday was a controversial provision in Senate 
Republican Leader Bob Dole's plan to cap Medicaid payments to states, which 
subsidize health care for the poor. The attacks set the stage for a rhetorical 
duel between Clinton and Dole (R-Kan.), when both address the governors 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) happily joined in the attack 
on Dole's proposal. At the same time, he assured the governors that he was in 
general agreement with their criteria for legislation to help expand and 
improve coverage without bankrupting states. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic governors led the way Sunday in the assault on the Medicaid cap in 
Dole's proposal, which has gained the support of all but five of the Senate's 
44 Republicans. The Kansas senator would use the money to pay for health 
insurance coverage for low-income groups. But the governors complained that the 
net result would leave states holding the financial bag, because they would 
still operate under federal mandates to subsidize health care for Medicaid 
recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles of Florida, a member of the association's health 
care leadership team, estimated the cost of the Dole proposal to the states at 
$150 billion over eight years. "To me that would be the worst of all things 
that would happen," Chiles said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Democratic Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado confronted Sen. Don Nickles 
(R-Okla.) on the issue, Nickles, chairman of the GOP Senate Leadership 
Committee and a backer of the Dole proposal, said that Republicans were "very 
receptive" to the governors' complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole said Sunday on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation" that he is listening to the 
governors. "We'll try to work out this cap. We think there are ways we can do 
it . . . . The last thing we want to do is to tie the governors' hands, whether 
they be Democrats or Republicans." 
</P>
<P>
 The governors have long been opposed to any caps on federal spending for 
Medicaid. And on Sunday, the governors' association staff belatedly released a 
letter that said: "Governors could not be more united in their opposition" to 
the idea of capping Medicaid spending. The letter was signed by Republican Gov. 
Carroll A. Campbell Jr. of South Carolina, chairman of the association; 
Democratic Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont, vice chairman; Romer and his Republican 
co-chairman of the health care team, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy G. Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was sent to Mitchell and Dole in the Senate, as well as House 
Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and House Minority Leader Robert H. 
Michel (R-Ill.). It also ticked off other health care issues on which the 
governors have taken a stand. The issues were initially set forth in a policy 
statement adopted at the February meeting of the governors' group. These 
included recommendations for federal insurance reforms and other legislation to 
assure states the flexibility to experiment with "innovative" approaches to 
health care. 
</P>
<P>
 In addressing the governors, Mitchell referred to most of the items in the 
letter and said he agreed with them. He also noted the complaint about the 
Medicaid cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "You said you don't like Sen. Dole's proposal, and you shouldn't, because it 
will devastate your state's budgets," Mitchell said. But he warned: "If we 
don't enact health care reform this year, that (Dole's) proposal will be back 
next year in one form or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Gov. Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania, a longtime foe of abortion 
rights, complained that a number of Democratic measures require that abortions 
be covered among other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" Sunday, incoming White House Chief of Staff 
Leon E. Panetta indicated that the Administration would be willing to 
compromise on the abortion issue, which threatens the passage of any health 
care bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion, he said, is a matter of choice and "should not be imposed by the 
government one way or the other." The Administration's goal, he added, "is to 
work with both the House and the Senate to try to come up with an approach 
that, frankly, provides that choice." 
</P>
<P>
 He appeared to be talking about provisions in some of the health plans that 
allow employers to opt out of covering abortion -- as well as a similar escape 
clause for medical providers.

MITCHELL, GEPHARDT LEAD CHARGE FOR HEALTH BILL; LEGISLATION: DEMOCRATIC CHIEFS 
FROM BOTH HOUSES MUST STRIKE A BALANCE THAT WILL APPEASE REPUBLICANS BUT 
FULFILL PRESIDENT'S PROMISES ON REFORM. TIME IS RUNNING OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All week long, more than half the Senate -- some members individually, others 
in groups -- found its way into the second-floor office of Majority Leader 
George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the rotunda, House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) huddled 
daily with key committee and subcommittee chairmen, other House leaders and 
individual members. 
</P>
<P>
 The two veteran legislators are fully engaged in perhaps the most difficult 
task they have ever faced: Each must sort his way through shifting internal 
factions, massive campaigns by powerful interest groups and intricate technical 
details to come up with a single, exquisitely balanced piece of health reform 
legislation that can withstand what promises to be a brutal fight on the floors 
of each house. 
</P>
<P>
 Two House and two Senate committees already have gone through the process of 
devising legislation designed to reform the nation's health care system, and 
the results of their efforts are useful. So too is the cautionary lesson of one 
House committee that struggled for months and ultimately gave up. 
</P>
<P>
 But none has found the formula that can both meet President Clinton's 
bottom-line goal of assuring health care coverage for everyone and win enough 
support to gain congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Now time is running out. Both houses are racing to approve bills by mid-August 
-- to give them enough time when Congress returns after its summer recess to 
put together and pass a final version. Lawmakers hope to adjourn for the year 
in early October, and the health legislation, or lack of it, is certain to be a 
major issue in fall election campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gephardt, the work is fairly straightforward. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is no Republican votes can be had in the House," said 
one strategist who has worked closely with the Administration. "Gephardt's task 
is to find 218 Democrats who will vote for something the President can, with a 
straight face, call universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Gephardt put it this way: "It's more or less what I do all 
the time, but it obviously is a bigger task, because the bill is more 
complicated, more important and it's been a longer effort." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Mitchell, who is working with a thinner Democratic majority and an 
institution whose rules give him very little control once the bill reaches the 
floor, the job is one of almost metaphysical dimensions. 
</P>
<P>
 He must offer legislation conciliatory enough to head off a potentially deadly 
GOP filibuster and avoid alienating the moderates and conservatives within his 
own party. At the same time, he cannot give up so much that the bill falls 
short of the President's promise of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell also must worry about how his legislation is perceived in the House. 
Last year, many House members took the politically risky step of voting for the 
President's controversial energy tax, only to see it die in the Senate. Many 
there have vowed that they will not again climb out on a limb unless they are 
certain the Senate will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to contend with people keeping one eye on the Senate and the Senate 
keeping one eye on us," said House Majority Whip David E. Bonior (D-Mich.). 
"Plus, the emotional issues involved here -- mandates, revenues, abortion, 
employment issues -- these are really hot items all by themselves. When lumped 
together, they really create a caldron of difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, there is ultimately the question of whether this entire 
process produces something that is, as Mitchell put it, "a coherent whole that 
represents the right policy for this country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to propose something just because somebody likes it," he added. 
"There has to be an internal compass to these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Gephardt readily admits that he and other leaders are not seeking 
perfection. "The reality of health care today has a lot of flaws, but the 
solution to it is not without flaws and difficulties," he said. "There's no 
ideal thing you can do here." 
</P>
<P>
 House leaders hope to produce at least an early draft of a bill this week. As 
its starting point, it will use the legislation produced by the House Ways and 
Means Committee, which would achieve universal coverage by expanding the 
Medicare program and requiring employers to pay 80% of their workers' health 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 That so-called employer mandate is the most controversial element of both the 
Clinton proposal and the Ways and Means bill. House leaders are exploring the 
possibility of phasing in the mandate more slowly, so that businesses and their 
workers could have more time to adjust to the idea. As an additional measure of 
reassurance, they are closely studying, with computer simulations, how best the 
government might subsidize businesses to help them offset the costs of 
providing coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've done is run different hypothetical firms of different 
sizes, different wage mixes to see how, in reality, different firms would come 
out," Gephardt said. "The analogy we've been using is the minimum wage 
increase, and that's been a useful analysis to go through. We're still working 
with different scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is also considering a range of ideas that might make it easier for 
his troops to support an employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 One, offered by Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee Chairman Edward M. 
Kennedy (D-Mass.), would reduce the employer obligation to 50% of their 
workers' premium costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if they can find a way to pass the mandate, or a way to reach 
universal coverage without it, there are dozens of controversial issues to be 
resolved. They range from cost controls to abortion coverage to changes in 
malpractice and insurance laws to how Medicaid would be treated under a new 
health system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 20 or 30 of these, and they all relate to one another," Gephardt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And not all the behind-the-scenes action is happening within the leaderships 
of the two houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Informal networks are taking shape in both the House and the Senate, as 
like-minded lawmakers see if they can use their numbers for leverage as a group 
of moderate Republicans and conservative Democrats did in the Senate Finance 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they held the swing votes and voted as a bloc, the seven senators who 
called themselves the "mainstream coalition" managed to take effective control 
of the panel and pass a relatively modest measure that falls well short of 
universal coverage. Of the four committee bills, it was the only one with 
significant support from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 That group is seeking to do the same on the Senate floor and its numbers are 
growing. "What I would like to do is use the Finance Committee bill as the 
vehicle" for Senate debate, said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), who has joined the 
group. "The Finance Committee bill began as a bipartisan effort, and it has the 
greatest chance to end up as a bipartisan effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sen. Max Baucus (D-Mont.), who defected from the Finance Committee 
group when the limits of its bill became clear, said there is sentiment for yet 
another approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finding, frankly, that a lot of (senators) want something between the 
Finance Committee bill and the President's plan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Baucus said, their discussions are informal and educational. "It 
may lead to something and it may not. We just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, the biggest challenge to the leadership could come from a 
similar coalition that now claims almost a quarter of the House among its 
members. It is being organized by Reps. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) and Fred Grandy 
(R-Iowa), backers of a more conservative health care proposal that once had 
been considered the leading competitor to the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are working with supporters of a minimalist proposal that essentially 
would fix what have been considered the most egregious flaws of the current 
insurance system but would not reach universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 They, too, see the Finance Committee bill as their model. Cooper said it has 
given his group "new momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Grandy: "The best thing about the Senate Finance bill is that it lowers 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 If they can manage to reach agreement and stay united, they could prove a 
formidable force on the House floor. In a letter Friday to Gephardt, they 
demanded that they at least be given a vote on their plan, if it materializes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe such an approach is an appropriate starting point for floor 
debate, and will attract broad-based support. . . . This alternative should be 
considered by the full House in the same manner as all other proposals," the 
group wrote.

SCIENTISTS THRILLED BY BIRTH OF FISH, SALAMANDERS ABOARD SPACE SHUTTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baby fish and salamanders popped out of eggs at record speed aboard the space 
shuttle Columbia on Sunday, thrilling scientists who want to know how human 
babies might develop in space. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's in the future," said Japanese project scientist Shunji Nagaoka. 
</P>
<P>
 Astronaut Richard Hieb reported that six or seven fish hatched, the result of 
orbital trysts. Researchers said it is the first known case of vertebrates -- 
in this case guppylike Japanese Medaka fish -- mating and reproducing in space. 
</P>
<P>
 There was bad news, however, on the mechanical front: Hieb flushed bubbles 
from a jammed cell-separating machine and got it running for the first time in 
the flight -- but only for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers need the Japanese-made unit for experiments involving worm DNA, 
rat growth hormones and mouse cellular secretions. The unit uses an electric 
field to separate cell components. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sunday, nine days into the laboratory research mission, about 18 newts 
and innumerable baby fish had been born on Columbia. All of them appeared 
normal, Nagaoka said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists are studying the mating, development and behavior of aquatic 
animals in weightlessness to see if astronauts could raise fish for food and 
have healthy babies in space -- necessities if humans are to ever live 
permanently in space.

 A strike against the Bay Area Rapid Transit District was averted Sunday night 
when the rail system's board of directors asked Gov. Pete Wilson to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect BART service to be provided as regularly scheduled tomorrow," board 
President Margaret Pryor said about two hours before a strike was scheduled to 
start at 12:01 a.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he had notified all parties that he was appointing a three-judge 
board to investigate the situation.

BOSNIAN SERBS EXPEL 800 MUSLIMS FROM TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA SILBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of Muslims were reportedly dragged from their homes or rounded up on 
the streets of a northeastern Bosnian town as Serbian leaders warned Sunday of 
an all-out war and recommended that their legislature reject an international 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 About 800 Muslims -- men older than 50, women and children -- were rounded up 
this weekend in Bijeljina by a Bosnian Serb paramilitary group, according to 
eyewitnesses in the town near Bosnia's border with Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials confirmed the forced expulsions, the biggest since September, 
from the town of 35,000, where Muslims were in the majority before Serbian 
forces took it over in April, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsions are yet another sign of Serbian defiance of the international 
community's insistence that Bosnia-Herzegovina remain a unified country 
composed of two ethnic mini-states. 
</P>
<P>
 The clock is ticking toward Tuesday's deadline for the rival assemblies of the 
Bosnian Serb and Muslim-Croatian federation to vote on the peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic put it bluntly, saying the Serbs would 
say "no if the international community presses us into a corner," the Bosnian 
Serb news agency SRNA reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan gives the Muslim-Croatian federation 51% of Bosnia, forcing the Serbs 
to pull back from some of the 70% of the country they have conquered during two 
years of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian government has indicated that it will recommend that its 
Parliament adopt the plan when deputies meet in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo 
today, but only because Serbian rejection is likely. Bosnian Serb Deputy 
Premier Vitomir Popovic said the plan put forward by the United States, Russia 
and Western European countries is "absolutely unacceptable for the Serbian 
people and should be rejected in its entirety." 
</P>
<P>
 By voting against the plan, Bosnian Serb representatives to the self-styled 
assembly would defy threats of tightened U.N. sanctions on Serbia and 
Montenegro, which together make up what remains of Yugoslavia, and risk the 
lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia's Muslim-led government. They say 
the plan would mean surrendering their "state" and 13 important towns and 
strategic territory. The plan forces them to concede land in the northern 
corridor, which is key for linking Serbia proper with Serb-held territory in 
Bosnia and Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 Karadzic warned of a total war if the Serbs vote for an outright rejection, 
saying, "In this case, all people will have to be mobilized, including women." 
Diplomats, however, believe the Serbian assembly will try to couch their "no" 
as a "yes, but" vote in the hopes of breaking the fragile consensus in the 
international community. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Sunday that NATO and the 
United States face deeper military involvement in Bosnia whether or not the 
warring parties decide to accept the peace plan, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 If the factions reject the plan, it could lead to rapid expansion of North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization air protection of "safe areas" and a spread of the 
civil war to other nations, Perry warned during a visit to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the plan is accepted, it will mean sending thousands of U.S. and other 
peacekeeping troops to Bosnia, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the weekend's attempt by Serbs to expel any remaining minorities in what 
they hope will be a Greater Serbia, about 4,000 Muslims remained in Bijeljina, 
many losing their jobs, property and homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fear for our lives," said a non-Serb woman speaking by telephone from the 
town on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. "They barged into the 
apartment of an old Muslim woman and dragged her away."

RWANDANS CRUSHED IN RUSH TO GAIN SAFETY AT ZAIRE BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN C. RANDAL, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Spurred by intensive rebel mortar and machine-gun fire, tens of thousands of 
Rwandan civilians and routed soldiers streamed in panic across the border to 
safety in Zaire on Sunday, trampling fellow Hutus to death in the pandemonium. 
</P>
<P>
 They were fleeing the Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels, predominantly Tutsis, 
who are driving toward the border after destroying the resistance of the Hutu 
government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The victorious rebels, meanwhile, threw down the gauntlet to French troops who 
are in Rwanda to help protect refugees, saying they would enter a 
French-controlled zone in the south unless former government ministers were 
turned over to them. The French Foreign Ministry responded by saying France 
will not tolerate any armed incursions into its zone, the Reuters news agency 
reported from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 With panic increasing and the Goma airport's perimeter under attack, the day 
was Goma's most violent since the mass exodus of Hutus began on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 40 and 50 Rwandan civilians, most of them children, were trampled to 
death by panicky refugees trying to escape rebel fire, according to French 
photographer Charles Caratina, who took pictures of the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 other refugees were killed by two mortar shell explosions near the 
main border crossing between Gisenyi and Goma, according to another French 
photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 This attack was followed by the rebels' warning that they would attack the 
French humanitarian protection zone in southwestern Rwanda unless France handed 
over interim Hutu President Theodore Sindikukwabo and three of his ministers 
who sought refuge there with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, French military spokesmen said that the rebels appeared to have 
reached Gisenyi. Smoke and fires were visible in the onetime resort on the 
banks of Lake Kivu, they said.

CRIME AGAINST TEEN-AGERS RISING RAPIDLY; VIOLENCE: NEW REPORT SAYS 1 IN 13 
JUVENILES WAS A VICTIM IN 1992. RENO CITES LATEST STATISTICS IN STRESSING THE 
NEED TO PASS LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One in 13 juveniles was the victim of a violent crime in 1992, the Justice 
Department reported Sunday, confirming that violence against teen-agers is 
rapidly rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on its annual survey of households, the government concluded that crimes 
committed against young people had risen 23% since 1987. Overall, youths from 
12 to 17 are five times more likely to be crime victims than adults older than 
35, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime trend involving juveniles "is sharply up, and this is greatly 
troubling," said John J. Wilson, acting administrator of the Office of Juvenile 
Justice and Delinquency Prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics interviews members of selected households 
each year and uses the information to project annual trends in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1992, it estimated that 6.6 million people were victims of violent 
crime, such as assault, robbery or rape. Of these, 1.55 million, or nearly one 
in four, were juveniles ages 12 to 17, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple assault in which weapons were not involved and injuries were not 
serious accounted for 56% of the crime reports for juveniles. About 27% of the 
crimes against juveniles involved aggravated assaults. The report did not 
include separate data on the most serious crimes, such as rape and murder, 
because the number of incidents reported was too small to make accurate 
projections. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said the rising tide of violence among young people 
offers "compelling proof that we must get the crime bill to President Clinton's 
desk. The crime bill's combination of policing, punishment and prevention will 
give us the tools we need to help reduce this grim toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the White House confirmed Sunday that it wants to drop from the 
pending crime bill a controversial provision that would allow defense lawyers 
to challenge the death penalty through the use of statistics on the race of 
those condemned. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the "racial justice" measure on NBC-TV's "Meet the Press" on 
Sunday, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta replied: "First and 
foremost, we want a tough crime bill enacted. This is a good bill, and we ought 
not to let it go down" over an impasse regarding appeals in death penalty 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans have pledged to block passage of the crime bill if the 
provision is included. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP opponents of the measure have derided it as a "quota bill" for the death 
penalty and insisted that it would stop all executions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton strongly supports the crime bill, which would pay for 100,000 more 
police officers, ban some assault weapons, increase funding for prisons and 
provide employment and recreation programs for urban youths. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has been noticeably silent on the racial justice measure, which the 
House passed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week Panetta told leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus that the 
President wanted the provision dropped in order to save the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Don Edwards (D-San Jose), prime sponsor of the racial justice measure, is 
reportedly seeking a modified version that would apply only to federal capital 
cases, a tiny segment of the overall death penalty system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Sunday that he doubted a 
compromise version could win passage.

CHENEY NETS MEN'S 45 TENNIS TITLE 
</P>

 Brian Cheney said he had to "hang in there" to have a chance to beat two-time 
champion Charlie Hoeveler in the singles final of the U. S. Tennis Assn. 
National Men's 45 Hard Court Championships here Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly didn't look that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Cheney, a Santa Monica native who resides in Chandler, Ariz., beat 
Hoeveler, 6-4, 6-2, at the Westlake Tennis & Swim Club. Hoeveler's only chance 
for success, it seemed, was by not letting Cheney return it. 
</P>
<P>
 Period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeveler, a finesse player, played keep-away with Cheney by hitting lobs and 
drop shots. "(Hoeveler will) get his opponents tired because he's a tremendous 
athlete," said Cheney, 46. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoeveler, 49, gave Cheney trouble early. But late in the first set, Cheney saw 
that he could take some shooting angles away from Hoeveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 5-4, Cheney served out the set with an aggressive love game. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on set point, Cheney moved under a 20-foot-high lob and smashed it down 
the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I played badly," Hoeveler said. "He's just a level above 
anybody I played in this tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The second set opened with Hoeveler losing on serve then wasting a break point 
on Cheney's first serve to trail, 2-0.

O.C. ENTERPRISE: SHINING PROSPECTS; FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT FOR DIAMOND'S HIGH-BEAM 
FLASHLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flashlights have taken on many new shapes, sizes and colors over the years, 
but their basic technology hasn't changed much since they were invented a 
century ago. That's why Lowell Way thinks he has a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Way is president of Diamond Light Industries Inc., a Costa Mesa company that 
turned a 12-year-old patent for a high-beam lens into a new battery-powered 
flashlight that's significantly brighter than others. Independent lab tests 
sponsored by Diamond Light show its krypton-bulb flashlights are 20% to 30% 
brighter than comparable models. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing else like it," Way says, holding up one of the slim, square 
lanterns, which are about six inches long and wide and have a rotating handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retailers say Diamond Light's launch in January got off to a quick start, 
boosted by a rush for flashlight purchases after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve DeNault, whose family owns five True Value hardware stores in Orange 
County, placed his order in mid-January after testing Diamond Light along with 
other brands in a dark attic at his store in Laguna Niguel. Since then, DeNault 
says he's sold about 300 Diamond Lights at $21.99 each -- more units than any 
other brand. "It's kind of the next flashlight to come," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Way, 46, raised almost $2 million to get the flashlight to the market, much of 
it from Cimco Inc., a Costa Mesa plastics manufacturer that's making the 
products for Diamond Light. Cimco says its current plan is to produce 400,000 
units in its first year. Way, however, won't say how many flashlights his 
company has sold to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Light flashlights are currently sold in about 1,000 hardware and 
general retail outlets nationwide, including Meijer Inc.'s chain of 116 
mass-merchandise stores in the Midwest. And in the fall, Way says, the company 
will begin offering two smaller and cheaper versions of its current model. 
</P>
<P>
 Way says he hopes to secure much more shelf space, especially at 
warehouse-style retailers like Irvine's HomeBase chain, where Diamond Light is 
now being tested. But even then, it won't be easy going up against established 
rivals like Rayovac, Eveready, Garrity and Mag Instruments, which dominate the 
$340-million-a-year domestic flashlight industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kouba, brand manager for Rayovac Corp. in Madison, Wis., which has been 
making flashlights since 1906, says he hasn't seen the Diamond Light product. 
But he says that one of Rayovac's latest models is a square, compact lantern 
that uses a krypton bulb, which is much brighter than an ordinary bulb. And 
Rayovac's lantern retails for about $10. "It's difficult for a new entrant to 
break in because of the competitive nature of the industry," Kouba says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Garrity, founder and chairman of Garrity Industries in Madison, Conn., 
has not seen Diamond Light's flashlight either. But he says Diamond Light "is 
on the right track if it has something new and different. There aren't many new 
things in the flashlight industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time anyone shook up the flashlight industry was in the early 1980s 
when Ontario-based Mag Instruments came out with its pocket-sized, metal 
flashlights. Mag's flashlights have since become a favorite with police 
officers and mechanics, and the company has carved out a whole new category of 
premium flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Diamond Light hopes to do the same with its new technology. "A flashlight 
is a toy," Way says, adding that people will be drawn by its novelty. 
</P>
<P>
 Way, who has an master's degree in business administration from USC, spent 10 
years running his own home-improvement products import and distribution company 
in Laguna Hills before he sold it and founded Diamond Light in the fall of 
1992. By then, the patent for Diamond Light's flashlight -- which has to do 
with diamond-shaped ridges on its lens that enable more light to be captured 
than ordinary parabolic lens -- was already 10 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say 99% of all inventions never make it to the market, and this one 
might not have made it either had it not been for a chance meeting in mid-1992 
between Way and physicist David Pelka, one of the inventors of the lens 
technology who made the discovery while doing research on solar energy at Cal 
State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Pelka had previously developed a prototype of the flashlight, and Way took it 
home with him, testing it outside on a summer's moonless night and in his 
garage at his Laguna Niguel home. "I knew they were on to something," Way says. 
</P>
<P>
 Before committing, Way flew to Chicago that summer to a hardware trade show to 
see what other flashlight makers were up to. "I went up and down the aisles, 
and there was nothing new," Way recalls. "I knew we had a clear opening in the 
marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Way then hit the road, crisscrossing the country interviewing buyers for True 
Value, Home Depot, Kmart and several others. The reaction was favorable, and 
Way jotted down notes and quotes from his interviews so he could show them 
later to prospective investors. Way then drafted a 100-page business plan, and 
in October, 1992, he formed Diamond Light. 
</P>
<P>
 Way had planned to produce the flashlights in Asia, but during a cocktail 
meeting he ran into an executive at Cimco. Eventually, Way met Russ Gilbert, 
Cimco's chairman. Gilbert, a former mechanical engineer at Hughes Aircraft, was 
familiar with optics and says he was taken by Diamond Light's technology. "It's 
probably the first major breakthrough applicable to flashlights," Gilbert says. 
</P>
<P>
 Way declined to identify his company's other investors, saying only that it 
was a "group of rugged individuals." But both Way and Pelka, the physicist, 
have a stake in the company. Pelka, who now runs TIR Technologies, a research 
and development firm in Costa Mesa, says he has an equity interest in Diamond 
Light plus an agreement to receive royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Way says his investment in the company has been mainly "sweat, tears and 
sleep," or lack of it. "We basically feel we've cleared most of the hurdles to 
bring it to the market," he says. Diamond Light Industries Inc.

EISNER SURGERY RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ROLE; ENTERTAINMENT: THE DISNEY 
CHAIRMAN'S QUADRUPLE BYPASS OPERATION COULD FORCE HIM TO NAME A NO. 2 PERSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner recovering from emergency 
quadruple bypass surgery, there was growing concern inside and outside the 
company on Sunday that he will be forced to appoint a second in command. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner has been filling in as president and chief operating officer of the 
entertainment conglomerate since April, when Frank Wells died in a helicopter 
crash. In interviews, Eisner has repeatedly said he plans to retain Wells' 
titles indefinitely. But analysts say his illness could force a reappraisal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously under more stress than ever because of the death of Frank 
Wells," said entertainment analyst Harold Vogel, of Merrill Lynch in New York. 
"He (Eisner) carries a very big burden and he needs someone to help him out, 
especially during the convalescence period." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, people close to the board agreed that Eisner's surgery will 
intensify discussions about the need to replace Wells, a lawyer who played a 
key role in developing Disney's business strategy. The directors have not 
scheduled a meeting, but they are being kept apprised of Eisner's condition. 
The company also sent memos to its thousands of staffers around the world 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Disney spokesman said Eisner, 52, was in stable condition and resting 
comfortably, one day after undergoing the three-hour bypass procedure at 
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. He will remain in the hospital for several days, 
but sources said he could return to work within a matter of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One report had Eisner checking Disney's weekend box office returns from his 
hospital bed on Sunday. Sources confirmed that he was awake and joking with 
visitors, with one adding: "He's doing great. He's going to pull out of this 
very fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has been guarded about discussing events leading up to Eisner's 
emergency surgery. But sources say he started feeling ill on Friday, while 
attending a Sun Valley, Ida., investment conference sponsored by Allen & Co. 
Eisner left the conference unexpectedly after lunch, but sources said that did 
not immediately arouse suspicion because the entertainment portion of the 
conference had just ended, and many of his colleagues also departed then. 
Eisner returned home to Bel Air and underwent the bypass operation Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With Eisner expected to make a full recovery, sources do not foresee Disney's 
stock being affected when the market opens Monday morning. But his illness has 
focused a critical eye on Disney's senior management structure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood last confronted such an issue when MCA Chairman Lew R. Wasserman was 
hospitalized in 1987. But analysts point out that MCA, unlike Disney, was 
viewed as a possible takeover target. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Merrill Lynch's Vogel said that "there's a real need" now for someone 
to help Eisner run the company, as Disney confronts fundamental strategic 
issues -- such as whether to acquire or align itself with a major television 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner assigned many of Wells' duties to his top lieutenants last April. But 
he has not been viewed as eager to share his power base so far, even though 
Disney is known for having one of the industry's best management teams. Said 
one source close to the board: "This is not a contest between the board and 
Michael. I think each is trying to find out who the best person is for Wells' 
job. Unfortunately, this puts a little more pressure on that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg is widely seen as the most obvious 
candidate for a larger corporate role. But Eisner recently told The Times that 
he most values Katzenberg at the studio. Relations between the two executives, 
who have worked together for 20 years, have been described as cool. Both 
attended the Allen & Co. conference last week, but they were seldom seen 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 One source of tension is said to be an internal debate over whether to pursue 
the acquisition of a broadcast network, now that CBS is in play. Katzenberg is 
said to be lobbying for the deal, while Eisner, who in the past has not favored 
major acquisitions, is said to be ambivalent or opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Team Disney, as it's called internally, is celebrating its 10th year together. 
In that time, the Burbank-based company has enjoyed phenomenal success in 
building on the company's strengths in feature animation, merchandising and 
theme parks. Its latest animated movie, "The Lion King," is its most successful 
ever -- passing the $170-million mark at the box office over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eisner has also come under strain recently as the company seeks permission 
to build a controversial historic theme park outside Washington and works to 
revive the troubled Euro Disney park outside Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have suggested that even Eisner, known as one of the entertainment 
industry's most driven executives, despite his happy-go-lucky demeanor in 
Disney promotions, may have taken on more than he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 But another well-placed source said Eisner should never be underestimated, 
even with his most recent setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael's got a pretty good point of view about what he wants to do with this 
company over the coming years," the source said.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: WEIGHING SOFTWARE STOCKS; AFTER THE MICROSOFT 
SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the federal government and AT&T announced their historic antitrust 
settlement late in the day Friday, Jan. 8, 1982, the lifting of that cloud was 
widely expected to re-energize the slumping stock market the following Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, investors' excitement about a Bell System breakup and their relief 
that the government had concurrently dropped its antitrust case against IBM 
Corp. were overcome by concerns about rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 16.07 points to 850.46 that Monday, 
even though AT&T shares jumped $1.875 to $60.50 and IBM closed unchanged at 
$56.75 after trading as high as $58.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The past weekend's landmark antitrust settlement between the Justice 
Department and Microsoft Corp., while not on the same scale as the AT&T case, 
nonetheless has technology analysts using the same sort of language when they 
talk about the potential fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 They see a weight removed from Microsoft's shoulders now that the case is 
history, while at the same time predicting a more level playing field for the 
software giant's many competitors, including Novell Inc., Lotus Development and 
Borland International. 
</P>
<P>
 From the viewpoint of investors, guessing how the stocks will react today -- 
and picking the longer-term winners and losers based on the Microsoft 
settlement -- naturally is fraught with high risk. These are technology stocks, 
after all; they are extraordinarily volatile and inherently speculative even 
without the government's hand in the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the sharp declines in most tech stocks over the past few months, 
while Microsoft shares have actually strengthened, the market backdrop suggests 
that a settlement that weakens Microsoft even marginally (as this one 
purportedly will) could hurt its shares in the near term, while helping those 
of other software companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Longer term, however, Microsoft is still the 800-pound gorilla in personal 
computer software and potentially in the interactive electronic world that is 
evolving by the second. The payoff in dominating this new world will certainly 
be measured ultimately in the billions -- in the number of users and the number 
of dollars of sales and earnings they will generate. 
</P>
<P>
 The question isn't whether Microsoft is an attractive investment, but at what 
share price. Odd as it may sound, price was rarely a worry for Microsoft 
investors between 1989 and 1992; the stock closed each year far above the prior 
year's close as sales mushroomed thanks to the company's virtual lock on its 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at some of the issues facing investors as they weigh the 
near-term and longer-term prospects for software stocks, in the wake of the 
Microsoft antitrust settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * For Microsoft's competitors: After battering many tech stocks in April, May 
and June on worries about slowing computer sales, investors just last week 
began to pile back into the sector, looking for bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 That change in mentality, coupled with the expectation that the Microsoft 
settlement will boost the prospects of some of its competitors, could give a 
further broad lift to tech shares in the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, bullish second-quarter earnings reports from semiconductor giant 
Motorola, computer networker Chipcom and disk-drive maker Seagate Technology 
sparked a wave of buying in the beaten-down tech area. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagate stock, for example, rose $2.875 for the week, or 13%, to $24.75 as the 
company's earnings report helped allay some of the concerns about a slower 
economy translating into sharply lower computer sales, and thus lower earnings 
for tech companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, investors' rising goodwill toward tech shares was deflated 
again, after semiconductor maker Texas Instruments warned that it indeed 
expects its growth rate to slow in the second half of the year. TI's stock 
tumbled $6.125 to $80.25 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's a reasonable argument that many of the software stocks, at 
least, have nowhere to go but up -- especially with an antitrust settlement 
that bars kingpin Microsoft from some sales practices that had clearly hurt its 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Novell shares, which have plunged from $26.25 earlier this year to $16.75 now, 
are trading for just 15 times estimated 1994 earnings per share. Yet Novell 
could be a big winner with its personal computer networking systems, with 
Microsoft no longer able to bind computer makers to lengthy contracts that 
restricted their ability to use other operating software systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft's stock, in contrast, sells for about 24 times the $2 a share it is 
believed to have earned in the fiscal year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lotus' stock has been pummeled from $86.50 at its spring high to 
$39.625 now, in large part because the company warned in late June that it 
wouldn't meet analysts' second-quarter earnings expectations. One of Lotus' 
problems has been its inability to keep up with Microsoft in desktop software 
development, especially for spreadsheet programs. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the share price declines already experienced by Novell, 
Lotus, Borland and other Microsoft rivals this year may leave them less 
vulnerable than Microsoft to what is still the great market fear in the short 
term: that the U.S. economy will slow enough in the second half to put a 
meaningful dent in the growth rate of personal computer sales. 
</P>
<P>
 * For Microsoft: It remains to be seen whether Wall Street will make any 
adjustments in its 1995 and 1996 earnings forecasts for Microsoft based solely 
on the antitrust settlement. But it's hard to imagine that any adjustments that 
might be made will be upward, rather than downward. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer, for instance, will Microsoft necessarily earn a per-machine fee 
from major personal-computer makers even if they use a rival's operating system 
in their machines. 
</P>
<P>
 While the early line from analysts over the weekend was that Microsoft's 
earnings won't be materially affected by the settlement's terms, an element of 
doubt has been injected into the immediate outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, of course, the simple fact that the settlement clears the 
air for Microsoft has some intangible value for the company and thus the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike shares of Novell, Lotus, Borland and others, Microsoft's stock has 
been holding up well in advance of the settlement. At $48.625, the stock is 
well up from its 1994 low of $39, though down from the high of $54.625. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the stock's relative strength this year was Standard & 
Poor's Corp.'s decision in the spring to add Microsoft to the S&P 500 stock 
index. That sparked buying in June by investors whose portfolios are set up to 
mimic the S&P 500. 
</P>
<P>
 That buying demand, however, should now be exhausted. Which leaves Microsoft 
investors dealing solely with the impact of the settlement, and with other 
fundamental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 One continuing negative is the company's delay in introducing its long-awaited 
upgrade to its ubiquitous Windows software program, which runs on an estimated 
50 million personal computers worldwide. The rollout for the upgrade, 
code-named Chicago, has been pushed from this spring to later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And rumors abound that Microsoft will announce at its annual meeting on 
Thursday that Chicago will again be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chicago's problems and the antitrust settlement's apparent promise of a 
tougher competitive environment in the years ahead, Wall Street may simply 
become much pickier about the valuation it affords Microsoft stock. 
</P>
<P>
 How much is too much to pay for Microsoft? If Wall Street is correct in 
expecting earnings to advance about 20% in fiscal 1995, the stock's current 
price-to-earnings ratio of 24 means the shares are vulnerable to any 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's also a good argument that the stock isn't dramatically 
overvalued today for long-term investors. 
</P>
<P>
 This is still Microsoft, after all; with its dominance in the 
personal-computer market, and the still-mushrooming nature of that market, 
Microsoft probably deserves a richer stock premium than its rivals for a simple 
reason: It can promise consistent, if slower, earnings growth in the years 
ahead, and consistency is increasingly a rare quality among technology 
companies. 
</P>

PEELING RUBBER IN JAPAN; SALES OF U.S. CARS ACCELERATE BECAUSE OF WEAKER DOLLAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Toshiaki Yamamoto and his wife dropped by their neighborhood Ford dealer 
after a recent Sunday morning of golf, they were impressed with what they saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I wasn't interested in American cars because they obviously were not 
fitted to Japanese road conditions," Yamamoto said. "They were too big for 
Japanese narrow streets, and the steering wheel was on the other side. . . . 
What I'm seeing is the (steering wheel) is now on the right side of the car, 
and what I'm especially interested in is their pricing and their safety 
features." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford, Chrysler and General Motors have been gearing up for two or three years 
to challenge the Japanese auto makers on their own turf. Now, as the dollar 
hits post-World War II record lows against the yen, imports are increasingly 
price-competitive in Japan and those efforts are beginning to pay off. While 
still a small percentage of the total market here, U.S. car sales this year are 
booming and seem headed for continued rapid growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three of Detroit expect to sell about 37,000 U.S.-made vehicles here 
this year, almost double the 19,630 sold last year. That represents about 0.6% 
of the Japanese market, but the American presence is somewhat greater than the 
figures indicate because of sales of other cars American auto makers build here 
and in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, imports of passenger cars, including those made by Japanese firms in 
the United States and elsewhere, are up 30% this year. In May, imports 
accounted for a record 8.6% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar's fall was a bit of luck for the U.S. makers. They have been able 
to take advantage of it because of long-overdue design changes, the development 
of dealer networks here and, at least for Ford, more successful advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuko Mizuno, a 29-year-old Tokyo jewelry store employee, last week bought a 
Chrysler Jeep Cherokee Limited. She said she intended to buy a smaller, 
moderately priced Japanese car, but the Cherokee was a bargain this year at the 
equivalent of $37,755. Two years ago, a Jeep Cherokee cost $42,400 at the 
exchange rate then. 
</P>
<P>
 "The price has come way down on the Cherokee, and I heard it's very sturdy," 
Mizuno said. "It has power, too. If it's in an accident, it seems it would be 
relatively safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Mizuno said she was also attracted to the Cherokee because it is kakko ii -- 
which translates roughly as "neat" or "cool" -- and because it will be good for 
going to the mountains with friends for fly fishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Compared to the past, people are using cars for leisure more," she said. 
"Outdoor activities are fashionable now, and people are taking more vacations." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Konen Suzuki, president of Ford Japan: "Japanese consumers are not always 
looking for the same car they have been using for many years. They are looking 
for new things." 
</P>
<P>
 Of America's Big Three, Ford is the one expanding most rapidly here. It aims 
to sell about 60,000 Ford brand cars here this year, including 12,600 imported 
from the United States. (Ford also manufactures some of the models it sells 
here in Mazda factories.) It plans to boost its sales in Japan to 200,000 units 
-- half will be imports -- by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors President John F. Smith Jr. said here Friday that his firm aims 
to sell 100,000 cars annually in Japan by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very serious in Japan," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although simplified customs procedures have lessened the once-daunting 
regulatory obstacles that had inhibited U.S. car sales, U.S. manufacturers 
still face great difficulties in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Japanese dealers maintain strong relationships with a single Japanese 
manufacturer, so it is still difficult to get American cars into many showrooms 
across Japan. This too is starting to change, but slowly. The sky-high price of 
real estate makes it difficult for American companies to build their own 
dealership networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford has marketed its cars here for more than 20 years through the distributor 
Autorama Inc., which has 288 dealerships and is jointly owned by Ford and 
Mazda. Ford also holds a 24.5% stake in Mazda. In May, as part of an effort to 
raise Ford's profile, the "Autorama" signs came down at these showrooms and new 
"Ford" signs went up. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Ford the first U.S. firm to sell cars here through a dealer network 
bearing its own name. General Motors cars are sold at 200 outlets of the Yanase 
chain; Chrysler vehicles are sold by Seibu Motor Sales Co. and through Honda. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford achieved what was seen in the industry as a modest but important 
breakthrough in May, when Tokyo Nissan Auto Sales Co. converted one of its 53 
outlets to serve as a Ford dealership under the name Ford Tohnichi. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler's connection with Honda is a complex manufacturer-to-manufacturer 
relationship. The Ford hookup with Tokyo Nissan, by contrast, set an important 
precedent as the first time a U.S. manufacturer has made a sales contract with 
a dealer that has some independence but is also part of a Japanese keiretsu 
chain of related firms. Nissan Motor Co. owns 25% of Tokyo Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
 Deals such as the Ford-Tokyo Nissan one are critical if U.S. car sales are to 
really take off here. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding ways to encourage other Japanese dealers to take similar steps is a 
goal of American negotiators in the U.S.-Japan trade talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo Nissan's decision to devote an outlet to selling Fords was triggered by 
Japanese automobile executives' desire to do something to ease the trade 
tensions, said Toshio Nakano, president of Ford Tohnichi. But the deal would 
not have been made unless his firm thought it could make money, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ford Japan's President Suzuki said Ford will supply cars at reasonable 
prices, and they will put the (steering wheel) on the right-hand side, and they 
will emphasize service and availability of parts," Nakano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market in Japan is close to saturation, and now customers are not only 
looking for Nissans or Toyotas. The type of customers who want to enjoy car 
life is increasing. So we figured that if Ford makes enough effort, we can make 
a business out of it. That's why we decided to open this company." 
</P>
<P>
 The American offensive began early last year, when Chrysler began building a 
right-side-drive Jeep Cherokee for Japan and cut its price. Chrysler sales here 
spurted to 5,698 last year from 1,602 vehicles in 1992, and sales this year are 
running at more than triple the pace of the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a second U.S.-made right-side-drive model was introduced here, the 
Ford Probe. At the same time, Ford began shipping to Japan its European-made 
right-hand-drive Mondeo. Festiva and Laser models made at Mazda factories in 
Japan were added to the Ford lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors sells right-side-drive cars here from its European Opel 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 GM cut Opel prices 10% just last week in response to the latest currency 
fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strengthening of the yen against the dollar has done more to level the 
trade playing field between Japanese and U.S. companies than all of the 
rhetoric and policy initiatives of the previous 20 years," GM's Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Big Three have announced plans to start U.S. production of other 
right-side-drive vehicles for the Japanese market over the next year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 If U.S. manufacturers can deliver a wider variety of right-side-drive vehicles 
at competitive prices, American cars have some advantages that should help 
boost sales. Design differences give them a distinctive look, and air bags are 
more widely available in U.S. vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in general, Japanese cars are a little behind in safety feature 
installation," Yamamoto said. "That is a very regrettable thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford Mondeo's ceiling light, located next to the rear-view mirror, caught 
the eye of Yamamoto's wife, Nobuko. She had never seen a Japanese car designed 
that way, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like it," she explained, "for when I put on cosmetics." 
</P>
<P>
 American cars are beginning to regain a good reputation, said Yamamoto, who 
was leaning strongly toward buying a Ford Mondeo wagon priced at the equivalent 
of $27,550. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese consumers don't have prejudice," he said. "If something is 
inexpensive and good, they will buy." U.S. Car Sales in Japan 
</P>
<P>
 After years of effort, U.S. auto makers appear to have gained a foothold in 
Japan and are enjoying a growth spurt this year, primarily because of the 
falling value of the dollar.

 State to Issue Debt: California on Wednesday will sell $4 billion in revenue 
anticipation warrants, or RAWs, that will mature in April, 1996. The mammoth 
debt offering, to be followed by a $3-billion offering of 11-month notes on 
July 27, will allow the state to close its huge budget gap temporarily without 
additional cuts in services.The RAWs are expected to yield at least 4.5% 
annualized, and the interest is exempt from federal and state income taxes -- 
which means the true yield will be much higher, especially for high-income 
Californians. The debt offering comes on the heels of Friday's much-anticipated 
downgrading of the state's credit rating by leading bond-rating services. The 
downgrading applies only to the state's long-term debt, however. The bulk of 
the RAWs, which are guaranteed by a syndicate of major banks, will carry the 
highest credit ratings.

 Wiles Trial Under Way: The trial of former corporate turnaround specialist 
Quentin T. Wiles of Sherman Oaks continues in federal court in Denver. Wiles, 
74, faces three criminal counts of fraud related to the last company he was 
hired to save, computer disk drive maker MiniScribe Corp. The company filed for 
bankruptcy five years ago and was liquidated.Prosecutors allege that Wiles, who 
worked for the San Francisco venture capital firm Hambrecht & Quist and had a 
reputation as a trouble-shooter, defrauded MiniScribe's investors by issuing 
false financial statements and then profiting from stock sales. Among the 
allegations are that MiniScribe, based in Longmont, Colo., shipped bricks 
packaged as disk drives to boost its inventory numbers. Each charge against 
Wiles carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

 Unemployment Statistics Due: The county's June unemployment rate is expected 
to be released Friday.The rate, which stood at 7.1% in June, 1993, has been 
falling in recent months and reached a 29-month low of 5.3% in May. But 
analysts expect the jobless numbers to rise, because rates typically jump in 
June as students and teachers seek summer work. For example, according to 
previously published figures, the Los Angeles County rate for June rose to 
10.1% from May's 9.7%.

 San Diego to Get Tourism Boost: The American Contract Bridge League will begin 
its national tournament Friday.The event, which will bring some 28,000 
delegates to San Diego, is one of the largest conventions attracted to the city 
in recent years and comes at an opportune time for the city's battered tourism 
market. Like the rest of Southern California, San Diego's tourism has been hurt 
by natural calamities, the economic downturn and the Los Angeles civil 
disturbances. But, according to figures to be released this week by the San 
Diego Convention & Visitors Bureau, the city is showing modest gains in 
year-to-date tourist head counts, visitor spending and hotel nights sold in the 
first five months of the year.

 MDT Shareholders to Meet: Torrance-based MDT Corp. will hold its annual 
meeting this week, and dissenting shareholders plan to challenge management by 
withholding their votes on the firm's directors. The company, which makes 
sterilization systems for medical instruments, has had an erratic earnings 
record since 1989, and its stock has fallen to $4.875 a share on Nasdaq from a 
peak of $15.13 in 1989.The dissident shareholders are led by Andrew Shapiro of 
Lawndale Capital Management in San Francisco. MDT, which had $137 million in 
sales last year, is expected to announce restructuring steps that may partly 
address Shapiro's concerns about restoring consistent growth in earnings. The 
meeting is set for 2 p.m. Wednesday at 19645 Rancho Way in Rancho Dominguez.

 Industrial Output Climbed in June: The Federal Reserve Board said production 
climbed 0.5% last month as the sizzling heat in most parts of the country 
caused a big jump in utility use.It was the 13th straight increase for 
production at the nation's factories, mines and utilities. But the Fed said 
that if the higher electricity output were excluded, production rose a mere 
0.1% last month, matching May's increase. In another report, the Commerce 
Department said business inventories rose 1.1% in May, the largest increase in 
nearly seven years. The bigger-than-expected gain was the fourth advance in the 
first five months of the year and the largest since inventories rose 1.3% in 
October, 1987.

FROSTS HEAT UP DEMAND FOR COLOMBIAN COFFEE; AGRICULTURE: DAMAGED CROPS IN 
BRAZIL MEAN A BOOM FOR OTHER GROWERS AFTER FOUR YEARS IN THE RED. 
</P>

 Two bitter freezes in Brazil have pulled this country out of a four-year 
crisis and pushed it toward what could be one of the greatest coffee booms in 
its history. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee growers in this Andean nation, which produces more coffee than any 
other except Brazil, have suffered through four years of low prices. But they 
have watched their prospects soar since frost hit Brazil on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
 A more brutal cold front struck Brazil's most productive coffee district July 
10, and experts here estimated losses at 40% to 50% of Brazil's 1994-95 
harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 With coffee prices skyrocketing in world markets, Juan Manuel Santos, 
Colombia's minister of foreign trade, predicted a bonanza not seen since the 
mid-1970s. The National Federation of Coffee Growers announced the second 
increase in a month in the price it pays suppliers, to $199.08 for a 125-kilo 
load from $173.43. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a happy end, after four hard years and complicated negotiations" 
between the government and coffee growers, said Jorge Cardenas Gutierrez, 
general manager of the coffee federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finance Minister Rudolph Hommes exulted: "The Virgin has now appeared to us 
twice." He was referring to the most recent price rise and to more gradual 
increases over the last 60 days that resulted from a six-month retention plan 
led by Colombia, Brazil and Central American nations seeking to control export 
sales and force prices up. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombian growers, who have been operating in the red, are feeling relief. 
Since the International Coffee Agreement -- which set world export quotas and 
kept prices relatively high -- expired in 1989, prices had nose-dived to 55 
cents a pound from $1.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee had represented prosperity otherwise unavailable in rural Colombia. 
Towns and municipalities accustomed to having access to roads, telephones and 
electricity went into a tailspin. Coffee growers, accustomed to the nation's 
highest standard of living, despaired of their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the crisis in Brazil, which supplies about 22% of world coffee demand, 
the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that demand will exceed supply by 
9 million sacks next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts predict that Colombian coffee prices could exceed $3 a pound before 
year's end. Government planners here have stopped talking about keeping coffee 
growers afloat and started worrying about inflation from the foreign earnings 
the boom is expected to generate. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most growers do not expect immediate recovery. Many farms are deeply in 
debt, and many are fighting a rear-guard action against the coffee borer, or la 
broca, an insect that invaded plantations in 1993 and can now be found on 40% 
of Colombia's 2.7 million acres of coffee land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crisis hit us very hard," said Alexander Garcia, a third-generation 
farmer who sold vehicles and apartments to keep his 87-acre plantation going in 
the face of heavy losses last year. "We've lost a lot of money and still aren't 
being paid what a shipment of coffee is worth." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's production of 11.5 million sacks is far short of last year's 
harvest of 15 million sacks, because many growers have cut back. And while 
growers are trying to increase production to take advantage of the rising 
prices, they are wary of the pitfalls of a boom and the dangers of triggering 
another price drop. 
</P>
<P>
 "If prices rise too high and production soars, we could saturate the market 
again and cause prices to slump," said one official of Colombia's coffee 
federation, who estimated the ideal harvest at 15 million sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excessive prices could also diminish consumption, which would be against our 
interests."

SEMATECH MAY BEGIN PHASING OUT $90 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Computer consortium Sematech has indicated that it will propose phasing out 
its $90 million in annual federal funding and scaling back its operations as 
early as two years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 After a board meeting Friday in which directors voted to "propose a new model 
of industry-government cooperation," the 7-year-old chip manufacturing research 
consortium said in a statement that it has succeeded in advancing the United 
States' chip-making know-how. 
</P>
<P>
 Sematech, which employs about 800 people, said it will begin "a natural 
evolution" to a "project management and coordination role." 
</P>
<P>
 That role "will lead to a change in Sematech's structure and funding levels," 
the statement said. The consortium's board will discuss the changes in the next 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The board includes representatives of the 11 member companies, the Defense 
Department's Advance Research Projects Agency and Semi-Sematech, an association 
of equipment and materials suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Consortium spokesman John Pope said the board has voted to continue providing 
the group with $90 million a year for now. Any change in Sematech funding 
"would provide a transition period of at least two years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Representatives has already approved the $90 million funding 
request for next year for Sematech. 
</P>
<P>
 But during a visit to Austin last month, Arati Prabhakar, the government's 
former principal consortium liaison, said Sematech needed an "exit strategy" 
for its financial dealings with the U.S. government.

 Pasta Group Wants Import Quotas: The National Pasta Assn. said in Washington 
that it will demand quotas or tariffs on imported pasta if President Clinton 
decides to curb Canadian imports of durum wheat, which is used to make pasta. 
The trade group will also formally ask the Administration to halt subsidies for 
durum wheat exports while wheat import restraints are in effect. The big 
winners will be foreign pasta producers, who will increase their already 
significant exports to the United States, she said.

 Shipbuilders Agree to Scrap Aid: Major shipbuilding nations agreed after five 
years of negotiations to scrap subsidies to their shipyards, but France 
rejected the deal, negotiators said.The deal to scrap aid to most U.S., 
European and Asian shipyards was struck at the Paris headquarters of the 
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Delegates from 
shipbuilding nations, representing three-quarters of world capacity, presented 
it as an attempt to impose order on an unruly international ship market. The 
unsigned agreement must be ratified by all participants and would come into 
effect on Jan. 1, 1996.

 3 Executed for Stealing Receipt Books: The government has executed three men 
for stealing tax receipt books as part of a clampdown on tax evasion scams that 
have put billions of dollars of state revenue at risk, the official People's 
Daily reported. The Harbin city intermediate court in north China's 
Heilongjiang province delivered the death sentence on Deng Yucai, a chemical 
factory worker, and his unemployed accomplices Yu Min and Sui Guohua, the 
newspaper said. The three men stole 800 books of blank value-added tax receipts 
from a county tax office warehouse in March and tried to sell them to companies 
intent on dodging taxes, according to Gao Changli, vice director of the Supreme 
People's Court, quoted in the paper.

 Gross Domestic Product Seen Growing 0.9%: The nation's gross domestic product, 
the value of all the goods and services produced in Japan, will grow 0.9% in 
the year through March, 1995, Japan Research Institute said in a report. The 
institute revised the forecast upward from the 0.5% it estimated in 
December.The revision is partly attributable to brisk consumer spending, which 
is expected to grow 2.4%, according to the report. In December, the institute 
estimated consumer spending would rise 0.7%. Separately, the Ministry of 
International Trade and Industry said industrial production for April was 
revised downward to a 1.2% month-on-month fall from a preliminary 0.8% fall. In 
year-on-year terms, industrial output in May was revised to a 1.8% decline from 
an earlier 1.4% fall, the ministry said. The production index stood at 89.8 
compared with an earlier 90.20, against a base of 100 for 1990.

 Remittances From Abroad Up 9.7%: The amount of money sent home from abroad by 
residents of the Philippines rose 9.7% in the first four months of the year, 
helping make the peso stronger against the dollar.Remittances are likely to 
accelerate in the second half of the year. Analysts said remittances usually 
surge in the last quarter of the year when Filipinos living abroad send home 
more money as Christmas gifts to their families. The Bangko Sentral ng 
Pilipinas said remittances from January to April totaled $794.9 million, up 
$70.5 million from a year ago. At that pace, total remittances will surpass 
$2.5 billion for the whole year. In 1993, $2.3 billion was remitted through 
banks.

HYUNDAI GROUP'S STEEL PLAN SPLITS NATION; SOUTH KOREA: PROPOSAL TO BUILD 
$10-BILLION MILL FUELS DEBATE OVER THE NEED FOR INDUSTRY COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Korea's Hyundai Group has a history of stirring up public opinion. In 
the 1992 presidential election, its founder, Chung Ju Yung, caused a political 
earthquake by mounting a highly charged campaign against the eventual winner, 
President Kim Young Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, the nation's largest conglomerate is dividing the country 
with an ambitious plan to build South Korea's second steel mill at a cost of 
$10 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some industrialists and analysts favor the plan, which is for an integrated 
steel mill with annual production capacity of nearly 10 million tons. These 
people say South Korea's fast economic growth will require an equally fast 
increase in steel production capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 But others worry about a worldwide glut in supply by the time Hyundai's steel 
mill is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, the debate centers on whether competition is needed for 
the Korean steel industry, currently monopolized by Pohang Iron & Steel Co. 
(POSCO). POSCO is the world's second-largest steel producer, after Japan's 
Nippon Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate started a few weeks ago, when speculation about the plan first 
spread. It became hotter this week, as most Seoul newspapers presented a 
detailed construction plan, quoting Hyundai executives and government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the reports, Hyundai will invest $10 billion to build three blast 
furnaces with a capacity of 3.1 million tons each, possibly in the southeastern 
city of Pusan. Hyundai officials were quoted as saying the group's 
construction, engineering and heavy equipment subsidiaries will take 39 months 
to build the plant once they start. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Il Kwon, a Hyundai Group spokesman, refused to confirm the reports but 
said the group's steel-product manufacturing subsidiaries, including Hyundai 
Pipe Co., have carried out some feasibility studies. 
</P>
<P>
 These include long-term projections of Hyundai's own steel demands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Hyundai's steel needs for its car, shipbuilding, construction and 
electronics subsidiaries are estimated at 6 million tons a year, making it 
feasible for the group to have its own steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is no secret that we have hoped to have our own steel mill ever since 
POSCO was created in the late 1960s," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual capacity of about 21 million tons, POSCO is perhaps the world's 
most competitive steelmaker, because its plants are among the most advanced.

VIETNAM ECONOMY GROWING STRONG BUT TRADE DEFICIT MAY BE A CONCERN

 Vietnam's foreign trade is growing rapidly but imports are growing faster than 
exports and analysts say the government should make sure an increasing deficit 
does not get out of hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam exported goods worth $1.6 billion in the first half of 1994, a 26% 
increase over the same period last year, according to figures recently released 
by the government's General Statistical Office. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of imports was 30.6% higher at $1.8 billion, amounting to a 
$200-million deficit, which a foreign analyst based in Hanoi said could cause 
problems if ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must watch to ensure the deficit doesn't get out of hand but I wouldn't 
be too worried at this stage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This communist country, which is adopting free market economic principles, had 
a small trade surplus in 1992 but ran up a $300-million deficit last year on 
total trade of $6.3 billion.

NEW BCCI SETTLEMENT PLAN MAY BE NEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to repay Bank of Credit and Commerce International depositors and 
creditors, who have claims exceeding $10 billion, has cleared a torturous 
series of negotiations and is ready for presentation to creditors and courts in 
three countries, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier settlement plan for BCCI depositors was shot down by a Luxembourg 
judge last year as too favorable to BCCI's majority shareholders, the 
government and ruling family of Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement was finalized in discussions over the weekend between the 
accounting firm Touche Ross, BCCI's court-appointed liquidators, and Abu Dhabi, 
a source familiar with the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The step is significant for the estimated 250,000 BCCI depositors in Europe, 
Africa and elsewhere who haven't been able to gain access to their accounts 
since the bank was shut down three years ago this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The framework of the latest agreement, reached in Zurich in March, provides 
that the Abu Dhabi shareholders contribute $1.8 billion to a global settlement 
fund.

</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, the debate centers on whether competition is needed for 
the Korean steel industry, currently monopolized by Pohang Iron & Steel Co. 
(POSCO). POSCO is the world's second-largest steel producer, after Japan's 
Nippon Steel Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate started a few weeks ago, when speculation about the plan first 
spread. It became hotter this week, as most Seoul newspapers presented a 
detailed construction plan, quoting Hyundai executives and government 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the reports, Hyundai will invest $10 billion to build three blast 
furnaces with a capacity of 3.1 million tons each, possibly in the southeastern 
city of Pusan. Hyundai officials were quoted as saying the group's 
construction, engineering and heavy equipment subsidiaries will take 39 months 
to build the plant once they start. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Il Kwon, a Hyundai Group spokesman, refused to confirm the reports but 
said the group's steel-product manufacturing subsidiaries, including Hyundai 
Pipe Co., have carried out some feasibility studies. 
</P>
<P>
 These include long-term projections of Hyundai's own steel demands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Hyundai's steel needs for its car, shipbuilding, construction and 
electronics subsidiaries are estimated at 6 million tons a year, making it 
feasible for the group to have its own steel mill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is no secret that we have hoped to have our own steel mill ever since 
POSCO was created in the late 1960s," Park said. 
</P>
<P>
 With annual capacity of about 21 million tons, POSCO is perhaps the world's 
most competitive steelmaker, because its plants are among the most advanced, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Aided by the strong yen, which makes Japanese steel more expensive in overseas 
markets, POSCO's earnings in 1993 rose 59% over 1992 to $368 million, on 
revenue of $8.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 To build its own steel mill, Hyundai would have to overcome many hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 In theory, Hyundai doesn't need to get a green light from the government for 
the project. But in practice, it would need approval to borrow foreign funds, 
select a mill site, import foreign technology and affect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, it is reportedly working to woo public opinion, which could 
influence government decision making. 
</P>
<P>
 It will get an important platform at a public seminar next week on ways to 
develop the nation's steel industry. News reports say Hyundai will strongly 
present its case at the seminar. 
</P>
<P>
 It may have to. Signs from the government aren't favorable so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Park Woon Suh, vice minister of trade, industry and energy, said last week he 
believes South Korea needs facilities to process steel products, not make crude 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-run Korea Institute for Economics and Technology, which often 
represents government views, recently said in a report that a new entry into 
crude steel production isn't desirable. 
</P>
<P>
 It said South Korea's crude steel demand will be about 48.4 million tons in 
2001, only 1.5 million tons more than supply at that time, an easy gap to fill 
with imports. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the current extra demand on Korean steelmakers, notably POSCO, 
will soon disappear as the yen stabilizes and world consumption falls. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot predict future demands based solely on the present situation," 
said Kim Joo Han, a key researcher for the report. "There is a tendency to 
overestimate the competitiveness of Korean steel." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the bigger picture makes the concerns of Kim and other critics of 
the plan more understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Asian countries, including China, Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia, are 
racing to expand their steel production capacity, risking a glut in the region 
in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government wants to expand its national annual crude steel output 
to 100 million tons by 2000. China Steel Corp. of Taiwan plans to boost its 
annual capacity by 30% to 8 million tons by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Korean government has an institute to publicize its policy of 
preventing reckless steel capacity expansion, the Hyundai Group has its own 
mouthpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korea Economic Research Institute, under the Federation of Korean 
Industries, which represents most major corporations here, recently put out a 
report defending Hyundai's position. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute's analysts say Korea's steel demands in 2000 will reach 50 
million tons, at least 10 million tons above production capacity at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 And they call their forecast rather conservative, given the fast growth of 
Korea's auto, shipbuilding and electronics industries and the prospects of 
inter-Korean economic cooperation. That would require vast amounts of steel for 
building North Korean infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steel is too important for the Korean economy to have a short supply of it," 
said Kwak Man Soon, a researcher at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly important for Hyundai to have a stable supply of steel, 
which is essential for the group's main businesses, such as autos, 
shipbuilding, construction and electronics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts add that a new entry by a private company into the monopolistic steel 
industry would stimulate the management of POSCO, which hasn't had any 
competition in the domestic market since its inception in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded and long headed by Park Tae Joon, a former general and close friend of 
former President Park Chung Hee, POSCO has recently come under fire for its 
allegedly slow and authoritarian management style. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there has been persistent speculation that the government wants to 
break POSCO up into two companies, one in Pohang and the other in the 
southwestern city of Kwangyang, where its new plants are, to stimulate its 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, POSCO has recently tried to reduce its dependency on steel and 
branch out into higher-value-added, high-tech areas such as telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 POSCO will be the leading company in a business consortium that will provide 
the nation's second mobile phone service, beginning later this decade.

NEW-BOND SALES LIKELY TO STAY SLUGGISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sales of new bonds, dampened by the recent turmoil on capital markets 
worldwide, is likely to remain subdued as investors prefer the safety of cash 
and short-term instruments, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 179.7 billion francs were raised on bond markets in the first five months 
of this year, compared with 208.6 billion francs in the same period in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if volatility, which was extreme in February and March, has abated, "a 
highly uncertain environment is likely to continue prevailing on the 
international markets in the near term," the Paris-based think tank said in a 
report on financial market trends. 
</P>
<P>
 A large number of investors have shifted funds to cash or shortened the 
duration of their bond portfolios, and it's unclear when funds will flow back 
into longer-dated bonds, it said. In times of uncertainty, investors tend to 
switch to short-dated bonds whose prices resist a rise in yields better than 
longer-dated bonds.

VIDEOS-ON-DEMAND DEBUT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES; ENTERTAINMENT: LASER VIDEO NETWORK 
INC. HAS INSTALLED KIOSKS AND TVS IN 200 DINING HALLS SO FAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1990s twist on the old jukebox has started showing up on college campuses, 
but it has more in common with two-way TVs of the future than nickelodeons of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser Video Network Inc., a 2-year-old New York company, for the past year has 
been installing kiosks and TVs to show music videos on college campuses. The 
setups are in about 200 dining halls so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The system, which the company calls College Television Network, is one of the 
few working examples of video-on-demand, something that has gotten a good deal 
of hype in the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word is so overused at this point," said Thom Kidrin, president of Laser 
Video. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond a jukebox, though, the kiosks deliver six commercials an hour, 
providing an avenue to the hard-to-reach college market that has lured big 
advertisers such as Coca-Cola, Chevrolet and MCI. 
</P>
<P>
 And the interactivity of the machines is more than just choosing the latest 
video from Counting Crows, Seal or Red Hot Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 A modem into each kiosk allows any user from a student group to the school 
newspaper to the sporting events ticket office to enter information that is 
shown amid the videos and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 That ability for viewers to add content is overlooked by many of the big 
companies testing video-on-demand systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hunter College in Manhattan, which has one of Laser Video's first kiosks, 
the computer only accepts typed messages instead of graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used it for lunch specials," said Ken Farnsworth, the school's food 
service director. "We tried to limit who uses it because then you have every 
school organization wanting to put up a message. We try to have student groups 
that benefit the entire college as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidrin said the kiosks being installed this summer will be able to take in and 
show a five-minute TV newscast produced by a college's journalism department. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools arrange to show other TV programs at certain parts of the day 
through the TVs that come with the kiosk. For instance, Michigan State 
University, which has the Laser Video system in a dining hall serving 1,100, 
switches the TVs to CNN in the morning and shows its own football, basketball 
and hockey games when they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we have a cable system hooked in, we have some flexibility with it," 
said Bruce Haskell, manager of Wonders Hall at Michigan State. "The predominant 
use is for the videos as a source of entertainment." 
</P>
<P>
 Students select videos, including comedy clips and movie trailers, using the 
kiosk's touch screen. When no selections have been made, the computer plays 
videos randomly. The biggest kiosks hold 250 videos, which are stored on up to 
18 CD-ROM discs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company rotates the mix every four to six weeks, taking into account 
demand for a video. Students who choose Garth Brooks and Mary-Chapin Carpenter 
often are likely to get a broader selection of country videos, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always trying to stay in sync with where our market is," Kidrin said.

SIX MONTHS LATER, WE'RE SHAKEN TO THE CORE; QUAKE: NIGHTMARES FROM THE JAN. 17 
TREMOR HAVEN'T FADED. FAR FROM IT. THE TERROR OF THAT MORNING HAS MANY PEOPLE 
RELIVING PAST TRAUMAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There is a man and a Vietnam memory that had almost disappeared. Now it's 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Once more he hears the whock-whock of helicopter blades and looks down at 
blood making vile art in the mud. He shouts a thought at a friend. Let's duck 
this one. 
</P>
<P>
 They jump from the chopper anyway. One last time. Gasping, yelling, sweating, 
running with a hand on the other's shoulder because that always seemed to 
reduce terror by half. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years later, he's gasping and sweating again. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are reprising sights and smells of the Holocaust. Greasy smoke from 
Auschwitz-Birkenau chimneys, pink and gray images of babies dead before they 
had walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are jerked awake and held sleepless by hearing bombs in the night. From 
London, 1941. Still more are again seeing the dead, staring faces of 
assassination. San Salvador, 1980. Or reliving the forced marching that ended 
with 1 million people starved to death. Cambodia, 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this bloody earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago, the Earth's innards buckled, at least 57 people died, and all 
citizens of Los Angeles scored some image they will carry to their deathbeds. 
</P>
<P>
 And the pictures aren't even fading. 
</P>
<P>
 This shock is loitering too long for too many. In part, the embedded echoes 
have to do with the polyglot cast of the Valley, a place rich with immigrants 
and psyches already disfigured by civil horror. In Cambodia, Vietnam, Ethiopia, 
Cuba and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lives were threatened once, but became safe. Until Jan. 17. Then, 
psychologists say, we shook to a fresh, deadly menace that was enough to unlock 
and spill emotional baggage from the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The affliction is called post-traumatic stress disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 It means we remember when and suffer again. 
</P>
<P>
 We develop the same headaches and depression, anger and impotence. We drink 
too much and brawl too easily and cry for nothing. We jerk awake at an innocent 
thud or rattle in the night and sometimes, for no reason, exactly at 4:32 a.m. 
And we blame everything but the collapsing, rasping, indiscriminate, 
executioner's energy of a 6.8 earthquake precisely where we live. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Moore, 68, of North Hollywood, the daughter of an importer-exporter, 
thought she had survived all the suffering that life has for one person. She 
was born in China and just escaped the Sino-Japanese war in 1936. Three years 
earlier there had been earthquakes in Japan, then Japanese bombing of Shanghai 
in 1941 and the Muslim-Hindu uprising in Calcutta in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had learned to cope with all this, you know," she recently told 
Times writer Jocelyn Stewart. "I thought: 'Well, it's not going to bother me.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Every aftershock was a repeat. Now she is forgetful, disoriented, 
fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, I have cracks in my ceiling . . . cracks in my bedroom," she said. 
"That's how I feel. . . . That's what happened inside of me. I've been through 
an awful lot. I've seen a lot of pain, a lot of illness, buried a lot of 
people. The quake brings it all back." 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also extinguished most of what life has left for the elderly at 
ground zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you, if you're in your 80s, start from scratch?" asks Lynn Bayer, 
director of the Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging. "People are 
experiencing a tremendous sense of loss and an identity crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 For they have no years left to re-create what took half a century to build. No 
fond, private memory was insured against damage or loss. No FEMA settlement can 
replace honeymoon trinkets of 40 years ago, those first ugly gifts from 
grandchildren, the college mug, the photograph of you and Eddy at Bastogne. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then these people -- on the whole, older people who don't do well in coping 
skills -- must hassle with insurance companies and government," explains a 
therapist with Project Rebound, a FEMA-funded counseling program administered 
by the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health. "That becomes 
revictimization . . . and by their own system." 
</P>
<P>
 We don't even hide our quiet tremblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I travel a lot, attend many meetings, and always recognize people from Los 
Angeles," says Ioan Allen of San Francisco, an executive with Dolby 
Laboratories Inc. "When a truck goes by and a conference room shakes, the ones 
with the wide eyes looking nervously at each other are from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet you needn't have known Nazi Germany or hunkered for weeks at Khe Sahn to 
be suffering terribly from this latest shattering of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Californians who thought they'd felt one and felt 'em all, who used 
earlier quivers as a bragging right for families left behind in Ausable, N.Y., 
have been silenced by the Biggest One So Far. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the small ones just rocked and rolled. They were a D ride. Nobody got 
hurt. Never been to Sylmar. Who knows where Whittier Narrows is anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 But six months ago, the guy you bowled with had his house fall on him, and 
before they took away the lady next door, she was talking to people who have 
been dead 15 years. Two inches to the left, and the TV set that jumped on the 
pillow could have changed your viewing habits forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical books call these "psychologically disturbing events . . . outside the 
range of usual human experience." They make a lie of our basic assumption of 
being safe in the world. It doesn't always happen to someone else. Communities 
are no longer strong sanctuaries. And when we die a little, the emotional 
aftershocks may continue longer than terrestrial ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Even our younger people, emotionally firmer and capable of bopping back from 
most anything, were scarred intensely by Jan. 17. Because they are from a Los 
Angeles notorious for its lack of safe surrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Had we been shaken in Salt Lake, the social stability of the city would have 
buffered our fear and sense of helplessness. We would have met the trauma with 
reserves of mental strength, not from some bruised, exhausted, fearful set of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles is drive-bys, freeway shootings, Rolex bandits, carjackings, 
ATM killings, and cops trying to bring sense to the senseless by telling us 
someone was in the wrong place at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, with its Laguna and Topanga fires, with its Malibu floods 
and rioting at Florence and Normandie, any area of Los Angeles can become the 
wrong place. 
</P>
<P>
 And that bloody sequence, in the souls of mentally battered citizens, elevates 
an earthquake from a survivable baptism of fire to a barely surmountable coup 
de gra ce . 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever there may be a fragment of recovery, there are reminders to rip off 
the bandage. Aftershock Watch. A stretch of freeway named after a dead 
motorcycle officer. The vase you went to find that isn't there anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 They pull sheets over the faces of corpses, don't they? How do you cover the 
dead apartment buildings on Reseda Boulevard or the charred, crumbling blocks 
of Moorpark Avenue? 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ogre refuses to bend. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been six months but it seems like the day before yesterday. The noises 
are no quieter. The pictures are just as graphic. Hollowness of heart lurks 
just one lonely thought away. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, advise the counselors, talk it all out and be patient, for time is 
the salve for most of us. At worst, they warn, if discomfort becomes 
dysfunction, then best seek professional help. 
</P>
<P>
 I know a therapist, Linda Bailey-Martiniere of Woodland Hills. Or she used to 
be. A week after the earthquake, Bailey-Martiniere, her husband and their young 
daughter moved to the quiet still of Nevada City. 
</P>
<P>
 Their move wasn't a matter of not being able to handle it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one psychotherapist's quickest, most efficient, most intelligent way of 
coping.

A FORCE OF ONE; WELCOME TO THE IN-YOUR-FACE WORLD OF LARRY BLUM, COP SHRINK. HE 
COMES ON STRONG, BUT ENDS UP EARNING THE TRUST OF OFFICERS IN PAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The veteran cops were squirming in their seats even before their coffee got 
cold. To the group of mostly 20-year sergeants and lieutenants, the early 
morning seminar on officer trauma sounded about as appealing as paperwork. 
Better to work out stress at a firing range or corner bar than with some 
touchy-feely shrink. 
</P>
<P>
 But the speaker didn't look like a psychologist, not with his drill-sergeant 
scowl and broad shoulders. And he didn't sound like one, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a cop," Larry Blum began, his New York accent barbed with attitude. 
"I never wanted to be a cop. I couldn't tell you about police tactics, either. 
But I am gonna tell you why you guys die out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the in-your-face world of "Dr. Deadlift," cop shrink. Maybe it's 
because he grew up as a street-smart kid in the bloody-nose Bronx, or because 
he practices triage psychology at crime scenes and emergency rooms, but Blum 
loves to get in that first punch. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Felix Osuna was in the audience that day. "I was sitting 
there thinking, 'This guy's a jerk.' About 30 cops were ready to get up and 
walk out, me included. But by the end of that day, I was a believer. Larry 
knows what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum, who earned the "Deadlift" nickname because of his enthusiasm for 
weightlifting, has believers across Southern California. They talk about his 
clinical successes, of course, but also about his earnestness, his fierce 
loyalty and streetwise candor. Most important, they know he carries the same 
burdens they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very protective of all of them," Blum, 49, says while holding one of 
the police caps that line the shelves of his Santa Ana office. The hats, and 
scores of agency patches, are thank-you gifts from former clients. "I've stood 
over them in hospitals, I've stood over their bodies, and held up their widows 
and partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum looks up and smiles broadly. "I call all of them my babies." 
</P>
<P>
 His "babies" bring in a parade of horror stories. Officers with trembling 
hands and shot nerves tell the big man about the mayhem and murders, the lost 
partners and innocent bystanders, and of the adrenaline rushes served with a 
side of stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum helps them cope with their anxieties and, at the same time, tries not to 
carry their weighty problems home. Often, that's not easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started doing this work I was a very sensitive, emotional person 
filled with love of life," he says. "With the first five years of my practice, 
and all the call-outs for shooting and violence, I started losing my value of 
life. I became numb, hardened. Some of my close friends still accuse me of 
cynicism. But I have never lost my humanism. I still love good people." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum's 12-year-old practice includes a client list of 15 agencies, most in 
Orange and Los Angeles counties. Speaking engagements and appearances as an 
expert witness at assorted trials vie for his time these days. He recently 
testified on behalf of Sgt. Stacey C. Koon in the Rodney King civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Long Beach resident spends most of his time doing what matters most 
to him: talking one-on-one with troubled officers. 
</P>
<P>
 He finds it easy to communicate with street cops, particularly those who 
patrol dangerous turf. That can be traced in part to his childhood, when he ran 
with the tough kids in a New York Jewish-Italian neighborhood. His parents 
divorced when Blum was 14, leaving the teen-ager with little supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Blum remembers the world view his father drummed into his head: "Don't lie. 
Don't steal. Don't take crap from anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's who I am. It probably helps me with the rank-and-file cops. They like 
the rough edges. But it's not something I picked up at a university." 
</P>
<P>
 And Blum did not forget that street education when he picked up his doctorate 
in psychology at the University of Michigan. Riverside psychologist Nancy Bohl, 
who also works exclusively with cops, says his markedly different influences 
make Blum an attractive confidant to officers. "They trust him, they like him, 
and he can help them," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Any bridge helps. Although officers are far more open to counseling and 
discussing their feelings than in the past, Blum says, a code of silence still 
comes with the badge. Many would rather swallow pain than show it. "It doesn't 
just gnaw at them, it rigidifies, it locks up inside them," Blum says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his former clients, for example, responded to a domestic dispute call 
to find an infant shot point-blank in the head. The shooter, a boyfriend of the 
child's mother, had committed suicide, and the officer walked away horrified by 
the sight and burned by his own helplessness. He told himself to shake it off 
and keep going. But it wasn't that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time this guy looked at his own baby son in the crib at home, he got 
sick; he would vomit," Blum says. "He couldn't do away with that image. Until 
he talked about it and got OK with what he felt. Until he did that, he wasn't 
gonna be able to enjoy his own kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum says two-thirds of officers will suffer post-traumatic stress symptoms in 
their career, and one-third will have a profound reaction. The symptoms range 
from nightmares to gastric problems to freezing up in the field. The treatments 
include debriefing, counseling and sometimes biofeedback. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops who die on duty have often put themselves in a compromising position, 
Blum says. Distractions, anxieties and, in some cases, complacency cause them 
to miss danger signs or leap into situations they would otherwise avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, an officer can be counseled back to health in a matter of weeks. 
Extreme trauma or untreated emotional wounds take longer, Blum says. "Every cop 
who is worth his or her salt carries baggage. I help them deal with it, manage 
it, so they can become or stay healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afew years ago, Blum forgot how to manage his own baggage. The burned-out 
cops, the late-night hospital visits and the manila folders bulging with lurid 
crime-scene photos began to darken his after-hours life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I did the work was by saying to myself, 'OK, this is not my wife 
who's been stabbed 26 times with hands and feet bound. This is not my daughter 
lying here raped and murdered.' That's how I did it, but everything got too 
close." 
</P>
<P>
 As the horrors got closer, he pushed his wife and children further away, 
afraid they might be touched by it. And he turned to the bottle for solace: 
"Vodka. I had no time for beer. And I never really learned the meaning of the 
word moderation. " 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Jim Harris has worked closely with Blum 
since 1986, and he saw the changes in his friend during those tough times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen so many cops walk away from the job as just hollow shells of who 
they had been because they've taken all the heartache and agony and held it 
inside," Harris says. "He finds ways to let them let it go. He's like this 
sponge soaking up their pain. Sometimes, though, you got to squeeze and let it 
back out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure built until Blum and his wife, Paula, separated briefly in the 
late 1980s. "It was the worst time in my life, no doubt about it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had met as teen-agers in New York and had found success in 
California, but the gory secrets Larry Blum kept in his head threatened to 
bring them down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of confidentiality, he would never tell us about what his cases were, 
nothing specific, only a global picture," Paula Blum says. "All this stuff was 
tearing his insides out, but he would keep it in. When he drank, all these 
terrible emotions would come out of him, just rotten things. We were all 
walking on eggshells." 
</P>
<P>
 The separation made Blum think hard about his options. "Either find a way to 
remain healthy in the way you do your work or lose your family, that's what it 
came down to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step was to quit doing suspect profiles and interviews with 
murderers and rapists for the police. He decided to counsel and evaluate only 
officers. "I only work with the good guys. That helped a lot."  
</P>
<P>
 He quit drinking, too. The Blums celebrated their 25th anniversary this year, 
and Paula, the director of senior services at the Long Beach Jewish Community 
Center, says the marriage is solid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although for a while I was trying to convince him to buy less weight 
equipment so we could buy a dining room set," she jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Blum turned to weightlifting to relieve the stress in his life 
and the pain in his back. A spinal injury had forced him to consider extensive 
surgery, but one of Blum's "babies," a Pomona cop who loved power-lifting, 
offered an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Deadlift was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the joy of my life," says Blum, who strengthens his muscles and eases 
his mind among the clanging free weights. Earlier this year, he locked out with 
600 pounds in the dead lift at the national Police Olympics. Blum laughs at the 
suggestion that lifting weights helps him carry his patients' burdens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you this," he says. "I'm helpless to prevent cops from being 
harmed, and that is my biggest wound. I can control the weight in the gym. It's 
just me against the bar. And if I'm tough, tough enough, I can pull that 
weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum is now planning his retirement. His son, Noah, 23, and daughter, Nicole, 
20, are in college ("They like me now that I can't tell them what to do"), and 
he hopes in five years or so to confine his practice to helping police 
departments create in-house trauma-response teams. He has worked to develop 
such programs in Brea, Huntington Beach and South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams, staffed by officers, quickly assemble and reach out to traumatized 
peers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great because the cop hears from another cop that, 'Hey, I've been where 
you are now. The things you are experiencing are nothing but normal reactions 
to a traumatic event,' " Blum says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He says the pressure cooker his "babies" work in would be too much for him to 
handle. ("I don't have the self-control. Take a guy that beats up a lady or a 
kid. I'd beat the hell out of him.") Southern California has become a 
high-scrutiny, low-tolerance place for police since the fallout from the 1991 
Rodney King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 When Blum testified as an expert witness on behalf of Koon, he explained to 
jurors that an officer's account of a traumatic event may be blurred or 
rendered incomplete by a tunnel vision that kicks in during duress. The tunnel 
vision, Blum testified, could explain some discrepancies between the notorious 
videotape and the officers' firsthand reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not a "big fan" of Koon, Blum says he fears that the King case 
fallout has ultimately made police officers too tentative in their work. 
</P>
<P>
 With the goal of charting the impact of the King case on area police 
departments, Blum is organizing a research project. He hopes the street-level 
cops can provide data on changes in stress, morale, public perception and 
police conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blum has only to thumb through his patient files to find anecdotal evidence of 
the pressures on today's patrol officers. Montebello Police Sgt. Tim Mahan was 
a wreck when he walked into Blum's office after a shooting three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan had been directing traffic on Whittier Boulevard when he found himself 
staring down a stolen sedan with a trio of carjackers. As the officer leaped 
from the car's path, he expected to feel a hot blast rip through his gut from 
the shotgun leveled out the passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23-year veteran got off two rounds before he hit the ground, killing the 
armed 15-year-old. "I couldn't believe I was alive," he recalls. He walked away 
with no visible wounds, but was shaken more than he knew. 
</P>
<P>
 His anxieties were compounded by the criminal investigation and trial, a 
subsequent civil case and the feeling that he was being treated as a lawbreaker 
instead of a lawman. He saw his name on a police report next to the word 
homicide. In court, he felt awkward sitting at the defendant's table after 
years on the prosecutor's side. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahan was vindicated, but not before months of worrying that he might lose 
both his job and home. The memory of the shooting left him with nightmares, and 
the emotional pressures manifested themselves as such physical ailments as 
stomach pain and diarrhea. Worse, other cops began to whisper about his hand 
tremors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't trust Larry, or any shrink for that matter, so I walked into his 
office emotionally armed and fearful," Mahan says. "I was from the old school, 
too, where you don't say you're hurting; you play it off. I thought anything I 
said would cost me my job. But the healing began as soon as I began trusting 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Blum explained that the stomach ailments were tied to the shotgun wound 
Mahan's mind had expected his body to suffer. And that the nightmares were tied 
to the carjacker's age -- the same as Mahan's son. As Mahan recognized that his 
troubles were normal reactions, not signs of weakness, he began to mend and 
eventually returned to the force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry saved my career, no doubt about it," Mahan says. 
</P>
<P>
 To Dr. Deadlift, that makes it all worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good ones are the truest heroes and heroines you can imagine," Blum says. 
"They literally sacrifice their own lives to save strangers. Think about that. 
Who does that? Some of the sweetest, finest human beings I have ever met wear 
badges. I'd do anything for those cops."

 While interviewing the Devil, Larry King asked him to name some of his 
greatest accomplishments.

 The Devil ticked off several: "The sinking of the Titanic, I did very well 
with that one . . . World Wars I and II were a hoot for me . . . I laughed when 
the Hindenburg exploded."

 So you're tired of spending your nights with Spot, 007 and Orville 
Redenbacher? Don't despair. Take these tips from the experts: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get rid of all dead-end relationships. (Cross them out of your address 
book.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Dispose of, or at least put away, all photographs, gifts and mementos of 
past relationships. (This includes jewelry.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Set a date by which you want to be married and post it all over your home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a plan of action on how you will find a mate and pick three 
mate-meeting options: networking, volunteering, personal ads, sports or the 
like. Then throw yourself into them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Says one expert: On a first date, ask 10 specific, planned questions. Bring 
along an index card if you need to. Don't rely on chemistry to let you know who 
is right for you. 
</P>
<P>
 * Says a different expert: Don't conduct a first date like an interview or an 
audition. Have fun, listen and assess whether you are physically attracted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take time to get to know your partner, and keep sex out of the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue to date a number of people until you know that you are in a 
mutually committed relationship. Don't put all your eggs in one basket until 
you know that basket is going to last a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't live together. 
</P>
<P>
 * Honestly evaluate what you have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a (short) list of what you want in a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make a list of 100 things that have ever interested you -- juggling, sky 
diving, standing on your head -- and research them. Find out who else might be 
involved. Then pick five of those things and do them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Become more approachable -- make eye contact and smile at people. 
</P>
<P>
 * Each day, compliment someone of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 * Become aware of the differences between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain a lot of friendships so you are not desperate for a mate to fill 
your social calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure your life is happy and interesting; don't rely on meeting someone 
to make you happy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Before you focus on finding the right person, be the right person.

COMMITMENTS; THE ART OF FALLING IN LOVE; SINGLES TODAY HAVE A TOUGH TIME 
FINDING MR. (OR MS.) RIGHT. WHAT WITH LONG HOURS AT WORK AND THE GYM, WHO'S GOT 
TIME TO MEET PEOPLE? THE EXPERTS SAY YOU DO IF YOU GO ABOUT IT THE RIGHT WAY. 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, boy met girl; boy and girl fell in love; boy and girl got 
married. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, nabbing Mr. or Ms. Right is apparently not so simple. In fact, like 
California cuisine or tai chi, soul-mate hunting is an art -- and an art that 
must be mastered, say experts in such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think they can start a relationship by seeing someone across the room, 
floating into each other's arms and then be set for life," said Hilary Rich, 
author of "Get Married Now: the Definitive Guide for Finding and Marrying the 
Right Mate for You" (Bob Adams Inc., 1993). 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to create relationships, you have to sink your teeth in; you have to 
become involved in the process," she added. "It's a mistake to think it will 
happen by kismet." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, who is completing a "Get Married Now" infomercial, is among many 
specialists tapping into the vast reservoir of singles' Angst. Rich and others 
have generated dozens of seminars, classes and books designed for hapless 
relationship-seekers. 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of titles: "The Mating Game," "At Long Last Love," "Yes! You Can 
Find a Soul Mate . . . Even in L.A.!" "How to Marry Rich," "10 Ways to Attract 
the Opposite Sex . . . Immediately!" "How to Attract Women," "If I'm So 
Wonderful, Why Am I Still Single?" "How to Get the Woman You Want with No Money 
Down" and its counterpart, "Protect Yourself From Men Who Want to Take 
Advantage of You and Learn How to Get the Man You Want at the Same Time." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are great people who take these classes," said Toby Berlin, executive 
director of the Learning Annex, the largest adult seminar organization on the 
West Coast and home to many such classes. "They're well-spoken and well 
dressed, with a couple of initials after their names -- they just need a little 
help in this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, singles today face some very contemporary issues when it comes to 
mating. Commutes, long work days and the ever-important hour at the gym can 
leave very little time for meeting prospective partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But an overfilled Filofax is the least of the problems confronting the 
dateless and desperate. Singleness has become not just a state of being, but a 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Singles are so frustrated these days," said Richard Gant, author of "How to 
Get the Woman You Want With No Money Down" (Aware Publications, 1993), and star 
of his own infomercial, "For Men Only." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are either apathetic, afraid or cynical. And if it seems like too much 
effort, they don't want to try." 
</P>
<P>
 Gant and others also say that expectations, especially in Los Angeles, land of 
celluloid and movie stars, are way too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I refer to it as the 4-6-8 syndrome," he said. "A person is a 4, thinks he's 
a 6, but thinks he deserves an 8." 
</P>
<P>
 It is important, however, to make a list of your ideal mate's desirable 
qualities. But that list should narrow necessary attributes down to 10, the 
experts recommend. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a good idea to separate the "must haves" from the "would likes." For 
example, "gainfully employed" or "of child-bearing years" might be a "must 
have," while "blond and broad shouldered" or "36-24-36" might fit the "would 
like" list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people say they want this, this, this and then wind up with nobody," 
said Carole Kirschner, who produced the ABC-TV special "The Search for the New 
Ideal Man" and who teaches "Yes! You Can Find a Soul Mate . . . Even in L.A.!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people in the world just meet their soul mate and they're really lucky," 
said Kirschner, 41, who met her boyfriend at a singles function while doing 
research for her class. "For the rest of us, we make our own soul mate. It's 
about finding someone who has qualities you want and also has the willingness 
to grow. The important thing is to end up with what is most important to you, 
and the rest is a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Brierley, a psychotherapist who runs Romanceworks -- For Those Seeking 
Love, which includes one-on-one counseling, tapes and seminars, takes a 
different approach. She focuses on understanding the differences between the 
way men and women view marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Women think of marriage in terms of financial and emotional security, 
children, family and, in short, as life enhancing, said Brierley, who practices 
in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But when men think about marriage, she said, they think about a loss of 
independence, additional responsibility, financial risk and how it will disrupt 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man must be madly in love with a woman and know that the only way to keep 
her is by marrying her," Brierley said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best ways a woman can successfully court a man, Brierley said, is 
by making her home "male friendly." Key elements include a large, deep sofa; a 
large, raised coffee table, and, of course, the TV remote control and a bowl of 
finger food within easy reach of the sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 "His unconscious thought when he sees your apartment should be, 'I could live 
here,' " said Brierley, who has gone to clients' homes to help decorate. 
</P>
<P>
 All this plotting and planning might sound a bit desperate and extreme. But 
for those who are truly tired of leaping over tables and bridesmaids to catch 
the bouquet, drastic measures are in order. And these experts are not advising 
anyone to do anything they haven't done themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I spent five years in hell wishing, hoping I'd get married," said author 
Rich, 31, who married at 27 and now has two children. "I felt like everyone I 
knew was getting married; I was always a bridesmaid, never a bride; I cried 
myself to sleep, I felt left out of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich, who was working as a business manager at the time, told her boss she 
would no longer work past 5 p.m. and went on an all-out search for Her Man, 
vowing to leave no stone unturned. She came up with a plan, which included 
setting her wedding date before she met her husband. Her efforts paid off, and 
after seven months, she met Mr. Right through a friend. They married five 
months later. After that, with the fervor of the saved, Rich decided it was her 
duty to lead others to matrimonial bliss. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Gant, 48, said that when he was younger, the women he was interested in looked 
over and through him. He made it his goal to heighten his desirability factor 
and spent the last 30 years talking to 1,000 "above average women" and 1,000 
men who successfully dated or married them. From this and other research, Gant 
developed his strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about how to score or hustle," said Gant, engaged to a woman he 
describes as "out of my league." "It's about how to present yourself, what to 
do when you find the right person and how not to blow it." 
</P>
<P>
 The question, of course, is whether all these machinations and analyses 
actually lead to successful relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't do any serious harm to set some sort of goal, if you need a goal 
to get you in gear," said Anita Siegman, a Los Angeles psychologist who 
counsels couples. "Unfortunately, these things don't always work on a schedule, 
and if you're so determined to get married, you could be courting disaster if 
you find just anyone willing to marry you." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, 41, a graduate of countless singles seminars, said that although none 
of the classes she took did her any harm, she believes that she met her 
boyfriend after she stopped trying so hard to find him and instead started 
focusing on herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I did gave me good information and was good preparation," said 
Karen, a Los Angeles clothing buyer. "But ultimately I had to realize that 
there were nice, available men in my life all along, and it was my problem that 
I never liked any of them. It wasn't that I suddenly found the right person, it 
was that I worked to be able to appreciate and love someone who wasn't 
necessarily my ideal." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Becky, a 36-year-old Huntington Beach writer, has tried just about everything 
when it comes to finding Mr. Wonderful: singles ads, dating clubs, dances, 
hikes and the "How to Meet Mr. Right"-type classes. Her conclusions: It will 
happen when it happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I just continue to work on myself," she said. "It's important to be 
open, but ultimately I don't think you can control who you meet or when. In 
fact, a lot of the people I've met when I've done the personal ads and the 
dating clubs are your typical single guys who are either really unattractive or 
have some fatal flaw which keeps them from being in a relationship. I prefer to 
just live my life, and trust that I'll meet the right person." 
</P>
<P>
 But all the teachers claim high success rates, and many of the students who 
invest their time and money in their courses, which range from $29 to hundreds 
of dollars, seem pleased with what they've picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Hamburger, although still single, swears by the techniques he's learned 
through Gant's book and seminars. He says he now feels comfortable to approach 
anyone, anywhere.

 "If I see someone I'd like to get to know, I can talk to her instantly and 
find out right away if I'm someone she'd be interested in, or if she's someone 
I'd be interested in," said Hamburger, 48, a salesman who lives in Torrance. "I 
ask her if she's married, engaged or madly in love, and if she is, I don't 
waste my time. Then I ask her what it would take to go to dinner with her, and 
if she says I'd have to be 6-feet-4 and blond, then I know to walk away," said 
Hamburger, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and dark-haired.

 Joyce, a 26-year-old special events coordinator in West Hollywood and a 
graduate of Kirschner's class, said she believes the class opened her up to 
meet the person she is dating, whom she is "crazy about." 
</P>
<P>
 "It helped me get clear on what I wanted and didn't want, and to focus," she 
said. "The class made me more open and the daily lessons Carole had us do, like 
smiling and making eye contact with people, helped a lot. When I first met my 
boyfriend, I didn't think he was my type -- but I stayed open and kept talking 
to him, and realized he was what I was looking for."

 And Sharon Ashkenazi, a 31-year-old Los Angeles computer programmer, did get 
married three months after she took Rich's "Get Married Now" class in 1992. The 
class, she said, helped her focus on what was important to her and gave her 
tools for spotting Prince Charming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was also just really supportive being there," she said of the class. "It 
made me feel like I wasn't out there in the world alone, searching alone. It 
was fun and gave me a feeling of camaraderie." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, if nothing else, the countless classes, books and seminars help show 
those who have not yet found their beloved that they are not alone. And these 
forums empower and motivate singles who might otherwise feel dejected and 
helpless. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rich: "If you don't take control of this area of your life, who will?"

POWERHOUSES FUEL SALES AT BOX OFFICE; MOVIES: 'TRUE LIES,' 'FORREST GUMP' AND 
'THE LION KING' ARE ON TARGET TO BREAK A RECORD FOR NON-HOLIDAY WEEKEND TICKET 
SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The movie industry on Sunday appeared headed for a record $105-million 
nonholiday weekend box-office gross, led by three powerhouse movies: "True 
Lies" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, "Forrest Gump" with Tom Hanks and Walt 
Disney Pictures' animated film, "The Lion King."  
</P>
<P>
 If the weekend estimates hold up when final figures are released today, the 
total will break the record established only a year ago on the weekend of July 
9-11, when four hit movies dominated the market, accounting for about 60% of 
ticket sales. Those films were "Jurassic Park," "The Firm," "In the Line of 
Fire" and "Sleepless in Seattle."  
</P>
<P>
 For the past weekend, only three films were taking in nearly 70% of all the 
dollars plunked down for admission. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, with theaters still open, studio executives who track box-office 
trends offered estimates that the weekend take would range from $102 million to 
$110 million. But all agreed that no matter how it was calculated, a record 
would be achieved. And the increase would outpace the rate of ticket inflation, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibitor Relations Co., which compiles grosses on films making more than 
$500,000 a week, calculated last summer's record weekend at $100 million. John 
Krier, president of the firm, said this weekend would easily top that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seldom do you see such powerhouses in the market," said Krier. "And seldom do 
you see films like 'Speed' and 'Forrest Gump' show such staying power in the 
face of severe competition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 20th Century Fox release of "True Lies," a $100-million production that 
reunited Schwarzenegger with the director of his successful "Terminator" 
movies, James Cameron, drew an estimated $26.2 million for the 
Friday-through-Sunday period. Preview showings around the nation on Thursday 
generated $1.6 million, giving the action film a total of $27.8 million to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 After last summer's less-than-dazzling debut of Schwarzenegger's "Last Acton 
Hero," which nevertheless went on to a successful box-office run, there had 
been a lot of industry speculation about the potential for "True Lies." It is a 
costly film and its opening date was postponed from the July 4th weekend to 
July 15, which sometimes can signal a production in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no business like show business," said an elated Tom Sherak, Fox's 
executive vice president, quoting the Irving Berlin song about the sudden 
shifts of fortune that entertainers experience. After a winter and spring 
drought, Fox is enjoying a strong summer with "True Lies" and the earlier 
release of "Speed," which came in fifth for the weekend with $5 million in 
ticket sales and $94 million after six weeks of release. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In second place for the weekend was Paramount Pictures' "Forrest Gump," a 
whimsical film with Hanks in the title role as an unlikely hero. The film 
grossed about $24 million in its second weekend of release -- a number that is 
virtually the same as the first weekend's gross, and a rarity because typically 
movie grosses decline after the first weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's holding power confirms the "incredible" positive word of mouth that 
Barry London, Paramount's president of worldwide distribution, said it is 
receiving from audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's "The Lion King" has slipped to third place in the weekend standing, 
but remains the king of the summer. The weekend added $17 million and brings 
its total to $174.7 million after only six weeks of wide release. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's "Angels in the Outfield" baseball comedy, appealing to families, 
opened in fourth place and batted a strong $9.2 million. That was followed by 
"Speed" in fifth place. The Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte whodunit picture "I 
Love Trouble" came in sixth with $3.5 million; "Blown Away" was seventh with $3 
million; "The Shadow" was eighth with $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In ninth and tenth, respectively, were "Wolf" at $2.3 million and $59.2 
million to date, and "The Flintstones," at $1.3 million, and $119.4 to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its popularity, "True Lies" has generated some criticism from Muslim, 
Arab-American and women's groups, who have accused it of reinforcing racial and 
anti-female stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were informational protests in a numbers of cities last week, including 
the Westwood area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering that what we did was a drop in the bucket compared to the media 
blitz that accompanied the film, we're pleased (with the attention the protests 
received)," said Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Washington-based Council 
on American-Islamic Relations.

HE'S ALL BENT OUT OF SHAPE OVER 'HIGH STRUNG' PLANS; MOVIES: JIM CARREY APPEARS 
IN A FILM THAT FEW PEOPLE HAVE HEARD ABOUT AND THAT HE WON'T TALK ABOUT. BUT 
ITS DISTRIBUTORS PLAN ON CASHING IN ON THE RED-HOT STAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Even Fireman Bill would probably recoil from the white heat emanating from Jim 
Carrey these days. The former "In Living Color" cast member -- known in 
Hollywood now as the $7-million man, because that's his fee for motion pictures 
-- became a superstar overnight earlier this year with "Ace Ventura: Pet 
Detective." His next movie, "The Mask," is expected to be a blockbuster when it 
opens later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrey will have to stretch himself like Silly Putty in the next couple of 
years to keep up with a portfolio of high-profile movies that include "Batman 
Forever," "Dumb and Dumber," sequels to "Ace Ventura" and "The Mask," and 
possibly "Best Man." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's one upcoming Carrey movie that few people have heard about, and 
that he refuses to talk about -- the 1991 "High Strung." His management, in 
fact, asked the film's distributors, Rocket Pictures, not to use Carrey's name 
or likeness in association with it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 They politely refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every superstar -- Kevin Costner, Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger 
-- all those guys had two or three pictures of really terrible quality out 
there that people capitalized on," said Tom Coleman, one of the principals of 
Rocket Pictures in Beverly Hills. Coleman's company bought the theater and 
video distribution rights to the forgotten film-festival entry as soon as 
Carrey became hot. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is different -- this is a good movie," Coleman said. "He does his stuff, 
he's quite funny, and he should be proud of it. It's not like he took his 
clothes off or anything like Stallone" did in an early film. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket plans to release "High Strung" theatrically in a few markets in 
September, when the big summer releases die down, followed by a national home 
video release, where most small films earn their keep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problem Carrey appears to have with "High Strung" is the marketing plans, 
which will prominently feature him. Yet with the exception of one 10-minute 
scene at the end of the movie, Carrey appears in the $400,000 film only in 
brief flashes as a shadowy grim reaper. "High Strung" is essentially a one-man 
comedy routine, written and performed by comedian Steve Oedekerk, that takes 
place during one day inside the apartment of an uptight man called Thane. He 
can't stand relationships, breakfast cereals, junk mail, the fly trapped in his 
apartment or much of anything.  
</P>
<P>
 "High Strung" was financed by two Russian expatriates and directed by 
first-time director Roger Nygard. Carrey, who had just started on "In Living 
Color" when the movie was being made, agreed to shoot a small part as a favor 
to his friend Oedekerk, who is now writing the sequel to "Ace Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with his contract, Carrey's cameo is unbilled in the movie, 
unlike the appearances of other relatively well-known actors who show up in 
small parts, from Fred Willard as an insurance agent, to Thomas F. Wilson 
("Back to the Future") as Thane's best friend, to Denise Crosby ("Star Trek: 
The Next Generation") as his boss.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, Jim wanted to secure his position, because when we were 
making the movie, his star was just about to bloom," said executive producer 
Vladimir Horunzhy, 43, a former orchestra conductor who fled his homeland 15 
years ago with a rock guitarist, Sergei Zholobetsky, when they refused to join 
the Communist Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very simple: Jim didn't want people to feel that he was available to do 
such small films. At the time we were shooting the picture, Jim wanted bigger 
movies and bigger fees," said Horunzhy, who now scores film music. He persuaded 
his friend Zholobetsky to sink his entire life savings -- from selling medical 
equipment in New York -- into the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "High Strung" received glowing reviews and won several awards on the film 
festival circuit, but the filmmakers could not find an interested theatrical or 
home-video distributor, leaving them with no return on their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned the film industry is like selling shoes -- they all want brand 
names, and we didn't have a brand name," Nygard said. "Steve Oedekerk is quite 
well known as a stand-up comic, but that didn't matter to exhibitors. They 
wanted film names." 
</P>
<P>
 When "Ace Ventura" burst out in theaters to the eventual tune of $72 million, 
they suddenly found that name in Carrey. "Ace Ventura" has proven to be just as 
powerful a draw on home video, selling 4.2-million units to consumers in its 
first three weeks. Although he has appeared in "Once Bitten," "Peggy Sue Got 
Married," "Earth Girls Are Easy," "The Dead Pool" and a few others, "High 
Strung" is the only one of his that hasn't been released. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Ace Ventura' gave me a new lease on life," Horunzhy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The executive producers were soon entertaining offers from several independent 
distributors. They chose Rocket, which had shown interest in the project even 
before Carrey became a film star. Rocket expects limited theatrical revenue, 
but hopes to sell videos.  
</P>
<P>
 Carrey's camp won't comment, but sources say that a phone call was placed to 
Rocket asking that Carrey's name not be used to promote the film. Carrey's 
contract apparently states that the actor cannot appear in the film's title, 
closing credits or the credit block on advertising posters. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not stopping Rocket from featuring Carrey in a promotional trailer 
and splashing his name and photo throughout the upcoming advertising campaign, 
which Rocket refuses to release in advance. Included in the ad will be a 
critic's quote from National Radio Review saying that Carrey is funnier in 
"High Strung" than he was in "Ace Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman insists, though, that he is not selling "High Strung" as a Jim Carrey 
movie: "We're going to honor his contract to the letter, and the nature of his 
participation in the picture will come across in the marketing and billing."

KEEPS COMING BACK TILL SHE GETS IT WRIGHT; MUSIC: MICHELLE WRIGHT, WHO PLAYS 
THE CRAZY HORSE TONIGHT, IS ON HER SECOND GO-ROUND AS A NASHVILLE RESIDENT. HER 
DETERMINATION PAID OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three months after her first foray to Nashville more than a decade ago, 
country singer Michelle Wright packed up and drove home. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in a tiny Canadian farming town -- population 600 -- she had already 
hit the road with a band. But that hardly prepared the greenhorn for Music City 
Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew no one and nothing," she recalled, referring to the brutally 
competitive industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the singer, who plays two shows at the Crazy Horse Steak House tonight, 
remained undaunted. In fact, she even wrote a song the night she returned, 
"I'll Keep Reaching for the Stars." 
</P>
<P>
 And today, while the stardom she enjoys in Canada still eludes her stateside, 
the husky-voiced singer has made the move back to Nashville, where she cut her 
1992 hit, "Take It Like a Man." The song earned the Academy of Country Music's 
top new female vocalist award last year, and she has just released a new 
single. "One Good Man" -- a longing-for-love ballad from her next album, "The 
Reasons Why," due in September -- "makes full use of her sultry, wide-ranging 
voice," a Billboard critic writes in this week's edition, "squeezing every last 
emotional drop from the lyric." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent telephone interview from home, the thirtysomething singer, on 
a break from an 18-month tour of Canada, Europe and United States, said she had 
no apprehension about returning to Nashville roughly three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this was a place I could come to do a lot of research and hang out 
with people whom I could learn from," she said, "and that's what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who has unconsciously added a touch of Southern twang to her subtle 
Canadian accent, follows pop chanteuse and compatriot k.d. lang south, but she 
said she feels no pressure to replicate lang's widespread fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just been a great inspiration (whose success) indicated to me that it 
was possible. I thought, by God, I can do this too." 
</P>
<P>
 The singer, who also plays acoustic rhythm guitar in her five-member band, 
made her stage debut at 5. She was following in the footsteps of her parents, 
who were country musicians as well as farmers in Merlin, Ontario, across from 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 In her teens, she put together a garage band, which played country and '70s 
rock, and a week before her 20th birthday, after impressing an agent during a 
local gig, went on the road for the first time, touring Canada and the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Those salad days were free and reckless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had a blast, but it became apparent to me that the work had to be a 
bit more focused," she said. "I had the vision, but I didn't have the 
discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to get the discipline, Wright signed in 1985 with manager Brian 
Ferriman, who remains with her today. Two years later, she got sober. (She once 
freely discussed her alcoholism, no secret within the industry back then, but 
now prefers to leave the past behind.) A year after that, she cut her first 
album, "Do Right By Me," in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, the recognition began, especially around 1990, when she 
released the album "Michelle Wright." The Canadian Country Music Assn. gave her 
album-of-the-year honors in 1991 and named her the year's female vocalist in 
'90, '91 and '92. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until "Now & Then," which she recorded in 1992 after moving to 
Nashville -- and trading big hair for a comely waifish cut -- with her first 
major label, Arista Records, that she scored her first hits. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, which shows her blues, swing and rockabilly influences, made it to 
No. 20 on Billboard's country chart that year, boosted by "Take It Like a Man" 
and "He Would Be Sixteen," which brought tremendous fan response, Wright said. 
In the tear-jerker, a woman, haunted by her past, muses about the son she gave 
up for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've sat in the back of the (tour) bus and cried tears of pain and joy as I 
read all the letters regarding this song," Wright said, adding that she has 
never been pregnant, but has known women who have had to face this situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Having that sort of understanding is a criteria she sets in choosing all her 
songs. She says she has complete control over her material, all but two of them 
penned by other writers. 
</P>
<P>
 Relating to the subject matter of a song she has written -- such as "Where Do 
We Go From Here," on her new album -- requires no such secondhand empathy. It's 
based on the recent breakup of her lengthy relationship with former band 
member, bass guitar player Joel Kane, she said, citing lyrics about two lovers' 
questioning their compatibility: 
</P>
<P>
 " It used to be so easy then We didn't hold back anything Love was always sure 
to win, or so we both kept promising But how were we to know, once time had its 
say That we would come this close to losing our way, so where would we go from 
here ." 
</P>
<P>
 But personal change isn't all Wright has on her mind. On a larger scale, she 
sees more success for more women in the business. Typically on any given week, 
the ratio of male-to-female country singers on the Billboard charts is about 
5-to-1; Wright is optimistic that the right parts are in place to remedy that. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, she appeared in "The Women of Country," a televised special 
featuring Tammy Wynette and Loretta Lynn, among others. Such legends, she said, 
achieved great success in the business in the days when they trekked across the 
country -- kids in tow -- in their own rickety cars with trailers hitched to 
the rear, well before luxury tour buses. 
</P>
<P>
 If they can do it, certainly the current crop can continue the task.  
</P>
<P>
 "There have been strong, independent women in this industry for years," Wright 
said, "so we're not necessarily a new breed." 
</P>
<P>
 At concerts where she shares the bill with male singers, audiences, she said, 
cheer just as hard for her as for anyone else, including a recent show in 
Fargo, N.D., in which the audience was loaded with girls and women singing 
along and yelling encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely going to be the decade of the female artist," she said, "for 
women to break through and even the scale." 
</P>

THRILLED, APPRECIATIVE FANS PACK STADIUM; MUSIC: FROM THE $1,000 SEATS TO THE 
NOSEBLEED SECTION, THE MOMENTOUS 'THREE TENORS' CONCERT WAS THE PLACE TO BE IN 
LOS ANGELES SATURDAY NIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "I like to be in America. OK by me in America. Everything free in America. " 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard Bernstein's paean from "West Side Story" rang out to a capacity Dodger 
Stadium crowd Saturday night during the "Encore! The Three Tenors" concert, and 
an international throng plainly shared the sentiment -- and objected not a bit 
that the evening was anything but free. 
</P>
<P>
 They schlepped from Switzerland and Silver Lake, Tokyo and Torrance, to be 
part of what was likely the single most multinational mega-concert crowd Los 
Angeles has ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that half of this audience is not from the United States," said 
Bill Press, chair of the California Democratic Party, as he schmoozed in the 
$1000-a-seat section, which was so cosmopolitan and preoccupied that even O.J. 
Simpson attorney Robert Shapiro was unbesieged as he proceeded to his seats. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the evening's event was so much the place to be -- for people from 
every tax bracket -- that even hardball commentators were reduced to gushing. 
"Pavarotti is my favorite," Press continued. "And 'Nessun dorma' -- I'll 
probably weep and sing along." 
</P>
<P>
 From the nosebleed heights of the uppermost deck to the 13,000 top-dollar 
folding chairs on the playing field, the attentive fans basked in the mix of 
pops and opera fare from Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. 
</P>
<P>
 Some called it momentous. "This is a second Golden Age of tenors and it may be 
generations before this happens again," said retired businessman Gerald Hieitel 
of San Francisco, a denizen of the priciest seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were thrilled just to get an earful, seat or no. "I was really happy to 
work this," said Sue Levandofsky, a concession worker up in the blue seats. 
"Most everybody was." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuxedos mixed with T-shirts on every tier above the well-heeled playing field 
pack, but the thumbs-up was as consistent as the dress code was not. Luigi 
Caruso, who cooks for Pavarotti when the tenor is in Pittsburgh, sat in the 
loge and called it "a dream." Teacher Tiecheng Fan, who'd never been in Dodger 
Stadium before, said the topmost tier was "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Mayer, a travel guide from Switzerland, rated conductor Zubin Mehta 
"brilliant." And the Angeleno brothers Buchak, Ruben and Ed, in matching red, 
white and blue jackets with Caesar's Palace logos, agreed the show was "10 
times better" than they'd expected. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco real estate agent Ibtesam Sahourieh and her retired friend Terri 
Saba echoed the sentiments of many. "I died and went to heaven about half an 
hour ago," Sahourieh cooed as she stood in the souvenir line. "And I'm so 
excited. It's like my first trip to Disneyland," Saba added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, including architects Joey Shimoda and Tom (who wouldn't give his last 
name), even managed to slip in without paying. "We were listening outside and 
we just walked in. We got lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The evening wasn't problem-free -- a traffic jam and parking nightmare had 
people streaming into the stadium virtually until intermission, keeping up a 
steady accompaniment of high-heels clicking on concrete. But the concert-goers 
stayed tuned to the tunes. "Considering it took us almost the whole first half 
to get in here, it's still excellent," said Evan Nisonson of Los Angeles, beer 
in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then too, there were those who thought the sound wasn't up to snuff. "I came 
up here to join my friends in the cheap seats," said Larry Miluv, business 
manager for the rap group Naughty by Nature, lurking on the loftiest level. "My 
wife Sheila and her brother and sister-in-law from New Jersey stayed in the 
loge. Downstairs the sound is horrible. Up here, it's excellent." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest sound next to the Big Three, though, was that of moola being made, 
in small ways as well as large. "Every now and then you hear a cash machine in 
the background go ding-ding-ding," said jeans-clad student Ed Haro of La 
Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 A few other gripes were more idiosyncratic. Frank Sinatra, whom the three 
tenors saluted with two renditions of "My Way," displayed his legendary 
restrained appreciation of the fourth estate. "Singers? What singers?" he 
snarled, when a reporter asked him about the tenors. "I'm not gonna answer that 
question at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, goodwill and euphoria were more the norm. The final medley and many 
encores elicited bursts of rhythmic clapping. And one enterprising woman even 
stood in a phone booth on the general admission level, holding the receiver up 
toward the stage so that a friend at home could hear. It may have been the only 
rebroadcast producer Tibor Rudas didn't have a piece of.

STREET SMART: CALTRANS SAYS IT DID RIGHT THING WITH LEFT-TURN BACKUP ON PCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 The left-turn pocket turning from southbound Pacific Coast Highway onto Crown 
Valley Parkway is not long enough. Cars turning left often back up, spilling 
onto Pacific Coast Highway, creating a dangerous obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that this problem could easily be solved. Couldn't the center 
island be removed and the lanes extended back in its place? It appears as 
though it is wide enough, and it wouldn't cost that much. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Cooper 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rose Orem, a spokeswoman for Caltrans, says that left-turn pocket is long 
enough. Another problem is causing the traffic backups, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Caltrans field investigation of the area revealed an intermittent problem 
with one of the vehicle detectors in the traffic signal, Orem said. The problem 
is causing the light cycle to operate ineffectively, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans has since repaired the detector, Orem said. Because it was an 
intermittent problem, maintenance crews will follow up their repair work by 
monitoring this intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 As you drive south on the San Diego Freeway approaching the El Toro Y, there 
are cameras mounted underneath a couple of the underpasses directed in the 
car-pool lanes. What are these for?  
</P>
<P>
 Who is watching them? Where are they being watched? 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Depasquale 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Seven television cameras are placed along Interstate 5 and the San Diego and 
Laguna freeways, said Rose Orem, a Caltrans spokeswoman. They were used in a 
study conducted from December, 1990, to March, 1993, which monitored, among 
other things, car-pool lane speed and at what points car-pool lane traffic 
merged into regular traffic lanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the study ended, the cameras have not operated, Orem said. But those 
cameras and eight others will be incorporated into a fiber optic system that 
Caltrans is installing along the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways and 
Interstate 5, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The cameras will go on-line in the spring of 1995 and will be able to provide 
Caltrans with information about traffic accidents or congestion as it happens, 
Orem said. The cameras will be controlled and monitored from Caltrans' traffic 
management center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 What is the appropriate way to park in a cul de sac? Should I park parallel to 
the curb or perpendicular to the curb?  
</P>
<P>
 L. Glenn 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Parallel parking is required in all situations unless otherwise indicated, 
according to the California Vehicle Code. Local authorities may permit angle 
parking by ordinance only, the code states. Motorcycles are the exception to 
this rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Transportation Authority and the city of Huntington Beach 
are working together to improve traffic conditions on another segment of Beach 
Boulevard as part of the OCTA Smart Street Program. Construction begins today 
along 2.3 miles of the busy thoroughfare between Ellis Avenue and the San Diego 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Improvements will include pavement rehabilitation, an additional traffic lane 
and traffic signal synchronization. The project also will add turn lanes at the 
intersections with Ellis Avenue, Warner Avenue and Stark Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction contract was awarded to R.J. Noble of Orange. Noble's bid of 
$2.8 million was 32% lower than the original engineer's estimate.  
</P>
<P>
 Primary funding comes from Measure M, Orange County's half-cent transportation 
sales tax. Additional funding also is being provided by Huntington Beach to 
improve the street's pavement for a smoother ride.  
</P>
<P>
 Completion of the project is expected in six months.

LARGER THAN LIFE; BEN AND MIKEY PROVE TO BE A BIG ATTRACTION AT THE FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, Michael and Angie Wittman had worked with livestock before, but then 
Michael answered a vaguely worded want ad one day and -- VOILA! -- they found 
themselves the caretakers of what may be the world's biggest horse. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the 13th summer, their campy but popular giant animal exhibit has come 
to the Orange County Fair, where it is big in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 Most days during the fair, scores of people queue up hour after hour to pony 
up four bits each to gawk at Ben, the huge horse and his colossal, if less 
acclaimed, soul mate, Mikey the Giant Steer. 
</P>
<P>
 First things first though. If there's anything the caretakers of what may be 
the planet's bulkiest equine are used to, it's questions. Day in and day out, 
they answer the same ones again and again: "How big is he?" "What do you feed 
him?" So, that said: 
</P>
<P>
 How big is he? 
</P>
<P>
 Big Ben stands 6-foot-6 and tips the scales at 3,030 pounds. That's almost as 
much as a Volkswagen Jetta, and more than 3 1/2 times the weight of the fattest 
living man on record, T.J. "Fat" Albert Jackson of Canton, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 How much does he eat? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it isn't exactly accurate to say big Ben eats like a horse. Because he 
eats like several horses. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, he gulps down a bale of hay and 25 pounds of crunchy, specially 
prepared, protein-packed pellets, not to mention the 30 to 50 gallons of water. 
By comparison, your garden-variety horse takes in three pounds of protein 
pellets, a fifth of a hay bale every day and a fraction of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 What does big Ben do? 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever he wants," jokes Angie. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
 For their own good, both Ben and Mikey have been castrated, the Wittmans say. 
"It calms them down," Michael says. "Also makes them live longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people are offended by the use of animals in such sideshows. And some of 
them have made their feelings known to the Wittmans after visiting Ben and 
Mikey. 
</P>
<P>
 Philosophical issues aside, fair officials say, the exhibit has received high 
marks for "cleanliness" and "professionalism" during spot inspections and no 
complaints have been filed with the fair office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only people who are dissatisfied are the animal activist types," Angie 
Wittman said. "And there are a lot of them -- especially in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a freak show . . . like the two-headed man and headless lady," 
she said. "That's fake. It's all mirrors. These are just big animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she said, eight months out of the year Ben and Mikey are "out to 
pasture" where they do nothing but what they do best: eat and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Based in Central Florida, every summer the Wittmans pack up their 
Schwarzenegger-like critters and their crew and convoy west to make the 
four-month fair circuit in California, Oregon and Utah. They work for a company 
called Outdoor Exhibits, which is owned by their boss, Tom Beimborn. He's been 
in the giant animal business since 1960 and has been bringing his oversize 
creatures to Orange County since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Beimborn tapped Michael, 21, to be the manager of the "show" 
and chief animal guardian after Michael responded to a newspaper ad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't say anything about big animals," recalled Michael, Wisconsin born 
and bred, and the self-described son of an "eccentric" blacksmith and 
seamstress. "It just said they were looking for someone interested in working 
with livestock and traveling across the country." 
</P>
<P>
 "We fell in love with the animals and taking care of them and letting people 
see them," said Angie, 18, who recently married Michael and became the 
company's caretaker-bookkeeper. "People in small towns don't see this kind of 
thing very often. They're in awe." 
</P>
<P>
 The most rewarding part of the job: "When people remark on how well taken care 
of the animals are," Angie said. "They're like our babies." 
</P>
<P>
 On the road, they are required by law to stop every five hours and give the 
animals some time away from their cramped traveling quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the show has gone on in places as far away as Alaska, where they 
charge $2 for people to see both Ben and Mikey or $1 to see one. "But up there 
everything is expensive," Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the places they've gone to, the couple said, it is in Orange County, 
more than most, where people are willing to pay to get a look-see at the gentle 
giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people here seem to really like this," Angie said. "The same people come 
every year to see the same animals. They say, 'Oh yeah, we saw him last year, 
but I want to see him again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they didn't see Mikey the Giant Steer last year because this year is 
Mikey's debut. Mikey replaced "Frankie," who died earlier this year from 
varicose veins, "bad plumbing" and old age, Michael said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikey, who weighs 3,250 pounds and has a whopping 11-foot girth, looks just 
like Frankie, though, and so people get confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the trouble: Mikey goes by the same stage name as Frankie, "White 
Mountain." There's no question Mikey is big, but it's unclear whether he's the 
biggest steer on record because there doesn't seem to be any records on such 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben, who replaced "Hercules" and has appeared at the Orange County Fair for 
three years, has a stage name, too: "Belgian Supreme." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know how it is with acts," Angie said, "they have to have show names." 
</P>
<P>
 You'd be hard-pressed to miss Ben and Mikey's exhibit with the huge "World's 
Largest Horse" marquee above Ben's makeshift aluminum stable. For now, there's 
a question mark after it, because the Guinness Book of Records lists a British 
shire gelding named "Boringdon Black King" as the tallest living horse. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beimborn has visited Black King, and he says he's big, but not in Ben's 
league. He has contacted the powers that be at Guinness, been told what he 
needs to do to get Ben in the book and vows to see it through. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fair, Michael rises each morning at 7 to feed Ben and Mikey, who, 
hopefully, have had a good night's sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 If they haven't -- especially in the case of Mikey -- they tend to "lie down 
on the job" during the day. "People don't like that because they can't see how 
big they are," Angie said. "If they do get tired though, we just tell people 
they can come back later and see them for free if they want." 
</P>
<P>
 Most days there's a steady stream of people, especially in the afternoons and 
evenings. The reviews are usually rave: 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy Cow!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, my God!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Even Paul Bunyan didn't have one that big!" 
</P>
<P>
 The more skeptical loiter outside, scanning the faces of people leaving for 
clues as to whether a view of Ben and Mikey is worth a full buck (or 50 cents 
apiece). 
</P>
<P>
 One boy to another: "Is it big?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is it cool?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, let's go." 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight, Ben and Mikey are given a nightly constitution through the 
grounds. Why then? "So we don't get asked a million questions," Angie said.

IMMIGRANTS SEE AN EMPOWERED LIFE AS CITIZENS; NATURALIZATION: GREEN-CARD 
RESIDENTS, SOME HERE FOR DECADES, ARE NOW TAKING STEPS TO FULLY JOIN THE 
MAINSTREAM. FEARFUL OF THE FUTURE, THEY SEEK ACCEPTANCE AND INFLUENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Twenty-four years ago, Cecilia Maciel left her 13 brothers and sisters in the 
tiny rancho of San Jose de Gracia in Michoacan and came to Orange County to 
escape a poverty so stark she didn't own a pair of shoes until she was a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived hesitant, illiterate and full of hope, and by 1972 she was 
manufacturing plastic hoses on a Costa Mesa assembly line, a job she held for 
more than a decade. By 1976 her green card was tucked snugly in her wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after all these years, the 46-year-old Santa Ana resident has joined a 
growing number of the city's longtime immigrants who are applying for U.S. 
citizenship, eager to cement their status as hard-working citizens and 
contribute to political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do we lack, those of us who aren't citizens? Education," said Maciel, a 
community activist who works with a church-based organization. "I want to 
promote a program to explain to people why we should become citizens and 
explain it well: We are the ones with the power, not the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Appalled by the tenor of anti-immigrant sentiment and worried their rights 
will be whittled away, legal immigrants are signing up for citizenship classes 
in record numbers to take what they hope is the final step toward mainstream 
acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 They knock daily on the doors of Santa Ana's Delhi Community Center for 
immigration consultations. They approach their priests to inquire about the 
application process. Many pack night classes to study the Constitution and the 
Pilgrims, and they memorize a litany of U.S. government trivia in an effort to 
pass the written civics test that marks one hurdle of naturalization. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immigration and Naturalization Service has only just begun to break out 
separate statistics for Orange County, but officials say they have noted a 
dramatic rise in citizenship applications throughout the seven-county region of 
the Los Angeles district since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Local agencies offering the INS-approved citizenship test countywide say much 
of the recent interest has come from people in Orange County's Vietnamese and 
Latino communities. In the Santa Ana area, most are of Mexican descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizenship is becoming part of the daily banter among Latinos in my parish," 
said Msgr. Jaime Soto, Hispanic vicar for the Diocese of Orange. "I either have 
people asking me questions about it or telling me about how their test went." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Delhi Community Center Executive Director Irene Martinez: 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have been here for 20 or 30 years who have never considered it are 
suddenly showing up at our doors and saying, 'I want to become a citizen.' 
People are very conscious of the political climate and the comments being 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 To respond, Catholic Charities in Santa Ana is launching its first citizenship 
classes next week. And Rancho Santiago College is setting up the county's first 
community college-based citizenship center, which will offer full application 
services by September, complete with fingerprinting and photographing, said 
Kenny Gomez, who heads the newly formed center and is community outreach 
specialist for the college's continuing education division. 
</P>
<P>
 The Diocese of Orange held its first volunteer training session last week in 
conjunction with Catholic Charities to begin offering combined English and 
citizenship classes out of Orange County churches as soon as possible, Soto 
said. The parishes also plan to offer educational citizenship fairs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the wave of citizenship-seekers comes a new hope for a political presence 
in the Spanish-speaking community. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so much of the anti-immigrant sentiment going around the county, it's 
underlining the need for the immigrant communities to assert themselves in the 
political forum in much the same way that they are doing in the economic arena 
-- in a significant way," Soto said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This may not have a direct impact on the elections for November, but our hope 
is as a church to be able to awaken an appreciation for what the immigrant 
communities are doing and can do for the state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 Social services workers cite several reasons for the increased interest in 
citizenship. Those who received their green cards before 1978, like Maciel, 
must swap the cards for new ones in September at a cost of $75 and pay to renew 
them every 10 years. Rather than do that, immigration activists and even INS 
officials are encouraging them to pay just $20 more to complete a citizenship 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 And many of the immigrants who were legalized during the amnesty program of 
the late 1980s are just now becoming eligible for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to integrate ourselves more into this country," Ofelia Ibarra, 49, of 
Santa Ana said as she sat with her husband in a Rancho Santiago College 
citizenship class. "For me, it's very important to have rights, to have more 
freedom to work, and to learn more about this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Javier Ibarra, said the United States has offered him an 
opportunity to work as a shoemaker and raise five daughters since he and Ofelia 
arrived from Mexico in 1976. The couple became legal residents just five years 
ago under the amnesty program and wasted no time in seeking citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have received a lot from this country, and for that reason I love this 
country," said Javier Ibarra, 52.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the region's new applicants say they are propelled by a more insidious 
factor: the growing anti-immigrant climate sweeping the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country is supposed to be one of the most democratic in the world, but 
lately these politicians are all going back, back in time, like crabs," said 
Plutarco Cedeno, 50, of Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Cedeno came to the United States legally from Ecuador 30 years ago and said he 
never considered citizenship until the rhetoric against Latino immigrants 
became increasingly sour a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more and more discrimination," Cedeno said, as his citizenship class 
practiced filling out their citizenship applications and pronouncing words like 
"Plymouth" and "Mayflower." 
</P>
<P>
 Consuelo Chavez also never felt the urge to become a citizen before the daily 
gibes of the media turned to anti-immigrant legislation and the Save Our State 
initiative. That measure will appear on the November ballot and could deny 
health and education benefits to illegal immigrants and their children if it 
becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez has lived in the neatly kept Delhi neighborhood for 30 years, raised 
her family there and was granted legal residency more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried we will lose our Social Security benefits," she said. "For 
this, I want to fix my status, to become a citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are worried that non-citizens -- even though they are legally in the 
United States -- may lose their access to financial aid for college. And some 
are just incensed that after all their years here, they are increasingly being 
viewed with suspicious eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Recently a parishioner came to me very frustrated. He's been a permanent 
resident for many years. He went to go renew his driver's license and they gave 
him a temporary one because they wanted to do a background search to see if his 
green card was valid," Msgr. Soto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so frustrated that his integrity was called into question, his first 
question to me was: 'If I become a citizen, will they stop doing that to me?"' 
How Well Would You Do? 
</P>
<P>
 The written portion of the citizenship test covers civics and history. 
Applicants take classes to study 100 possible questions, 20 of which appear on 
the exam. Twelve out of 20 is a passing score. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who elects the President of the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Electoral College 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many changes or amendments are there to the Constitution? 
</P>
<P>
 A: 26 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the duties of the Supreme Court? 
</P>
<P>
 A: To interpret laws 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many representatives are there in Congress? 
</P>
<P>
 A: 435 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A: Thomas Jefferson 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Who was Martin Luther King Jr.? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A civil rights leader

 Applications for U.S. citizenship have increased dramatically at the Los 
Angeles district office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, which 
serves a seven-county region in Southern California. the INS began tracking 
Orange County separately last month, when the daily average was 51. The daily 
average number of applications from the seven-county region:

 The body of a young woman who apparently had been beaten to death was found 
Sunday near the city's water tower, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were searching for a man who was seen driving a cream-colored, 
four-door sedan and apparently dumping the woman's body at the water tower near 
the intersection of 23rd and Monroe streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman had no identification on her, and police have not been able to 
determine her name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're desperately trying to find out who she is," said Westminster Police 
Sgt. Dave Stronach. "We're checking her fingerprints." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses, who saw the man acting suspiciously after apparently lifting an 
object out his car, called police about 6:30 a.m., Stronach said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time officers arrived a few minutes later, the man had fled. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Phil Marshall stated in a police report on the incident that the victim 
was "killed with unknown type weapons" which caused "blunt force trauma." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who appears to be an Asian in her 20s, was wearing a white 
University of Pittsburgh shirt and blue denims. 
</P>
<P>
 Police described the suspect as male with a dark complexion, possibly Asian, 
about 5 feet, 6 inches tall, with a thin build and dark hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the crime is asked to call the Westminster 
Police Department at (714) 898-3315.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SHOOTING AT PARTY CLAIMS MAN'S LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One man was shot to death and another wounded when violence erupted at a party 
advertised by flyer, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that a party in the 1600 block of South Sycamore Street 
was disrupted when a fight broke out and two young men began shooting at each 
other about 3:50 p.m. Saturday, Santa Ana Police Cpl.Jeff Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Valenzuela, 19, of Santa Ana was shot once in the chest and was 
pronounced dead at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were later called to the 1400 block of South Main Street, about three 
blocks away, where a second fight had broken out, Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the same individuals involved in the fight on South Sycamore," 
Armstrong said. 
</P>
<P>
 No suspects were arrested at the Main Street address but police said they 
found a pistol believed to have been used in the gun battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police later learned that another man had sought medical attention at Coastal 
Community Hospital for a minor injury from a gunshot wound, Armstrong said. It 
was unclear whether the second man had been shot at the first party or the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said the shootings are being investigated as a gang-related 
incidents.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; FORMER COUNCILMAN WISNER TO RUN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former City Councilman Gene Wisner has announced that he plans to run for City 
Council this November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner, who was on the council from 1982-92, did not run for reelection in the 
last general election because he supported a limit of two consecutive terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having been out of politics for two years, I have been able to take a hard 
and honest look at both our community and its government," Wisner said in his 
announcement last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner's announcement cited concern for the city's financial position as one 
of several issues on which he is focusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of prudent fiscal management over the last decade, (Yorba Linda) has 
an adequate reserve, but that reserve is slowly being reduced," Wisner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will work with the council to strengthen that reserve by closely analyzing 
each and every project and program provided by the city to make sure that every 
dollar spent is of true benefit to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner has been living at his ranch in San Diego County since April, repairing 
damage to the property caused by last October's fires. 
</P>
<P>
 With the repairs complete, he plans to move back to the city by the end of the 
month.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; PLANNING PANEL OKS PROPOSAL FOR RINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A joint proposal by the city and the Walt Disney Co. to build a community ice 
rink in the downtown area glided through the Planning Commission last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission voted 6 to 0 to approve the project, which still requires 
approval from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council may decide upon the proposed ice rink, which would serve both as 
practice site for the Mighty Ducks hockey team and a community youth center, as 
early as next month, city officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100,000-square-foot facility would be built on three acres at the 
southwest corner of Lincoln Avenue and Clementine Street. 
</P>
<P>
 If the project receives council approval in August, the rink may open in 
September, 1995, Disney officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed facility would house two ice rinks, one Olympic size and the 
other National Hockey League size. The Olympic rink would seat 300 spectators, 
while the NHL rink would hold up to 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials said there would be about 12,800 hours of ice time available 
to the public each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks would use the rink only about 200 hours per year, Disney officials 
said at last week's commission hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks now practice at the Glacial Garden Ice Arena in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed rink also would be used by Disney's new nonprofit program called 
GOALS -- Growth Opportunities Through Athletics, Learning and Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Modeled after a highly touted New York program named Ice Hockey in Harlem, the 
charitable organization's aim is to teach underprivileged children positive 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed facility also would include a retail pro shop, meeting rooms, an 
amusement arcade and a restaurant. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; DISTRICT REWORKS KINDERGARTEN POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following protests from parents and teachers, the Anaheim City School District 
has modified a recent policy that had meant kindergarten teachers would 
supervise up to 65 children. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials last month had directed kindergarten classes be combined 
for as long as 22 minutes a day to cope with a booming student population and a 
limited 38-vehicle bus fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Kindergarten teachers and parents opposed the move, arguing it would cut into 
valuable instruction time and pose safety risks. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's board meeting, district officials announced eight schools that 
do not bus students could either eliminate or reduce their classroom overlap 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But seven other schools that rely on bus transportation will still have to use 
the overlap schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also said because of fire codes, some classes could not be 
combined since the rooms can accommodate only 45 students safely. Each school 
will decide how best to comply with the safety codes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Meliton Lopez said the overlap time situation is "not ideal" but 
preferable to other more drastic options to resolving the problem. For example, 
the district cannot afford to purchase more buses, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 And if school schedules were changed, the result would be either children 
waiting for a bus in morning darkness or the elimination of field trips, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and teachers, however, say they will continue to oppose any 
kindergarten overlap time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a Band-Aid solution to the problem," said Connie Boydstun, who 
has a child in kindergarten. "Why don't we look at the real problem and fix 
it?"MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY, COUNTY, MWD SUED OVER '92 SLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim Hills homeowners association has sued the city, Orange County and 
the Metropolitan Water District over damage caused by a 25-acre landslide in 
January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed last week in Orange County Superior Court on behalf of the 
Window Hill Homeowners' Assn., alleges that the city and county were negligent 
in permitting the housing development despite knowledge that the area is 
susceptible to landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, water officials were negligent in installing a defective pipeline in 
the unstable hillside, the suit contends. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' association contends that the slide damaged common property 
and property values. The suit seeks unspecified damages. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related case filed in January, about 250 residents sued the same agencies 
for $300 million. That suit is still being litigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the city, county and water agency have denied any wrongdoing in 
connection with the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said they first learned about the landslide in June, 1992, 
when residents reported buckling in their street. 
</P>
<P>
 Between July, 1992, and Jan. 17, the hillside moved one inch. But after heavy 
rains in January, the slide accelerated dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The landslide forced the evacuation of some 45 houses in the Anaheim Hills. 
Within several months, almost all of those were reoccupied, but three were 
condemned.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; HEARING TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABLE HOUSING

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission will have a public hearing at 7 tonight to discuss an 
affordable housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The voluntary plan, which eventually will be part of the development review 
process, relies on incentives for builders to include affordable housing in 
their projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan's goal is to make 20% of new housing affordable for low- to 
moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentives available to developers include the ability to build more homes 
than otherwise would be allowed and the right to use modular homes. 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WINNER SHARES HIS RECIPE FOR VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ground underneath Lou Delmonico's Anaheim Hills home is still shifting a 
year after a rain-induced landslide caused major damage to the house and other 
homes in the Avenida de Santiago neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 He wakes up mornings to find new cracks in the walls, and all he can do is 
take a paintbrush and cover them. It's so depressing, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But around the stately Tudor house with a spectacular kitchen view of the San 
Bernardino Mountains and Mt. Baldy, the apple, plum, apricot, orange and 
nectarine trees are again laden with fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomatoes are ripening on the vine. Pepper, squash, cantaloupe, lima beans, 
carrots, basil and an assortment of herbs grow on the patio and among the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 This garden bounty has helped keep his frustrations in check, Delmonico says. 
And from this crop, he has concocted jellies, jams, marmalades and chutneys 
that so impressed judges at the Orange County Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in the fair's 100-year history, a man has won the 
sweepstakes in the amateur preserved-foods competition. Delmonico, 53, chief 
executive officer of a Costa Mesa-based computer company, broke the tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 He won 12 blue ribbons and topped five divisions, submitting the best entries 
in jams, potpourri, fruits and fruit juices, fruits and vegetables, and 
vegetable juices. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his 43 entries, 31 won him ribbons, earning 89 points to win the 
sweepstakes. Paula Anderson of Lake Forest was second with 52 points and Dawn 
Dunn of Laguna Niguel was third with 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's any secret at all, it's that I grow most of the stuff I use," said 
Delmonico, adding that some of his happiest moments are spent in the kitchen, 
concocting culinary treats for his friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it's not odd that a business executive like him could be good at 
making jellies and jam, an activity traditionally considered a woman's 
preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like food, and I love to cook," said Delmonico. "Food and cooking is a 
social activity. I've made a lot of friends as a result of my trees, my jams 
and my jellies." 
</P>
<P>
 A native New Yorker, Delmonico started planting trees 10 years ago. Now, he 
has more than 100 fruit trees, including peach, plum and avocado. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever he needs a fruit or vegetable, he just steps outside his kitchen. But 
he's picky. He says he uses only the best. When he has to buy, he doesn't mind 
traveling to get what he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Delmonico went to Little Saigon in Westminster to buy live blue crabs for his 
entry in the potpourri division. Using a recipe he learned from his 
grandmother, Delmonico entered a dish of cracked crab leg in spicy tomato sauce 
and won the division. 
</P>
<P>
 Taste and appearance are the keys to a winning entry, he says. The taste may 
be heavenly, but if presented poorly it has no chance, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want every element of the process perfect," Delmonico says. "How you 
prepare the fruit, the size of the slices, the size and shape of the jar, how 
the fruit will look inside the jar . . . everything is considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Delmonico says he plans to enter the Los Angeles Fair in September, just for 
fun. "It's a wholesome activity," he says. And it takes his mind off the cracks 
in the walls.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; COUNCIL STUDYING SHOOTING RANGE LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council tonight is expected to consider a new lease agreement with 
the Huntington Beach Police Officers Assn. to allow the group to continue 
operating the shooting range at Central Park and make improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Officer Richard Wright, president of the association, said the facility 
is in need of upgrades to ensure safety for public use and to provide a more 
modernized training facility for police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said the association has operated the shooting range for more than 20 
years. It is used by local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, as well 
as by the military, private shooting clubs and police academies and colleges. 
The shooting range is off Gothard Street, between Talbert and Ellis avenues, 
next to the Central Library. 
</P>
<P>
 The public portion of the shooting range was closed in May because of safety 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the association has had a yearly lease agreement with the 
city. But Wright said that without a long-term agreement, the association did 
not want to spend the estimated $4 million to make the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider entering into a 20-year lease with the association. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agreement is approved, improvements will include redesigning the 
existing facility for public and law enforcement uses, building classrooms, 
sound walls, state-of-the-art shooting lines and sound-baffling systems, Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans also include reopening the shooting range to the public by early next 
year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MAN REPAIRING RIDE ELECTROCUTED AT FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Alamitos man was electrocuted while repairing an amusement ride at the 
Orange County Fair, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Vogt, 45, was fatally injured about 11:20 p.m. Saturday when his forehead 
touched an exposed wire as he worked on the Gravitron ride, fair officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was underneath the ride to fix a lighting wire," said Jill Lloyd, a 
spokeswoman for the Orange County Fair. "When his forehead touched another 
wire, he became rigid." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogt was taken to Hoag Memorial Hospital Presbyterian in Newport Beach after 
the accident and was pronounced dead about 40 minutes later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said Vogt was a carnival ride operator who worked for B&B Amusement 
based in Fountain Valley. Officials from B&B Amusement could not be reached for 
comment Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lloyd said Vogt "took it upon himself to try and fix the lights." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Occupational Safety and Health Administration has started an 
investigation into the incident. An inspector examined the ride early Sunday 
morning, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to find out what kind of condition the ride is in and whether or not 
there are violations of state health and safety laws," said Jim Brown, the 
regional director of Cal-OSHA's Anaheim office. "We have nothing to release at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Another safety inspector from the state department of industrial relations 
determined that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the ride, Lloyd said. 
The problem was with the lighting system, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gravitron, which spins riders around in a circle, was shut down after the 
incident and reopened late Sunday when the lighting problem was fixed, Lloyd 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Michael, 23 of Boron, who was operating the ride at the time of the 
accident, said he saw Vogt's body become rigid after his forehead touched the 
live wire. Michael dragged Vogt out from underneath the ride and called for 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 No other people at the fair witnessed the incident, Lloyd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, this occurred out of view of the crowd," Lloyd said. "The ride was 
in between loads and just two people were waiting to go on the ride." MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; COMMUNITY SERVICES BUDGET TO BE 
REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will consider ways to trim $140,000 from its Community 
Services Department budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed cuts are expected to be made through a combination of program and 
personnel reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday will review options on where to cut and where the city 
might raise fees for things such as renting ball fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the areas slated for potential cuts are recreation services, 
after-school programs and city support for special events. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, recommended reductions for those three areas total about $65,000, 
said Al King, the city's community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 King said layoffs are possible. He said the department has 25 employees, eight 
of whom are full time. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager George Scarborough said he hopes to avoid layoffs and meet the 
department's goal by trimming some employees' hours in the Community Services 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the council approved the department's $1.48-million budget 
request when passing a $10.2-million general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the council asked that the department reduce its budget by $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough said the city plans to do so with about $100,000 in service cuts 
and $40,000 in personnel costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Scarborough said the city must carve another $60,000 in personnel 
costs from elsewhere in its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Collene Campbell said it is hard to reduce programs that serve children, 
senior citizens or high-risk youth, but she added that the city has few 
alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tremendously difficult to trim the budget for any service to the 
community," Campbell said. "It's painful, but we're not through yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Scarborough said he hoped that private nonprofit organizations will be able to 
help fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to take final action in 30 to 45 days. JEFF BEAN

BODY DISCOVERED; SEARCH CONTINUES AT SITE; CRIME: AUTHORITIES BELIEVE 
EX-NORTHRIDGE RESIDENT DENISE HUBER MAY BE ONE OF MANY VICTIMS AT ARIZONA HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities were digging for more possible victims Sunday at the country-club 
home of a house painter charged with murdering a former Northridge woman whose 
frozen body was found in a rented truck here, three years after she vanished 
alongside an Orange County freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the search of 37-year-old John Joseph Famalaro's hilltop 
property in this affluent town was continuing partly because of evidence 
suggesting the work of a "serial killer." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith said the discovery of Denise A. Huber's 
checkbook, purse, identification cards and near-flawlessly preserved corpse is 
consistent with people who keep personal mementos or bodies as "trophies of 
their killings." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body was found Wednesday in the stolen truck, inside a freezer chest, 
naked and wrapped in layers of plastic trash bags. The freezer was plugged into 
an extension cord that ran from the Ryder rental truck to Famalaro's house. 
</P>
<P>
 A special canine unit from Utah discovered "two points of interest" inside the 
house late Sunday, said Yavapai County Sheriff's Lt. Kathleen McLaughlin. The 
two cadaver-sniffing dogs began pawing at two places downstairs, prompting 
authorities to consider an excavation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could probably start digging (there) tomorrow," McLaughlin said Sunday. 
"You never know what might be there." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials are also concerned about a partial excavation they 
found in a lower cellar area in the Famalaros' split-level home, where 
authorities, some in surgical masks, were digging Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an autopsy found that Huber, who was 23 when she disappeared in 
June, 1991, died from blunt force trauma to the head, according to the Maricopa 
County Medical Examiner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber appeared to have suffered at least a half-dozen blows to the head from 
an object with "sharpened" edges, police said. No murder weapon had been 
recovered Sunday night. Smith said it could not be immediately determined 
whether Huber had been sexually assaulted. But the body was so well preserved, 
Smith said, that authorities had little trouble lifting fingerprints to make a 
positive identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the corpse was frozen, Yavapai County Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie 
Berra said, experts are having a difficult time determining exactly when Huber 
died. It is possible they may never know, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro was being held on $250,000 bond on suspicion of murder and felony 
theft related to the stolen Ryder rental truck. The case has been referred to 
the Yavapai County grand jury for investigation, and a preliminary hearing has 
been tentatively set for Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grim discovery last week marked the end of Orange County's most baffling 
missing persons case, which began three years ago when Huber disappeared after 
attending a rock concert at the Forum in Inglewood. Her blue 1988 Honda Accord 
was found the next morning on a shoulder of the Corona del Mar Freeway in Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's parents, who spearheaded a massive, enduring search effort, appeared 
shaken Sunday. The family recently announced their intention to leave the state 
where they had raised their daughter to move to North Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad we finally have an answer," Ione Huber said at the family's 
Newport Beach home. "We were praying for an answer for a very long time. But 
this is not the kind of answer we were praying for." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers said they had never heard of Famalaro until this week, and have no 
plans to travel to Arizona. Rather, the family has found some comfort in 
reports from authorities, who believe that the victim died quickly after her 
abduction June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sign of torture and she did not appear to be malnourished," Smith 
said. "That would mean to me that she died very soon after she was picked up." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Hubers were finally free to grieve for their long-lost daughter, 
another family -- the Famalaros -- was in the Yavapai County jail waiting room 
wrapped in a different kind of grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hearts are breaking over this," said Anne Famalaro, the suspect's mother. 
"We are the kind of people who keep to ourselves. We're conservative Christian 
people. I believe in Jesus, and he will pull us through this." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, who lives next door to her son in a fashionable golf course 
community and reportedly owns the split-level house now surrounded by crime 
scene tape, described her son simply as "wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, you must understand," she said at the jail. "I shouldn't say anything 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Sgt. Jerry Holloway said John Famalaro had not been a 
suspect in the case. Nor was there was there any indication that Huber knew 
Famalaro, a house painter who left Orange County to care for his aging father 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no sign of a struggle at Huber's car, and police were never able to 
determine exactly what happened at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber grew up in Northridge, where her family moved in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hubers were active in the Presbyterian church, first in North Hills, then 
in Calabasas, establishing a large network of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Claudia Moreland, a close family friend who was Denise Huber's teacher at 
Valley Presbyterian School in North Hills, said ever since Huber's 
disappearance in 1991, people have asked her for updates on her case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley Christian community is a very tight community," said Moreland. 
"Probably every church in the Valley had her on its prayer chain. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was an excellent student. She had a vivacious and adorable personality," 
she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Ludden, 27, who described herself as Huber's best friend, attended Los 
Angeles Baptist High School in North Hills with her, where they played on the 
basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludden said she and Huber attended Duran Duran and Spandau Ballet concerts and 
professional hockey games. After graduating in 1985, they took a monthlong trip 
to England. They were planning to go again after Ludden's graduation from Cal 
State Northridge next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were like sisters," Ludden said. "Denise was really popular and outgoing 
and fun-loving. Everybody loved her." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's parents moved to Texas before her senior year in high school when her 
father, a mortgage banker, was transferred. She decided to stay in the Valley 
so she wouldn't miss her final year of high school, staying with the Morelands. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing high school, she joined her parents in Texas and later 
attended a Georgia Bible college for about a year and a half. She later 
transferred to the UC Irvine after her parents moved to Newport Beach in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 For Costa Mesa's Lt. Smith, the dark details of Huber's disappearance have 
been compelling -- his life's work over the past three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The end here ranks as kind of weird any way you put it," he said. "This was 
the biggest case of my career. I lived this case. I became close to the family. 
I'm glad she has been found but I'm not happy about the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every anniversary of her disappearance has been emotional for me. You think 
of what you could have done differently. But I don't think we could have done 
anything more."

CITY LEADERS USE CAUTION IN NAMING QUAKE RECOVERY EFFORTS; GOVERNMENT: 
OFFICIALS HESITATE TO REFER TO PLANS AS REDEVELOPMENT PROJECTS BECAUSE OF 
FEELINGS ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN, BUREAUCRATIC COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During a recent meeting of a quake recovery panel, Los Angeles Councilman Hal 
Bernson was quick to correct a housing official who dared to use the term 
redevelopment area to describe a proposal to help quake victims get back on 
their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's call them recovery areas, please," Bernson said, referring to the 
proposed districts where property taxes would pay for quake improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the post-quake proposal is drawn directly from the pages of the 
state's redevelopment laws, city officials are hesitant to refer to them as 
redevelopment projects. And with good reason: For years, redevelopment projects 
have been the bogyman among governmental programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hollywood, Hollywood and Downtown Los Angeles, redevelopment has 
incited lawsuits, criticism, scuffling matches at redevelopment advisory panel 
meetings and even death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no wonder city lawmakers are moving ahead with caution on the latest 
incarnation of this financing mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes the hard-hit Sherman Oaks 
area, has not thrown his full support behind the idea. But he held a community 
meeting last month to gauge his constituents' response -- and that response was 
mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take the temperature of the public to see how they react," 
Yaroslavsky said prior to the meeting. "We are not going to ram this down 
anybody's throat." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky's district is one of nine in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood 
and central Los Angeles being considered by the Community Redevelopment Agency. 
The project areas would officially be known by the politically unsavory title 
of "emergency redevelopment areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment areas are a tool state lawmakers provided more than 40 years ago 
to help eliminate blight by giving local government -- through its 
redevelopment agencies -- the power to buy land, build roads and sewers and 
make other improvements that may attract private development. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund these improvements, the state allows redevelopment agencies to keep 
all the property taxes generated by new development, a method known as 
tax-increment financing. Normally, property taxes are split among the county, 
local school districts and the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Under disaster provisions of the state's redevelopment law, cities can also 
establish redevelopment areas in communities hit hard by disasters, without the 
time-consuming environmental studies required for traditional redevelopment 
projects. But to do so, the project areas must be established relatively soon 
after the disaster -- in this case by October or November. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest bugaboo of the redevelopment process has been the powers of 
eminent domain it bestows on the CRA, allowing it to condemn private land 
within project areas to make way for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent council panel discussion about the quake redevelopment areas raised 
the ire of longtime CRA critic Howard Watts, who attended the meeting wearing 
his trademark white T-shirt with big bold letters spelling out: "CRA GO AWAY." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you recover, you don't recover by taking away everybody's homes and 
businesses," he told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But CRA officials and council members have emphasized that under the special 
disaster provisions, powers of eminent domain are limited to abandoned 
properties and so-called nuisance properties that the owner cannot or will not 
rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not be a (traditional) redevelopment area," Bernson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possible target of criticism in the emergency redevelopment projects 
is the CRA's ability to use redevelopment dollars on non-disaster related 
improvements, such as new streets and sewers that do not replace those damaged 
by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 William Carlson, executive director of the nonprofit California Redevelopment 
Assn., said a bill to more closely tie the use of redevelopment money to 
disaster recovery is moving through the state Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, whose Hollywood-based district lost almost 5,000 
residential units in the quake, has not decided whether she will back the 
quake-recovery area idea but "we are definitely taking the public's temperature 
to see how people think a redevelopment area can help," said Sharon Delugach, 
Goldberg's chief deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on her firsthand experience with the delays and lawsuits of the 
Hollywood redevelopment project -- among the largest in the country -- Delugach 
said Goldberg is keenly aware of the potential for controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 A $750-million redevelopment project in Downtown Los Angeles also has had its 
share of strife. That project has been bogged down by a lawsuit filed last year 
by former Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who claims a closed-door meeting to 
discuss its expansion violated the state's open meeting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of how nasty the politics of redevelopment can get are easily found 
in the recent history of the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the CRA's offices in North Hollywood were temporarily closed because 
the project's manager received numerous death threats, culminating in the 
arrival of a hearse. New security measures were installed when the office 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings of a citizens' advisory panel for the North Hollywood project have 
been interrupted by walkouts, shouting matches and scuffles between 
redevelopment critics and boosters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mildred Weller, a longtime CRA critic and vice chair of the advisory panel, 
said that having lost her Sherman Oaks apartment in the quake, she understands 
the need for efforts to help quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said establishing emergency redevelopment areas is "the most appalling 
idea I've ever heard in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 She claims the CRA's bureaucracy makes the cost of improvements three times as 
high as the cost of improvements done by private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city wants to avoid controversy, Weller said it should forget about new 
redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "A redevelopment area is the worst possible way of solving the problem," she 
said.

SUSPECT LEADS DETECTIVES TO BURIED REMAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 After a murder suspect showed them where to search along a road in the Angeles 
National Forest, authorities on Sunday unearthed what they believe are the 
remains of a 73-year-old man missing for 17 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were led to the makeshift grave by Michael Benanti, 35, a 
Palmdale landscaper arrested last week in the murder of James Young. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours of questioning, Benanti led homicide detectives to mile 
marker 6.79 on Lake Hughes Road in the national forest, and pointed out the 
spot where he said he buried Young, authorities said. The eccentric Quartz Hill 
resident had been missing since he left for a Las Vegas vacation in February, 
1993, said Sheriff's Detective Mike Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided there was too much on his conscience and he told us Mr. Young was 
dead and he buried him and he would take us to where he was," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives, accompanied by a Los Angeles County coroner's 
investigator and a forensic anthropologist, excavated the grave site and 
discovered the human remains about 11 Sunday morning, said Sheriff's Deputy 
Gabe Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's autopsy is expected to be conducted later in the week to determine 
the cause of death, Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti lived in Young's Quartz Hill home for almost one year after the 
disappearance of the elderly man, who neighbors say was cantankerous and 
extremely protective of his possessions, which filled the back yard of his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said there were motorcycles, a classic Porsche automobile and other 
valuable items which began to disappear after Benanti moved into the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Young met Benanti, who was paroled in 1986 from state prison on a rape 
conviction, when the younger man began working for a landscaping company at 
Young's expensive home. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a short period of time, neighbors say, Benanti had become a fixture in 
the yard, regularly mowing the lawn and maintaining plants for Young, who was 
unable to perform heavy labor since suffering stroke in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had no close relatives, and only one sibling, a sister with whom he had 
not been in contact for 30 years, he told neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 When he moved in, Benanti told neighbors that Young had met a Mexican woman in 
Las Vegas, fallen in love, moved to Mexico and left him to tend to his business 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities and neighbors were suspicious of Benanti's story, and after 
waiting for almost a year, neighbors frustrated with the lack of progress 
signed a petition last December calling for the Sheriff's Department to solve 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said he and his partner, Detective Tom Harris, spent six months working 
only on Young's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and neighbors also expressed relief upon the discovery of the body 
because they had heard nothing for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was much doubt in people's minds that he was dead," said 
Pat Weese, a Quartz Hill contractor who worked at Young's home. "I always 
thought they'd find him somewhere between here and Las Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators served search warrants Thursday at homes of Benanti's friends 
and relatives in Canyon Country, Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Palmdale and 
Northridge and found jewelry, collectible coins and other personal items that 
belonged to Young, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also identified forged checks on Young's account for thousands 
of dollars and recovered several vehicles belonging to the victim, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Benanti, who was arrested early Thursday at a mobile home park in Palmdale, 
will be arraigned today on murder charges in Antelope Valley Municipal Court, 
Ramirez said.

STREET SMART: TRAFFIC NERVE CENTER'S TECHNOLOGY NOT QUITE IN FAST LANE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over just a few minutes, it happens -- just as it happens five mornings a 
week, 52 weeks a year. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:45 a.m. the tiny lights embedded in the giant road map on the wall 
flicker green, then many change to yellow, then many more to red. In muted 
colors, the television monitors on the wall show a steady stream of cars moving 
mostly fast, then mostly slow, then not at all through Downtown's four-level 
interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Quietly and quickly, the morning rush hour has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 And while traffic on the Santa Monica Freeway crawls a few miles away, the 
workday is just starting to speed up inside the Caltrans traffic operations 
facility -- the electronic nerve center for Los Angeles County's 527 miles of 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 It is here in a windowless room in a drab 1960s office building in downtown 
Los Angeles that the Big Brothers of the Open Road scan the freeways 
electronically for problems -- stalled cars, wayward ladders or other road 
problems -- and try to solve them as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 What the cadre of traffic engineers and dispatchers can do now is fairly 
limited. They can dispatch crews or California Highway Patrol officers to scoop 
up debris or help clear accidents. They can flash messages on the lovable 
Freeway Condition signs, warn the media of nasty tie-ups and, in extreme 
situations, change the sequence of on-ramp meter lights. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this helps move traffic along, but it is not exactly an Orwellian 
Ministry of Traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Caltrans folks say, they will be able to solve many of the 
freeways' everyday problems without ever leaving the room. In time, new 
computers and new equipment will allow them to coordinate signals on city 
streets with freeway traffic and thus manipulate real cars just like toys with 
a few double-clicks of a computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, though, workers like Alex Reyman watch and wait and do what they can. 
</P>
<P>
 From his desk, Reyman can watch images transmitted via microwave by 18 video 
cameras installed along the freeways. Intended to show the current condition of 
certain freeway stretches, the cameras can be rotated or zoomed in to get a 
clearer picture of a problem area. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyman said the images are not clear enough to catch unwitting motorists in 
subtle but embarrassing situations, such as being face-first in a cheese Danish 
or knuckle-deep in a nose scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 They are clear enough to catch more obvious events. "We see people bump into 
each other all the time, fender-benders," said Reyman. "Sometimes we see people 
running across the freeway." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a box of sombreros fell off a truck and was hit by a car as traffic 
engineers watched on their monitor. The engineers thought they had a situation 
on their hands until, as they watched, every last sombrero rolled unaided off 
the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem solved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger problems are not so easy. Traffic congestion has grown faster than 
traffic technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, motorists drove about 81 million miles a day on the freeways and 
highways of Los Angeles and Ventura counties. Eight of the 10 busiest freeway 
interchanges in the country are in Los Angeles. And the busiest -- the East Los 
Angeles interchange -- cycles through 570,000 vehicles a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Accommodating all this traffic is a freeway system that was designed in the 
1950s and built during the 1960s and 1970s. The traffic operations center was 
built in 1971 to make the most efficient use of the freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 A giant map on the wall of the operations center displays Southern 
California's freeways illuminated by hundreds of tiny lights. The map's lights 
are connected to a computer, which in turn is fed by hundreds of sensors 
embedded every half-mile or so in the freeway -- one for every light on the 
map. 
</P>
<P>
 As congestion around a sensor increases, the lights change from green, which 
indicates free-flowing traffic; to yellow, which indicates some slowing, to 
red, which indicates traffic as usual. In other words, practically stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right around 8 a.m., most of it goes red," Reyman said, his spotless desk 
occupied only by a half-filled Styrofoam coffee cup and a logbook filled with 
careful entries. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was dedicated by then-Gov. Ronald Reagan, the giant map was state of 
the art, a twinkling testament to the region's passion for making the freeways 
free-moving arteries of freedom and opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 More advanced computers now sit on desktops in the center, churning out more 
detailed data and giving engineers a clearer picture of what the road ahead 
holds for commuters. 
</P>
<P>
 The map is mostly for show now -- a funky prop that looks good when the 
occasional television news crew comes by to film, as they frequently did in the 
first hectic weeks following the Northridge Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 During catastrophic situations, the operations center becomes a virtual war 
room, coordinating the movements of an army of workers and engineers, as well 
as laying out quick plans to bypass broken freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up and running right after the earthquake," said Joseph Brahm, the 
center's senior transportation engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But on a routine day the center runs along quietly. Radios carrying the 
conversations of CHP officers and Caltrans crews and tow truck drivers drone in 
the background. Computer cooling fans hum quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, new equipment such as the video cameras have come on line. The 
Freeway Service Patrol tow truck fleet is monitored in one corner of the room 
by Julie Jefferson, a no-nonsense woman who keeps tabs on her 144 drivers via a 
computer screen. Computers also relay information from CHP officers in the 
field. And they update a cable television program that displays current road 
conditions -- presumably for those with TVs at the wheel -- called "Freeway 
Vision." 
</P>
<P>
 But all of this seems almost antique when compared to the complexity of a new 
program being installed as part of a pilot project along the Santa Monica 
Freeway. The $50-million Smart Corridor program will allow engineers downtown 
to manipulate road conditions and to relay information to drivers to reduce 
congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of your life in Los Angeles is spent in your car that any little 
change, even a minute, can get really annoying," said Caltrans spokesman Russ 
Snyder. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the future, Big Brother will not only be watching. If the engineers can 
pull it off, he may also help out. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 My question has to do with car-pool lanes. If you have four people in a 
vehicle and you are towing, say, a boat, are you allowed to drive in the 
car-pool lane? 
</P>
<P>
 Don Zshernig, Newbury Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer to your short question is no, you may not. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol Officer Pablo Torres said if you are towing anything 
-- whether a boat or a camping trailer or another car -- you are restricted to 
the two right lanes of a five-lane freeway and the far-right lane of a 
three-lane freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Since car-pool lanes generally run along the center divider, it would be 
illegal for a towing vehicle to merge left across other lanes to get there, 
regardless of how many people it is carrying. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres said that in cases where on-ramps dump cars into the left lanes of a 
freeway, the driver of a towing vehicle should quickly -- but safely -- merge 
right into the proper lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, at the intersection of Reseda Boulevard and 
Rinaldi Street, signals were re-timed so that traffic going east and west on 
Rinaldi had a longer interval between red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 118 Freeway has opened up, they haven't readjusted the lights. 
Traffic coming out of Porter Ranch has to wait two to three light cycles to get 
through the Reseda-Rinaldi intersection because the light is so short for 
southbound cars on Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 I was wondering if the city Department of Transportation would check into this 
to see why the signals haven't been readjusted since the freeway reopening. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Shapiro, Northridge 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 You're absolutely right that the signals were adjusted after the quake to 
favor traffic on Rinaldi, which became a key detour for erstwhile freeway 
users. City traffic engineer Brian Gallagher says that not only was more time 
given to Rinaldi motorists between lights, but northbound Reseda drivers who 
wanted to turn west (left) onto Rinaldi also were given extra time for their 
green light, because so many motorists wanted to use Rinaldi as a bypass. 
</P>
<P>
 Southbound Reseda drivers were the sacrificial lambs. "All the time was taken 
away from them," Gallagher says. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's about to change. According to Gallagher, this week engineers are 
expected to readjust the signal at that intersection, restoring a longer cycle 
for southbound Reseda motorists.

D.C. HEAT; CALIFORNIANS SWEAT IT OUT IN THE SUMMER HUMIDITY OF THE NATION'S 
CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's during the summer that Los Angeles native Amadie Hutner longs most for 
the cool breezes of the Pacific Coast, those oppressive months of July and 
August when the heat and humidity turn the nation's capital into a sauna with 
scenic monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 She feels it even on her morning walks to the subway, when the new-day heat 
wrings out its moisture like a wet sponge -- the sweat beading on her brow, 
trickling down her stomach and legs, stinging her eyes, ruining her clothes, 
driving her to think of cooler things, like squinting surfers catching a wave 
off Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere but here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summer's heat is a disgusting fact of life in Washington," said Hutner, a 
24-year-old legislative aide to Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills). 
"You try to beat it. You use super-absorbent deodorant. You carry around little 
towels to mop the sweat. You hold your clothes away from your body to create a 
breeze. But the humidity, it always wins." 
</P>
<P>
 One wise-cracking legislative intern from California recently set out to prove 
just how hot a Washington summer can get: He tried to fry eggs on the sidewalk 
outside the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 "He insists they fried," said Rob Stone, a Pacific Palisades resident and 
Washington intern for Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles). "But nobody else 
was there to verify it. It was too hot to go outside." 
</P>
<P>
 For Californians spending the summer in the District of Columbia -- whether 
working on Capitol Hill, doing personal business or playing tourist -- talk 
inevitably turns to the steamy force of nature locals have strangely come to 
accept without question: The crazy heat and overbearing humidity that can tap a 
quart of sweat an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout inland Southern California -- including the San Fernando Valley -- 
summer temperatures soar. But here in Washington, the added element of brutally 
high humidity can be devastating, especially in this pedestrian-laden city. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a heat that makes you want to sit on the back veranda and sip mint 
juleps. Or invade a small nation. The humidity makes you immediately hot under 
your tie-festooned collar as you leave the cool marble and air-conditioned 
confines of the Library of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hottest days, when temperatures top 100 degrees, the weather plants its 
uninvited wet kiss -- making you feel sorry for pregnant women and people on 
crutches, for the homeless spread out like puddles of sweat in city parks. You 
pity those poor courier devils darting through city traffic, their bicycle 
tires sticking to a sea of hot street tar-turned-black-glue by the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soupy is the word I use for the heat," said Jonathan Blaes, a meteorologist 
for the National Weather Service. "The air is so full of moisture and junk, 
it's like walking in an atmosphere of soup. It's hot as hell here. Literally." 
</P>
<P>
 A local newspaper once listed 32 ways to ignore the heat, including: No. 2 -- 
Hole up in a catacomb. No. 21 -- Steal some kid's inflatable pool. No. 32 -- 
Walk like a penguin. And No. 28 -- Hypnotize yourself with a snowstorm 
paperweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, summer reminds you that Washington is indeed a Southern city, one that 
assumes a tropical character come July. It's Bombay without the monsoons, a 
place where even jungle animals at the local zoo, used to unbearable humidity, 
demand a cool midday respite. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day the scene is repeated: Grandmothers from Illinois or Iowa pass out on 
some sidewalk from the heat, their grandsons fanning them like ringside boxing 
managers. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's only on the hottest days that the subway escalators break down, 
forcing the grumbling crowds to walk stairways 10 stories tall. "I know it's 
hot," one Reseda mother scolded her young son, yanking him along by the hand. 
"And complaining isn't going to make it any cooler. So just shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the heat of the night, mosquitoes work the crowds milling about the 
Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, making them swing and curse at 
the dive-bombing insects. And unlike California, darkness brings no relief from 
the day's inferno. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a Washington decidedly at odds with its postcard image. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the humidity is 100% and it's not raining, you know you're in trouble," 
said Jean Smith, a Washington native and chief of staff for Rep. Howard L. 
Berman (D-Panorama City). 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Washington wags say, the temperature is always 10 
degrees hotter when Congress is in session "with all that hot hair blowing down 
from Capitol Hill." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the Washington heat has changed the course of history. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summers before air conditioning, Congress and anyone else with 
means would flee muggy Washington, a city built mostly on marshy, low-lying 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government shut down during the summer because of the humidity," said Don 
Kennon, chief historian at the Capitol Historical Society. "The reason that 
Congress takes its annual recess during August is a holdover from those times." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern times have not eased the heat's effects on politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, former Egyptian President Anwar el-Sadat felt the discomfort. 
"Because of the oppressive heat and humidity of Washington in the summer, I 
found myself longing for the cool breezes of our own Alexandria," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may sound strange coming from an Egyptian, used to heat, but the climate 
in Washington during August is really unbearable. Some people who saw me on 
television may have noticed that I had to change my suit before I left the 
White House because I was sweating so profusely." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the heat, British foreign diplomats once considered Washington a 
secondary post to Bombay, and until recently the government offered hardship 
pay for diplomats working here. 
</P>
<P>
 British embassy press secretary Peter Bean likens Washington to Thailand, 
where he spent four years: "In Thailand, I always walked very slowly and looked 
for the shade. I find myself doing the exact same thing in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other congressmen, Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) knows 
how to beat the summer heat: He doesn't go outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a tunnel under the Capitol we use to get around," he said. "One 
freshman Congresswoman recently said the heat had literally driven her 
underground. She used the tunnel so much she didn't get any fresh air for a 
week." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Pollock, 23, a San Diego native and legislative aide to Rep. Carlos J. 
Moorhead (R-Glendale), never thought she'd be so happy with a 9-to-5 job that 
keeps her indoors all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The summer months are constantly sticky," she said. "By the time you get to 
work, your makeup has melted off and you don't even feel like you took a 
shower. So you say, 'Why bother?' You just go around feeling disgusting." 
</P>
<P>
 David Jorgenson, Moorhead's chief of staff, thought he was trading L.A. smog 
for Washington heat when he came here in 1979. Instead, he got both -- arriving 
to find a brown haze over the Capitol, a humidity that made it impossible to 
dry off after a morning shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped going to church because of the heat," he said. "I just couldn't 
bear the idea of being in a suit on a muggy Sunday morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Cochran, chief of staff for McKeon, followed his boss to Washington two 
years ago -- then faced the daunting task of moving his reluctant wife from 
Covina, where both she and Cochran had lived all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, they picked a steamy July weekend last summer to go 
house-hunting here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drove around in a miserable heat that provided more ammunition for me to 
use against Washington," recalled Kellie Cochran. "But Bob wanted me so 
desperately to live here, he would have said anything to make me like the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "So he ignored the humidity. It was like 'Me sweating? No, honey, I'm not 
sweating.' But I've found that if you have a positive mind-set, the heat is 
tolerable. The more you sweat, the better it is for your pores. You lose 
weight. It's like having a sauna without going out and buying one." 
</P>
<P>
 The heat has taught Amadie Hutner some valuable lessons: Don't buy satin 
blouses that melt in the humidity. On the hottest days, catch a matinee. And 
take a cab -- forget the sweaty subway. 
</P>
<P>
 At those weekend softball games, do what Hutner and her friends are planning 
to do: Put together a block of ice and a portable fan and you've got instant 
outside air-conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 She has advice for anyone planning to brave the nation's capital and its 
big-dog days of summer: "Force yourself to get outside. You can't let the heat 
stop you. Otherwise, in this city, you'd spend your entire life indoors."

PAINTING OF SWASTIKA ON CAR CALLED HATE CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an incident authorities are calling a hate crime, vandals painted a 
swastika on a Chatsworth man's car while it was parked in his driveway, police 
said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Raby, who is Jewish, said he discovered the swastika painted in red on 
the trunk of his white car when he went out to his driveway Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I was violated," said Raby, 39, who moved from West Los Angeles 
to the San Fernando Valley four years ago. "I'm not sure whether it's 
teen-agers or whether it's skinheads. But it's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Raby, who lives with his wife and three children on the 20800 block of Tulsa 
Street in Chatsworth, said it was the fourth time in two years that his 
property has been vandalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandals once smashed his family's mailbox, another time his car was smeared 
with eggs and sugar, and in a third incident a window of his minivan was 
smashed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a real surprise and a horror, too," Raby said. "It scares my 
wife, it scares my kids." SUSAN BYRNES

ARTIST PAINTS TRIBUTE TO VICTIMS OF NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to ease the pain of those who lost relatives and friends in the 
Northridge earthquake, a Ventura artist unveiled a painting Sunday of most of 
the 16 people killed in the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came down here a couple of days after the earthquake, and I saw all of 
this and said to myself, 'I have to do this,' " Lynn Griffey said. "I don't 
know if it was God or what, but I felt like no one really knew who these people 
were." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, Griffey posted a note at the Northridge United Methodist 
Church, which was an emergency center in the days after the quake, asking 
family members for photographs of the victims, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three months, but she received photos of 12 of the 16 Northridge 
Meadows residents who died when the building collapsed. She printed the names 
of two other victims whose photos she did not receive in time. The families of 
the final two victims did not want to take part in the project, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year Griffey, 27, painted a portrait of Oxnard Police Officer 
James E. O'Brien, who was killed by a gunman who had gone on a bloody rampage 
at an Oxnard unemployment office last December. That portrait now hangs in the 
office of the chief of police in Oxnard, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, for the first time she put together the names with the faces of the 
people she had contacted after the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last experience here was digging through my mother's apartment, so I think 
this will be a much nicer memory," said Julie Tindall, who came from Phoenix, 
Ariz., with her husband, Ted, to attend the unveiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The unveiling, held in the church vestibule, was attended by about 30 friends 
and relatives of the people who died at the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "She caught my sister's smile," Carolyn Andersen said as she stood before the 
portrait. Andersen, a Sacramento resident, was there to honor her sister, 
Sharon Engler, who with her husband, Phil, died in the destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this will put this thing to rest, not that we will ever forget it, but 
maybe enough so we won't dwell on it anymore," Andersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The portrait will be on display at the church for the next week. Griffey said 
she is in discussions with Cal State Northridge officials about placing it 
permanently on university grounds.

CHIROPRACTORS, PHYSICIANS HOPE TO END ANIMOSITY, HEAL TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Dr. Ben Morovati, a chiropractor and a member of a profession once derided by 
the American Medical Assn. as quacks, recently earned the right to, as he puts 
it, sit on the good couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Morovati, with four other chiropractors, has opened a clinic at the Thompson 
Memorial Medical Center -- believed by experts to be the first such 
chiropractic clinic at a hospital in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Morovati's first patients at the new chiropractic clinic was Sharon 
Skinner, a Burbank grandmother with neck and shoulder pain who is an X-ray 
technician at Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a firm believer that chiropractors and medical doctors should work 
together," Skinner said after her recent visit at which Morovati told her that 
the neck and shoulder trouble was causing the mysterious headaches she had been 
suffering for a year and a half. "I think they both have something to offer," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, that has been a minority view. Morovati, a Glendale chiropractor, 
describes that early relationship as similar to that between a reluctant 
homeowner and unfamiliar house guests. "We didn't automatically assume we could 
sit on the good couch and put our feet on the table," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson granted staff privileges to chiropractors a year ago in order to 
start using a new procedure, known as "manipulation under anesthesia," in which 
chiropractors use their skill in making spinal adjustments with the help of 
medical doctors, drugs and a hospital operating room. The patient is 
anesthetized so the chiropractor can make more vigorous adjustments of the 
spine. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1980s, chiropractors have earned staff privileges at as many as 
150 hospitals, which allows them to perform examinations in hospitals and 
co-admit patients with the assistance of medical doctors. However, Thompson 
Memorial is the first hospital in the country known to have taken the 
relationship with chiropractors to the next level, creating a fully operational 
clinic staffed only by chiropractors who function within their own department 
at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we're like two roommates," said Morovati, although he quickly adds to his 
metaphor, explaining that in a hospital the medical doctor is still the 
roommate who holds the lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a first," said Dr. Jon Buriak, chairman of the American Chiropractic 
Assn. hospital relations committee. "I don't know of any other hospital who is 
doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the patient who comes into the emergency room after wrenching his back 
while gardening can be immediately referred to a chiropractor. Don Kennedy, 
director of physician services at the 105-bed hospital, estimates that about a 
dozen patients a month ask for a referral to a chiropractor. 
</P>
<P>
 By opening the clinic, Kennedy expects the hospital will provide an easily 
accessible alternative treatment that can be far less expensive and 
time-consuming than drug treatments and surgery offered by medical doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an idea that, when you start putting chiropractors into a hospital, 
becomes a natural thing," said Dr. Richard Dietzen, a Chicago-area 
chiropractor, about Thompson's clinic. "It sounds to me they are actually doing 
what we were trying to do here." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietzen, who had chaired chiropractic services at Belmont Community Hospital 
in Chicago, tried to set up a chiropractic clinic in that hospital last year, 
but the effort fell through. "The timing just wasn't right," Dietzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinner, 52, is not sure what caused her to develope the problem with her 
right shoulder and neck. But after a year and a half of physical therapy, which 
brought her from having 30% use of her arm to about 95%, Skinner was glad to 
find out her hospital was opening the chiropractic clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a physical therapist, they are so booked up you have to take whatever 
time slot they have available," said Skinner, who has four grandchildren. 
"Sometimes you have to wait six months." 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between chiropractors and medical doctors has been raging for 
decades. In the 1960s the American Medical Assn. even declared it unethical for 
any of its members to professionally associate with chiropractors. A lawsuit by 
a group of chiropractors filed in 1976 countered that the AMA policy violated 
anti-trust laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The AMA finally rescinded its policy in 1980. That move would ultimately pave 
the way for the two groups to make referrals and for chiropractors to win staff 
privileges at hospitals, giving them the opportunity to co-admit patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not end the suit, which continued until 1987, when a federal 
judge ruled that the AMA boycott had harmed the reputation of chiropractors and 
forced the AMA to publicly recant its past policy. The terms of the settlement 
of the lawsuit were not fulfilled until last year, and rifts between the two 
professions remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the medical doctors don't understand what chiropractors do," said Dr. 
G. Ron Austin, director of chiropractic services at Coast Plaza Hospital in 
Norwalk. But chiropractors said they have found that once they earn staff 
privileges, it becomes a prime opportunity to show medical doctors that they 
can work together. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thompson, the first step toward educating doctors about chiropractic was 
the creation of a manipulation under anesthesia program. This led, eventually, 
to the full clinic. And now, Kennedy said, the two camps are working together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we will be able to close the gap between medical doctors and 
chiropractors," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We study the same things," said Morovati, explaining that anatomy courses for 
a chiropractor are similar to those for a medical doctor. "But our approach is 
more hands-on rather than pharmacological." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past it was more common for a chiropractor to make referrals to medical 
doctors, but both Morovati and Kennedy hope to turn that trend around. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is get ahead of the game," said Kennedy, who holds a 
private theory about where this trend will eventually lead. He hopes that 
eventually the state will require hospitals to recognize chiropractic services. 
"It's just a matter of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with increased access to hospitals, Dr. Stephen Capps of Houston, who 
teaches manipulation under anesthesia procedure across the country, predicts 
that most chiropractors would not ultimately give up private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morovati has discovered many advantages to working in a hospital. X-ray 
and other equipment are not always available to chiropractors in private 
practice. And if a patient really needs more care than a chiropractor can 
offer, he can quickly be steered to physicians at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a trade-off. A chiropractor in private practice can set his own hours and 
generally doesn't have to worry about the voluminous paperwork a hospital 
generates. Still, the hospital access apparently adds status. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a different stadium now," Morovati said.

Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Max Arroyo, 27, was last seen at 3 a.m. Saturday in a minimum-security ward of

3.4 AFTERSHOCK CENTERED IN NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months to the day after the Northridge earthquake ravaged the Southland, a 
3.4 magnitude aftershock rattled across the San Fernando Valley on Sunday 
morning. It caused no damage but was felt as far away as Santa Monica, 
seismologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock, which hit at 8:29 a.m., was centered in Northridge a mile 
southeast of Chatsworth and was one of several hundred since the Jan. 17 quake, 
according to Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershock was closer to the surface than some of the recent rumblings but 
follows what seismologists call a normal pattern after a large earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really know how long they will go on," said Russ Needham of the 
National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colo. "But I would think they 
would begin abating down to the point where they will be smaller." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's aftershock was the strongest in several weeks. On June 15, 
seismologists recorded a magnitude 4.2 quake, Needham said. There have been 
about 260 aftershocks between 3.0 and 3.9 since Jan. 17. SUSAN BYRNES

<P>
 A round the World Cup in 31 days:  
</P>
<P>
 June 17 -- I go to Chicago. I am certifiably one of my newspaper's 99 
part-time soccer correspondents, including our regular international football 
guy, our regular American football guy, our regular World Cup woman, our 
visiting Rome bureau guy, our Pulitzer Prize-winning guy, our Nobel Peace 
Prize-winning guy, our Spanish-speaking travel agent, our Irish-speaking 
editor, our Irish editor's Spanish-speaking translator, our skiing writer, two 
hockey writers and our temporary World Cup stand-up comic. We brace ourselves. 
We place our hands in front of our laps. We begin. 
</P>
<P>
 June 18 -- I go to Detroit. For indoor soccer. Only in America. I suspect soon 
we will host World Cup skiing indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 June 19 -- The illustrious Simon Barnes of the Times of London refers to 
soccer as "footy." This is one of the many reasons why the writing of Simon 
Barnes of the Times of London is often compared to Hemingway's best work -- 
Mariel Hemingway's. 
</P>
<P>
 June 20 -- Belgium plays Morocco in Orlando. But I miss it. Damn. I almost 
never miss a game between Belgium and Morocco in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
 June 21 -- Greece goes goal-less. 
</P>
<P>
 June 22 -- We teach that crazy Colombia a thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
 June 23 -- Italy wins. About time. 
</P>
<P>
 June 24 -- Mexico wins. About time. 
</P>
<P>
 June 25 -- The quotable Simon Barnes of the Times of London writes of American 
columnists' vain attempts at being "humorists." Then Simon, cheeky monkey, 
proceeds to his next column item, "Best Haircuts of the World Cup," with its 
simply marvelous reference to Alexi Lalas and his "red Frank Zappa goatee." Oh, 
Simon! Oh, gallant keyboard knight! If humor be the song of love, write on! 
</P>
<P>
 June 26 -- USA loses. About time. 
</P>
<P>
 June 27 -- Greece still goal-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 June 28 -- Some rubber-legged Russian puts five past Cameroon keeper. Cameroon 
coach considers using radical, new, one-player, 10-goalie defense. 
</P>
<P>
 June 29 -- Maradona squirts away Argentina's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 June 30 -- Greece lays geese eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 July 1 -- The devilishly handsome, Cardinal Richelieu-goateed Simon Barnes of 
the Times of London, regarded around the world as the Benny Hill of soccer 
journalism, desperately tries to think of something frightfully clever to write 
next, so he can really impress the Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 July 2 -- Chicago's last game. Crazy man with lawn mower is found in Marshall 
Field's, going in circle after circle after circle. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 July 3 -- Brazilians say: "Yes, we fear the American players tomorrow. What 
were their names again?" 
</P>
<P>
 July 4 -- We get our butts Bebeto'd right out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 July 5 -- Television ratings out. Smaller than COURT-TV, bigger than Chevy 
Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 July 6 -- Rest Day. I take out garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 July 7 -- Rest Day. I write new garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 July 8 -- Rest Day. I take out fresh garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 July 9 -- Either Netherlands loses at Meadowlands or Meadowlands loses at 
Netherlands, I forget. 
</P>
<P>
 July 10 -- Deutschland, Deutschland, guten abend. 
</P>
<P>
 July 11 -- The latest dispatch from Simon Barnes of the Times of London 
exposing the incredible number of American athletes who resemble members of the 
Zappa family is pushed back to Page 3 to make room for the more important DIANA 
PHOTOGRAPHED WITH NO SHOES, PRINCE CHARLES TALKS ON PRINCESS TELEPHONE, QUEEN 
SEEN SELLING CROWN IN PAWN SHOP, ENGLAND CRICKET EVEN WORSE THAN ITS FOOTBALL 
headlines on Page 1. 
</P>
<P>
 July 12 -- Roberto Baggio ready to play, despite long black beaver tail 
protruding from back of skull. 
</P>
<P>
 July 13 -- Roll over Bulgaria, and tell Stoitchkov the news. 
</P>
<P>
 July 14 -- Someone wakes Brazil goalkeeper, tells him yesterday's game is over 
and he can leave. 
</P>
<P>
 July 15 -- Italy team eats lunch, says California pizza "tastes like Baggio's 
hair." 
</P>
<P>
 July 16 -- Brazil trains to Xuxa music. Xuxa says she's xextatic. 
</P>
<P>
 July 17 -- Game over. World Cup over. Last one out of Pasadena, turn off the 
smog.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; BILL PLASCHKE; MOST IMPORTANT LESSON WAS HERE THE 
WHOLE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, Bill Plaschke covers the National Football League for the 
Times. He covered 14 games in four cities during the tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The television image-makers will tell you the World Cup was about rock stars 
and gods. 
</P>
<P>
 The Century City suits will tell you it was about economic impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The soccer nerds -- and won't they be coming out of the upholstery -- will 
tell you it was about a future professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as usually happens when people forget about other people, they will all 
be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup was about cabbies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about climbing into the back seat of a ripe taxi, glancing up at the 
foreigner sitting on a strange bed of wooden beads behind the wheel, then doing 
something for the first time in your adult life. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about talking to the guy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about asking where he was from. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, it was about asking about his country's soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 We could have asked this before. But, sadly, never before have we cared. 
</P>
<P>
 For one month, the World Cup offered our diverse nation a chance to sit at a 
common table. Those of us lucky enough to accept that invitation looked across 
that table with surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants who are the recipients of our anger and butts of our jokes, those 
with funny accents who pass through our lives as blurs behind a mini-market 
counter or in a strawberry field or in the front seat of a cab . . . they 
became more than just images. 
</P>
<P>
 They became people. People with voices and homes and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the World Cup, we considered them aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending a month using the universal language of soccer, we have 
discovered they are neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget this notion about a sporting event bringing the world together. The 
World Cup taught us about the bridges that can be built within our own borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Our differences, often the reason for disdain, suddenly became cause for 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the cabby from El Salvador who was still furious at a perceived 
slight to his team during qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I said, I now understood about the power of soccer referees, and wasn't 
that too bad. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, he added, he came to this country several years ago, lives in a 
small apartment outside New York City, and hopes one day to save enough money 
to bring the rest of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck, I said. And for once, I wasn't just saying it. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the cabby from Sudan who wondered if the Nigerians had enough 
gumption to survive the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 When he wasn't driving a cab, he was working toward obtaining a college 
business degree that he could use back home. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't particularly want to move to our country, but he didn't know another 
way he could help give his own country a future. 
</P>
<P>
 You should be proud of yourself, I said. And for once, I wasn't just saying 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, numbing rides usually marked by weird pipe music coming from a 
makeshift radio became lively 30-minute debates. 
</P>
<P>
 Money changed hands, but so did smiles. The temptation was to hang up a sign 
so the next passenger would understand: 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup was here.  
</P>
<P>
 Frighteningly, perhaps, this soccer tournament also changed the way we looked 
at people we thought we knew so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Patricia, an "aunt" to our children, the first person we invite to 
holiday celebrations, a former employee and dear friend. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved here from Colombia nearly 20 years ago, but until this summer had 
always resisted becoming a citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 When we asked why, she could never fully explain. She just shrugged when we 
told her we would never understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then her national soccer team arrived in Southern California for the World 
Cup. And while watching it play on television from my assigned work stations on 
the East Coast, my eyes were opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia was not just a bad joke about drugs, it was an actual country with 
real people possessing real passion. These thousands of Colombians, dancing and 
singing in the Rose Bowl stands, were far different from ones we usually see on 
the CNN clips of dirty Bogota streets and funeral processions. 
</P>
<P>
 I heard their chants, and recognized their anguish as their team fell behind, 
and my mind turned to Patricia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I thought. So this is who she is. 
</P>
<P>
 Excitedly one morning, I picked up the phone in hopes of reaching her, of 
telling that I thought I understood why she was reluctant to become a citizen, 
that perhaps it was because she did not want to lose her heartfelt Columbian 
roots. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was not home. She had driven to the Rose Bowl with several other 
Colombian friends to watch the game against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 And here, I didn't even know she had Colombian friends.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; JULIE CART; IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE OF A LIFETIME 
FOR U.S. TEAM AND REPORTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, Julie Cart was assigned to report on soccer and this World Cup 
almost two years ago. She has covered eight games in four cities during this 
tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you must hang around an athletic team -- an unfortunate occupational 
requirement -- you could do much worse than to spend a year with the U.S. 
national soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 The players on the U.S. World Cup team are as unlike other professional 
athletes as it's possible to be. They are mostly college educated, polite, 
patient with autograph seekers and wholly without pretension. Mostly. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, covering the U.S. team was the easiest beat of the 24 in the 
World Cup. There was no language problem, if you don't count the coach. Access 
-- a big media issue during the tournament -- was no trouble for the Americans. 
Almost every player came out after the game and spoke with reporters. The sole 
exception was Marcelo Balboa, who spent most of his time after games in random 
drug testing, drinking gallons of fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 The American players understood their sport's position in the hierarchy of 
sports here. They took it as their responsibility to promote the sport, and if 
that meant answering the same questions and retelling the same anecdotes to 
wave after wave of reporters, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it didn't get old. The team put on a skit at a function before the 
World Cup, poking fun at American reporters' ignorance of the game. It was an 
accurate reflection of the inevitable when-did-you-first-play-soccer questions 
that accompany something considered a minor sport here. Gymnasts hear the same 
thing every four years, as do swimmers, divers and most other Olympic athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup has been a learning experience for reporters and the American 
public, true, but also for the players. As the U.S. team bandwagon picked up 
steam, the players got a good look at what hype and public scrutiny is all 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 From a reporter's perspective, I think I know what the Beatles' beat writers 
felt like. Most sportswriters are more accustomed to hearing screaming coaches 
at practices rather than screaming teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fan favorites changed frequently, usually depending on hairstyle. First it 
was goalkeeper Tony Meola, who, I'm told, exudes a kind of Vinnie Barbarino 
charm. Then came mop-headed Cobi Jones and his Tiger Beat fan club of screaming 
teeny-boppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as the World Cup got closer, Alexi Lalas became the rage, with his rock 
band and his long red hair and goatee. Lalas was the most fun. Even when 
Lalas-mania was at its height -- perhaps it has yet to crest -- the saving 
grace was that Lalas never took himself or his overnight fame too seriously. He 
has been intelligent and aware enough to know that whatever is happening is 
fleeting and he has decided to enjoy the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was good for the players to bask in the attention and healthy for the sport 
that it had such presentable ambassadors. And now it's over. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the reality that perhaps Lalas knows but others will discover. Fame is 
fickle. It's a wild and often brief ride that's seldom worth it, except 
financially. Sudden fame spoils. You come to expect it and, worse, actually 
believe it is something that reporters and fans are obliged to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meola, who has been known to scold reporters for not writing enough about him, 
said a curious thing the day after the U.S. team lost to Brazil in the second 
round. He said he was going to retire from international competition because he 
didn't want to put his family through the hell that is media attention. He said 
that while he could take it, he wanted to protect his parents and wife from the 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 What Meola didn't understand is that the attention paid to the U.S. World Cup 
team was like a narrowly focused spotlight, trained on the team for a short 
time but soon turned elsewhere. And, for the most part, it was a friendly 
light. 
</P>
<P>
 The players experienced about one-tenth the criticism and scrutiny heaped on 
professional athletes and even college athletes in this country. It was 
certainly nothing like what professional soccer players deal with in Europe or 
South America. Whatever mild criticism or offhand remark the U.S. soccer 
players might have read or heard was nothing like the tirades that go on every 
day on sports talk radio or in bars. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the American public's ignorance of soccer spared the U.S. team a more 
harsh reality. And the player's naivete earned them the goodwill of reporters 
who couldn't bring themselves to rip a team of such hard-working and earnest 
young men. If they are smart, they enjoyed the experience, because it is not 
likely to be duplicated in their lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 The media learned too. If you have to cover a team, make it soccer. The worst 
guy on the U.S. team would be the prince of any American baseball team.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; GRAHAME L. JONES; U.S. HAS MISSED ITS BEST SHOT 
TO ENSURE MLS SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, Grahame L. Jones is one of the country's foremost experts 
on soccer. He covered 18 games in eight cities during the tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember the date clearly. It was Aug. 5, 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when I covered my first soccer match for The Times, or indeed for 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland was playing Mexico at the Coliseum. I wanted to see the game, so I 
volunteered to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, no one at the newspaper was interested in soccer, so I got to 
go. It was a friendly. The Poles and Mexicans both had qualified for the 1974 
World Cup in West Germany and needed some international competition before the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Morejon was promoting the match. Morejon, from Spain, spent more than 
half a century keeping the Greater Los Angeles Soccer League in business. He 
worked long hours and put up with all sorts of absurd problems. Why? Because he 
loved soccer. It was that simple. 
</P>
<P>
 They won't have heard of him at FIFA, any more than they would have heard of 
other soccer friends from those early days, Chuck Bowerman from Malta, for 
example, or John Best, a former referee, from Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 But they, and many more like them, are the backbone of the sport in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why, when thinking of memories from World Cup '94, their names came 
to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 They were not involved in the tournament. All they did was lay the groundwork 
for its success by spending countless hours at the grass-roots level, planting 
the seeds for soccer to thrive in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 What a pity if it were all to go to waste. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 is history. In the next day or two, the FIFA hierarchy will be 
gone. The foreign press and fans will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 And the greatest opportunity soccer has had to succeed permanently in this 
country will be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 And we will be left with what? 
</P>
<P>
 Promises of a professional league? Does FIFA seriously believe Major League 
Soccer will be up and running by April? Does it think this World Cup, 
successful and profitable as it was, will be the catalyst that launches the 
sport into the big leagues? 
</P>
<P>
 Give me a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The final whistle had no sooner sounded at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on Sunday 
than things began to fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, look for infighting and excuses, amateurism and ineptitude, to 
take center stage as the U.S. Soccer Federation tries yet again to 
self-destruct. Ego and greed are the name of the game from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that an unnecessarily negative attitude? Not when it's based on more than 
20 years of covering the USSF and seeing it drop the ball time and time again. 
</P>
<P>
 Those running the sport in this country, and that means from Alan Rothenberg 
on down, had a tremendous opportunity here, perhaps the last opportunity to 
establish soccer as a viable professional sport in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But I think the chance has passed them by. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the day after World Cup '94 ended, the professional league should have 
kicked into gear. The franchises should have been in place. The team names 
should have been known. The clubs should have been signing World Cup players 
and coaches, capitalizing on the interest generated in the sport by the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, U.S. soccer today walks off the edge of the cliff. Coverage in 
non-Spanish language newspapers and on non-Spanish language television will 
plummet in volume, if not disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 It need not be that way. Soccer is not ending merely because World Cup '94 has 
ended. The players and teams are simply moving to different fields in different 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, qualifying for the 1996 European Championship in England gets fully 
under way. Forty-nine national teams are involved, including 13 of this World 
Cup's participants. Next year, the Copa America, or South American 
Championship, is played in Uruguay, featuring another 12 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year also brings the second FIFA Women's World Championship in Sweden, 
with the United States as defending champion, as well as the Under-20 World 
Championship in Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, the Atlanta Olympic Games will feature men's and women's soccer 
tournaments in five cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year also sees the start of qualifying for the 1998 World Cup in 
France. Add in all the annual national and continental club competitions, the 
African and Asian championships and innumerable friendlies and its easy to see 
that there is life after 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But will the United States be part of it? 
</P>
<P>
 This World Cup did incalculable good in introducing fans to soccer and giving 
them a genuine interest in the game. That includes many of my colleagues at The 
Times who earlier shuddered at the idea of covering soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 That, perhaps, is my fondest memory of World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 But wouldn't it have been far better to have had a proper professional league 
right now, rather than some nebulous promise? 
</P>
<P>
 No one will go to half-empty stadiums to see second- and third-rate American 
players and a few over-the-hill foreigners in the MLS. That has failed before. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one formula that might work. 
</P>
<P>
 Let AC Milan have a farm team in New York, using promising American players 
and up-and-coming stars AC Milan is interested in keeping. Have the team wear 
the same uniforms as the parent club. 
</P>
<P>
 Do the same thing in Chicago with Bayern Munich. The same thing in Los Angeles 
with Chivas of Guadalajara, and in Seattle with Liverpool in Miami with Sao 
Paulo. And so on. Make it a truly international league, reflecting the country 
as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 has proved that the United States is not a melting pot but 
rather a multicolored quilt. Soccer can and should be a thread that ties the 
pieces together. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not an impossible dream. It simply needs the right people to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
 A few more Tony Morejons, Chuck Bowermans and John Bests, for example.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; MIKE PENNER; IT'S BLURRY, BUT IT ALL COMES BACK 
TO HIM NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, Mike Penner is a columnist for the Orange County Edition of The 
Times. He covered 11 games in three cities. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The editors have demanded I send them 750 words of World Cup recollections, 
and I am sitting here drumming my fingers and racking my brain and the pages of 
my yellow legal pad are still as blank as the Greek half of a Group D 
scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing I remember is a Saturday night in late June, about 10 o'clock. 
My wife and I, who used to have a life, are flipping through copies of Soccer 
America and World Soccer, newspaper sports sections from New York to San 
Francisco are spread across the living room floor like Patton's field maps and 
I am clipping stories for my 24 individual World Cup folders. A Wall Street 
Journal piece on the rigors of training to be a World Cup referee suddenly 
seems particularly compelling. ESPN's tape-delayed broadcast of the Saudi 
Arabia-Morocco match is droning on in the background. I look up, Saeed Al 
Owairan makes a sensational spin move and . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Pfffffffftt!  
</P>
<P>
 Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I am sitting in front of my computer screen and I am wearing a 
green-and-orange Ireland Soccer T-shirt bearing the inscription "Playing On 
America's Toughest Greens" and a yellow-blue-and-green baseball cap with the 
CBF Brazilian football logo on it. I have no idea how they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD player is on. Electric guitars are crunching and groaning and it seems 
like Alexi Lalas is singing. 
</P>
<P>
 'Cause it's not against the law  
</P>
<P>
 Bring anyone at all  
</P>
<P>
 We're all just kickin' balls.  
</P>
<P>
 I reach for another CD and the first one I grab is called "World Cup Bend 
It!," featuring "songs about (or by)" Pele, Roberto Baggio, Maradona, Johan 
Cruyff and Roger Milla. I do not want to know how it got there. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacked against the wall are a half-dozen videotapes. They have handwritten 
labels that read "WORLD CUP QUARTERFINALS," "ROMANIA 3, COLOMBIA 1" and 
"GERMANY 3, SOUTH KOREA 2." 
</P>
<P>
 In my handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel dizzy. I decide to lay on the couch and close my eyes. My head hurts. I 
see a flash of golden light, a blurry yellow mushroom cloud. I concentrate 
harder. It appears to be a partial eclipse of the sun. . . . No, that's not 
right. . . . It's . . . yes . . . it's Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
 I see white stars on a blue denim shirt. I see red block letters. B-A-L-B-O-A. 
The long-haired man in the shirt is cartwheeling in mid-air, heels over head, 
and he kicks a soccer ball before he lands. The ball nearly winds up in a a 
massive mesh of netting, missing the post by inches. 
</P>
<P>
 My head is pounding. I hear drums, incessant and rhythmic. I see something 
that looks like the banner for a high school science fiction club. I see 
another, and another. Now dozens. They are frantically being waved in the air 
by people dressed from head to toe in vertical green-and-yellow stripes. I hear 
voices, speaking in tongues. BRA-seel! BRA-seel! Over and over. Louder and 
louder. 
</P>
<P>
 The images are moving faster now. 
</P>
<P>
 South Koreans. Running and running. Legs churning. Never stopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Germans on the same plot of grass. Feet dragging. Tongues hanging. Begging the 
referee to blow his whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Booming kick by a yellow-shirted Romanian. The ball accelerates as it gains 
altitude, then it knuckles and slices into the top corner of net. Then he does 
it again from a little farther out. Each time, the crowd keeps count, calling 
out in Romanian: "Hagi! Hagi!" Penalty kick by a red-shirted Romanian. Swedish 
goalie makes a guess and takes a dive. Ball hits goalie's glove. Swedish 
players fly in the air. Romanian players lie on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 It is starting to come back to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember buying a magazine at a newsstand in Westwood. The vendor is from 
Sweden. He predicts Sweden will beat Brazil, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember buying a mini-cassette recorder in Lakewood. The man behind the 
counter is from Nigeria. He predicts Nigeria will reach the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember sharing a plane ride to San Jose with an Iranian gentleman who 
sells Persian rugs in Corona del Mar. He is flying up to see the 
Brazil-Cameroon game. He predicts Brazil will win the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember a cab ride in Palo Alto. The driver is ending his shift as soon as 
he drops me off at my hotel. He, too, has tickets to the Brazil-Cameroon game 
that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these people? 
</P>
<P>
 And why am I comparing playmaking midfielders with them? 
</P>
<P>
 I fear something terrible has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife walks into the living roon and almost trips over a Jorge 
Campos-autographed soccer ball. 
</P>
<P>
 I open my morning sports section, read the soccer stories and toss the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 I am now counting the months to France '98 and wondering how I can score that 
assignment and wondering how I will pass the time until then. 
</P>
<P>
 I pop a tape into the VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "101 Classic Goals Of The World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-seven months to go.

games in two cities during the tournament.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a small opening under the chain-link fence. We looked at each other, 
considering the positive and negative ramifications of such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's go," Mike said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without another look at the barbed wire, I slid under the fence first. Fine, 
no problem, the guard dogs were at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike was on his belly. I looked for the glint of guns as he crawled under the 
fence. Seconds later, we were on the other side and had flirted with breaking 
international law in the name of journalism. No one had seen us and it had 
never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering the revolution? 
</P>
<P>
 No, we were covering the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, in some countries it is the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, we probably didn't know we were obsessed with the World Cup. 
The fence was only another one of those ever-present Rose Bowl barriers, a 
decent imitation of a high-security correctional facility. (Frankly, Lompoc is 
probably easier to vacate than the mixed zone, where reporters interview 
players and coaches.) 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the World Cup did to our household in less than a month. At first 
it dawned as a minor diversion from having watched poorly played hockey (the 
Kings) and an escape from a bumbling baseball franchise (the Angels). 
</P>
<P>
 Then the spinning soccer ball ended up acting as a hypnotic force. Somewhere 
that first weekend of World Cup, between Hagi and Henrik, soccer became the 
only sport that mattered. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi's brilliance in the first World Cup game at the Rose Bowl set the tone 
for surprises as he led Romania to a startling 3-1 upset over Colombia. There 
was his beguiling game-winner, a 35-yard shot that soared through the air and 
dipped over goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba into the upper right corner of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hagi Night Fever in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a day later there was a jubilant Swede Henrik Larsson, who came off the 
bench late in the game and helped set up the tying goal against Cameroon. 
Larsson patiently waded through a series of interviews. He spoke to Swedish 
radio reporters, television reporters and print journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was a sign of light near the front of the pack. No Swedish 
translator was in sight as I edged near the barrier separating the press from 
the players. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Larsson if he spoke English. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said, shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when I was wondering if my editors were going to send me to the writers' 
wing of the group of death, Larsson started laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I do," he said, proceeding to answer all questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A little Swedish humor. The kid was having some fun. Which is what all the 
Swedes seemed to do on their way to the semifinals. They came out to speak, win 
or lose. The players stood patiently, and no one ever heard two of the 
most-uttered phrases we're used to hearing from athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything else?"  
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of a question is that?"  
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes may have complained quite a bit about the heat and the officiating, 
but they were always available and always quotable. Goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli 
even mocked himself at times. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the beginning of the World Cup spell. Friends wondered who was Bebeto 
and why we were saying he was better than Romario. Then they started to 
complain things had changed. They didn't understand why we spent extra hours 
driving up to Westwood or Hollywood to find European soccer publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Why were we drinking a pint of Guinness after Ireland won and a pitcher of 
sangria after Spanish victories? 
</P>
<P>
 My brother wondered whether we had moved. 
</P>
<P>
 We listened to the Spanish broadcast of the Sweden-Brazil game on the radio en 
route to the Mighty Ducks headquarters at The Pond of Anaheim the day of the 
NHL's entry draft. Some wondered why the Mighty Ducks didn't select Radek Bonk, 
we wondered whether Rai deserved to be benched. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings were supposed to be lucky that Jamie Storr was still available. But 
what about Claudio Caniggia's availability against Romania? 
</P>
<P>
 Then it started to get weird. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto, Romario and Mazinho pretended to "rock the baby" after Bebeto scored 
against the Netherlands in honor of Bebeto's newborn son. This victory dance 
became popular. 
</P>
<P>
 I told my mother I planned to rock the baby after the World Cup ended. 
</P>
<P>
 What?  
</P>
<P>
 No, that was a surprise for another day.

 Mom affixed the name tag to my pressed rayon shirt and wetted down my cowlick. 
I kissed her on the cheek and set off on this World Cup soccer assignment. . . 
. kicking and screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't want to meet the new kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most Americans, I considered unworthy variants of football not flanked by 
the words National and League.  
</P>
<P>
 I expected to grow sick and tired of soccer and, initially, this was the case. 
To the point, I was poisoned at the first soccer match I ever attended, a 
"friendly" between Mexico and the United States at the Rose Bowl. The culprit 
was a media box lunch. Two words: spoiled mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmonella 1, me nil. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day I prayed to the porcelain Pele while clutching a 1994 NFL 
schedule, only to recover in time to open my travel itinerary. 
</P>
<P>
 The boss apparently thought it would be interesting to test his theories on 
sleep deprivation. One segment of my 15-day "death march" asked that I cover a 
Friday night game at Pontiac, Mich., a Saturday match at Foxboro, Mass., and a 
Sunday morning contest at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 I called the airlines to see whether such routing was possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart-alecks. 
</P>
<P>
 When my head finally hit pillow in Chicago on June 26, I had been awake, more 
or less, 60 consecutive hours, not counting a cat-nap I took on the shoulder of 
a woman in a middle seat on the Boston-to-Chicago flight. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm guessing the Who got more sleep on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In the blur of a weekend, I saw 270 minutes of soccer involving teams from 
Sweden, Russia, Argentina, Nigeria, Greece and Bulgaria. Don't ask me which 
teams played which. 
</P>
<P>
 Staring at Greece's lineup that Sunday morning in Chicago -- the names jumping 
off the page: Tsalouhidi, Apostolakis, Atmatzides -- was the eye-chart test 
from hell. 
</P>
<P>
 I ate at Denny's so often that weekend I once begged the manager to refuse me 
service. During pit stops at Butch's diner at Chicago O'Hare, I watched a 
waitress named Louise sling insults and hash with equal aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise? Imagine Dick Butkus in an apron wearing Aunt Bea's wig. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise donned a button that read, "You gotta problem with that?" 
</P>
<P>
 When I ordered a muffin, she offered, "Oh, need to clean out your colon?" 
</P>
<P>
 Check please. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't get to know many soccer players, but I forged bonds with service 
industry workers across America. (Aside to bellhop Bobby at the Logan Airport 
Hilton: Stay in school, son, don't be a fool. And, yes, I think Cindy still 
loves you.) 
</P>
<P>
 The trip might have been salvageable if not for an abrupt detour out of 
Detroit on June 24. After wrapping the Sweden-Russia game story around 
midnight, I raced my rental toward a hotel adjacent to the Detroit Metro 
Airport, hoping to catch a few winks before a 9 a.m. flight to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:30 a.m., on the transition road Interstate 75 south to 94 west, I got 
stuck in traffic, eventually turned off the engine and waited . . . four hours! 
 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30, in a scene out of "Night of the Living Dead," drivers who had been 
backed up for miles started walking like zombies out of the mist into the glare 
of headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 A state trooper broke the news to us that a truck had jackknifed in the rain. 
The driver was presumed dead. The truck had spilled diesel fuel, making the 
road impassable until sand trucks could be called in. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, another trucker walked up with a lighted cigarette in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you nuts?" I screamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently so, because the man laughed and flicked his Bic in defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 I ran back to my car and locked the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Checked into hotel at 5:30. Checked out at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Not much in the mood for soccer, I approached some matches cynically. Yet, the 
more I watched soccer the less I came to despise it. 
</P>
<P>
 A second-round match between Germany and Belgium actually raised my pulse 
rate. Still, I find it amusing soccer writers would dare attempt to compare the 
athletic abilities of Brazil's Romario to Michael Jordan's. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll believe that the day Romario jumps over the back of the goal and scores 
on a header. 
</P>
<P>
 My prejudices are deep-rooted. I am not convinced the game has much of a 
chance to make it in America. Sweden's play in the semifinals might have sealed 
soccer's American fate. 
</P>
<P>
 That said, I do hereby recognize that soccer at the highest level can be a 
game of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 I would prefer this not get around, but I . . . sort . . . of . . . liked . . 
. it.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO; SOCCER EXCITEMENT NOT 
FOREIGN TO HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, William D. Montalbano is The Times bureau chief in 
Rome. He covered 12 games in four cities during this tournament. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On one coast I met a daughter whom I first deposited on a soccer field when 
she was 6. Only yesterday, it seems, but she's a Manhattan fast-tracker now, 
and all month she's been watching with kinsmen's approval as World Cup 
defenders scythe impudent attackers. My daughter, four years an All-Ivy 
sweeper, recited the fullback's credo: "The ball can go past, and the man can 
go past, but the man cannot go past with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other coast, inside the Rose Bowl on Sunday, I met a son playing hooky 
from a weekend soccer team in Northern California on which he is the only 
starter who does not speak Spanish as a first language. My son wore a badge 
that proclaimed him on-site counsel for one of the USA '94 support companies. 
"The fact is, nobody here needs a lawyer as much as I needed a Cup fix," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm the one who has been watching USA '94 from the other end of the telescope. 
After years of living in Latin America and Europe, soccer is an old friend. 
Over cappuccino every morning tifosi of Roma and Lazio taunt one another across 
our neighborhood bar. I don't say much: My morning friends understand that I 
hail from a soccer-disadvantaged land. Truth is, though, I think it's funky to 
come from a country that can go to the moon but might never beat Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 What has fascinated me in USA '94 is less the game itself than the interplay 
of sport and place. A foreigner's game come home to America. 
</P>
<P>
 We've both learned from the summer encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 About size, for one thing. America is so big. Big cars, big cities, big 
people, big portions. It strikes me every time I come home. The sense of space 
and proportion is utterly different here than in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the foreign fans I talked to commented on their own need to adapt to 
impressive new dimensions. A wholesome reset, too; an eye-opener for visitors 
who came braced for the glitzy, saccharin, dangerous America that Hollywood has 
foreshortened into a television tube. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the most cursory inspection of USA '94 might bring home to 
Americans the reality that bigger is not necessarily better. Hard to grasp, 
perhaps, while American football players bench press aircraft carriers and 
basketball centers endanger low-flying planes. But there is room in the world 
athletic jungle for cheetahs too. Foot wizards from Italy, Brazil, Bulgaria and 
half a dozen other Cup countries -- typically 5-6 and 155 pounds soaking wet -- 
are true international giants, Jakarta to Joburg to Jutland. 
</P>
<P>
 Did American space, all those lovely green fields stretching till morning, 
influence Cup play? Experts will tell you better, but I saw a more open, 
buoyant and interesting soccer this year than I did in Italia '90. From the 
press box at least, it looked like more fun for players and fans alike. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurs to me that in its fullness America has also given soccer refreshing 
space for the psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 I first went to a big soccer game on a long-ago Sunday as an exchange student 
in Buenos Aires. What I remember best were the mounted riot police resolutely 
separating the blue and yellows from the red and whites. At the 1990 Cup, I 
covered riots in Sardinia started by hooligan British fans; violence is no 
stranger to international soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 With that as preface, I was nonplussed at my first game here to be engulfed at 
Giants Stadium by intermingling hordes of Irish and Italian patriots -- 
raucous, loud, wrapped in their flags, partisan and proud. A recipe for tear 
gas, I thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. Inside the stadium, 77,000 people cheered their lungs out, Ireland won, 
and everybody went home peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later in Foxboro, I saw something even more extraordinary; a huge, 
human blue and white carpet filing noisily into a lovely suburban stadium. 
HE-LLAS, screamed the dark blues for Greece. AR-GEN-TINA, screamed the light 
blues parading alongside them. I have covered both countries, mind you, and 
never found many sanguine people in either. But that day, and in all the others 
to follow, hardly anybody at America's Cup confused sport and life. 
</P>
<P>
 The message of crowds cheering for 24 countries at fields around the country 
seems clear: The assertion of difference does not require hostility. For me, 
such reaffirmation of an old-fashioned American principle may be the most 
valuable World Cup postscript. For the United States, and for a world riveted 
to USA '94, and to surprising images of a country it knows too well -- and too 
little.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; ELLIOTT ALMOND; LOST IN NEW JERSEY, ONE FINDS THE 
WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, Elliott Almond is a sports investigative reporter for The 
Times. He covered nine games in four cities during the tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm lost. Hopelessly, unequivocally astray in the forests of central New 
Jersey. I'm with three Brazilian reporters looking for 22 Bulgarian soccer 
players and we have only a few hours left to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little chance we will find them. They are staying in Princeton, 
enjoying the groomed grounds of a famous Ivy League university. We're a bit 
north in a rental car, trying to meet our deadlines. We have come from Short 
Hills, N.J., where we spent the morning with the German soccer team. On the 
map, it looked simple to get to Princeton, but once we reached the forested 
hamlet of Watchung on Highway 531, I knew we were in trouble. I remained 
hopeful, considering my company. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving on this lovely, cloud-filled summer day was Jorge Rodriques of O Globo 
of Rio de Janeiro. You might have read recently about the samba and the 
carefree Brazilian spirit. This is not Jorge. He is as hard-driving as a Wall 
Street banker. I'm not sure he stops for Carnival, yet he talks endlessly about 
the virtues of his city. 
</P>
<P>
 About now, he seems to be overlooking the natural beauty of New Jersey as I 
banter about why they call it the Garden State. OK. He is angry. And 
frustrated. And as lost as the rest of us. 
</P>
<P>
 After driving around Rutgers University on College Farm Road ("You mean we 
need College Road at Princeton?"), we give up. 
</P>
<P>
 This was my World Cup. This is my life. Driving around New Jersey with angry 
Brazilians looking for wild Bulgarians. I had the privilege of discovering the 
world and rediscovering America during the last month. Just maybe that is what 
international sport is all about: the mingling of peoples and cultures in an 
effort to better understand each other. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an exotic monthlong journey during which I sometimes felt stranger than 
paradise, where the changing American landscape never ceased to amaze me. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the evening along the Esplanade of the Charles River listening to 
the Boston Pops perform the traditional Fourth of July show that seemed so 
different from every Fourth I had celebrated on the beach in California. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the time in a Dallas tapas bar when a man asked in the tiniest of 
drawls if I was leaving my table. At least that is what I think he asked. I 
could not quite understand the dialect. I left anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Rodriques and I had little choice but to become friends. Same goes for 
Noelly Ruzzio of Sao Paulo's major paper. Our newspapers exiled us to Dallas 
for much of the tournament because FIFA, soccer's world governing body, was 
centered there. Our job was to report on FIFA's machinations, which at times 
was a step above covering the Seal Beach sewer district meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as we tried, we were unable to grasp the essence of Dallas, whose 
gleaming downtown edifices rise out of the Texas wasteland like a surreal 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 While we read about America embracing futbol elsewhere, we had the feeling 
Dallas was sticking to football, and there was little Maradona, Romario or 
Hristo Stoitchkov could do about it. The venue operators tried to enlist some 
support when they asked Troy Aikman, the Dallas Cowboy quarterback, to attend 
one of the six soccer games held in the Cotton Bowl. Perhaps echoing the 
sentiments of his fellow Texans, Aikman respectfully declined. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to say the thousands who attended matches were bad fans. Dallas is 
mad about youth soccer, and a certain segment gave the event its full support. 
</P>
<P>
 But we never had the sense that something special was happening there. In the 
mad dash around the city each day, there were few signs of excitement. The 
town's touristy West End brought out the Argentine, Brazilian, Dutch and German 
fans when their teams played there, but it was more of a curiosity than a 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas two-stepped to its own country-and-western beat. And as we became 
intimate with the city, the more remote it seemed. The more distant America 
appeared. After spending five weeks in Europe before the World Cup, I expected 
to employ the comforts of home. 
</P>
<P>
 Quite the opposite occurred. The quarters of Paris were as comfortable as an 
old pillow. In Dallas I was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopelessly, unequivocally lost.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; HELENE ELLIOTT; HUMIDITY, MOSQUITOES: SHE LOVED 
IT 
</P>

By HELENE ELLIOTT, Helene Elliott covers the National Hockey League for The 
Times. She covered nine games in four cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For this I went to journalism school? 
</P>
<P>
 It was an hour before the Brazil-Sweden semifinal. My assignment was to gather 
interesting and newsworthy notes, so there I was in the parking lot of the Rose 
Bowl, interviewing a 10-foot tall chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you ask a 10-foot chicken: Why did you cross the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but I couldn't even do that. This chicken spoke only Portuguese and a 
little Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this was a memorable World Cup. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones have their Voodoo Tour. I had the humidity tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando, Fla., home of Disney World, Epcot Center and enough sodden, heavy air 
to soak the Sahara. Take a shower, dry off, go outside, and get so sticky that 
you want to jump into the shower again. 
</P>
<P>
 No sympathy from the office. One of my editors, who is from Orlando, listed 
the city's attractions. He would have gone to the dog track. Or jai alai. Me, I 
was dragging myself back to my room, drained, after each game and practice. And 
I hadn't been running for 90 minutes, as the players had. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, my editor said, how he wished he were there! 
</P>
<P>
 Risking instant unemployment I inquired sweetly, "If you liked it so much, why 
did you leave?" 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder I was stationed there long enough to qualify for residency. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 On to New Jersey. A notice in the hotel room warned guests that because the 
Meadowlands sports complex is built on what used to be swampland and some 
mosquitoes haven't yet gotten the news, insects still invade the area in hordes 
each summer. Environmental regulations prohibit spraying them into oblivion, so 
be prepared to scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 What an impression that must have made on foreign visitors. Welcome to our 
country, and by the way, you're gonna need an ocean of calamine lotion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This was a month of moments, not of days. 
</P>
<P>
 Of moments when I wondered if anyone was reading what we produced, of moments 
-- principally after diving into the mixed zone -- that I wished I had listened 
to my mother and gone into a different line of work. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were moments of exquisite tension, of glorious games settled by one 
goal or resolved by penalty kicks. I had covered soccer before and have seen 
enough leagues fold to fill a bowl of alphabet soup -- remember the NASL and 
MISL? -- yet I had forgotten how wonderful soccer can be. 
</P>
<P>
 The quickness of the Mexican forwards was marvelous to watch. The skills of 
the Dutch were dazzling. Bebeto and Romario were mesmerizing. Belgian 
goalkeeper Michel Preud'homme was an acrobat. I can replay dozens of goals in 
my mind and times when defenders headed balls off the goal line, never losing 
my awe of the skills those feats required. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lasting memories are of the people I encountered along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the fans. They didn't need cheerleaders to hold their interest, or 
scoreboards telling them when to clap and what to chant. They entertained 
themselves in the stands by forming makeshift bands, playing an astonishing 
variety of songs. They brought signs honoring their local pub, their home club 
or each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish fans danced with Dutch fans, who got along fine with Belgian fans, who 
admired the Mexican fans' exuberance. It was a huge and happy party with no 
dress code and no language barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 I can't forget feeling humbled by the European players' ease in speaking three 
or four languages -- or the triumph I felt at connecting with one player, whose 
language I didn't speak and who spoke no English, through French and bits of 
Spanish and hand gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 I will remember seeing old NASL friends like Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat, who 
played for the Chicago Sting when I covered that team for the Chicago 
Sun-Times. Of hearing him say, "You haven't changed," and wishing I could say 
the same about him, except he had a lot less hair and a lot more pounds around 
his midsection. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, are the people whose names I didn't know, all the people who filled 
stadiums and made the tournament a box-office success, and those who worked for 
the organizing committee and made the tournament run smoothly. I rooted for no 
particular team, but on some level, I wanted this to be a success, to show the 
world that Americans aren't soccer heathens. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we succeeded. I know we gained the attention, however briefly, of 
those who scoffed at soccer before the World Cup began. It's not the games that 
matter, it's the people who play them. Sometimes, we lose that in a sea of 
statistics. Drama is universal, whether in baseball, hockey, football or 
soccer. It's an athlete challenged by an adversary of equal or better skill. It 
was a great show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we've discovered -- or rediscovered -- the beauty of the game, it's 
over. There's no league to follow, and if Major League Soccer ever gets off the 
ground, it won't feature the caliber of players we've just seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody know a place to catch some Italian League games?

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; RANDY HARVEY; LESSON LEARNED IN THE AMERICAN WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, Randy Harvey covers the Olympic movement for The Times. He 
covered 12 games in four cities during the tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am at the bar in a Los Angeles restaurant, waiting for a table, when an 
Englishman sits on the stool next to me and begins discussing the World Cup 
with the bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 The bartender says he is not sure soccer will become successful in the United 
States because of the competition from sports that he believes offer more 
action, such as football, basketball and ice hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally," the Englishman says, coming as close to a harumph as I have ever 
heard. "Americans have the attention span of gnats." 
</P>
<P>
 I consider challenging him. I, an American, have as long an attention span as 
some Brits. Prince Charles, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I decide to count to 10. 
</P>
<P>
 One, two, three, four, five, six. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Where were we? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Americans. After one month of playing host to the world, I am more than a 
little tired of hearing foreigners tell us who Americans are. The only thing I 
am more tired of is hearing Americans tell us who Americans are. They ought to 
know better. 
</P>
<P>
 I am talking primarily about some of my colleagues in the media, those who 
informed us before the World Cup that soccer would never capture the hearts and 
souls of Americans because Americans like a lot of scoring, because Americans 
don't like sports that require the ball to be advanced by kicking instead of 
throwing, because Americans need sports with commercials for their beer and 
bathroom breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 So, I ask them, if Americans don't like soccer, who were those 91,000 people 
who went to the Rose Bowl to see the United States play Mexico the weekend 
before the World Cup? 
</P>
<P>
 It might be true that most of them have Spanish for a first language. It is 
true that most of them were cheering for Mexico. But it also is true that 
virtually all of them are Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people did not drive from Mexico," U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic said 
that day. "These people are from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 I know an American from Sweden. I've never known him to have an interest in 
sports, although I recall we did discuss Bjorn Borg once. If he asked me for 
suggestions regarding his splendid New Year's Night parties, the only one I 
would have is that he occasionally turn on the Orange Bowl so I could get the 
score. But I doubt he's ever heard of the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 During Sweden's World Cup games, however, he amazed his friends and family by 
revealing that he had roots in fandom. They remarked upon this one afternoon 
during lunch while he ignored them to watch a game on television. "You can't 
understand," he said. "Soccer takes me back to my childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 I know an American from Greece. He knew too much about soccer to tie his 
emotions to the Greeks, predicting all along that they would be as miserable as 
they were. Pulling for Romania and Bulgaria, he might have been the only person 
in the United States who was disappointed when it was determined that they 
would not meet for the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 I know an American from South Africa. The only sport he likes more than soccer 
is cricket. Now, Mr. Englishman, there is a sport that tests my attention span. 
My friend also likes basketball and baseball. But he is having difficulty 
explaining the all-too-frequent fights among the players in those sports to his 
young son. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there is fan violence in soccer, as deplorable as it is, I at least can 
explain that to him," he says. "The fans have been drinking too much or they 
are too passionate about their team or they are looking for trouble. But it is 
harder for him to understand why players fight. What kind of message about 
sportsmanship are they sending to our children?" 
</P>
<P>
 I known an American from El Salvador, a country that once went to war with 
Honduras when a border dispute accelerated after a soccer game. She watched 
World Cup games on television with her husband. They pulled for the United 
States until it was eliminated, then switched their allegiances to Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not Mexico?" I asked her one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," she said, "many of the Mexicans I know become arrogant when their 
team wins. They look down on the Salvadorans and the Guatemalans. I don't even 
like to go out of the house when Mexico wins." 
</P>
<P>
 I know an American from Italy. He owns a restaurant, which he closed each time 
his beloved Azzurri played on television so that he could suffer and smoke in 
solitude. He wouldn't take phone calls, wouldn't take deliveries, wouldn't go 
to the door unless it was a policeman knocking. When one did one afternoon, my 
friend figured he was about to be ordered to turn down the volume. No, the 
policeman said, he just wanted to know the score. 
</P>
<P>
 This country where we Americans live, it's a big tent.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / MEMORIES; JOHN CHERWA; RELUCTANT AT FIRST TO EMBRACE GAME, 
IN THE END WE COULDN'T GET ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHERWA, John Cherwa is the Times deputy sports editor. He coordinated 
The Times coverage of the tournament. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's very difficult to determine the ingredients that can turn a big event 
into an unqualified success. It's often easier to figure out at what point the 
event has made it. 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of the people who were responsible for the planning, 
prose, pictures and production of The Times coverage of this World Cup, that 
moment is very clear. 
</P>
<P>
 It involves Steve Horn, whose creative headlines have been a signature for 
this sports section for several years. Steve is a meat and potatoes kind of 
editor. Baseball, football, basketball, golf, and maybe, on a slow day, hockey. 
He tolerates the other sports. On June 16, soccer was one of those sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight days later, Steve was angry, very unlike him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," he said with bite. "Tomorrow, no one has the Saudi 
Arabia-Morocco game on live. Not Univision. Not ESPN. I can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that point it became clear that this monthlong soccer tournament had 
made it with the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 These pages are filled with the memories and impressions of writers who saw 
the games in person. This story is the perspective of one who never saw a 
minute in person, but like most of you, experienced the passion and drama of 
World Cup '94 through television and talking to people who were there. 
</P>
<P>
 Most will remember this tournament for two events, each diametrically opposed 
in the emotion it evoked but connected through the cruelest of fates. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. victory over Colombia was astonishing, and even the most cynical 
observers couldn't help but get caught up in the jingoistic fervor. It was as 
if the tournament was giving America a taste of what the rest of the world 
experiences when it comes to soccer. Much of the passion that would normally be 
there for a seventh game of an NBA final wasn't there that day. There was 
something else, something special that was happening. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling flattened when the United States lost to Romania, 1-0, in a game 
that was a reflection of all the things that are wrong with soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Saturday, July 2, the day that sports lost all perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Andres Escobar, the Colombian player whose gaffe against the United States 
cost his team the game, was dead. He was killed by men who lost a considerable 
amount of money betting on the game. As each bullet crashed into his body, the 
killers yelled, "Goal, goal." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some things about life that can't be explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Life changed a lot during the past month. The daily trip to the Redwood 
restaurant for lunch continued only because the owner took the keno games off 
the television so we could watch the soccer games. Actually, he would have done 
that anyway because we weren't the only ones asking. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was Univision. As the tournament progressed, Univision was the 
only acceptable television option when watching the World Cup. Andres Cantor, 
on the strength of his "goal" calls, became a cult hero. Whenever a goal was 
scored, television sets in the newsroom of The Times were turned up until the 
resounding call would echo off the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his calls were recorded and placed in the sound program of the main 
sports layout terminal, so whenever a soccer fix was needed it could be taken 
care of with two clicks on the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The names Romario, Baggio and Klinsmann were heard more often than Piazza, 
Hershiser and Langston. Suddenly, the sports department was filled with a group 
of soccer experts. Surprising when you consider most working on this project 
got their first real exposure to the sport six weeks ago when Sigi Schmid, a 
U.S. assistant coach, gave a talk to the sports staff that made the sport much 
more understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 One editor stumbled onto a football conversation about the Chicago Bears camp 
but misunderstood the words and started talking about the relative strengths 
and weaknesses of Netherlands striker Dennis Bergkamp. As always, football was 
abandoned and soccer became the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the readers of The Times are glad the World Cup is over. They want 
their sports section turned back to the sports they are used to. Undoubtedly, 
if you've read this far, to the last part of the last page of the last special 
report, you are not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers are not supposed to talk about their people. It's in bad taste. And 
besides, who really cares? But, one month, millions of words and nine special 
reports later, we ask for your indulgence. A few names need to appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Times sports editor Bill Dwyre built an excellent infrastructure from which to 
start. And special mention has to go to Dave Morgan, whose brilliant layout 
designs are exceeded only by his capacity for work. Others who have been the 
foundation to this project are, in no particular order, Mike James, Emilio 
Garcia-Ruiz, Van Nightingale, Jim Rhode, Jim Hodges, Rod Millie, Dave Moylan, 
Dave Montesino and Fred Sweets. There's also the aforementioned Steve Horn, 
who's already looking forward to France '98.
