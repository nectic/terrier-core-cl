LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: ANSWERING CALL OF WILD -- FOR SOME, BUT NOT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a native Southern Californian and not being a lover of the Great 
Outdoors is a condition a person probably shouldn't talk about. Like wearing a 
leather coat and carrying veal scaloppine to the anti-vivisectionists' potluck 
dinner, it makes one vulnerable to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 But the truth is, I think it's pretty dangerous outside. Think about it. 
Infestations of flying, swarming and bloodsucking insects that sting, bite and 
go to battle with you over your burger. Stones that cut your feet. Plants that 
fight for space with an amazing array of weaponry: poisonous berries, thorns, 
thistles and those really irritating things that stick to ankles and socks. 
Then there are scratching cats, biting dogs and the occasional skunk -- do I 
even need to get into that? And I haven't even left my yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I talk to my hiking, biking and rock-climbing friends, who are always 
encouraging me to join them on their weekend forays. Judging by their 
adventures, it sounds like a blast: We can all get dehydrated, break our legs 
or commune with the local flora (poison oak) and fauna (rattlesnakes). "Yeah, 
love to," I say, "but unfortunately I hear the call of my VCR." 
</P>
<P>
 Then we have Ken McAlpine, the intrepid free-lancer who, in the name of having 
something to write about, is generally on some sort of open-air suicide 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 McAlpine has done some harebrained stunts -- he's competed in long-distance 
ocean swims, gotten into the ring with professional martial artists and run 
through the jungles of Malaysia. But for this week's Centerpiece story, he and 
his wife Kathy went on Mission Impossible: They camped with Cullin, their 
18-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done some nutty things, there is no doubt about it, but I think I was 
more nervous about this trip with Cullin than I have ever been on any other 
assignment," McAlpine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though a mile swim in a freezing ocean or a run through a jungle is 
dangerous, there is an X factor -- you pretty much know what the dangers are 
and you only have yourself to worry about. But with a small child, you never 
really know what to expect, which makes you feel vulnerable all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 So how does going one-on-one with a tireless toddler compare with going into 
the ring with a martial artist? 
</P>
<P>
 "Faced with the choice of being punched by the world shoot-fighting champion 
or spending two days following Cullin around a campsite, I might actually 
choose to step back in the ring," said McAlpine, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 So I guess this means that Cullin will have to wait some time -- perhaps until 
college or grad school -- before he again is allowed to hear the call of the 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
 "In truth," McAlpine said, "it was a fantastic experience, and I look forward 
to doing it again. But, then, look at the sort of things I've done. Mine is not 
a rational mind."

SOUNDS: OXNARD-BASED COMPOSER GIVEN LOCAL AFFIRMATION; VENTURA COUNTY SYMPHONY 
WILL BEGIN SEASON WITH MIGUEL DEL AGUILA'S 'CONGA,' WHICH IT COMMISSIONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Miguel del Aguila, the Oxnard-based and increasingly internationally 
renowned composer, this autumn is shaping up to be the season of the conga. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Ventura County Symphony hits the stage of the Oxnard Civic Auditorium 
on Saturday to kick off its 33rd season, it will be to the tune of "Conga," a 
premiere of del Aguila's. His association with the symphony began when his 
undulant and somewhat subversive "Toccata" was performed last February. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Conga" differs in that it came into being as a commission from the 
symphony, with funding from the city of Ventura Office of Cultural Affairs. The 
commission is a case of local affirmation for a gifted composer, born in 
Uruguay in 1957, trained in San Francisco and Vienna and deserving of wider 
recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon last week, del Aguila had just returned from New York City, 
where a companion variation on the piece, entitled "Conga Line in Hell," was 
performed by the Juilliard Ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The composer was reeling from the warm glow of a New York Times review, which 
referred to the piece as a "delicious send-up of minimalism . . . . Mr. 
Aguila's deft tribute to the conga rhythms was in line with its parodies of 
Latin American pop styles delicious and never overripe." 
</P>
<P>
 Because his music often derives from and sometimes deconstructs rhythmic 
pulses, del Aguila tends to be roped into the minimalist corral. But there is 
more to the story. "The problem is, the rhythmic pulse is a minimalist thing, 
because you are repeating it. In that sense, all folk music is minimalist. 
That's why people put me in that drawer." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Aguila, an accomplished pianist as well as a composer, will play the piano 
with the orchestra on the piece. On this day, he was at home "practicing like 
crazy, because I've been writing music for the past two months." 
</P>
<P>
 In the work, he explained, "the piano is not a soloist, but serves the same 
function as a harpsichord in a baroque orchestra, or the piano in a Latin band 
-- the metronome for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 As might be deduced from the title, "Conga" is hardly a conventional classical 
work, but one that freely stitches together Latin American and European 
classical music. Del Aguila is no stranger to eclecticism at the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everytime people have tried to keep influences apart, the culture always 
suffers. I believe in bringing disparate things together. I must suffer from 
multiple split personality," he said laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many parts of myself, that very often I cannot bring them out at 
the same time. I think that's part of the biggest fun of composing, to bring 
things together that don't belong together necessarily -- to bring them 
together and make them sound logical." 
</P>
<P>
 A composer of demanding standards, del Aguila was impressed with the Juilliard 
ensemble. "That was the first time I didn't leave depressed from a first 
rehearsal. Nobody can count my music. They always count like crazy, and it 
looks like people counting desperately." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Aguila believes that the education of classical musicians often steers 
away from non-traditional rhythms and new stylistic blends he tends to favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Training is directed more toward harmonic development and melodic beauty and 
nice sound, and interpretation -- to interpret, for the millionth time, 
something in a better, nicer way." 
</P>
<P>
 He commented that "Conga" "started with a visual idea. I saw this image of 
souls dancing in hell, in a conga line going through the fire. Then I started 
hearing the music. Then I associated that with the famous story of hell with 
Paolo and Francesca, from Dante," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music started coming by itself. It starts with an introduction to hell 
and then the conga rhythm starts, which runs throughout the whole piece. 
Sometimes it gets distorted into different patterns, like a 13/16 pattern. 
There is a middle section which is very sensuous, as they relive how much fun 
they had before they got there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle section reverts to the rhythm, and, of course, like everything in 
my music, they start dancing and everything goes out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Control -- and the surrender thereof -- often plays integrally in del Aguila's 
sense of dramatic development, as in the increasingly chaotic "Toccata." "All 
my music is always out of control," del Aguila shrugged, laughing. "That's my 
life. It always goes out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County will be privy to more of the composer's work when the Ojai 
Camarata performs a choral suite from his opera "Cuauhtemoc" at its Nov. 19 
season opener at the Ojai Presbyterian Church. It was a few years ago that del 
Aguila plunged into writing the magnum opus, on the subject of the last Aztec 
emperor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the most daring moves in my career," he said. "I don't regret 
it. I wrote it and got it out of my system. It would be great to see the 
premiere of it, but actually I'm the kind of composer who is dying to hear the 
premiere. I have heard it in my mind and it sounded very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always dream my music while I'm writing it and after I write it. Two days 
later, I always have a complete dream with the whole production. I know there 
is no reality that can get close to that, because it's played by perfect 
people. It's a dream performance." Details

along with music by Rachmaninoff and Mussorgsky.

NIGHT LIFE: CRITICAL SUCCESS STORY; SEATTLE-BASED BAND ROCKETED TO STARDOM WITH 
A PLATINUM RECORD AFTER BEING SIGNED BY MADONNA'S RECORDING COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's no justice, no one cares, nothing matters, there's no baseball, so why 
not hang ourselves now and beat the rush? Yet, good happens, too -- once in 
awhile. Something good happened to Candlebox, the Seattle band that headlines 
the venerable Ventura Theatre tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The band had barely painted their name on the drum set when they got signed to 
Maverick Records. That's Madonna's label. In no time, they were opening for the 
likes of Rush and Metallica. And the album continued to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, now almost every other band wants to kill these guys for their 
instant success. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Seattle area, yeah, some people are jealous of us," drummer Scott 
Mercado said during a recent phone interview. "I think it's safe to say that 
there are bands who have been at it longer than we have, but we were never part 
of the Seattle clique or scene, anyway. We haven't got much respect in the 
area, but other bands view it as an inspiration because if we can do it, so can 
they." 
</P>
<P>
 The band -- Kevin Martin (vocals), Peter Klett (guitar) Bardi Martin (bass) 
and Mercado -- became Candlebox in 1991. They sold everything they owned and 
bought studio time, which resulted in an eight-song demo tape. Right away, they 
had fans. EMI flew the band to L.A. for a showcase, but the band ended up 
signing with Maverick barely 11 months after they began. The self-titled album 
has just gone platinum and features the hit singles "You," "Change" and "Far 
Behind." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the last leg of this tour for the album -- three more months," 
Mercado said. "Then we're going to take a little break, and start on the next 
album probably around the end of winter. We're surprised that the album went 
gold, then more. . . . I bought a new truck, and now I don't have to worry 
about my phone being disconnected, but I do miss my own bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Candlebox plays hard rock with a little garage and a little grunge thrown in. 
Depending upon the critic, Candlebox is really just like Pearl Jam, Nirvana, 
Soundgarden, Extreme, Stone Temple Pilots or the Black Crowes. Mercado could 
care less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critics are kind of a joke. They're either frustrated musicians or debate 
team rejects," he said. "Most of them just write what other critics write. They 
can't get specific as to why they don't like a band. I read a review of the 
Stone Temple Pilots, about three pages long, a scathing review, but it was just 
pretty much other people's opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some places we're marketed as an alternative band, in other places as a 
rock band, and other times as a heavy metal band. What is alternative? 
Alternative used to mean music nobody listened to, but now everybody likes it. 
Basically, we're not affected by that stuff either way. Our music is hard rock, 
but it's not metal." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Mercado is the drummer, so what does he know? He's in the back and 
everybody else gets the girls while he gets to carry the stuff out to the van. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that's pretty much it, except now it's the guitar player who gets all 
the girls because the singer has a girlfriend now." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, since he is signed with Madonna's label maybe he'll at least get a 
chance to meet the Material Girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked to her on the phone once, then she came to one of our gigs in Miami 
with Metallica, but it was after we had been signed for a year," Mercado said. 
"She doesn't go out and sign bands -- she has other people do that for her. She 
just puts up the money." 
</P>
<P>
 So what advice does Mercado have for struggling musicians? 
</P>
<P>
 "I read a lot of stories about rock stars who are always whining and 
complaining, but I'll never complain -- we've worked too hard to get where we 
are," he said. "I'd say if you want to be a musician, find some people you're 
comfortable with that have chemistry, then rehearse, rehearse, rehearse and 
become a tight band." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Candlebox, Flaming Lips, Mother Tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura Theatre, 26 Chestnut St. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: $18.50. 
</P>

 * CALL: 648-1888.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: LARRY DEAN ALWAYS PROVING HE CAN GET HIS HOOKS INTO A TUNE; 
SINGER AND SONGWRITER BRINGS HIS DANCEABLE, TRADITIONAL MUSIC TO SIMI VALLEY 
CLUB TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tired of dancing to the same old canned Top-40 deejay tunes? Or just want to 
sit and listen to great country music and vocals? Well, hang onto your cowboy 
hats. There are plenty of opportunities across Ventura County this weekend to 
do both. 
</P>
<P>
 Get a head start tonight with Larry Dean and the Shooters at Cousin's Country 
Saloon, Simi Valley's popular nightspot. Similar in size and atmosphere to the 
Crazy Bull in Camarillo, Cousin's is an intimate club that accommodates line 
dancers and couples. But fans of couples-dancing will be in paradise with 
Dean's very danceable, traditional country music tonight through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's unusual is that Dean draws a club crowd even though more than 90% of 
his material is original. He's not a human jukebox for the line-dancing patrol. 
But the requests just keep coming. And Cousin's is the only place in Ventura 
County where the Canoga Park resident plays. So run, don't walk, to hear Dean's 
acoustic lead guitar and beautiful low tenor vocals backed by a tight band 
(Mickey Wells, pedal steel; Danny Cifalia, bass guitar; Brad Swanson, drums). 
</P>
<P>
 "I write music to match my voice -- traditional country with the '50s and '60s 
sound," said the Texas native. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984 Dean captured the California Country Music Assn.'s Song of the Year 
award. In 1990 two singles from his albums, "Thirty Years Ago Today" and 
"Outside Chance," both charted on Country Billboard, Radio and Records and 
Cashbox. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Outside Chance' " was the first song I ever sang on 'Nashville Now,' " Dean 
said of the TNN show now called "Music City Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean's experience as a staff writer for some Nashville publishing companies 
has helped him learn to write lyrics that are tender without becoming cliched 
or gooey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clever hooks -- that's kinda what we're supposed to do as a songwriter," he 
said. "But there's a fine mix between being clever and showing emotion. There's 
a lot of clever writers in Nashville. But so many times they leave out 
emotion." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no danger of that with Dean's tunes. "Barely Gettin' By," "Slowly, 
With Feeling," and "Are You Listening?" are ballads guaranteed to deliver 
romantic goose-bumps. "When I Drive Out of Sight" is a new, hot straight-ahead 
highway song. And the strong instrumental hook of "Angel Day," penned with 
"Rhinestone Cowboy" writer Larry Weiss, is very appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean's up-tempo shuffle, "Sometimes Love Ain't Enough," contains my 
favorite line: "She said, 'I'm gone. I'm outta here.' She slammed the door and 
she disappeared. She didn't take the car. She didn't take the bus. Couldn't 
take a plane -- that costs too much." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dance-aholics, including many members of Ventura's Country Lovers Western 
Dance Club, are still recovering from their pilgrimage to dance workshops in 
Pismo Beach and Bakersfield. When I saw Bonnie Sommerville on Sunday, she was 
still flushed from learning 17 new line dances in one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you didn't make it to Pismo or points beyond, you've got a second 
chance. Starting Friday, Ventura will become "Bakersfield-by-the Sea" for two 
nights and three days of dancing competitions and workshops featuring some of 
the region's best instructors at the first annual California Western Dance 
Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Deejay Vince Fiske, the organizer of the event, said there will be something 
for all dancers, from novice to advanced level. And package room rates are 
available at the Country Inn near the American Legion hall and the Elks Lodge 
-- sites of all the events, including two social dances Saturday evening with 
Shiloh and the Rhythm Rangers bands. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday night after attending the workshops, why not practice what you've 
learned at the Crazy Bull in Camarillo? Darlene O'Connell and the Dixie Flyers 
will be in town after opening last week for Nashville recording artist Radney 
Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon check out the duo "Sibling Rivalry" at Thunder Country 
radio's fund-raiser, "Save Our Bases." Next hit the Ventura Harbor Village for 
outdoor tunes with the Rhythm Rangers. Then follow 'em over to the Crazy Bull 
for an early dance lesson on family night and country rockin' on a rare Sunday 
night of live music. (See Two-Steppin' listing for details on all these events 
and more). Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHO: Larry Dean and the Shooters. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Cousin's Country Saloon, 2381 Tapo St., Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 8:30 p.m. tonight through Saturday; dance lessons 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: 522-2559. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Dean will also appear at Cousin's on Oct. 18 and 19, Nov. 8, 9 and 
17-19, Dec. 15-17 and 29-31.

CENTERPIECE: CAMPING WITH A TODDLER HAS ITS MOMENTS, BUT IT'S NO PICNIC; AN 
18-MONTH-OLD TAKES THE GREAT OUTDOORS IN HAPPY STRIDE, BUT HIS PARENTS FIND THE 
PACE, WELL, PUNISHING. 
</P>

<P>
 Over the past 18 months I have been told many things about small children, 
often by people who wouldn't recognize a tot if they drove down Sesame Street. 
When it comes to kids, everyone has foolproof advice -- which I find puzzling 
since no one can predict what a child will do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently this flood of wisdom became a torrent. My wife Kathy and I decided to 
take our 18-month-old son, Cullen, camping. The phone lines lit up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, you don't want to do that," said one friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it hurt less to have your eye teeth removed?" said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, this is a bold experiment," said a third. 
</P>
<P>
 Precisely the point. It's my opinion that truly harrowing adventures, searing 
tests of stamina and grit, are fast becoming a thing of the past. So one night, 
while we were eating dinner, I proposed that we go camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Camping?" Kathy paused. "With Cullen?" 
</P>
<P>
 After several years of marriage, it's not difficult to gauge spousal interest. 
I understood that my wife's enthusiasm was somewhat dampened by the knowledge 
that she would have to do most of the work. Before our marriage, Kathy had 
compiled a fair bit of outdoor experience, including backpacking trips into 
remote areas. My own wilderness training peaked when, as a Boy Scout, I learned 
how to eat minute steak that had been dropped in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen was seated in his high chair, daubing his face with a substance that 
had once been a banana. As he already makes most of the decisions in our house, 
I decided to ask him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cullen, would you like to go camping?" 
</P>
<P>
 He issued his answer firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone who has had an 18-month-old knows, I could have asked Cullen if he 
wanted to wallow in fudge and he would have responded in a like manner. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned to Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "See," I said. "Cullen wants to go." 
</P>
<P>
 As any outdoorsman knows, the first task of camping is deciding where to camp. 
There are numerous campsites in Ventura County. Having no idea what would be 
best for an 18-month-old, I called our friend Jim. During the course of his 
life he has been a Marine, a member of an elite cadre of firefighters and a 
parent, so he is familiar with risk and danger. When I told Jim what we were 
planning, he was enthusiastic. Camping with a toddler was a terrific idea, he 
said. He'd done it with his kids, though they were now grown. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take your baby and your little day pack and hike through the forest 
and sit under the trees and read and watch the clouds and the world go by," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious to me that Jim hadn't had an 18-month-old around the house in a 
long time. Nonetheless I respected his outdoor expertise. He talked for several 
minutes about some of his favorite campsites, empty places atop mountain ridges 
commanding beautiful sweeping views, places where you hike to burbling streams 
to get your water, places where you are alone with the wind and your thoughts. 
Places no one in their right mind would take an 18-month-old on his first 
camping trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim made some practical recommendations too. One of them was Wheeler Gorge 
Campground, about 15 miles outside of Ojai up California 33. We could drive 
right up to the campsite, Jim said. There was a creek there and lots of shady 
woods. There was also a ranger who lived there. Having a professional on 
24-hour call sounded comforting. Plus it absolved me of the awkward task of 
asking Jim to come along. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before hanging up, Jim suddenly had an alarming thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call the Forest Service and ask them about hunting season," he said. "I don't 
think it's going on right now, but you want to be safe." 
</P>
<P>
 When I called the Forest Service station in Ojai, I found out we would be 
camping during the last few weeks of deer-hunting season. The woman on the 
other end of the phone was perky and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't be a problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have hunters trooping through our campsite?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trooping through?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hunters, she explained patiently, are required to stay several hundred feet 
away from designated campsites. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not familiar with firearms, but a few hundred feet didn't sound like much 
of a buffer to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've never had any problems," I asked, "in terms of shooting campers?" 
</P>
<P>
 I was starting to feel silly. But I also believe all lines of questioning, 
especially those involving bullets, should be pursued to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman left the phone for a moment, then came back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just asked one of the rangers. He said no one has ever shot a camper." 
GATHERING THE GEAR 
</P>
<P>
 It's fortunate my wife and I don't own any firearms or we might have shot each 
other before we even left on our trip. The second task of camping is packing. 
At noon our house looked like an explosion at a sporting goods store. This was 
unfortunate as the car was already full. Cullen wandered among the piles, 
scouting out the most toxic items and then putting them in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way we're going to get all this stuff in," Kathy said. "I told you 
we need a bigger car." 
</P>
<P>
 What we really needed was a bus, but I refrained from saying so. I am a thrill 
seeker, but not a fool. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrived at Wheeler Gorge Campground shortly after 1:30 p.m., everyone 
was in a better mood. The campground was indeed beautiful. We found an 
expansive campsite overhung by a canopy of oaks. A stone's throw away, a creek 
burbled over rocks worn smooth as marbles. Cullen liked it. The instant his 
feet hit the ground he was off, his first chore to squat and roundly smear his 
face with dirt and the remains of a peanut butter sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Our campsite turned out to be ideal -- a shady, drive-in site cleared of brush 
and grass. This was not a matter of expertise on our part -- it was blind luck. 
I had planned on consulting with camping experts before our trip, but I never 
got around to it. 
</P>
<P>
 This was probably a good thing, because what they told me when I spoke with 
them later might have discouraged us altogether. Not that camping with an 
toddler is a bad idea. It's just that, done right, it entails slightly less 
forethought and substantially more equipment than a moon shot. In fact, 
National Park Service Ranger Bonnie Clarfield advised camping with a toddler 
only under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd recommend taking an 18-month-old only if you're experienced camping 
without them," Clarfield said. "Since your child's comfort is involved, you 
really need to know what you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes. Of course. What kind of oaf would wander off into the wilderness 
unprepared? 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy had a few concerns of her own. My wife revels in the outdoors. She is 
not, however, particularly keen on sharing the experience with its denizens. 
When the ranger stopped by our site to collect the camping fee ($12 for the 
night), Kathy had several questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are there bears here?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranger, a pleasant, weathered-looking fellow named Jim Peele, peered out 
at us from the cab of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bears?" He cocked an eyebrow. "This is a national park, it's not a zoo." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger Peele also assured us that rattlesnakes weren't a problem. By his 
reckoning, their presence in the campground had been sparse -- maybe five all 
summer -- though for a brief period their ranks had swelled considerably after 
nearby road construction demolished their dens. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty much all gone now," he said. "Haven't seen one for almost two 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 We watched him drive off. Kathy was un-appeased. 
</P>
<P>
 "My theory is that they're here all right," she said. "It's just that only 
five have been seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The wildest life in our campsite proved to be Cullen. Our son has loved the 
outdoors from the moment he was born. Until he discovered sugar, the only 
sure-fire means of consoling him was to step outside. Now that we were loose in 
the great outdoors on a semi-permanent basis, this was good news. But it had 
its drawbacks, too. By late afternoon we had covered every inch of the 
campground, most of it in small circles. 
</P>
<P>
 As adults we think in terms of a start and a finish, an unfortunate approach 
that denies us the joys that lay between. Not so with an toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen dropped stones in the creek. He bent to sweep his hands through the 
dirt. He veered off to swat foliage. He was supremely interested in an eclectic 
range of outdoor offerings, from the business of other campers to the abundant 
supply of animal scat, which, if we weren't quick enough, he fingered like some 
pygmy tracker. He would punctuate his discoveries with such astute observations 
as "der garr" and "gut de bof." 
</P>
<P>
 These ramblings filled Cullen with joy. They left us drained. At one point 
Kathy looked at me bleary-eyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't both be walking around following him like this," she said. "One 
of us should be sitting down." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the one thing both of us wanted more than anything, but neither one of 
us volunteered. To sit down meant missing out on the magic. 
</P>
<P>
 As we walked back to our campsite, the late afternoon sun slanted low, 
spreading shadows across the ground. I've always viewed twilight as a romantic 
time of day, a brief pause, the day's heated ardor past, the night's yet to 
come. We passed an attractive couple talking quietly at a picnic table. Two 
wine goblets stood on the table, reflecting the softening sun. Back at our 
campsite we used our picnic table to change Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening we received the one thing we wanted most, company. Our 
friends, the Wadsworths, are experienced campers, making them confident enough 
to join us for dinner. Actually they fixed dinner. On unpacking early that 
afternoon, we discovered that we had six grocery bags of food, but nothing to 
cook with. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole and Joe brought firewood, a stove, pots and pans, a table cloth, even a 
centerpiece -- a jar containing a pretty arrangement of marigolds. More 
important, they brought their 13-year-old son, Zeph, and their 7-year-old 
daughter, Morgan. The children immediately entertained Cullen, who by this 
point had reduced his parents to a state of animation resembling asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation turned woodsy. While I have no qualms about bears and 
rattlesnakes, there is an outdoor item I fear mightily: poison oak. Numerous 
times in the past I have been told how to identify this diabolical plant. The 
explainers generally imply that any idiot can find the stuff. I certainly can; 
I've had it more times than I care to admit. Given Cullen's gene pool and his 
proclivity for shrubbery, I was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 We took a short walk away to see if we could find some. We didn't see any, at 
least nothing we could clearly identify. Carole had an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just around the campsite," she said with sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner we had pasta, salad and bread. At least everyone else did. I filled 
my plate, then left it to chase Cullen who didn't seem particularly hungry, 
possibly because he'd already consumed fistfuls of dirt, nearly half a bag of 
Fig Newtons and the better part of an unattended mosquito-repellant coil. 
</P>
<P>
 He may have been distracted, too. Night had fallen. Bright stars filled the 
sky, buckets of silver-glitter tossed across a jet-black cloth. Cullen found 
this enthralling. To get a clearer look, we walked away from the fire. Joe, 
Zeph, Cullen and I stood in the road that looped through the campground, our 
heads turned up to the sky. Cullen rarely stands still. He did now. I could 
feel the light press of his tiny fingers clasped around my pinky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oooooooo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 We returned to the fire. I sat in a chair. Cullen wormed his way into my lap. 
There are few joys greater than a child wound down. He squirmed for a few 
minutes, then went still, his legs poking out over my knees. The quarter moon 
rested on the toe of his shoe. 
</P>
<P>
 We left early the next morning, after a short hike during which I suspect two 
of the three of us were thinking mostly about going home. It was a beautiful 
fall day, a bright sun and china blue sky causing the trees and hills to leap 
out front and center. But it was hard to appreciate it fully on a fitful 
night's sleep. Not that Cullen was tired. He had slept like a rock, spread 
across the one mattress we had been able to stuff in the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Under most circumstances, my wife is a beautiful woman. Now she looked 
haggard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to go home early," she said. "But how else is he going to sleep 
when it's time to take his noon nap?" 
</P>
<P>
 Both of us know Cullen can sleep through a typhoon. But we also knew it was 
imperative that he rest at home; if he didn't, his parents would be incoherent. 
</P>
<P>
 We left just before noon, Cullen wedged in the back seat, encased in a bubble 
of camping gear. Looking for confirmation of the weekend's success, we did what 
any parents would do. We prompted him to do what we wanted him to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bye," he said, lifting his only free arm to wave at our campsite. ASSESSING 
THE TRIP 
</P>
<P>
 How much of this will stick with our pint-sized John Muir? Hard to say, though 
probably more than we might suspect. A few days after we returned home I called 
Anita Garaway-Furtaw, a nice woman with a degree in child development. 
Garaway-Furtaw has worked with children for 25 years, and oversees the 
award-winning program at Lost Arrow Corp.'s Great Pacific Child Development 
Center in Ventura. She understands children. I suspect she understands parents, 
too, because she told me exactly what I wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think young children don't understand much, but the truth is 
they understand much more than we think they do," she said when I asked her 
what effect the camping trip might have had on Cullen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little children process information at a phenomenal rate. They're very, very 
sensory creatures. I can't think of any kind of environment where you can be 
more sensory than you can when you're camping." 
</P>
<P>
 That would explain the sand I am still finding in our car. 
</P>
<P>
 Garaway-Furtaw continued: 
</P>
<P>
 "When kids go camping they're exposed to a wide variety of sights and sounds 
and textures. All of that helps to expand their base of knowledge, and that's 
really good for them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then she told me a sweet story. When her son David was 3, his parents took him 
camping. An avid bug collector, David stumbled on a golden find -- a horde of 
squirmy caterpillars. Patiently, Garaway-Furtaw explained to her son that the 
caterpillars couldn't come home with them. Several months later, she opened a 
cabinet door under the bathroom sink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sixty beautiful butterflies flew out of the cabinet," she said. "It was one 
of the most magical experiences I ever had as a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 The other day I asked Cullen if he remembered camping. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine with me. Odds are, he'll never remember his adventure. But I'll never 
forget the warm press of my son's sleeping body, a sliver of moon balanced 
nonchalantly on the toe of one tiny shoe. 10 Tips for Kid Camping 
</P>
<P>
 Want to give camping with the kids a try? Want to make it a pleasant 
experience, too? A few words of advice from National Park Service Rangers Susan 
Ream-Hajdik and Bonnie Clarfield. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plan on car camping. With all the gear you will need for young children, 
backpacking into the wilderness is back-breaking -- not to mention virtually 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look at all the gear you need to cater to your little ones at home, then 
bring it all along. This might seem like overkill, until your child asks for a 
favorite blanket. Camping with young children is not a time when you just want 
to make do. "If your child is uncomfortable, you're not going to have a good 
trip," Clarfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring special treats your kids like to eat. Sure it's bribery, but this can 
also go a long way toward smoothing out potential calamities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring a tent with plenty of room to move. Bring a quality frame backpack to 
carry your child. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you are not capable of watching your children constantly, think about a 
child leash, a baby stroller or a playpen. Campgrounds are places where it's 
easy for small children to wander off and get into trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bring your own drinking water. Many campgrounds have running water, but it 
often runs through rusty pipes -- and if the water tastes funny your child 
might not drink it. Bring your child's favorite drink along, so you can be sure 
he or she will get liquids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Choose your campsite carefully. If possible, you'll want a shady site (to 
protect from sunburn) with no ground cover (which could house such undesirables 
as poison oak and rattlesnakes). Give the entire campground thoughtful 
consideration. If there's nothing but outhouses you might want to bring your 
child's familiar potty seat -- confronted with an outhouse children can balk, 
guaranteeing you a memorable trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your children are old enough, tell them to watch where they put their 
hands and feet when they walk. This will help them avoid poison oak, 
rattlesnakes, bees and other surprises. If you don't know ahead of time if your 
children are allergic to bee stings or insect bites, be sure to consult a 
doctor about carrying the appropriate medication. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set up all your gear before you leave to make sure you have everything and 
it's in working order. Better yet, do a complete dry run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before you camp for real, have a camp-out at home in your back yard," 
Clarfield said. "That way the kids will know what to expect and it won't be as 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 * Have fun. "Teach them about nature and how to take care of it," Ream-Hajdik 
said. "Go on walks. Pick up leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 That brings to mind one other essential camping item. 
</P>
<P>
 "For sure, bring the camcorder," Clarfield added. Who to Call

THEATER REVIEW; 'BELL, BOOK AND CANDLE' STILL ABLE TO CAST AN AMIABLE SPELL; 
THE TONE IS FROTHY, THE DIALOGUE WITTY IN A COMEDIC TALE OF MODERN-DAY WITCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The possibility of witches living in contemporary New York City formed the 
premise of John Van Druten's 1950 comedy "Bell, Book and Candle." While 
stylistically very much a product of its time, the play holds up quite nicely 
in a breezy production by the Oxnard-based Etc. theater company. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Hobson stars as Gillian Holroyd, the kind of with-it witch who'd 
later be immortalized by Elizabeth Montgomery in the TV series "Bewitched." She 
lives the single gal's life in a nice, leased apartment, with her daffy Aunt 
Queenie (Nita Fouhse) in residence upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Witches aren't able to fall in love -- in Van Druten's concept, at least -- 
but the presence of suave publishing executive Shep Henderson (Alan Price) as 
the building's new tenant stirs something in Gillian. There's only one problem: 
Shep and his longtime girlfriend plan to announce their engagement at a party 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Not above casting a spell or two, Gillian does some witchy things, all the 
while trying to keep Shep from finding out what's going on. Along for the ride 
are Gillian's prankish warlock brother, Nicky (Andrew Dunn), and a 
self-declared expert on witchcraft (Elmer Ferber) who doesn't realize that he's 
literally standing in the middle of a coven. 
</P>
<P>
 The play's tone is frothy, Van Druten's dialogue witty, and the cast's 
attempts at recreating the sort of atmosphere favored by the likes of William 
Powell and Myrna Loy are moderately convincing under Linda Hyde's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever decided to update the script with a cordless telephone and compact 
discs misjudged, though: The script still includes such telltale signs of its 
age as references to the Kinsey Report, the House Un-American Activities 
Committee and double-feature first-run movies. And we're asked to believe that 
a single woman in 1994 would maintain a full pitcher of martinis in her 
kitchen, just in case any visitors should drop by. While noticeable, the 
anachronisms aren't particularly distracting; just unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances at Friday's opening were fine, particularly considering that 
three of the players came in during the rehearsal period when originally 
announced actors dropped out for one reason or another. In addition to those 
already mentioned, the cast includes brief appearances by Camille Rodriguez 
and, as Gillian's familiar, Tabian Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing well into November, the play -- while not at all scary -- is 
appropriate to the Halloween season, and is certainly suitable for audiences 
from the teens up. Details

THEATER REVIEW; 10 YEARS LATER, 'HEART' IN BEAT WITH THE TIMES; LARRY KRAMER'S 
1984 POLEMIC ABOUT THE AIDS CRISIS IS WRY AND RELEVANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TODD EVERETT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the plays performed in local theaters, precious few are really about 
anything, and fewer still could be considered important in any immediate sense. 
One welcome exception is Larry Kramer's "The Normal Heart," a 1984 play that 
couldn't be more relevant a decade later. Its Ventura College run concludes 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 While as serious as death itself, "The Normal Heart" is also entertaining and 
not without a measure of wry humor. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, it's not so much a play as a polemic, born of Kramer's anger at the 
way the then-unfamiliar AIDS was spreading through New York City, unrecognized 
by the press, politicians, or medical establishment. Kramer's thesis is that 
AIDS went unrecognized for so long in great part because it was seen as "the 
gay disease." He sets "The Normal Heart" deep in the heart of New York's gay 
community, between 1981 and 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's protagonist (and, most likely, surrogate) is Ned Weeks (Art 
McDermott), a writer whose frustration at what he sees turns him into an 
activist. He meets and falls in love with Felix Turner (Christopher Colone), a 
New York Times fashion reporter, and eventually forms an activist group whose 
membership also includes banker Bruce Niles (Todd R. Garrett) and hospital 
administrator Tommy Boatwright (Jeffrey H. Britt). 
</P>
<P>
 Engaging in civil disobedience, writing threatening letters to the mayor and 
advocating warning gays against sex altogether, Weeks is shunned by the others, 
who find his conduct embarrassing and a potential threat to both their personal 
security and their movement. In the meantime, the corpses of AIDS victims are 
piling up at an increasing rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The other -- straight -- side is represented by Ned's sister, Barbara (Sarah 
P. Meaney), an attorney who's indifferent to her brother's situation; and Dr. 
Emma Bruckner (Susan Wiltfang), confined to a wheelchair as the result of 
childhood polio and symbolizing those few physicians who initially recognized 
and fought AIDS. Then as now, dealing with AIDS primarily consisted of warning 
against practices that seem to lead to the disease, and making life as 
comfortable as possible for those who succumb to it. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kramer confines his play to the effect of AIDS on homosexuals -- 
ignoring the dangers of unsanitary blood transfusions or dirty needles on drug 
users' syringes, for instance -- he portrays a broad cross-section of gays, 
from the stereotypically flamboyant Weeks and Boatwright to the more 
conservative Turner to the almost totally closeted Bruce Niles, a former Green 
Beret. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Kramer points out that AIDS is not a "gay disease," that 
heterosexuals are dying from it at a growing rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's message is important, of course, but "The Normal Heart" is no more a 
"gay play" than AIDS is a "gay disease." The play is the strongest drama seen 
in this area in some time, presented with conviction by a large cast under the 
direction of Ventura College's Judy Garay. 
</P>
<P>
 Weak points? There's some stilted line-reading (resulting in part from 
occasionally stilted dialogue), and the size of the college's theater causes 
everybody to shout too much of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least they can be heard, and the message is chillingly clear. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "The Normal Heart." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m.; closes Sunday at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura College Mainstage Theater, Loma Vista Road (west of Day 
Road), Ventura.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; A LOOK AT THE SECRETS BEHIND 'JURASSIC' SUCCESS; 
ANIMATOR PHIL TIPTETT WILL SHOW A VIDEO ABOUT THE MOVIE'S SPECIAL EFFECTS AFTER 
SCREENING OF THE BOX OFFICE HIT AT UC SANTA BARBARA.

 The UC Santa Barbara Arts and Lectures series begins a distinguished selection 
of fall films this week. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, maybe the blockbuster film "Jurassic Park" is more commercial than it is 
distinguished. But there's a plus. Academy Award-winning animator Phil Tiptett 
will present a video on how the special effects were created. The video will be 
shown after the main feature. Tiptett will also answer questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the films in the series you've probably seen before, but like 
"Belle Epoque," "Red Rock West" and "Schindler's List," they're good enough to 
see again. 
</P>
<P>
 All films start at 7 p.m. Tickets are $5 and available at the door. For more 
information call 893-3535. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Feeling like your circadian rhythms are upside down? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you want to watch a really weird film, the kind usually screened as the 
midnight feature. But you can't stay awake after 10 p.m., you say? Well the 
Riviera Theatre has the answer for the diurnal lover of cult films. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater last week launched its "Cult Classics" festival, all of them 
screening at the unlikely hour of 11 a.m. on Saturday. Imagine watching "Pink 
Flamingos" and exiting the theater into the cheery sunlight of a Santa Barbara 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 This week's feature is "The Loved One," starring Jonathan Winters and Rod 
Steiger. Riviera manager Terry Boyle calls it a movie with something to offend 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle said there are eight movies in the lineup. Still to come are 
"Deliverance"; "Repulsion," starring Catherine Deneuve in a Roman Polanski 
film; "The Producers," featuring the hit single "Springtime for Hitler" and, of 
course, the cult film of all cult films, David Lynch's "Eraserhead." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to have more theme nights," Boyle said. "Whether it's cult 
classics, films by the same director or films with the same star." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the topic of films with the same actor, here's an item for lovers of 
esoteric character actors. The Ojai Film Society is showing movies featuring 
Jim Broadbent over the next two Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's Jim Broadbent? 
</P>
<P>
 He played the sympathetic bartender in the "Crying Game." Check him out in 
"Widow's Peak" on Sunday and in "The Wedding Gift" on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows are 4:30 at the Ojai Playhouse.

EARTHWATCH: TURNING TRASH TO CASH VIA AN INDUSTRIAL PARK; IF THE PROJECT WORKS, 
IT CAN MAKE VENTURA COUNTY LOOK GOOD. IT'S ABOUT KEEPING JOBS AND RAW MATERIALS 
AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KAHLENBERG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 This week, neighbors of a planned Ventura Environmental Business Park on 
Victoria Avenue in east Ventura have been trooping over the 20-acre site to 
talk trash. The developer, Gold Coast Recycling Inc., has been taking pains to 
explain, via a series of breakfasts, brunches and tea-time gatherings, that an 
industrial park around a solid-waste sorting facility is not contrary to good 
environmental practice or good business practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceedings will begin Oct. 13 at the County Government Center to determine 
whether Gold Coast gets the required permits for its project to sort 1,500 tons 
of trash daily and to erect manufacturing and business facilities needed to 
turn the reusables into salable products. Whether the plan passes muster with 
the county or not, the overall business idea warrants serious consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 In this respect, Earthwatch joins the chorus of huzzahs from county, state and 
local elected officials, as well as business people. If the thing works, it can 
make Ventura County look good -- a pioneering place -- good for business and 
good at business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new concept, only being considered by a handful of places, (but) it 
makes a lot of sense," said Victoria Hand, manager of the recycling division of 
the Ventura County Solid Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the deal here? Simply put, it's about keeping raw materials and jobs at 
home rather than exporting them to other states or countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the Earthwatch report about Chinese junks heading for our county to 
carry away all our garbage? That particular scheme faltered, but if you were 
thinking the premise was far-fetched, you were right for only a little while. 
Timber and ore supplies are dwindling, and prices for virgin sources are 
soaring. The Wall Street Journal was down on the idea of recyclables for years 
but recently discovered -- and headlined -- that "Cities Couldn't Give Away 
Their Trash; Now They Get Top Dollar from Recyclers." 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. communities are seeing factories going up to handle desirable raw 
materials. The newsprint industry alone has lately plunked down hundreds of 
millions of dollars to build de-inking facilities for recycled papers. 
Purchasing agents for these plants now must range far and wide. So when you 
recycle this newspaper it's probably going to Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's OK for our national economy -- better than having the raw 
materials and jobs slip to the other side of the Pacific Rim. But a better 
idea, the environmental business park idea, is to keep these resources right in 
the community where they originated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Coast plans appear responsive to local conditions. For instance, they 
include a de-inking plant to produce office supplies from old office paper. 
Yes, newspaper will be processed at the East Ventura facility, but it will be 
turned into specialty building materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's going to buy products made from scrap? I recently went to Portland to 
see what the "Buy Recycled Business Alliance" was doing. Not many folks from 
the Birkenstock crowd were there. Lots of suits -- Fortune 500 types -- swarmed 
around looking at consumer products, industrial commodities and even 
high-fashion goods. It was just like any other ritzy trade show, except that 
everything on display was, so to speak, on its second time around. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T, McDonalds, American Airlines, Bell Atlantic, Home Depot, Johnson & 
Johnson are already heavy buyers. McDonalds alone spent $900 million in the 
last four years on recycled products and packaging for its restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside pickup of recyclables nationally has spread from 1,000 communities 
five years ago to 7,000 today, just as virgin materials are getting scarcer and 
recycling technology is getting cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "These conditions are not going to go away," said National Recycling Coalition 
President Mark Lichtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 This is reminiscent of the old days when a mine or timberland opened. Mills -- 
and jobs -- sprouted like mushrooms. Today's mines and forests are no longer in 
the wilderness but in the city. Which, in a neat twist of fate, is where you'll 
find the folks needing jobs. Details

ON THE ROAD: 'VETTE AFICIONADOS MAKE TREK TO THEIR OWN MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, Leonard Reed is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The look of the thing is singular, indelibly etched in place by the TV show 
"Route 66" and the weight of some near-religious '60s belief that it would 
deliver us from banal. The Corvette. America's only sports car. The 'Vette, if 
you truly understand. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 40 or so people in these parts who especially do. 
</P>
<P>
 They own 'Vettes and belong to the Ventura County Corvette Club, which does 
what most social clubs do: raise money for charities and hold fun activities 
for the membership. Fun activities here means that members celebrate and 
commiserate and otherwise swap stories, tools and sweat on matters relating to 
fuel injectors, suspension, the torsional rigidity of fiberglass bodies, 
torque-to-horsepower ratios and all manner of 'Vette minutiae. Fetishes are 
like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when it risks becoming nerdy, though, the club goes and does something 
dramatic. Ten of its members in five of its cars one Saturday met at Morris 
Chevrolet in Fillmore and, with 6 a.m. dew still on the hoods, pulled out in 
single file onto the 126 eastbound. Whooshing and arcing and accelerating 
through wet lemon orchards, these drivers were heading to the source, setting 
out on a pilgrimage that would land them at Mecca by today: The Corvette 
assembly plant and museum in Bowling Green, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 There they will see life-size mannequins of call-me-cool George Maharis, 
I'm-the-sane-one Martin Milner and a real 1961 'Vette in a re-created "Route 
66" scene. But that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum building, in homage to the car for which it is a memorial, has a 
free-form sculptural shape. Through winding rooms, it contains 50 'Vettes of 
every vintage, among them the '57 SS, the popular Sting Ray, the '63 split 
window coupe, the '78 Indianapolis pace car and the '92 'Vette that was the one 
millionth to roll off the production line. 
</P>
<P>
 On its 33-acre grounds are displays that cite the Corvette's development in 
racing and its design development from a gas-chugging behemoth, whose 
suspension was so stiff as to shake fillings loose, to the current 
Concorde-like cruiser whose 350-cubic-inch engine, in sixth gear at 75 m.p.h., 
barely is awake and consumes but one gallon of gas for every 26 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura contingent also will see the $600 brick they bought that helped 
build the museum. And, before departing Friday, they will stop at the museum's 
3,000-square-foot gift shop to ensure the purchase of Corvette icons. A decal 
here, a hat there: everywhere something Corvette. 
</P>
<P>
 It may all seem so over the top -- grown adults driving 4,000 round trip miles 
to see the history of what they're driving. But consider that on the museum's 
opening day one month ago, 4,000 Corvettes jammed into Bowling Green and more 
than 80,000 pilgrims paid to see the preserved American dream machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Corvette people are like that: fierce in their conviction that the Corvette, 
like the Harley-Davidson motorcycle, is a classic, a piece of machinery that 
couldn't have occurred anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Turse of Camarillo was driving her '77 coupe for this trek, with Abe 
Strozenberg of Simi Valley as a passenger (Abe's older-vintage 'Vette stayed 
home, because "it would need a gas station following it," he noted). Taking 
turns on lead position in the caravan were Sandy and Leonard Cardosa of Ventura 
in their '87 coupe, Phil and C. J. McPhetridge of Ventura in their '88 35th 
anniversary edition coupe, John and Dorothy Mimms of Oak View in their '90 
coupe and Bill and Nora Berger of Camarillo in their '91 coupe. 
</P>
<P>
 They had lunch in Needles on Saturday, hours after leaving Fillmore. Then it 
was daily destinations of Tucumcari, N.M.; McAlester, Okla.; Queen Wilhelmina, 
Ark.; Nashville, Tenn., and Bowling Green. Friday, commencing a southern route 
home, they'll hit Jackson, Miss.; Fort Worth, Tex.; Brownwood, Tex.; Carlsbad, 
N.M.; El Paso, Tex.; Benson, Ariz.; Phoenix; Palm Springs, and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Cardosa, who once drove a '61 Triumph TR-3, thought up this trip. She 
loves not only the Corvette's mystique but also its deep reserves of power. Of 
the Miata she test-drove not long ago, she said: "Oh, four-cylinder engines 
just don't cut it." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Corvette reality, few can turn back. That's what got this trip off the 
ground in the first place. Seeing where the dream is bolted together, coupled 
with a love of the open road, was enough for these people to sit behind the 
wheel for most of their vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sandy Cardosa puts it, "this trip is, well, great fun, because you just get 
in the car and drive."

JAUNTS; FOR A NEARBY CAMPING OUTING, HEAD FOR HILLS; THE NEWLY OPENED 624-ACRE 
SAGE RANCH PARK OFFERS SOMETHING FOR HIKERS, BICYCLISTS AND EQUESTRIANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a new place to camp, without leaving Ventura County: the Sage Ranch at 
the east end of the county in the rugged, rocky Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Opened in May, the 624-acre spread with its 10 campsites is owned and operated 
by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which spent $4.2 million to acquire 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But you don't have to be a camper to appreciate the place. For hikers, it has 
stunning views -- but more than that, it has rocks, lots of them. It's filled 
with sandstone outcroppings, some of them huge, that are spectacular in 
themselves and give the park a unique feel. 
</P>
<P>
 The rocks and scruffy chaparral-covered hills give the area a real Western 
look, just like something out of the movies. The ranch was in the Sage family 
since the 1940s. The orange and avocado trees they planted are still there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an important property," said Rorie Skei, an official with the 
conservancy. "It holds a strategic position in the cross-mountain wildlife 
corridor. And it has access to urban areas." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the urban areas are quite visible from the top of the property, which 
has a nearly 360-degree view, encompassing the ocean, Simi Valley and the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to the property is Rocketdyne's Santa Susana facility, where the 
company does rocket engine testing and other research. If you take a two-mile 
loop trail around the perimeter of the ranch, you can't miss it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers can take a walk led by anthropologist Tom Maxwell from 2 to 5 p.m. Oct. 
16. He will follow the loop trail, which is actually a dirt road starting at 
the base parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The park only has one trail now, which is also open to bicyclists and 
equestrians, but more are planned, Skei said. The campsites, in a secluded oak 
grove high on the property, are for tents only. Water and a chemical toilet are 
nearby. The cost per night is $10. Camping is allowed only on Friday and 
Saturday nights. Reservations are accepted but not required. 
</P>
<P>
 The spacious 4,000-square-foot home that the Sage family built on top of the 
property is off limits, except for a pay telephone outside. A ranger lives 
there, but eventually the house may be turned into a conference center, Skei 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to the ranch is a little tricky. It's located south of Simi Valley, on 
Black Canyon Road near Woolsey Canyon Road. From eastern Simi Valley, you can 
get to it via a two-mile stretch of Black Canyon Road or a three-mile stretch 
of Box Canyon Road, but both paved roads are narrow, windy and steep that might 
make some drivers nervous. The conservancy recommends a longer alternative 
route for Simi-area residents, following the Simi Valley Freeway east to 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard, then south. 
</P>
<P>
 From other parts of Ventura County, the best access is via the Ventura Freeway 
east to Valley Circle Boulevard, north to Woolsey Canyon Road and east 2.7 
miles to Black Canyon Road. This route, which takes you past Rocketdyne, is 
marked with signs to the ranch. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Docent-led hike at Sage Ranch park. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: 2 to 5 p.m. Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Sage Ranch is on Black Canyon Road near Woolsey Canyon Road in the 
Santa Susana Mountains south of Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For information about the park or to make camping reservations, call 
(818) 999-3753; for information about the hike, call (310) 456-5046.

SHOPTALK; FOR MEN WHO WATCH FOOTBALL AND WOMEN WHO LOVE THEM; JUST IN TIME FOR 
THE GRIDIRON SEASON, SOME TIPS ON WHERE TO BUY SOFT, SCENTED, FRILLY GIFTS.

 It might not be so easy to tell, what with the mention of bath beads, soaps, 
doilies and such, but what you are about to read is for guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Guys who like to watch football on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe they should acknowledge the women who let them do so every weekend. 
This column will provide tips on selecting gift items that say, "I love you and 
it's not even Valentine's Day" -- gift items that will leave that special woman 
feeling pampered and appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 And guys, remember, this is not a column on bribery. These items are not to be 
bought because you want to watch next weekend's games. These items are to be 
bought in thanks for getting to watch last weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
 You can find sweet, sentimental gifts in specialty stores, drug stores, gift 
shops and other locations. We visited three specialty shops -- Les Romantiques 
in Oxnard, Tottenham Court Ltd. in Ojai, and Eastland Stationers (a Hallmark 
shop), also in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was Tottenham Court, where we were overwhelmed by the selection 
of lovely merchandise for women. 
</P>
<P>
 First we checked out those dainty, decorative soaps shaped like teddy bears, 
angels, hearts, fish, turtles and the like. Each was priced at $1.25. Those 
same soaps at Les Romantiques were 35 cents, 75 cents and 80 cents, depending 
on size. The exception was an extra-large angel soap for $2. 
</P>
<P>
 Next we checked out the potpourri, fragrances of dried flower petals or spices 
mixed together. It's French, for one thing, so it's got to be romantic. What we 
were surprised to find -- probably because we've spent too many hours staring 
at the pigskin -- is the amazing variety of potpourri available. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tottenham Court we found a four-ounce bag of vanilla bean scent from 
Seasons Inc. going for $12.50. There was also a nice four-ounce Scarborough And 
Co. bag for $11. Or instead of buying the pre-made bag, the store also has 
sachet lace bags (for $2.50) that can be filled with either lavender or rosebud 
potpourri at $4.50 a scoop. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-ounce bag of Renaissance Inc. amber rose potpourri was selling for 
$9.95 at Eastland Stationers. And at Les Romantiques, a five-ounce bag of 
Bella's Secret Garden potpourri was $12.50. Scoops of cinnamon, gardenia, peach 
and other scents were $3, with sachets going for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Next on our shopping list was bath beads. We've always been interested in the 
quantity of designs and colors available. Beads shaped like hearts, dolphins 
and stars, in purple, blue, red and gold, were 40 cents each at Tottenham 
Court. Comparable beads were also 40 cents at Les Romantiques and 25 cents at 
Eastland Stationers. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to go the way of fabric, lace doilies are a sentimental and 
attractive option. Les Romantiques had them ranging from $4.50 to $7.50. 
Tottenham Court had them priced at $2 for the simpler three-incher, $4 for the 
six-incher and up to $42.50 for the more intricately designed versions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were some of the basic, common items. For more of a flare, here are some 
other samplings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tottenham Court, there was an attractive cranberry-colored vase, about four 
inches tall, for $18.50; burnished rosebud-pattern soap dishes made in England, 
ranging from $8.50 to $15; a glass jewelry box with an ornate silver 
heart-shaped top for $16.50, and a small, burnished picture frame for $9.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastland Stationers had an English Garden Fragrance Basket (with two ounces of 
potpourri, two scented candles, a silk flower and a sachet) for $7.95; a 
heart-shaped white ceramic jewelry box with a pastel floral bouquet design for 
$4.95, and a shell-shaped crystal perfume bottle with silver-plated stopper for 
$4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Les Romantiques, there was a soap dish shaped like an old-fashioned 
bathtub -- complete with knobs -- for $13.50; scented candles in glass with 
gold edging and wrapped in gold netting for $15.50; and an array of attractive 
aromatic bars of soap.

 Now for you guys thinking of giving up football just so you don't have to deal 
with this mushy stuff, Les Romantiques also sells pre-wrapped, 
could-be-anything "surprise packages" for $5.50. If you don't know what's 
inside, that special woman in your life can't blame you if it's wrong.

FASHION; JOB SETBACK BRINGS OUT A DESIGNING NATURE; WHEN A PROSPECTIVE CAREER 
AS A FIRE INSPECTOR FIZZLES, LAURA SPLAWN BEGINS CREATING UNIQUE DRESSES. 
</P>

<P>
 There is art, and there's fashion. And, sometimes, although seldom, there is 
fashionable art. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a story of one of those times, and of Laura Splawn, who always meant 
to do the sensible thing in life, until destiny took a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Splawn's goal was to become a county fire inspector, and she was nearly there. 
It's not the aim you expect from an artist, but she didn't know she was an 
artist at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up left-handed and red-headed, and I've been different all my life," 
the designer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Carr was to have been named Autumn when she was born in Oxnard 40 years 
ago, but the attending doctor talked her mother out of the notion. She grew up 
on a small ranch in Oak View, where she plowed fields, built fences and 
generally shunned dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school she went to work as a ranch hand, then entered the Air Force 
and studied accounting. She married Phil, a facilities manager at Point Mugu, 
and worked her way up to office manager for the county Fire Department. When 
her son neared the age of independence, she took on night school to gain her 
career goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy schedule wasn't a problem. She was a "Type A" person who thrived on 
stimulation. ("Actually, I was a Type Double A," Splawn will say.) 
</P>
<P>
 One day, three credits short of certification, the would-be inspector hefted 
some boxes in her office and suffered three herniated discs in her back. Her 
career ended and life slowed to a crawl. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming a "Type B" is not something that A's do well. They brood over 
immobility and look upon life in the slow lane as futile. Still unemployed two 
years after her injury, Splawn, who had gradually gone to a Size 14, took her 
Size 8 wardrobe and cut it into pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 That was how it all began. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrated woman took up the ragged pieces of fabric and sewed some into a 
collage. She shaped the result into a dress. Then, having no one to pin up a 
straight hem, she made an irregular handkerchief border instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like to be exact," Splawn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The finished dress was a flowing mosaic, like nothing she had seen. Of course, 
friends wanted a work of art like it. Of course, they urged her to market the 
clothes, and finally she put some in a friend's garden store. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sold like crazy," said Splawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months ago came the opportunity to open a shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rent's more than our mortgage," said the owner of Autumn's Ease on 
Ventura's California Street. "We kept looking at the place. Then we realized I 
was turning 40, and the address was 40. That finished it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop, which began paying the rent in its first month, has a special 
vitality to it. The uncommon montages of silk, rayon, wool and lace in a 
breathless mix of colors gives a strange impression: maybe after hours the 
clothes come to life, like so many Velveteen Rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I start out gathering materials I think go together," Splawn said of the 
creative process. "When I think I have enough for a dress, I picture what style 
it would work best in, and what size. Sometimes I think, 'No, a skirt and 
blouse.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the colorful garments are in large sizes. "(Larger) women can find 
something they feel pretty in; it hides parts that they don't want showing," 
the designer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roses are a repeating motif. One dress has eight fabrics, seven of which are 
various rose prints. It has three pockets at random locations, and is like all 
of the pieces -- unique. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much she likes a dress, the designer doesn't copy it exactly, 
and none is made to order. She tried custom work; the creative process was 
thwarted. Her instinct serves her better -- except for a fixation on pink. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after she opened, a shopper looked carefully through all of the 
clothes, then protested, "Don't you have anything that doesn't have pink in 
it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I looked, and I didn't," said Splawn. "I'm having to stretch myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are more color blends, monochromatic and kaleidoscopic. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers vary as much as the clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had 18-year-olds to a woman who was probably 75," the shop owner said. 
"She bought a long-sleeve in navy blue. She was tickled to have it, but she 
said she wouldn't wear it to church. She was lovely." 
</P>
<P>
 The work still fascinates Splawn, and can be made to fit her new, slower pace. 
When she needs to rest, there is a cot ready in the back room. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is totally the opposite of what I was," she said, "I don't know what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The woman has a way with words as well as with fabrics: 
</P>
<P>
 "This is," she said, "like my soul's work."

THEATER REVIEW; MOVEMENT, SPEECH INSPIRE WORSHIP AT AUTOMOTIVE ALTAR; SET IN A 
CAR REPAIR SHOP, 'WRENCH' IS AN OFFBEAT TALE OF SIBLING CONFLICT, SHAMANISTIC 
RITUALS AND BAD COFFEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Wrench," a strikingly original performance piece presented by the UC Santa 
Barbara Theatre Artists Group and the Santa Barbara Contemporary Arts Forum, 
movement itself becomes as much a narrative device as dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not entirely surprising, given that director and co-creator James 
Donlon was, in the mid-1970s, head of movement and physical conditioning for 
the Clown College of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is surprising is how well gesture and speech synthesize as Donlon, a 
resident instructor at UC Santa Barbara, joins forces with Lit Moon Theatre 
Company's Matthew Tavianini and Joseph Velasco from El Teatro Campesino in this 
offbeat tale, set in an auto mechanic's shop, of sibling conflict, shamanistic 
rituals and bad coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is careful observation and precise thinking," mutters Jim (Donlon), 
the sullen chief mechanic for J & M Automotive, to his partner Matt 
(Tavianini). 
</P>
<P>
 His observation doubles as sound advice to the audience, for information is 
not doled out in generous linear helpings here -- it's up to us to piece 
together the multilayered relationships between the play's seemingly 
disconnected occurrences. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Jim is the reserved craftsman, Matt is the outgoing schmoozer who 
manages the shop, deals with customers, and drools at the prospect of landing 
that new Rapid Lube franchise. Only gradually do we realize from the tense 
undercurrent between them that they're brothers with a lifetime of emotional 
baggage locked in the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hovering around them is the eerie dual presence of a shaman warrior disguised 
as a would-be shop assistant (Velasco) with a knack for intuitively diagnosing 
car problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the clutter and grime of a marvelously detailed set, the multiple 
associations in the work's title play themselves out -- from physical tools to 
twisting movements to sudden emotional turns. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood careens from hilarious satire to compassionate slice-of-life to 
surreal edginess in staging that proves an improbable mix of The Three Stooges, 
Sam Shepard and David Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow it works. 
</P>
<P>
 While serviceable enough, the dialogue ends up taking a back seat to the 
imaginative use of movement. What lingers afterward are visual impressions -- 
Donlon's mimed journey through the innards of an automobile, Tavianini's 
transformation into an engine, and Velasco's limbs and torso painted with 
mystical symbols as he presides priest-like over the brothers' sacramental 
metamorphoses. 
</P>
<P>
 Innovative and entertaining, this little gem affords ample opportunity to 
worship at the automotive altar -- as all devout Southern Californians must do 
from time to time. Details

MUSIC; TRAGICALLY HIP INTENT ON SEEKING MORE FAME; WHILE TOURING THE STATES, 
THE HIT CANADIAN GROUP HOPES TO BUILD ON THEIR FAN BASE AND ATTRACT FOLKS TO 
THEIR SHOWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Tragically Hip got together for a good reason; at least it seemed like a 
good idea to a bunch of teen-agers 10 years ago. At that time in Kingston, 
their hometown in Ontario, Canada, all the clubs had nothing but cover bands. 
The Hip wanted to provide a suitable soundtrack to hang out with their friends 
and drink beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a decade and many beers later, the Hip, have just released their fourth 
album, "Day for Night." They'll be showcasing that and more when they play the 
Voodoo Lounge in Santa Barbara on Tuesday night. That's a long way from 
Belgium, according to phone interview victim Gordon Sinclair, who knows 
geography, beer, the Hip and the bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Belgium is the place for beer. It seems like every little town has 
their own brewery. Every one is different and a lot of them are great," said 
Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tragically Hip play the basic two guitar-powered rock, but with 
insightful, readily decipherable lyrics and one-of-a-kind vocals by Gordon 
Downie. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first album, everyone thought we were just like the Georgia 
Satellites; then after the second one, it was the Black Crowes; then after the 
third one, it was R.E.M. And since our new one came out the same week as 
R.E.M., we'll probably hear that one again," said Sinclair. "Playing, 
performing -- that's what this band is all about. I think we have our own 
original sound." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the two Gordons -- Sinclair and Downie, there are two 
guitarists, Paul Langlois and Bobby Baker, and Johnny Fay beats those drums. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that we've been playing together for years, plus we knew each 
other beforehand," said Sinclair. "Personality-wise, we've sort of grown up 
together. The greatest thing is actually playing the gig; the worst thing is 
sitting around between gigs." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hip have long been the biggest band in Canada, where they have won lots of 
awards and sold even more albums. But groups from north of the border, in 
addition to having reliable vehicles, have to try harder. They can't just 
cruise down to Hollywood every weekend for a showcase for the corporate slugs 
at Megazilla Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "Canada is a country bigger than the United States but with only 25 million 
people. The only way to make it as a band here is to take it on the road," said 
Sinclair. "Usually, you can't play and drive back home. You can drive six or 
eight hours between gigs and see nothing but trees and wheat fields. Those 
bands that can hang together, get tighter. Those that can't, explode. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of Canadian winter tours will make or break a band. We go out for 
six or eight months of the year, but usually no more than three weeks at a 
time. Four out of five of us are married and some of us have kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet being Big Time in Canada still hasn't given the band the avalanche of 
acclaim south of the border, despite their heavy touring schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really sell a lot in Canada, modestly so in Europe, but not so much in the 
States. The American thing is not based on selling tons of records. We're into 
building our fan base, and getting more people out to the shows," said 
Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tastemakers -- MTV and the Rolling Stone -- they decide what's going on, 
and so far, we don't fall into their star system. Anyway, you can still do very 
well and not be a household word in America." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, the band puts on a killer live show, makes great albums and generates 
favorable press. None of which guarantees anything in the music biz. The band 
was recently dropped by MCA, their record label since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're no longer on MCA in the States, but we're staying with MCA in Canada. 
But I can't really say too much right now; we've got lawyers working," said 
Sinclair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The album will be out in the States after the first of the year, but I'm not 
sure on which label. "Day for Night" is out up here in Canada. It's quite a bit 
different than the ones before, because it was written over a much longer 
period of time during the winter: long, gray and freezing cold -- even for 
Canada. So I think some of the winter slipped in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music has become a real group effort after four albums. Gordon (Downie) 
writes all the lyrics now, but everyone brings something of their own to every 
song. There's a lot of dynamics now. It's not just one person's vision."

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FANNING THE FLAMES FOR SZECHWAN LOVERS; THE 13-YEAR-OLD 
THOUSAND OAKS RESTAURANT HAS MASTERED THE CHINESE COOKING STYLE THAT CAN BE 
BOTH SPICY AND SUBTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORM CHANDLER FOX, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I've been told that before World War II, Szechwan cooking was almost unknown 
in China outside of the province. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when the Nationalist Chinese government moved to escape from the 
Japanese Army, it went to Chongqing in Szechwan Province, in the western part 
of the country. After the war, Chinese officials brought Szechwan cooks with 
them when they returned to cities like Nanjing and Shanghai. In 1949, many 
Szechwan chefs moved to Taiwan, when the Nationalist government fled the 
mainland and the Red Chinese Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Szechwan cooking is basically very hearty peasant food filled with the bold 
flavors of chiles, garlic, ginger and bean paste. After its culinary invasion 
into the United States in the '60s, Szechwan food became a craze. Nearly every 
Chinese restaurant worth its soy started adding hot peppers to various dishes 
to jump on the fiery bandwagon. Now that things have cooled off, we can enjoy 
this special cuisine at a fine regional restaurant -- Chen's Szechwan in 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-year-old restaurant is quite attractive, with soft lighting, turquoise 
and black chairs and booths, and etched glass dividers. The congenial servers 
will help you compose a memorable meal, and if you like things that ignite your 
palate, you only need to ask for your dish to be made with extra spice. For my 
taste, ice-cold beer and hot tea are the beverages of choice with this 
full-flavored food. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news at Chen's, which we last reviewed more than 2 1/2 years ago, is 
the assorted appetizer platter, with the unappetizing name of pu-pu tray, 
($7.95 for two), containing inedible rumaki, hard fried won-ton, nondescript 
egg roll, and overly breaded fried shrimp. The good news is that all subsequent 
dishes taste better after this disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest starting with the excellent hot and sour soup ($3.95 for two) filled 
with lots of black mushrooms, or the fine imperial soup ($5.25 for two), which 
is chock full of crab, shark's fin and sugar peas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Szechwan shrimp ($9.95) have a wine-like taste and come with finely diced 
water chestnuts. They are tasty, but surprisingly mild despite a menu notation 
of "hot and spicy." The Dynasty chicken ($7.95) has a fiery brown sauce that 
contrasts nicely with the lightly fried chicken chunks and broccoli spears. 
</P>
<P>
 For an absolutely knockout dish, try the Szechwan scallops ($10.95); the 
thinly-crusted mollusks stay crisp in a phenomenal garlic sauce. Another 
taste-bud tantalizer is the Chun-pi chicken ($7.25), where cubes of chicken 
breast are enlivened with toasted orange peel and chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the vegetable offerings, I especially like the green beans ($8.95) with 
minced pork in a fragrant sauce . . . braised bean curd with rich black 
mushrooms ($6.95) . . . and scallion-laden spicy eggplant ($6.95). An order of 
wok-tossed spinach and finely chopped garlic ($6.95) was too oily for my taste, 
but the refreshing, sweet asparagus sauteed with chicken ($8.95) in a mild 
garlic sauce is perfectly balanced and delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dishes are absolute musts. The succulent whole rock cod (a medium-sized 
fish averages $15.95) braised in a superb black bean sauce with minced 
scallion, ginger, and garlic. (Don't worry about the bones. Your server will 
fillet the fish with a flourish.) The other must for anyone who loves 
sophisticated Chinese cooking is the ginger duck ($9.95), a sublime combination 
of tea-smoked duck, carrots, celery, and thick slices of pungent baby ginger. 
</P>
<P>
 You may want to round out your meal with the stir fried tender beef and soft 
noodles ($5.95) or Chen's fried rice ($5.95), which is a harmonious blend of 
chicken, shrimp, beef, egg, carrots and peas among the rice grains. I ask for 
each dish to be served separately in succession to fully appreciate the 
individual nuances. But if you like your dishes served simultaneously, the 
staff changes dinner plates often to prevent the unintended swapping of 
flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's not on the menu, I commend the candied apples ($4.95) for 
dessert. Here, the fruit slices are dipped in hot caramel and then plunged into 
ice water, imparting a super-sweet brittle coating to the tart apples. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the best Chinese restaurants in our area, and with a few 
exceptions, the chefs should be congratulated for making these creative dishes 
less oily and more flavorful than most Szechwan restaurants in Southern 
California. Details

 Sixteen chefs were on hand at The Tower Club in Oxnard last week for the first 
dinner presentation of the new Central Coast Culinaire Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower Club Executive Chef Francois Millet and his staff prepared the elaborate 
four-course meal, while the other chefs, more than half of them from Ventura 
County, chatted with the guests -- explaining and critiquing the food, offering 
cooking advice and sharing their own cooking techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Millet's menu began with a parfait of yellow fin tuna with avocado mousse and 
grilled shitake mushrooms, followed by lasagna croustillante de grenouilles 
(frogs' legs) with black trumpet mushrooms and sauce cerfeuil . The main course 
consisted of crisp roasted Guinea hen with chanterelles and pearl onions, sweet 
peas puree and shallot sauce. And for dessert it was tropical fruit strudel 
with ginger orange sauce.

</P>
<P>
 In July, it was announced that Chef Gerard Thompson of the Stonehouse 
Restaurant in Montecito had been invited to prepare a five-course meal at New 
York's prestigious James Beard House. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming all went as planned, Thompson did his thing last night, and with a 
little help from a Ventura County food source. The bread for the evening was 
prepared by Thierry Liot, of the wholesale Les Bles D'Or Bakery in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Liot came over from France about four years ago and since then has hooked up 
with about 25 top restaurants in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, baking 
about 20 varieties of bread. 
</P>
<P>
 And for this special affair? "I am going to make a focaccia bread, a 
potato-sage bread and a farmer bread," he said last week. "The farmer bread is 
an old-fashioned bread with a mix of whole-wheat and white flour. It's very 
crunchy and very light too."

KID STUFF: A PHYSICAL EDUCATION; CHINESE MAGIC REVUE FOCUSES ON AMAZING

 No rabbits pop out of hats at the Chinese Magic Revue. No women disappear. And 
there are no floating crystal balls, not even a lousy card trick. 
</P>
<P>
 But you will find a different sort of magic -- the kind created by performers 
who invest a lifetime of long hours and strained muscles to perfect a physical 
art form that has been a part of their heritage for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled the "Original Acrobats of Taiwan," the 16-member touring company 
gives its first Orange County performances in several years Monday and Tuesday 
at 8 p.m. at the Irvine Barclay Theatre and Oct. 14 at McKinney Theatre at 
Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. The two-hour shows are recommended for all 
ages. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese Magic Revue, which has also been billed under such titles as the 
Magic Circus of Taiwan and the Chinese Golden Dragons of Taiwan, focuses more 
on acrobatics than it has in previous years, said Don Hughes, who co-produces 
the show with Ken Hai, a third-generation acrobat whose family established the 
troupe in Taiwan in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Martial-arts demonstrations were once a big draw -- including a bit in which a 
man crushed bricks on another performer's head with a sledgehammer -- but were 
dropped when they were found to be too intense for some children to watch (OK, 
parents, you can breathe now). And, yes, there was even a smattering of Chinese 
magic at one point, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The current show opens with a production number inspired by the Chinese lion 
dance, a tradition used for centuries to announce the arrival of traveling 
acrobats to a new locale. Following that are 14 back-to-back (or, in the 
contortionist's case, back to scalp) feats of physical strength, balance and 
endurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Acts include the "Tower of Chairs," in which longtime company member Chen Tai 
An (the cast calls him "the chair man"), takes four upright champagne bottles 
and stacks chairs on top of them. (His record is 28 feet.) Then he performs a 
handstand from the top of the pile. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a juggler who keeps armloads of fragile Chinese jars and vases 
aloft. And a female contortionist who twists her body into positions that, as 
Hughes describes them, would turn Gumby a deeper shade of green in envy, all 
the while balancing burning candles on her head, hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights include the Bicycle Pagoda, in which nine performers balance 
on each other on board a moving bicycle, and a unicyclist act in which the 
rider, using a spike held in his mouth, catches limes that the audience tosses 
to him (sometimes none too accurately, Hughes notes). 
</P>
<P>
 Though some of the performers speak English and maintain residences in 
California (the company's headquarters are in Pismo Beach), the Chinese Magic 
Revue relies almost exclusively on physical instead of spoken humor. For 
example, a plate-spinning act that's popular with children features a harried 
chef madly trying to keep a dozen plates going while his inept kitchen crew 
gets underfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 The acrobats, who range from teen-agers to adults in their 50s who have been 
with the troupe since its early years, typically begin their training at age 6. 
By their early teens, they are spending 20 to 25 hours per week on their craft, 
at which point they may audition for a professional troupe. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who join the Chinese Magic Revue, an arduous international touring 
schedule awaits, said Hughes, ticking off a list of credits ranging from 
Madison Square Garden to county fairs. Since he's been with them, the troupe 
has performed in some 30 countries, driving as much as 1,400 miles between 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduling demands, however, haven't affected the performers' dedication to 
their craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a very professional group of people," Hughes said. "I remember once, 
we were in a small town in Northern California and the electricity went out 
right when the group was ready to go on."  
</P>
<P>
 They were told it would be at least two hours before the theater would have 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman who had organized the show came back and offered to cancel," he 
continued. "The cast said, 'No, don't' . . . and they went outside and arranged 
the bus and truck (to make a stage), then told the audience to sit in their 
cars and put on the headlights. They did the entire show right there . . . and 
not one person asked for their money back."

SPECIAL EVENT; BACK TO BASES; YOU CAN'T GET TO THE GAME, BUT STADIUM PHOTOS LET 
YOU GO HOME AGAIN

 There's a photo in the Fullerton Museum Center's "Major League/Minor League: 
Photographs of America's Baseball Stadiums by Jim Dow" that's more than a 
little eerie. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide-angle shot captures the Detroit Tigers' ball field but nobody's in 
sight, except for one lone stranger roaming through the emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
 With the season over, and big league stadiums across the country seating more 
memories than spectators, the picture hits home. That awareness welled up in 
Paul Hernandez, a longtime fan of the Los Angeles Dodgers and California 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at that and think about how I'd love to be there, or at the Dodger 
park or the 'Big A' and it makes me uncomfortable," said Hernandez, who lives 
in Orange and recently visited the museum to, as he put it, "recall some of the 
good feelings" he has about the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really care about it and so do my two young sons," Hernandez added. "I 
enjoy (the photographs) but they left me thinking of what we're missing . . . 
well, at least it's still baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball mixed with wanderlust. Dow, who used to be a printer for renowned 
American photographer Walker Evans and has exhibited his own work across the 
country, including at the Library of Congress, traveled across the states to 
document stadiums big and small, from both the major and minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The dozens of shots include Chicago's Wrigley Field, Boston's Fenway Park and 
Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore. Those are just some of the majors; 
there are also photos from College Park in South Carolina, where the minor 
league Charleston Rainbows of the South Atlantic League play, and from Legion 
Park in Montana, where the Great Falls Dodgers pitch, bat and field. 
</P>
<P>
 Selections range from the gleaming (Dodger Stadium) to the rickety (Sam Lynn 
Field in Bakersfield). 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an old-fashioned, romantic approach to picture-making and 
architecture," Dow explained. "But I'm not interested in making specimens. I'm 
interested in synthesizing an experience." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Dow used a tripod-mounted, 8-by-10-inch view camera, usually set 
for long exposures in both daylight and dusk. The shots tend to be wide-angled 
and panoramic, taking in the diamond and the seats and fences that wrap cozily 
around it. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the exhibit's program, Dow accomplished something special by 
searching for the essence of each park.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball's best (stadiums) are full of odd angles and nooks and crannies," 
writes David Lamb, the author of "Stolen Season: A Journey through America and 
Baseball's Minor Leagues" and one of those who contributed to the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than being architectural intruders, they appear to be part of the 
cityscape" in Dow's photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The traveling show, which was produced by the Smithsonian Institution with Dow 
and curator William Dunlop, will remain in Fullerton through Nov. 13. In 
conjunction with the exhibit, baseball writer Richard Beverage will talk at 3 
p.m. Oct. 15 about the old Pacific Coast League. Beverage has authored two 
books on the league, which operated in California from 1903 to 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the full-view stadium perspectives, Dow focused his camera on familiar 
corners of the parks, such as concession stands. An image of a vintage popcorn 
machine from Alumni Coliseum in Butte, Mont., takes you back to the '50s; even 
the bags, with their old-fashioned images of clowns against a red-striped 
background, seem right out of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ballpark expanses are what intrigue most people. Samuel Rickard, a 
71-year-old Fullerton resident, kept staring at the shot of Tiger Stadium. He'd 
never been there, but he'd been to many others, including Fenway, the 
Astrodome, Dodger Stadium and the Big A. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickard, like many fans, had been watching Ken Burns' monolithic PBS series on 
baseball and was still in a flush of nostalgia. While gazing at that photo of 
Tiger Stadium, the nostalgia deepened. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really are beautiful, the way everything goes together so well, from the 
diamond to the green" of the outfield, Rickard said. "I don't think you have to 
be a baseball nut to appreciate a stadium. All you have to be is someone (who 
appreciates) part of our history." 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "Major League/Minor League: Photographs of America's Baseball Stadiums 
by Jim Dow." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Through Nov. 13. Noon to 4 p.m. Wednesdays, Fridays, Saturdays and

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>

<P>
 Various Artists 
</P>
<P>
 "Trance Planet" 
</P>
<P>
 Worldly Music/Triloka Records  
</P>
<P>
 When you feel more like swaying than praying, spiritual but not ritual, 
"Trance Planet" has the potential to take you that one realm beyond with nary a 
note of preachiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Intelligently compiled by world music radio producer Tom Schnabel of KCRW, 
Santa Monica, "Trance Planet" is a world music sampler of virtuosos playing 
their traditional music through contemporary lenses, in the process often 
imparting a sensual overlay to the divine and primal impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 14 tracks seems to bypass the brain and speak directly to the 
heart, the underlying rhythms drawing you inexorably into the music and outside 
of yourself. Content can be decidedly secular, as on the gently affecting first 
track, "Nwahulwana" by the Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Mocambique, wherein 
vocalist Wazimbo laments about women who end up as prostitutes, and on the 
final track, the lone live track, Latin American singer Mercedes Sosa's 
persuasively powerful "Gracias a la Vida." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Indian music seems to go country-Western when Ali Akbar Khan, 
master of the sarod, a 25 metal-stringed instrument, offers his take on a folk 
song from the Indian desert province of Rajasthan in "Two Lovers." Bringing 
ecstasy (the word is not used casually) to the album is qawalli singer Nusrat 
Fateh Ali Khan, something of a scat-singing Sufi priest or prophet; he puts a 
contemporary spin on his rapturous art in "The Game." 
</P>
<P>
 The album also includes some real ear-stretchers. 
</P>
<P>
 From Tuva, between Mongolia and Siberia, comes Sainkho's "Tanola Nomads," a 
jarringly contemporary take on the region's indigenous music; that whistling 
you hear is throat-singing, a technique by which two or more tones are produced 
simultaneously. New York native Jai Uttal studied sarod with Ali Akbar Khan, 
but his "Petition to Ram" starts off with piano riffs before settling into a 
mix with far-flung influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fascinating of all, however, is the Tahitian Choir's "Morotiri Nei," from 
the island of Rapa Iti; the song's tonality eerily shifts downward by steps, in 
midtone. It couldn't be more different from the sensual and visceral rhythms of 
Hassan Erraji's "Hammouda," yet they make perfect album mates. 
</P>
<P>
 A promotional piece on "Trance Planet" says that listening to the album is 
"like listening to the heartbeat of humanity." There's something to that.

SPOTLIGHT; ROCKING IN TONGUES; CLUBS ARE ADOPTING THE OFFSPRING OF DANCE BEATS 
AND SPANISH LANGUAGE -- ROCK POP ESPANOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Midnight rolls around and sounds of a baby crying pierce the dance number 
pumping out of the sound system at Metropolis. The recorded wailing serves as 
more than a signal of the 12 o'clock hour to the hundreds of sweaty patrons on 
the floor of the Irvine club -- it's a reminder of the birth of rock pop 
Espanol into the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock pop Espanol is claiming a night or two at clubs throughout the Southland, 
where promoters are anxious to cash in on its popularity among trendy young 
Latinos, and their non-Latino friends who've gotten hooked on the vibe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Latino clubs J.C. Fandango in Anaheim and Orchids in Orange 
have been packing fans in; El Paraiso in Anaheim will join them this Sunday 
when it debuts a similar program of Latin-flavored rock and pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 But the single best illustration of how hot this craze is, say observers, is 
the decision last month by Metropolis owners to turn that mainstream, upscale 
club's coveted Friday night spot over to a rock pop Espanol format. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock pop Espanol is an umbrella term that encompasses rock and pop, as well as 
house, techno, disco, reggae, ska and alternative. The common denominator is 
that any singing is in Spanish. If some songs sound suspiciously familiar, it's 
because there's a tendency to pattern tunes after English-language rock and pop 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Spanish market, there hasn't been a separation of the various 
categories of rock and pop like there is with (English-language) rock, which 
has hard rock, classic rock, alternative rock and many others," said Carlos 
Ramos, the lead singer of Bravo, a Los Angeles-based rock pop Espanol band that 
played Metropolis on a recent Friday. "We have Spanish rock pop and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 While there have long been pop and rock songs sung in Spanish, the 
all-encompassing category didn't attract much mainstream attention until 
earlier this year. The Shark Club in Los Angeles introduced a Sunday rock pop 
Espanol night called La Cama (the bed) and Spanish-language radio station KLVE 
(107.5 FM) started playing less salsa and easy-listening music and added more 
rock and pop. (La Cama promoters brought their super-trendy brand of rock pop 
Espanol Fridays to Orchids when the club opened in the middle of last month.) 
</P>
<P>
 A following quickly developed among young Latinos who had grown up on KROQ and 
never bought into the cowboy grind of banda. Club deejays still included blocks 
of KROQ hits, from Erasure to Nirvana. But the predominance of rock pop Espanol 
excited crowds most. Here was music they could not only dance to, but sing 
along with, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this music is in our own language, we feel it better," explained 
Edith Tellez, 21, of Westminster. Tellez, stylishly put together in black lace, 
short boots and model-perfect makeup at Orchids recently, added that she and 
her friends have stopped going to "English clubs" since the advent of the rock 
pop Espanol nights in Orange County and Los Angeles. A new acquaintance of 
Tellez, Jose Castrillo of Anaheim, has also changed his clubbing habits. 
Slickly decked in Dr. Marten boots, calf-length trousers, a flannel shirt 
around his waist, a nose ring and a goatee and long, wavy hair, the 22-year-old 
said in Spanish that it's all about "el ambiente ." It's the ambience, he said, 
that appeals to him, along with the Spanish lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it's el ambiente like no other. Club patrons cheer wildly when their 
favorite songs come on. The entire dance floor might bounce together, arms in 
the air, or garnish the chorus of a song with palmas (hands clapping). The 
celebratory atmosphere is infectious and just about everyone -- non-Latino 
patrons included -- participates in the New Year's Eve-like revelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Castellanos, the general manager of his family-owned supper club, J. C. 
Fandango, calls it "the most enthusiastic crowd I've ever seen. The ladies 
start yelling and screaming so the guys start too." The Anaheim club was the 
first to bring the concept to Orange County in April with the help of promoters 
Los Cinco Muskateros. The Sunday fete proved so successful, with a consistent 
draw of 600 to 700 weekly, that early last month the club added a Friday gig, 
called La Luna. 
</P>
<P>
 For Metropolis owners Gregg and John Hanour, the Friday installation of Baby 
Rock -- their name for the rock pop Espanol format -- has resulted in an 
evening that's a breed apart from other nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stands out in the collective expression of how (club-goers) feel about the 
music," said Gregg Hanour. "It's not a night of posturing as much as just 
partying. There's more of a realness to it than what you typically see at 
clubs. These guys aren't afraid to show their excitement for the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Include Rich Grbavac, 22, of Huntington Beach among the more expressive 
revelers. He and three friends -- only one Latina among them -- whooped it up 
at Metropolis recently like it was their last day on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this!" he yelled over some bouncy number. 
</P>
<P>
 Grbavac, who spent last year attending school in Spain, said the scene made 
him nostalgic for the nights he'd spent in Madrid clubs. "There's no hostility 
here; everyone's just friendly," he managed to get in before whirling off. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's less of a language barrier than you might think. Most patrons are 
bilingual, so non-Latinos need not feel intimidated. Plus, Spanish-speakers 
don't have to worry about communicating with the staff at a place like 
Metropolis, where extra personnel have been hired who can speak Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 With a growing young Latino market willing to fork out up to $10 to get in, 
it's no surprise that almost weekly there's word of another club offering a 
night of rock pop Espanol. Already, there's talk of competition between club 
promoters and owners anxious to cash in on the craze. But the real winners so 
far seem to be the patrons, as well as musical artists from North and Latin 
America who have been working more than ever before. Making the rounds have 
been Mexico's Mana, Cai Fanes and La Lupita as well as Argentina's Los 
Fabulosos Cadillacs, Los Tres Vampiros and El Africano. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Tacuba from Mexico, which played J.C. Fandango to a packed house this 
summer, has since attracted enough fans to do a concert at the Universal 
Amphitheater this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo lead singer Ramos said his band is hitting the studio again after a 
two-year hiatus. A couple of years ago, the group made the charts in Latin 
America for 14 weeks and played in front of crowds of 40,000 in Colombia and 
neighboring countries, he says. Now he's looking for the rock pop Espanol 
movement to bring similar success on this side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos, 25, hopes to fuel the cause with the premiere (Saturday at 7 p.m. on 
KWHY, Channel 22) of what he says is the first program dedicated solely to rock 
pop Espanol. "WC" (yes, the international term for water closet, or bathroom) 
will feature interviews with local and famous bands, videos and news on the 
scene. Ramos is host and executive producer of the hourlong show. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock pop Espanol scene, says J.C. Fandango's Castellanos, "is growing 
really kind of fast. It's saturated already with the clubs and it's going to 
peak soon." But he says it won't be going the way of, say, lambada because of 
its accessible appeal.

ART; WIT WE WEAR; OUT OF THE CLOSET, 'LUN*NA MENOH'S BOUTIQUE MYSTIQUE' GETS AT 
THE FABRIC OF HUMOR 
</P>

 Fashion has had an intriguing relationship to cutting-edge culture in this 
century, from the outrageous costumes the Russian Futurists paraded in the 
streets in the 1910s to English designer Vivienne Westwood's flamboyant punk 
rock-style outfits of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanciful garments by Lun*na Menoh -- at the South Coast Plaza satellite of the 
Laguna Art Museum through Dec. 4 -- flirt with the tradition of shock-apparel 
in beguiling ways. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Indoor Game I" -- a life-size velvet-covered outfit lined with 
floral-printed cloth -- has the hourglass silhouette of a Victorian dress, with 
ruffles and lace-up sides. But there's a twist: The box format resembles a 
girl's vanity case and a plastic panel in front with visible garters serves as 
a sly form of "window dressing." (A companion piece, "Indoor Game II," is based 
on the swelling outline of an 18th-Century hoop skirt.) 
</P>
<P>
 * "Peking Bra" is a ruffled, pearl- and button-trimmed creation grafted onto 
the metal curlicues of an ornamental side table. The bra top of this unlikely 
outfit with a punning title looks like a giant pair of eyeglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Silhouette Dress," a ruffled gingham design that's as flat as a board 
(i.e., model-thin), contains a cutout of a woman in the traditional arms-akimbo 
model pose. 
</P>
<P>
 Such cleverly crafted pieces are partly about the sexual tease of fashion, 
from the peek-a-boo glimpse to the hint of bondage, from the ruffle as a 
distant relation of the froth of pubic hair to the plump, covered button as 
nipple. They are about Woman as Theater -- women as the eternal object of men's 
gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 They also are about fashion as a curiously aggressive and non-functional 
branch of architecture, rearranging bodily contours -- hiding or revealing, 
enlarging or diminishing -- as if they were as malleable as empty space. And 
they are about fashion as play -- a socially acceptable game of dress-up for 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Menoh frankly acknowledges the tyrannical idealism of haute couture , made 
expressly to suit the thinnest and tallest, as well as the seemingly infinite 
adaptability of the female form to suit the "look" of a given season or a given 
designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshingly, however, "Boutique Mystique" -- which also contains numerous 
other items -- is not yet another critique of the objectification of women in 
contemporary society. Menoh, who clearly relishes working with fabrics and 
trimmings, seems more interested in investigating the multiple meanings of 
fashion in a witty way. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained as a fashion designer in Tokyo -- where she lived until moving to Los 
Angeles five years ago -- Menoh (nee Atsuko Shimizu) is able to view Western 
style at a certain amused distance. 
</P>
<P>
 While traditional Japanese culture has elaborate rules of dress and a deep 
distrust of nonconformity, Western fashion appears to be about rampant 
individualism. In fact, of course, it is heavily conformist but always in flux, 
forcing its "slaves" to keep nervously au courant . 
</P>
<P>
 In Menoh's "Articulate Cap," a text printed on a roll of plastic serves as a 
veil on a rudimentary piece of headgear. This Constructivist-style piece 
playfully suggests the extent to which clothing "speaks" for us without our 
having to open our mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 Menswear gets equal deconstruction time in "Gentlemen's Closet," a rack of 
shirts cut away so that they are no more than a skeletal outline of collars, 
button plackets and cuffs, and trousers reduced to waistbands, pockets and 
cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Held together by mere traceries of fabric, the garments suggest a visual 
conceit, like a bravura drawing made without picking up the pencil. By 
stripping men's clothes down to their prime components, Menoh underlines the 
sternly utilitarian nature of men's clothing. A wall text in the show likens 
the piece to "a limp instrument of torture." If (as the cliche has it) clothes 
make the man, they are oddly pathetic when they aren't engaged in bondage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip and flip and worldly-wise, "Boutique Mystique" sometimes walks a thin line 
between cute and clever, but Menoh's visual inventiveness and unexpected 
cultural juxtapositions give her work a compelling edge. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "Lun*na Menoh's Boutique Mystique." 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Through Dec. 4. From 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Friday, 10 a.m.

NIGHTSHIFT; FLAMENCO GIVES NEW TWIST AND SHOUT TO HAPPY HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<P>
 Interest in Spain and its culture revived in 1992 with the Olympics in 
Barcelona and radio play of the Gipsy Kings (who, ironically, are from France) 
and seems to be continuing with mucho gusto as tapas bars and restaurants 
continue to open and thrive statewide.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, flamenco classes are overflowing, vanguard director Pedro Almodovar 
achieves pop celebrity status, and movies such as last year's Oscar winner 
"Belle Epoque" and this summer's trendy "Barcelona" entertain more than 
art-house movie audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining the chorus is El Torito in Westminster, which has added an intimate 
flamenco show at its Tuesday night happy hour from 8 to 10 p.m. For as little 
as $2.50 -- the cost of a margarita ($1.75) and soft taco (75 cents) during the 
show -- you can be transported, in mood any ways, to a bar in the south of 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancers Sarah Hohmeyer and Amparo de la Rosa move the crowd, seated around the 
indoor courtyard (careful of the splashing fountain). Lifelong students of 
dance, the two have been studying flamenco for about eight years, mostly here 
in Southern California's tight flamenco community. Neither claims Spanish 
heritage (De la Rosa is a stage name), but that never ensured an ability to 
dance, either. 
</P>
<P>
 As De la Rosa, a Silver Lake resident, put it: "This myth that you have to be 
Spanish to dance well has long been a monkey on the back of many flamenco 
artists." 
</P>
<P>
 Believers will change their mind once they catch these two. They flatten myth 
with their technical skill and inherent passion for the art of flamenco. Even 
their jaleo, the coaxing cried out during a dance, rings with Spanish flavor. 
They are accompanied by guitarists John Simpson and John Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour show (with a break) is the perfect place for a date, either for a 
drink or full dinner. It isn't paella, and the flan obviously follows a Mexican 
recipe, but keep your eyes on the tablao and everything else matters little. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also performs occasionally Saturday evenings at Tapas in Irvine, and 
every Wednesday, Thursday and Friday at Alegria, a tapas bar that recently 
opened in downtown Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Footnote: New honorees will be inducted into the California Swing Dance Hall 
of Fame at the organization's fifth annual dinner-dance and awards show 
Saturday from 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. aboard the Queen Mary in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Big-band music will be provided in the ship's grand ballroom by Walt Wilder's 
13-piece band. Between sets, local deejay Bob Brewer will spin recorded tunes 
for dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-tie affair will also feature live dance exhibitions and vintage film 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets, $50 per person, are available at the door or by calling (818) 
956-8174. Part of the proceeds will benefit the Hathaway House for abused and 
neglected children. MORE CLUBS:

240-2000. Open 7 p.m. to midnight Sunday, Monday and Thursday; 8 p.m. to 1 a.m. 
Friday and Saturday. Closed Tuesday and Wednesday. No cover. What the Club 
Grill lacks in the way of wild pizazz and grand orchestras commonly found in 
the old supper clubs, it more than makes up for in ambience. The mood here is 
intimate and very romantic -- couples of all ages will find it the ideal place 
for a special evening. Bands play mostly KBIG covers. Just remember to bring 
your wallet; this isn't among the cheaper dates.

MUSIC; 'AIDA' STAR GULEGHINA TRIES TO LOOK THE PART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, Chris Pasles covers classical music and dance for The Times 
Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Maria Guleghina was shouldering a rifle to sing the role of 
Aida in a radical production of Verdi's work at the Hamburg State Opera. "There 
were no Egyptians," she recalled. "No Ethiopians. Aida was white. It was in 
contemporary dress. I sang in jeans because Aida was a military aide." 
</P>
<P>
 When she sings the role for Opera Pacific this weekend, however (alternating 
with Camellia Johnson), she will revert to the more traditional incarnation of 
the character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," she said, "I would like to be the 'Flower of the Nile.' I will try to 
be very soft and very feminine. I will try to change." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more svelte and attractive young sopranos singing today, Guleghina 
will not have to try very hard. Two years ago, concerned about dramatic 
credibility and looking the part, she made a conscious decision to lose weight. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I was big," she said, over coffee at a hotel restaurant, where she declined 
lunch. "Not big like some sopranos, but I was bigger than I am now. One day I 
looked intensely in the mirror and I understood, it's not me. I decided to 
change completely. I lost about 30 pounds. I have respect for the audience. 
People go to the theater to hear something, yes, it's true, but also to see 
something. I do not want people to smile when I play Tosca or Aida!" 
</P>
<P>
 Born in the Ukrainian city of Odessa, Guleghina dreamed of being an opera 
singer from age 3. But whenever she sang, her friends laughed at her.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had such a large voice. They said, 'You sing like an elephant,' and I 
always cried." 
</P>
<P>
 Her father would soothe her and tell her not to worry. His comforting words 
turned out to be sound. 
</P>
<P>
 The dramatic soprano made her La Scala Opera debut as Amelia in Verdi's "Un 
Ballo in Maschera" in 1987 opposite Luciano Pavarotti. She sang Floria Tosca 
opposite Placido Domingo last year and opposite Pavarotti last April, both at 
the Metropolitan Opera in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she recently sang Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana" in 
Avignon, she particularly relished the part because for once the soprano was 
"not in love with the tenor!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which usually means the soprano dies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, I am Tosca, big trouble for me. I'm Leonora in 'Il Trovatore,' 
trouble. 'Ballo in Maschera,' trouble. Aida, trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the trouble in the plot, the role itself is vocally very difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "Verdi wrote the first and second acts for a dramatic soprano and the third 
and fourth acts for a very light soprano, really for a different type of voice. 
But I don't need to change my voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Guleghina's real husband, Mark Guleghin, a bass-baritone, is very much alive. 
The two met while they were music students at the local conservatory. They got 
married when she was 15 and he was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were too young," she said. "Two children in the conservatory. But it's OK. 
In Russia, it's OK. We finish at school usually at 16 or 17, and after that, 
we're free." 
</P>
<P>
 Guleghina declines to give her age, although she says that from the age of 
their 14-year-old daughter, we can figure it out. "I'm old. Over 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Their daughter dreams of going to Hollywood to be an actress, she said, 
raising her eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides changing her life, her marriage also changed her religion. She became 
a Baptist, converting from the Russian Orthodox faith because Guleghin and his 
family are Baptists. In doing so, she learned how his family suffered 
persecution because of their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband's grandfather was sent to Siberia for this, for 10 years. At that 
time, around 1933-35, someone came to the house and asked him, 'Do you read the 
Bible with your children?' He said, 'Yes.' 'Do you sing hymns with your 
children?' 'Yes.' 'OK. Ten years.' It was terrible. When he came out, 
'rehabilitated,' he was a broken man. He died soon after. That is why I love 
America. America saved our family. We came to California as refugees." 
</P>
<P>
 But California is not exactly home yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My home? Oh, I don't know," Guleghina said. "It's a very difficult question. 
It depends on my work. I have a house in Russia. I have a new house in Hamburg. 
I have a house in Sacramento, where the parents of my husband live, but they're 
my parents, also. I don't know. Maybe, when I will be old, I don't know, I will 
live only in America."

DO IT!: THE SINKS PROMISES A GRAND WALK THROUGH PRIVATE CANYON PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Grand Canyon of Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 That's how some describe the Sinks, dramatic sandstone cliffs that rise 150 
feet in a remote area off Santiago Canyon Road in the county's hilly 
northeastern corner. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've never heard of or seen the Sinks, join the club -- it's on private 
Irvine Co. property. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1 1/2 years, however, guided walks coordinated through the Nature 
Conservancy have opened the scenery to the public for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7,600-acre parcel that includes the Sinks, now known as the northern 
reserve, has been designated for eventual inclusion in the county park system, 
and will probably someday become part of Whiting Ranch Regional Park. There is 
an additional 6,800 acres of Irvine Co. property adjacent to Laguna Coast 
Wilderness Park near Laguna Beach; known as the southern reserve, it is also 
designated as future parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than wait for the two properties to be officially handed over to the 
county, the Irvine Co. decided to invite the public to take a look by offering 
limited tours through the Nature Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the northern reserve, moderate 2 1/2-hour walks are offered each Saturday 
morning at 7:30 and 10. Twice a month, more ambitious hikers can take part in a 
10-mile, five-hour hike that is moderately strenuous (the next 10-mile hikes 
are Saturday and Oct. 22, at 7 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the southern reserve, walking tours are offered each Saturday at 
7:30 and 9 a.m. Both reserves offer occasional equestrian and mountain biking 
tours; a cycling tour of the northern reserve will be offered Sunday at 8 a.m., 
and an equestrian ride through the southern reserve is planned for Oct. 16 at 
9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 All tours require advance phone registration, and Nature Conservancy officers 
will provide directions to staging areas at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups for the hikes are held to a maximum of 20, but Nature Conservancy 
docent coordinator Mark Sanderson said that although there was a waiting list 
in the early months, attendance has been down recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fall is one of the nicest times to be out there," he said of the northern 
reserve, adding that the weather is cool, and animal activity tends to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the animals that might be seen are mule deer and bobcat. Acorns carpet 
the ground, keeping the acorn woodpeckers busy as they stock up for winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Walks in the southern reserve tour the areas that burned in last season's 
wildfire, Sanderson said. That affords participants a chance to "learn about 
the role fire plays in the maintenance of these natural areas." 
</P>
<P>
 All guides are volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really fortunate in attracting some of Orange County's top-notch 
biologists and naturalists," Sanderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nature Conservancy is getting ready to train its next group of volunteers, 
and anyone interested is invited to call. The 10-week program involves about 50 
hours of training and begins later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Tour itineraries vary from week to week, so return visits won't necessarily 
cover the same ground. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Amigos de Bolsa Chica offers its 15th annual "Running Is for the Birds" on 
Saturday, with a 10K run (8:30 a.m.), 5K run/walk (8:40 a.m.) and 1K youth run, 
ages 5 to 12 (9 a.m.).  
</P>
<P>
 Registration is from 7 to 8 a.m. at the start point at Bolsa Chica State 
Beach, opposite the Bolsa Chica wetlands at Pacific Coast Highway and Warner 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The $20 entry fee includes a T-shirt; proceeds benefit efforts to preserve the 
wetlands. Information: (714) 897-7003. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * When: Northern reserve, each Saturday at 7:30 and 10 a.m.; southern reserve,

KIDS ON FILM: 'PRINCESS' WINS LOYAL FOLLOWING AMONG GIRLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Princess Caraboo," a journalist in 19th - Century England falls in love 
with a beauty who leads the aristocracy to believe she's a foreign princess but 
is suspected of being a fake. (Rated PG)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is it written that only girls can enjoy cute fairy tales and romantic 
adventures. I'm sure there are boys out there who might go willingly to this 
movie. They just weren't anywhere to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the theater was filled with girls ages 9 to 13, and their mothers. 
Most found the movie entrancing, if flawed. The ostensibly true story has all 
the required elements -- the beautiful girl with unusual outfits and a secret, 
the great English countryside and Dickensian city scenes, the 
upstairs/downstairs accents, and the true love that flourishes only because it 
takes root beneath surface appearances.  
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing is the sequel (or perhaps a TV sitcom?) that they are 
now eagerly awaiting.  
</P>
<P>
 Laurel Clark, 10, gave it a total thumbs up. "It was exciting. It had a lot of 
good jokes in it," she said, referring to those by Frixos, a Greek butler 
played by Kevin Kline, who wants at first to expose the princess. (As he serves 
her dinner, Frixos hisses, "I know you are a fraud and I spit in your soup.") 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie was just really funny and it kind of got sad at the end," Laurel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Erin Dawson, 9, said she thought "it was very happy in the 
beginning and at the end, and the pictures were very wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Both were surprised when the plot revealed "Princess Caraboo" was really an 
ordinary servant with an extraordinary imagination. The ruse is discovered by 
lonely journalist John Gutch after following a lead that she might be a former 
client of the Magdalen Hospital for Penitent Prostitutes.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised," Erin said. "I thought she was a princess, then I found out 
she wasn't a princess, but she sounded like she was a princess. In the very 
beginning, I thought she was an Indian."  
</P>
<P>
 Some thought it was just too confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing happens with this one character, and then it skips over to another 
character and it was hard to follow," said Katy Nilsen, 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questioned the entire premise, saying they didn't understand why a 
servant girl would want to pass herself off as foreign royalty, although 
several hints were dropped that she yearned for adventure or a measure of 
revenge against the upper class. The girls speculated it was more likely power 
or money.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it was that good," said Elyse Chernoff, 12, who along with 
Katy were among the guests at 12-year-old Anupa Sanvordeker's birthday party 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you say that?" asked the others. "I didn't think it made any sense," 
Elyse said. "It just didn't flow that well. To me, it just wasn't a very good 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 But the other girls all laughed out loud when a pompous professor played by 
John Lithgow attempts to communicate with the "princess" by experimenting with 
languages full of tonal variation and glottal stops.  
</P>
<P>
 Brittany Gery, 12, said she liked the scenes where the "princess" would 
pretend to be praying in unusual places and move her arms in dance-like poses. 
</P>
<P>
 And most fairy-tale lovers were satisfied by the conclusion in which, true to 
the genre, the princess is rescued -- in this case by a man less handsome than 
she but more powerful by virtue of his profession.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though he was no Prince Charming, Brittany said, "it reminded me of 
'Cinderella.' "

SPECIAL SCREENING: PARADISE FOUND IN UCI'S POTPOURRI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lance writer who regularly 
writes about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following "Angel Heart," the bloody horror-mystery that launched UC Irvine's 
fall film series last week, with "Cinema Paradiso," the gentle Oscar-winner 
screening Friday night, is like following a scream with a whisper. 
</P>
<P>
 While Alan Parker's messy but often fascinating "Angel Heart" is all about 
rude provocation, Giuseppe Tornatore's "Cinema Paradiso" is all about the 
tenderest of provocations. It's as if the organizers of UCI's "Cinema 
Potpourri" series wanted to first rile the nerves, then calm them back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner for best foreign-language film for 1990, Tornatore's movie can feel 
like a sedative. There's so much reaching for soothing epiphanies in the story 
of Alfredo, the bearlike projectionist in an ancient Sicilian movie theater, 
and Salvatore, his young friend and later apprentice, that you get drowsy after 
a while. Sentiment is "Cinema Paradiso's" reason for being, and Tornatore never 
strays from providing it. 
</P>
<P>
 But within their small tale, which draws in, however tangentially, several 
others in the fishing village where they live, there's also meat for dedicated 
movie lovers. 
</P>
<P>
 As we watch the relationship develop between Alfredo and Salvatore, nicknamed 
Toto, we also watch their excitement over the pictures shown in the Cinema 
Paradiso, a worn-out but still elegant theater. Passages from Renoir's 
social-realist classic "The Lower Depths" mingle with those featuring Chaplin, 
Errol Flynn, Greta Garbo and dozens of others from filmdom's Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekly screenings are the town's highlight, bringing in everybody within 
miles. The upper classes sit in the balcony, even spitting at the noisy crowd 
of blue-collar workers, fishermen and prostitutes below. But the pictures unite 
them, as they unite Toto and Alfredo. Tornatore's message about the shared 
experience of art, especially popular art, is distractingly obvious but joyous 
nonetheless. "Cinema Paradiso" is a movie easy to forgive, simply because it's 
so pleasurable.  
</P>
<P>
 Tornatore also wins us over through the details. The opening sequence, in 
which we're introduced to Alfredo (played with a bellowing goodness by Philippe 
Noiret) and Toto ( Salvatore Cascio), shows the local priest gasping at the 
kissing scenes in "The Lower Depths." With a violent ring of his bell, he 
signals Alfredo which passages to edit out. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a man screams during the butchered movie that he's never once seen a 
kiss on screen, sending the audience into a fit over the censorious nature of 
the Catholic Church. Still later, that first passage echoes in the final, 
remarkably effective epiphany as Toto, now well into middle-age and a 
successful TV director with doubts about his emotional resources, has to face 
what he's become as a man.

RESTAURANTS; DE PALMA MAKES HIS MARK'S WITH LOOKS, CHATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark De Palma is an energetic, black-shirted presence with perfect hair; he 
was born to run a restaurant. That's him at the front of his Laguna Beach 
restaurant, Mark's, greeting the art establishment types that flock here 
nightly. That's him in the dining areas, keeping watch over his new customers 
like a Secret Service agent assigned to a President. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant's terrace is almost like a private club, what with all the 
schmoozing and inter-table chatter that goes on out here. De Palma relishes 
socializing. Until recently, he concentrated energies on his other Mark's up in 
West Hollywood, a popular spot with industry insiders. Now he's made plenty of 
new friends down here, and Laguna has a hot new hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 Clever design has undoubtedly played a part in the restaurant's early success. 
This is one restaurant that wouldn't look out of place either in Malibu or on 
the shores of the Mediterranean. The outer dining room has a floor of bare gray 
stone; palm fronds jut out from the walls at sharp angles and blond wood 
wainscoting contrasts nicely with the white table linens -- a striking 
juxtaposition. Embellished by the work of well-known local artist Wayne Forte, 
this room is both spare and subtle, with no space wasted; call it New Age/Japan 
on PCH. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when the weather is good (and that's often, in Laguna), most customers 
prefer sitting on the terrace, shielded from the sun by mustard-colored canvas 
umbrellas, even though this means having to ignore distracting traffic noises 
from the street below. On weekends, especially for Sunday brunch, the patio is 
an especially tough table. Standees run four deep at the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark's menu is full of Mediterranean, California and even a few Pacific Rim 
dishes -- the type of eclecticism that a community such as West Hollywood 
demands. You will find Chinese-inspired dumplings stuffed with shrimp and 
vegetables, quasi-Mexican turkey breaded with cornmeal masa and pumpkin seeds, 
the de rigueur pizza a la goat cheese, a few creative pastas and a collection 
of the salads and grilled items that define the California idiom: Shanghai 
chicken salad for one, the over-familiar seared ahi for another. 
</P>
<P>
 This eclectic style has been filtering down into southern Orange County by 
inches and may have just found a home here. Still, I can't help thinking that 
what comes out of this kitchen could use more polish, even if certain faces in 
the crowd tell me the food is beside the point.  
</P>
<P>
 Dining at Mark's begins on a wholly encouraging note. The first thing you are 
served is a basket of warm, crusty olive rolls, alongside a white porcelain 
plate upon which is a perfect square of cold, hard, fresh butter. Combined with 
the aesthetics of the room, the breaking of this bread is a near-perfect 
experience. Things become somewhat less than perfect later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dishes at Mark's are acceptable without making a strong impression. 
Steamed Eastern mussels, for instance, have a nice Mediterranean feel. The 
shellfish come in a white bowl, drenched in a nondescript broth flecked green 
from a slight overdose of thyme. The chicken tacos are better. The soft corn 
tortillas are loaded with tasty chunks of fried, nicely spiced chicken breast, 
flanked by delicious guacamole and a mild tomato salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the kitchen may be out of its depth when it comes to the west side of the 
Pacific Rim. The Asian-inspired shrimp dumplings have a proper al dente 
texture, but the filling is insipid and the soy dressing has too much vinegar. 
Shanghai Chicken salad has the opposite problem. This mixture of greens, 
shredded carrot, fried won tons and rice noodles, roasted chicken and cabbage 
is too sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 Scallop shrimp linguine is a solid, dependable choice among the pastas. The 
nicely chewy noodles are topped with tiny bay scallops and flavorful shrimp in 
a roasted tomato sauce. Smoked chicken fettuccine appeals to me as well, but 
because the chicken has a heavily smoked aftertaste, I won't say it is for 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best main dishes is roasted chicken with french fries, and it 
doesn't surprise me that it happens to be the most unassuming. This kitchen 
tends to run into trouble when it gets fancy. Compare the seared ahi, which 
needs to lose the mushy brown rice, the overcooked baby bok choy and the 
penetrating ginger sauce and learn to be just a good piece of fish. The turkey 
scaloppine with masa pumpkin crust is oily and overbreaded, though the 
cranberry chipotle sauce is a nice twist on an American classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The properly thick grilled pork chops are a good choice -- if you don't have a 
problem with a lot of sauce and rather wet corn, shallots and tomatoes mussing 
up the texture of grilled meat.  
</P>
<P>
 Desserts include a sweet chocolate souffle served in a tiny souffle dish, a 
nicely caramelized tarte tatin and a delicious chocolate mousse lining an 
elegant little chocolate cup. The espresso is hot and so is the scene, so there 
are plenty of reasons to show up at Mark's. I just wish more of them were 
things to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark's is moderate to high end. Starters are $3 to $8.50. Salads are $3.50 to 
$7.50. Main courses are $8.50 to $13.25.

NEWSBITES: WHAT HAPPENED IN 1492? THAT'S WHEN COLUMBUS DISCOVERED TOMATOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who regularly 
contributes to The Times Orange County. Information for this column can be 
faxed to (714) 966-7790, or write: Newsbites/OC Live!, The Times Orange County,

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before Christopher Columbus landed in the New World in 1492, the Italians made 
their lasagna with beets. The Swiss had no chocolate, the Chinese no peppers 
and the Irish no potatoes. (Columbus also paved the way for other staples to 
make their way back to Old World tables, including beans, turkey, vanilla, 
peanuts and strawberries.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Columbus changed for sure Italian cuisine," said Maurizio Nascimben, manager 
of Emporio Armani Express. "Italians eat bell peppers roasted, stuffed, every 
way imaginable. And what would Italian cuisine be without the tomato? 
Unthinkable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Armani Express will mark the Monday holiday with a special menu of foods 
from Genoa, hometown of both the explorer and of chef Nino Pagano. Eight 
choices include minestrone Genovese ($4.95), risotto with cuttlefish ($11.95) 
and fusilli (corkscrew pasta) al pesto ($9.50).  
</P>
<P>
 "Pesto is the image of Genoa," Nascimben said of the pine nut, basil and olive 
oil concoction. "Pesto is to Genoa what pizza is to Naples."  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in many circles it's no longer politically correct to celebrate 
Columbus Day. Many Native Americans, for instance, feel that they found 
Columbus, and gave him food and shelter before he turned on them -- not that he 
found them, since they were never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelo's restaurant has found a way to celebrate the holiday and to be 
politically correct. The Italian restaurant will serve a different three-course 
prix fixe dinner, including a specialty salad, pasta course and entree, each 
night Monday through Oct. 13, and noting the year the explorer "found" America, 
the price has been set at $14.92. 
</P>
<P>
 The important part is that one-third of the proceeds from the meals go to the 
American Indian Relief Council to benefit Native Americans in need.  
</P>
<P>
 This last tribute might be stretching things, but Monday nights in October, 
Tony's Sea Landing restaurants are offering 1 1/4- to 1 1/2-pound Maine lobster 
dinners for $10.95, and on Columbus Day, owner Mike Khamis said he's aiming for 
the upper limit -- specifically 1.492 pounds.

TRIED & TRUE: WHO GETS GEMUTLICH LIKE THOSE GERMANS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a free-lance writer who regularly contributes 
to the Times Orange County Edition. This column is one in a series of 
first-person accounts of leisure activities in and around Orange County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I love weddings. Actually, I love wedding receptions. Big ones. Loud ones. 
With lots of yelling and silly behavior and dancing and toasting and enough 
food to collapse the tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian wedding receptions are usually right near the top on the pure fun 
list, and Greek ones are great if you love line dancing in its original form, 
and Jewish wedding receptions will force you onto a diet for at least a month. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Germans have perfected the art of the blowout wedding reception. They 
did it beginning Oct. 12, 1810. The occasion was the wedding of the crown 
prince of Bavaria, who later became King Louis I, to Princess Therese von 
Sachsen-Hildburghausen. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception, it is said, went on for -- depending on whom you believe -- one 
to six weeks. They had so much fun they decided to do it every year after that. 
Today they call it Oktoberfest. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, party-intensive folks from all over the world have since 
appropriated Oktoberfest for themselves, and Orange County has two of the 
largest ones in Southern California. I decided to go to both in one weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not easy. The trick is to arrive ravenously hungry and, to a lesser 
extent, thirsty. Because, let's remember, Oktoberfest started life as a royal 
wedding reception and it still carries a lot of that slightly crazed 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly the one at Old World in Huntington Beach. Held in an enclosed 
area that looks to be part makeshift beer hall, part fake alpine cave, Old 
World's Oktoberfest (which runs through Nov. 6) began at 6:30 Saturday evening 
with a few stragglers who quickly ordered trays of standard Oktoberfest food 
from the kitchen -- lots of bratwurst, chicken, sauerkraut, strudel and potato 
salad -- and began sipping the first malty German beers of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 I chose a table near the band, an import quartet from the Old Country called 
the Nurnberger Express. They were slightly disappointing in that they were 
mostly in tune, a real sin for any good Oktoberfest band, but before long the 
dancing started on the nearby raised wooden floor. 
</P>
<P>
 I ordered a bratwurst and potato salad and a big Spaten beer and settled in. 
And for the first hour or so, things were fairly genteel: a few little kids 
capering around on the dance floor, a fine spray of kraut-and-wurst juice, and 
not a few good ringing burps (it ain't Tavern on the Green) rising from the 
crowd.  
</P>
<P>
 Around 8:30 or so, however, I noticed that the decibel level had risen 
dramatically (along with the temperature), and the crowd had almost completely 
filled the inner beer garden and were spilling out into the adjacent outdoor 
one. Waitresses in dirndls were circulating through the mob hawking apple 
schnapps and Jagermeister (a strong herbal drink) in what appeared to be test 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 I fled outside for some fresh air, stayed a few minutes, then tried to 
shoehorn my way back inside. I was met by a blast of warm, beery air and a din 
that made conversation a test of wills. This is just the sort of atmosphere I 
treasured in college (and most of the crowd appeared about that age), but now, 
in full fuddy-duddy array, I reconsidered a second assault into the throng and 
remembered that I had to do this again the next day at the Phoenix Club in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenix Club is Orange County's private German-American club that is open 
to the public (for $5 admission) through Oct. 30. While Old World opens the 
beer hall on Wednesdays through Sundays (Wednesday and Thursday are free, 
Friday and Saturday admission is $10 and Sunday -- family day -- is $3.50) the 
Phoenix Club takes the celebration outside in the huge beer garden only on 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a comforting feel of authenticity about the Phoenix Club's 
Oktoberfest. Club members volunteer at the food booths, and many of them wear 
Bavarian costume. The tables in the covered beer garden seat hundreds, but many 
are families of several generations. You hear a lot of German spoken, and these 
people know how to polka. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a few shots at the indoor air-rifle range, a familiar German 
institution (the sport is highly popular in Germany and the club team is 
excellent), I rigged myself with a beer and a bowl of one of the planet's best 
pea soups. It's made in the huge caldron of an outdoor World War II-era German 
field kitchen and it can be eaten with a fork.  
</P>
<P>
 After a waltz or two (the band played in tune again; whatever became of 
traditional mediocrity?) I ordered up a paper plate of reibekuchen -- potato 
pancakes -- with apple sauce: golden, crunchy, scourge of Richard Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment took on a decidedly loopy character. A man wielding a huge 
blue balloon danced around with it and then actually crawled inside it and 
became what appeared to be a human billiard ball -- a round blue object with 
only a head protruding, jumping around. The crowd loved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The schuhplattler group came next, the most unequal division of labor in the 
dance world. Traditional Bavarian dancers, the men leap around with intricate 
hand-leg motions, slapping thighs and shoes, while their female partners stand 
by oscillating demurely back and forth or twirling slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all worth a toast, and the band knew how to get it started. At every 
Oktoberfest celebration, at roughly half-hour intervals, the band strikes up a 
kind of fanfare and the crowd sings, over and over, four lovely words: Ein 
prosit der gemutlichkeit: A drink to . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What? That last word is really untranslatable into English. It's a combination 
of comradely regard, friendship, fun, sharing of good times, cozy atmosphere, 
carefree living, good food and drink. One word to sum up the biggest, 
best-loved wedding reception in history. 
</P>
<P>
 I drank also to Louis and Therese Whatever-the-heck-her-name-is. And tried 
unsuccessfully to work off the reibekuchen with a Chicken Dance (don't ask) so 
I could take a whack at an ox sandwich. That's right, a complete ox, roasted on 
a spit. 
</P>
<P>
 But I couldn't manage it, not even with the help of a decent burp. The ox 
would have to wait until next week. 
</P>
<P>
 So much gemutlichkeit, so little time.

3-HOUR TOUR: HISTORY'S IN BLOOM IN WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can visit a museum, a farmhouse and a barn all in one stop at Blakey Park 
in Westminster. Then stop to smell the roses on your way to a drugstore where 
prescriptions expired almost a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:40: Exhibits at the museum are numbered 1 through 30, but local history 
is such that not until display No. 5 is the founding of Westminster Colony in 
1870 chronicled. Early photos show the home of the colony's first settler, John 
Y. Anderson, resident Ethel Bauer driving east on what was then Almond Avenue 
in her horse and buggy and, enough to make a grown man cry, an onion farm on 
the present site of Westminster Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Various displays focus on "sad irons" -- thanks to interchangeable handles, 
you could use one while the other was being heated -- and turn-of-the-century 
petticoats, corsets and hats. A poster for Green Mountain Vegetable Ointment 
claims "a positive remedy for everything, unequaled for gout, shingles, 
milk-leg sores, face ague (and) swelled breasts." 
</P>
<P>
 The great quake of '33 destroyed the 17th Street School. The photo of second- 
and third-graders at Hoover School in '44 includes a dog. The museum deemed it 
worthy to exhibit the actual kitchen table on which Westminster's incorporation 
papers were signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby hang Laurel and Hardy plates manufactured in Westminster, one showing 
the pair moving a piano on a suspension bridge. "There's something here to 
interest everybody," noted Westminster historical society President Joy 
Neugebauer. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a Cape buffalo head. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1920s, the largest aircraft in the world, the Albatross, was 
manufactured in Westminster by Sterling Price," Neugebauer explained. "When his 
son Gerald told me the history of aviation in Westminster and gave me all this 
memorabilia, he also gave me the buffalo head. How could I not take it?" 
</P>
<P>
 1:40 to 1:45: On the grounds outside the museum are a windmill and a sycamore, 
all that remained after fire destroyed Leaora Blakey's home in 1944. A 60-pound 
pumpkin grows beneath the windmill. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakey arrived in Westminster Colony via covered wagon in 1894, at the age of 
3. In later years she collected space flight memorabilia and was known as "the 
covered-wagon lady." She remained on the property at the corner of Westminster 
Boulevard and Newland Street until she died in 1981 at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
 1:45 to 2: The Warne family farmhouse next to the museum opens for tours Oct. 
16. Inside is a dry sink with metal-lined cupboards to keep out bugs, a stove 
with a dial marked "warm," "hot" and "very hot," and an upright piano called an 
"orchestral grand" and featuring four pedals instead of the usual three. The 
farmhouse, barn and pump house stood at Bolsa Avenue and Bushard Street until 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 2:15: The barn at the rear of Blakey Park houses a sugar beet wagon and 
farm implements from the early 1900s as well as an early fire engine and 
Westminster's first paramedic wagon. The chickens -- one white Leghorn that 
lays eggs six out of seven days and four black Australorps -- are not vintage 
Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 2:15 to 3:20: The flavored jellyfish ($6.95) appetizer at the restaurant next 
door was pleasantly crunchy and sweetly refreshing -- it made you feel happy to 
eat it! No wonder they call this place Seafood Paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 " Don't get sea cucumber," pleaded my wife, referring to the wormlike creature 
that's served four different ways, including "family style." We settled instead 
on fried crispy quail ($3), clam with hot mint sauce ($6.95) -- each clam came 
with its own pepper slice and mint leaves -- a vegetable delight ($5.95) with 
at least four types of mushroom, and kung pao frog legs ($12.95) unusually 
replete with frog knees. When we're rich and famous, we'll go back for braised 
shark's fin soup ($12 per person), sauteed elephant clam with yellow leek 
($22.95) and sliced abalone with chicken feet ($22.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Live crabs, lobsters and rock cod are sold from tanks, and Hong Kong dim sum 
is served daily. Special feasts range from $26 for four people to $298 for 12. 
Sixty dishes are offered at weekday lunch in the $4 range, including soup, rice 
and dessert. We were brought a complimentary dessert of frozen yogurt and 
fortune cookies. My fortune: "You shall soon achieve perfection." 
</P>
<P>
 3:20 to 3:40: A public rose garden lines the grounds of the Civic Center. 
Roundelay is the city's official rose; other varieties include Voodoo and 
Mikado, Typhoo Tea and Tickled Pink. Among the less humble are Pristine, First 
Prize and Sheer Elegance. There's a brick clock tower at the center and what 
appears to be a drum set atop the Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 3:40 to 4: The McCoy-Hare House was the city's first drugstore, and it's the 
oldest surviving building. You don't need a tour to look into the windows. One 
room contains pharmaceutical artifacts; the other is a turn-of-the-century 
parlor. If you do arrange a tour, peek at Marie Hare's Alaskan Botanical 
Collection, which includes tundra rose and pink tundra moss, and listen to the 
Victrola. "They played this song at my wedding, only with a different beat," 
Neugebauer said a little wistfully, placing the huge needle gently down on 
"Always." 3-HOUR TOUR

 Almost as humorous as a Letterman list: Public affairs consultant Robert 
Mooney of Covina writes that when he read his invitation to join the American 
Assn. of Political Consultants, "I thought immediately of your column." We can 
see why after reading the group's "Code of Professional Ethics," which 
contained these knee-slappers: 
</P>
<P>
 * "I shall not indulge in any activity which would corrupt or degrade the 
practice of political campaigning." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I shall treat my colleagues and clients with respect and never 
intentionally injure their professional or personal reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I will refrain from false and misleading attacks on an opponent or his or 
her record." 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, the group will give exemptions to the consultants involved in the 
Wilson-Brown and Feinstein-Huffington races.

 Rock's blood group: A press release from the Hollywood offices of Geffen 
Records quipped that Jesse James Dupree, Jackyl's chain saw-wielding front man, 
"came close to donating his thumb to the Hard Rock Cafe's memorabilia 
collection. While performing a special live set as part of Hard Rock Miami's 
first anniversary celebration, Dupree cut his left hand to the bone with his 
chain saw." 
</P>
<P>
 It adds: "After completing the band's set with blood flowing from his hand, 
Dupree also cut the Hard Rock's anniversary cake with his chain saw before 
being taken to a local hospital. . . ."

 Tasty.

 But what about your houseguests?Our oddment about the Hollywood company that 
specializes in "phallic casting" brought a note from Linda Countryman, who says 
she "was reminded of an offering that could be of benefit to both sexes." She 
read about a toilet seat firm that offers to make "customized seats . . . from 
one's own template." 
</P>
<P>
 She concludes: "May visions of placing your bottom in a bucket of plaster of 
Paris forever dance in your head." 
</P>
<P>
 Tributes like that bring tears to our eyes. miscelLAny In honor of Rideshare 
Week -- surely you knew this was Rideshare Week -- several female impersonators 
from a local restaurant say they will "drag the Strip" today aboard West 
Hollywood's Sunset Shuttle. The bus will be topped with a giant, high-heeled 
shoe.

 Your editorial on Iraq's arms (Sept. 25) neglected to mention the plight of 
the Kurds. Any rapprochement of the West with the government of Iraq should 
include political security for the millions of Kurds who were the victims of 
Saddam Hussein's genocide before the Gulf War and immediately after, had he not 
been stopped by the U.S. and its allies.

CLAS TEST VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of the CLAS program for public schools panders to the 
radical right. The governor's own appointed Board of Education unanimously 
recommended extending the testing.The CLAS testing was a key ingredient for 
improving public schools. Now California is left without an accountable 
assessment system of its students. 
</P>
<P>
 I think this is a transparent attempt to further diminish public education in 
California, which is the agenda for those who would prefer state vouchers to 
subsidize private schools. We can only hope that a future governor will have 
more moral courage and concern about the quality of California's schools.

attempting to destroy public education through under-financing, he has 
dismantled the only test that accurately measured his success.

GUN RESALE, MANUFACTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's recent veto of the measure to ban the resale of firearms 
seized from criminals (Oct. 2) is another example of society's loss of moral 
direction. The explanation for the veto was that the measure would only be 
"symbolic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wouldn't it be refreshing for someone in a position of leadership to take the 
moral high ground and do something "symbolic" (in the face of being unable to 
do something substantive)! The gun manufacturers and the NRA are "well and 
thriving," and that issue surely needs to be addressed, but to recycle seized 
guns is total capitulation and sanctifies the existence and inevitability of a 
violent, gun-dominated society. Can the police agencies in their quest for 
funds live with the possibility that these already seized guns may be recycled 
and turned against them?

 * Re "Southland Firms Dominate Market for Small Handguns," Sept 23: 
</P>
<P>
 Now we hear that cheap, small-caliber, low-capacity pistols are "the weapons 
of choice for criminals," a moniker of vilification recently exclusive to 
expensive, high-powered, large-capacity assault weapons. This abrupt 
redefinition demonstrates either: the crime bill's assault weapons ban -- law 
for only a few weeks -- has criminals panicked, hastily abandoning their 
formerly requisite weapons and overwhelmingly acquiring these bargains; or yet 
another example of politicians' and mainstream media's contempt for the 
public's intellect by attempting to manipulate popular opinion using emotion 
and hyperbole, eschewing statistical and empirical evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, of course, is obvious. Tragically, the media's self-righteous 
obsession with vilifying instruments used to inflict harm obscures the problem: 
pervasive violence, particularly among our youth. Sensationalizing inanimate 
weapons -- machine gun to zip gun, stiletto knife to sharpened paint roller 
handle -- cannot mitigate the gut-wrenching agony of victims' families, loved 
ones and friends . . . and will not stop the carnage.

and the Foundation for Global Community to get this information out to the 
public.

 There were wonderful speakers and informative workshops on this important 
subject, but so little attendance. For shame.

WHY FIGHT FOR A CRUEL METHOD?; CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T APPEAL COURT RULING THAT 
SHUT THE GAS CHAMBER DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This newspaper opposes the death penalty essentially because it requires the 
state to act in a way unbefitting a democratic society. The ruling Tuesday by a 
federal judge declaring execution in the gas chamber to be unconstitutional 
only reinforces our view. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel's ruling is the first by a federal 
judge that the gas chamber violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on cruel and 
unusual punishment. Patel found that the cyanide gas causes extreme pain. Her 
ruling permits execution by lethal injection, which California provides as an 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel's decision does not address the constitutionality of the death penalty 
itself; it does not overturn the sentences of the 387 people condemned to death 
in California. But thedecision -- which state officials have vowed to appeal -- 
will add to the already significant cost and delay involved in carrying out 
death sentences.  
</P>
<P>
 When it was built in the 1930s, California's gas chamber was considered a 
humane alternative to hanging. Now only five of the 37 states with the death 
penalty still use a gas chamber, and all offer lethal injection as an 
alternative. A law signed by Gov. Pete Wilson in 1992 allows condemned 
prisoners to make that choice. So the state probably can proceed with 
executions by injection, but it will appeal Patel's ruling to prevent inroads 
on the constitutionality of the death penalty itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the state impose the ultimate punishment to eliminate those who have 
committed crimes so heinous they should not be allowed to live in civilized 
society? If so, then execution by injection is certainly preferable. We see no 
need for the state to expend effort and money to retain its ability to conduct 
executions in a manner now held impermissibly cruel.

RED ALERT FOR THE RED LINE; U.S. HALTS FUNDING AMID CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a systemic problem within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
that is causing sloppy and poorly monitored construction on the Metro Rail 
subway? If so, that could jeopardize federal funding for Los Angeles' huge mass 
transit project. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday the Federal Transit Administration ordered a halt in federal 
funding for the Red Line until questions regarding construction and management 
of the multibillion-dollar subway -- the biggest public works project in the 
country -- are resolved. The federal agency also ordered a continued halt of 
tunneling in Hollywood, which already had been suspended because of surface 
sinkage and failure of braces. 
</P>
<P>
 NO DOUBT: These stunning developments should dispel any doubt about the need 
for a make-over of the MTA. That should include dissolving the Rail 
Construction Corp., the MTA subsidiary created specifically to build the subway 
in partnership with private-sector contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We perceive there to be inadequate management controls at the (MTA) for 
executing the (subway) project," FTA Administrator Gordon J. Linton wrote in a 
letter informing the MTA of the freeze in federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the culpability for the construction problems rests with the RCC. The 
subsidiary not only has it own board of political appointees who recommend 
changes and contract awards to the MTA (itself governed by a 13-member board of 
elected officials) but also has quality-control oversight and monitoring 
responsibilities. The RCC assumed authority over rail construction when the 
Southern California Rapid Transit District merged with the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission in 1990 to form the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 The current structural relationship between the RCC and the MTA obscures 
accountability. Each time a problem has surfaced, RCC officials insist 
procedures were adequately followed. Yet new problems seem to emerge 
constantly. When The Times first reported trouble with tunnels in the subway's 
Downtown leg, MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin White ordered an outside 
review, which later verified some problems in construction and management. 
</P>
<P>
 NO END: The latest problem, involving tunneling in Hollywood, prompted White 
last week to order another outside review. Separately, on Tuesday -- a day 
before the federal censure -- MTA officials issued a scathing condemnation of 
their own based on MTA inspection records. They said the reports "strongly 
indicated" that the tunneling contractor had failed to place high-strength 
concrete or grout in joints of the outer shell along a mile and a half of 
tunnel beneath Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. That failure is not 
going to bolster public confidence in the safety of those tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 White has made a proposal to dissolve the RCC, a proposal that will be 
considered by the MTA board. MTA Board Chairman Ed Edelman must convene board 
members as soon as possible to discuss this and other actions necessary to 
restore credibility -- and federal funding -- to Metro Rail.

HOMELESS WATCH; WINTER SALVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congress, approaching adjournment this Friday, has a final chance to help 
homeless Americans before the onset of winter makes life on the streets even 
more miserable. It should approve an ambitious Clinton Administration plan to 
help get poor people off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bold federal plan would double the homelessness budget of the Department 
of Housing and Urban Development. The price tag is daunting, $1.6 billion, but 
so is the problem. On any given night as many as 500,000 men, women and 
children across the nation are without permanent shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of them, housing isn't enough . One in four homeless adults needs 
drug treatment also. One in three requires mental health medication or 
counseling. Most need job training and other support to help them get out of 
public shelters and into permanent housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's well-thought-out plan would reform the current hodgepodge 
of homelessness services, eliminate wasteful duplication and emphasize 
strategies that have proved successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would bring Los Angeles $40 million next year because federal funds 
would be allocated on the basis of local poverty and unemployment rates. 
Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino and Riverside counties would share $46 million. 
Even though Washington would provide the money, the feds wouldn't dictate 
solutions. They would allow local authorities to tailor homeless programs to 
specific local needs. 
</P>
<P>
 This creative plan could go a long way toward thinning the ranks of the 
homeless. It merits Congress' approval.

 China has assured the United States -- yet again -- that it's ready to commit 
itself to efforts to control the spread of missile technology. In exchange, the 
Clinton Administration will lift the trade sanctions it imposed on China 14 
months ago, making it possible for Beijing to buy from American companies a 
number of communications and other satellites worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration insists, as a senior official put it, that "this is not an 
economic decision" but rather a "non-proliferation decision." Fair enough. The 
question now is whether China can be counted on to hold up its end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The question has to be asked because of what has gone before. In 1991 China 
promised Washington that it would abide by the terms of what's called the 
Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), under which technologically advanced 
countries have agreed to try to limit the spread of missiles, notably those 
that could deliver nuclear weapons. In August, 1993, however, the Clinton 
Administration announced it had "unambiguous evidence" that China had in fact 
delivered technology for its surface-to-surface M-11 missile to Pakistan, a 
country that for many years has pursued a nuclear weapons program. The trade 
sanctions followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTCR covers missiles with a range of at least 186 miles and able to carry 
warheads of up to 1,100 pounds. Relatively cheap and easily transportable, 
these could become poor countries' strategic delivery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agreement with China, while a step toward strengthening 
non-proliferation, falls short of completeness. Beijing still hasn't committed 
itself to adhering fully to the MTCR, as Moscow recently said Russia would. It 
has only agreed to continue talks with the United States to resolve the two 
countries' differences over missile exports. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves an area of ambiguity that China, as it has in the past, could 
exploit to its advantage. All this provides a powerful incentive for the United 
States -- and other concerned countries -- to continue trying to persuade 
Beijing to keep tight controls over its technology exports, especially to 
countries that pose a threat to their neighbors. The proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction is inherently destabilizing. The major powers, and China is 
one of them, must be leaders in working to head off such threats.

 Re "Getting Out Alive, Bearly," Sept. 20: 
</P>
<P>
 Humans can be so arrogant and pompous. To remove a bear from his natural 
environment (that we have encroached on), from his family and happy life, file 
down his teeth, which there can be no possible justification for, and oh yes, 
"thank you," not destroy him, seems completely absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 To the people or person who had Samson removed -- you live in an area where 
regular sightings of wild animals occur. I understand that you are concerned 
about your and your family's safety. If that is the case, then possibly you 
should think about living somewhere else. If that is not an option, then maybe 
you could put together a "neighborhood wildlife awareness program" for people, 
children, etc., on how to be careful and cautious of curious or possibly 
dangerous wild animals. 
</P>
<P>
 It is natural for humans and animals to be curious about their environments. 
However, the way to solving this problem of people encroaching on animals is 
not by simply removing the animal from his or her home. Maybe we should be 
educating people on how to live more harmoniously with wild animals in our 
overpopulated world.

SIMPSON JURY SELECTION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Divining Potential Jurors' Real Racial Attitudes a Daunting Challenge," by 
Bill Boyarsky, Sept. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 What makes anyone so smug that they think they can devise a questionnaire to 
determine jurors' hidden bigotries without revealing their own? Every human 
being has biases, even Mother Teresa. The only truly honest among us are those 
who recognize their natural biases, put them in their proper prospective and 
don't let them be destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 One consultant asks: "Is there any reason why you would hesitate to buy a 
Japanese car?" This question shows that the consultant believes this will root 
out a prejudice against people of color, but a fuller explanation may be that 
many Americans hesitate to buy German cars, especially Jews, and even more 
refuse to buy cars from Sweden or England because they want to keep other 
Americans, including racial minorities, working in American factories. 
</P>
<P>
 This consultant harbors an obvious stereotypical prejudice that Americans are 
likely to be more racist than others. A little objective knowledge of world 
history, and reading any newspaper, indicates that we are no more racist than 
any other group, and less than most.

 * Re "Jury System Is Held in Low Regard by Most," Times Poll, Sept. 27: 
</P>
<P>
 Traced originally in the Anglo-Saxon courts around the 12th Century, today, 
outside of some English-speaking countries, there is less recourse to a jury 
and more voices are raised about eliminating it. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the reason of using a number of naturally biased and mostly 
undereducated persons to follow the complicated advice and incomprehensible 
instructions given by the bench? 
</P>
<P>
 Also, why should a jury of 12 people offer always a unanimous decision when 
the nine members of this country's Supreme Court almost always express a 
dissenting opinion?

 * Would it be possible to change the way jurors are selected? How about a pool 
of people who have chosen to be jurors, are well-trained, tested and certified 
in a program to produce competent jurors, and reasonably compensated for their 
work? They would be available for the months they have signed up for, and then 
would be selected randomly. 
</P>
<P>
 A system using people who want to be jurors would eliminate the lengthy 
process of trying to form a jury with people who can't serve.

 Re "The Soul Mate With the Ideas: Mrs. Huffington," by Stephen Games, Opinion, 
Aug. 21: Once again, I'm writing to correct misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third time on record, the Church of the Movement of Spiritual Inner 
Awareness is not a "Santa Monica-based church," nor is MSIA pronounced 
"Messiah."In the 12 years that I have been involved in the church, I have never 
heard anyone refer to MSIA as "Messiah," so that is outdated information at 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the statement about John-Roger being "written about in the press as a 
free-spending Rasputin, charges he has denied," what is the point in printing 
that? I find it objectionable practice that the press gives itself free license 
to print just about anything about anybody by merely calling it an "allegation" 
or a "charge." The function of the press seems to have changed dramatically 
from that of reporting the news of the day as a public service to printing what 
sells. 
</P>
<P>
 I realize the corrections about which I have been writing to you may seem 
trivial to The Times, but again, it just points up to me that I cannot trust 
what is printed in the press if corrections to misinformation are simply 
ignored by journalists. I find that deeply disappointing.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: A CUBA POLICY DRIVEN BY SADISTIC ZEAL; THE 
U.S. EMBARGO HOBBLES LIFESAVING MEDICAL CARE. WHY DON'T U.S. DOCTORS PROTEST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The United States is killing Cubans every day. The victims are mostly over 65, 
and they are dying from such diseases as TB, influenza and pneumonia. It's the 
kind of carnage registered in small upticks on a mortality graph, not as easy 
to focus on as, say, a pile of bodies dismembered by U.S.-trained troops in El 
Salvador in the early 1980s. But the killing, engineered by the U.S. 
government, is just as relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's crisis began with the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late 1980s, 
but real devastation commenced with the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, 
reluctantly signed into law by President Bush in order to head off candidate 
Clinton, who had been eagerly promoting the bill in Florida. The new law 
severely tightened the 33-year U.S. embargo on trade with Cuba, banning 
shipments to Cuba from any subsidiaries of U.S. firms. Foreign ships visiting 
Cuba are banned from docking at U.S. ports for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. government officials have been enforcing the 1992 law with sadistic zeal. 
They once banned a shipment of Colombian chickens to Cuba because their diet 
consisted of American-made chicken feed. Goods produced outside the United 
States containing less than 10% U.S.-origin components aren't banned under the 
act. But the United States determined that by the time of shipment, the 
American feed was reckoned to make up more than one-tenth of the chicken. It 
would take the pen of Jonathan Swift to address this level of bureaucratic 
madness. Would a Somalian kid fed on humanitarian shipments be able to claim 
U.S. citizenship because he had been raised on corn from the Midwest? 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is sadistic and deadly. Cuba was able to import a European-made 
water-purification system that contained filters made in the United States. But 
the sale of replacement filters was prohibited. So now the whole system is 
useless. Deaths in Cuba from diseases such as diarrhea, associated with unsafe 
drinking water, have been rising since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical donations are sometimes permitted from private U.S. organizations, but 
only under maniacally tortuous on-site supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba can buy food and medical supplies from other countries, but pays about 
30% more than U.S. prices; shipping costs are anywhere from 50% to 4,000% 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such duress, imports of medicines and medical supplies have declined by 
about 40%. Substitution of some American products is impossible: X-ray film for 
breast-cancer detection; replacement parts for respirators, Spanish-language 
medical books from a firm bought by a U.S. conglomerate. Bibliographic searches 
are impossible for Cuban doctors, since they can't use the National Library of 
Medicine's MEDLAR indexing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1993, Cuba's overall mortality rate rose 15%, with a 79% 
increase from flu and pneumonia attributed to lack of antibiotics. Since the 
Cuban medical system gives priority to women and children, the elderly and men 
are bearing the brunt of the shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 Rationing protects the weak. Nonetheless, even though overall infant mortality 
continues to decline, babies with birth weights under 5 1/2 pounds rose by 
nearly 2% from 1989 to 1993, wiping out 10 years of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuba's health system has always been one of the great achievements of the 
Castro years. Childhood malnutrition disappeared. Immunization coverage for 
those under 2 is still higher than 90%. The population over 65 increased from 
4.8% to 8.9% in 20 years and life expectancy at birth is 75 years, the highest 
in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one physician to every 214 residents and the number of physicians 
continues to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 This public-health system is resilient, and shows no sign of the sort of 
collapse suffered by nations in the former Soviet Union. When a shortage of B 
vitamins caused 50,662 Cubans to go temporarily (and 200 permanently) blind 
back in 1993, health workers were quick in distributing the necessary 
supplements to every household. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuban people are dying because of the U.S. siege, and one question is: 
What is the American medical community going to do about it? Almost all the 
major associations have kept their mouths obediently shut. The only one that 
fought the 1992 bill publicly was the American Public Health Assn. When its own 
material interests are threatened, no group is more tigerish in self-defense 
than American physicians. Is it beyond the powers of one of the most powerful 
U.S. lobbies to urge its government to drop this barbaric siege?

PERSPECTIVE ON CONGRESS; TALKING DEMOCRACY TO DEATH; SENATE FILIBUSTERS HAVE 
KILLED OR COMPROMISED A RAFT OF CRUCIAL LEGISLATION. THIS ISN'T GOVERNING; IT'S 
TREACHERY THAT MUST STOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
By ELLIOT L. RICHARDSON, Elliot L. Richardson, a Republican, was secretary of 
Health, Education and Welfare, secretary of defense and attorney general under 
President Nixon, and a special diplomatic representative under Presidents 
Carter, Bush and Clinton.

 If the Senate operated by majority rule, Congress would have passed a campaign 
finance reform law last week. It also would have adopted the first major 
telecommunications reform law in 50 years, reined in the giveaway of 
taxpayer-owned gold to private mining companies and perhaps adopted a 
compromise health-care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these bills is now dead for Congress, because a filibuster frenzy has 
made majority rule the exception rather than the rule in the Senate. This week, 
filibusters continue to threaten school funding, toxic-waste cleanup, and other 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 When senators filibuster, using parliamentary tactics to block the Senate from 
voting, they turn democracy on its head. Since the Senate's current rules 
require three-fifths of the Senate to break a filibuster, 41 members can hold 
the Senate hostage, even if 59 are ready to take action. The majority must 
either allow the bill to die, or pay whatever legislative ransom is demanded -- 
sometimes a multimillion dollar handout for a senator's favorite college or 
highway, sometimes changes in policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue isn't whether we are for or against whatever bill is the 
filibuster's victim. There are times when a nation's future may depend on 
whether its citizens can rise above policy differences and take a stand for 
democracy. This is such a time. At stake is our government's ability to make 
decisions and take action. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I've joined 25 of our nation's most respected leaders, both 
Republicans, such as former Sens. Barry Goldwater, Charles McC. Mathias and 
Robert Stafford, and Democrats, such as former Sens. William Proxmire, Birch 
Bayh and Gaylord Nelson, in launching the Action, Not Gridlock! campaign to 
sound an alarm: A filibuster frenzy gravely threatens our government's ability 
to act to meet the nation's pressing challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 We have had more filibusters in the last four years than in the Senate's first 
140 years combined. Today, the ever-present threat of a filibuster, whether by 
Republicans or Democrats, affects nearly every issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, for example, our government was forced to give away $10 billion of 
gold on federal land. Why? Because filibuster threats blocked efforts to fix 
the Gold Rush-era mining law requiring this giveaway and dozens more in the 
months ahead, giveaways of billions of dollars that come out of our pockets as 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Founding Fathers would be appalled to learn that the framework they had 
labored so valiantly to construct had been perverted by the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there must be ample opportunity for expression of minority views, 
and perhaps even additional incentive for a majority to seek broader agreement. 
Some have suggested, for example, that the number of senators needed to break a 
filibuster might decline from 60 to 51 as a filibuster dragged on. But using 
the fiction of "extended debate" as a means of blocking action on urgent 
problems is a corruption of the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 Senators need not await a rules change to regain their self-restraint and 
their respect for the democratic process. Just as we forswear using chemical 
weapons in war, senators should forswear using filibusters in legislative 
combat. Such scorched-earth tactics may win a battle but leave the democratic 
process in ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of us has a choice. We can choose gridlock and policy by ransom, or we 
can choose democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Action, Not Gridlock! says to our senators: We pay you to make decisions, not 
to stand in the way and make no decisions. So vote for or against legislation, 
but respect democracy and majority rule. Give the Senate back its right to 
vote, and give Americans back their right to action. No more filibusters.

 Memorandum to Colin Powell, from a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 As you may have noticed, you're on the cover of Newsweek. The headline blares: 
"Will Colin Powell Run for President?" Inside, citing polls showing you 15 
points ahead of President Clinton, columnist Joe Klein predicts that you "won't 
be able to resist the ultimate challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations -- you've got the Big Mo. Now what do you do? Remember what 
happened to another larger-than-life icon, Ross Perot. In 1992, riding an 
earlier wave of public revulsion with politics as usual, he was ahead of both 
Clinton and George Bush. But as the voters focused on the substance of his 
style, they could see that Perot was, as they say in Texas, all hat and no 
cattle, and so he fizzled. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are interested in running, you're going to have to start talking about 
"the issues." You say you were fighting for your country when those other guys 
were safely stateside in wonky grad school? Too bad. You're on their terrain 
now, with new rules of engagement. You have two ways to proceed. Option A is to 
start reading new manuals. Get briefed on everything from capital gains to the 
Superfund to managed competition. Does that sound as dull as trajectory 
calculations in artillery school? Sure, but remember, reporters' questions are 
as clever as a Viet Cong booby trap: They earn their stars by helping statesmen 
wannabes blow themselves up. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Option B: Pick one big issue that you already understand, that builds 
on your own experience and moral authority and about which you can speak from 
the heart -- without cue cards! That's what the last hero general who got 
elected President did. Dwight ("I will go to Korea") Eisenhower was a leader 
above petty politics, the man with the plan for defending the Free World. He 
carried 39 states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War is over. As America looks inward, the biggest problem we see is 
poverty, the underclass and associated ills from crime-hyped flight from the 
cities to the sense that inequality and despair are eroding our collective 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Clinton said we should "end welfare as we know it." That 
sounded good then, but nothing's happened since. The Republicans are no better 
-- they'd rather attack Murphy Brown than suggest something what would work. 
That's what would work -- work . Sixty years ago, Franklin D. Roosevelt said 
welfare was "a narcotic." FDR's idea was that the unemployed were underutilized 
assets, not permanent victims. So he set up the Civilian Conservation Corps to 
offer honest toil to anyone who wanted it. Outside of Washington, that's what 
people still believe in. This isn't a right-wing country or a left-wing 
country. Heartland America still believes, as Roosevelt did, in "the moral and 
spiritual value" of labor. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where you come in. You grew up in the South Bronx -- man, you've been 
there. Your own story is a testament to the power of hard work. You had the 
chance to serve your country -- and you were transformed in the process. So why 
not extend that opportunity to the next generation of poor minority kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has set up a weenie national-service program that will pay 20,000 
"volunteers" to be interns at Planned Parenthood. That's no solution. We need a 
million kids out of the ghetto and into the fresh air. The old CCC planted 3 
billion trees. If you decide to keep Al Gore around, you could double that 
total and launch the recycling equivalent of Desert Storm. We can use all those 
shut-down military bases and laid-off drill sergeants, not as jailers, but as 
guides to a new life for the unlucky. As Jack Kemp says, there must be 
something in between more gun control on the left and building more prisons on 
the right.  
</P>
<P>
 Is the CCC "Big Government"? The issue isn't big vs. small, it's smart vs. 
dumb. Smart Government should do a few things well, rather than a lot of things 
badly. If you ask, both Jesse Jackson and Bill Bennett would jump at the chance 
to help you. They've been wrestling with the problem of discipline and virtue 
for some time; only you could unite them on the same all-star team. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be your message: Save America. The other issues are potato peels by 
comparison. Do the right thing. Generate a groundswell. Show people that you 
can trump the static stupid two-party debate by pointing toward a better way. 
You'll win in a landslide.

'BLOWN SIDEWAYS' AN ANGRY, FUNNY STORY OF HOPE

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Claudia Shear has been a brunch chef, a hat-check girl, a fake secretary for a 
guy pulling a con involving pens. She has been instructed "no phone calls," "no 
eating," "always give your name," "never, never give your name." She has held 
64 jobs, and she has learned that "everyone has a story that can stop your 
heart." To prove it, she tells you one -- her story. On Tuesday, "Blown 
Sideways Through Life," Shear's one-woman Off Broadway sensation, landed at the 
Coronet Theatre for a limited engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Shear doesn't look much older than 30, so simple math will tell you that some 
jobs were of "unusually short duration"; one lasted as long as it took her to 
make a bunch of personal phone calls and say "(expletive) you!" to the manager 
at Bar Lui in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, she is a little angry. She cites a hilarious list of the things she 
said or would liked to have said to the cretins who bossed her around and 
treated her badly in a string of menial jobs. "A bad attitude?" she asks, in 
mock disbelief to one invisible employer. "You can't possibly imagine my 
(expletive) attitude!" And my favorite (the first sentence is spoken calmly; 
the second, enraged): "I'm sorry I don't know anything about pastry cream. Now 
let's have a conversation about all the things I know that you don't!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Shear is not simply a disgruntled worker, resentful of being told what to 
do. She possesses ultra-sensitive radar for dehumanizing behavior from people 
who have power over other people. And she understands this behavior as 
completely unnecessary. As a young runaway, overweight, poor and without 
connections, she was at the mercy of every whim, every insulting rule, every 
nasty corner that life can back you into. But she never, ever believed that she 
belonged there. Or at least, not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Her most extended employment story is a tale about answering phones in a 
Manhattan whorehouse. Her descriptions of the women who worked there -- and did 
not answer phones -- is heartbreaking, though never sentimental. One woman 
dreams of being a dog groomer, and we sense the impossibility of her making 
even that simple dream ever come true. Also heartbreaking is Shear's admission 
that, as a 200-pound woman who always wore the same skirt, made of gray 
upholstery fabric (she called herself "the human sofa"), she was actually 
envious of the other women. "Men liked them," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 When she loses that job she applies to another whorehouse. Walking down an 
empty corridor she sees a woman, fully dressed, lying on a bed, staring at the 
ceiling. That image of quiet despair drove her out of the whorehouse and into 
other, more healthful adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So she squirreled away money and took dancing lessons, fencing lessons, 
Italian lessons, and eventually wound up in Rome, in a bizarre film directed by 
a Fellini manque. Along the way, there were other moments, defining moments, 
the rare job or person that made her feel valuable. There was the painter for 
whom she posed naked, who made her "not just pretty, like a girl at a table in 
Raoul's in a size six dress from Barneys" looking around to see who is watching 
her, but beautiful, like a woman in a painting. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the quintessential act of being looked at and recognized for one's true 
worth that clinches Shear's self-esteem, as it does for most of us. For Shear 
that moment comes during an Outward Bound survival trip, in the form of a 
remark made by her instructor that reverberated inside her and, one senses, 
will continue to throughout her life. In Shear's words, it was a moment when 
"someone shows you a portrait of yourself -- clean, clear and totally 
unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Loy Arcenas' lovely set alludes to Shear's image of herself as a work of art, 
with a painterly backdrop and an oddly shaped artist's canvas behind the 
actress. Arcenas also supplies part of a theatrical red curtain that, under 
Christopher Akerlind's lights, looks as rich as if Degas had painted it. The 
lighting is extremely sensitive to the shifting moods of the piece. Christopher 
Ashley's direction must be credited for the seamless quality of the monologue 
and the fact that it never is boring. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a graceful setting for the story of an anonymous person who never forgets 
that she has something to say. And now she takes the ultimate revenge: She's 
saying it and saying it gloriously. More important, hers is a story of hope for 
others who might not yet have found that portrait of themselves -- clean, clear 
and totally unexpected.

TWO SERIES, ONE IDEA: KIDS HOME ALONE; THESE TV ORPHANS MIGHT NOT HAVE MANY 
REAL-LIFE COUNTERPARTS, BUT EXPERTS SAY THE SHOWS REFLECT TRENDS OCCURRING 
WITHIN FAMILIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the first episode of Fox's "Party of Five," an hourlong drama about five 
white middle-class siblings whose parents have died, 16-year-old Bailey 
Salinger tells his 15-year-old sister: "We gotta seem in charge, Julia! We 
gotta seem like we can handle everything ourselves -- like a normal family. Or 
else they have an excuse to split us up." 
</P>
<P>
 In the first installment of ABC's "On Our Own," a half-hour sitcom about seven 
black middle-class children in the same situation, 14-year-old Jazz Jerrico is 
telling four of her brothers and a sister: "That lady in there is a social 
worker. She gonna split us up if we don't get a relative to take care of us, so 
our aunt moved here from Memphis." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the aunt, or the person posing that way for the benefit of the 
Department of Children and Family Services, is the oldest brother, 20-year-old 
Josh. The eldest Salinger is 24-year-old Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new series, two different approaches to a single theme: children taking 
care of themselves. In each case, the parents have been killed in an automobile 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Sid Johnson, executive director of the American Public Welfare Assn., said 
that the number of real-life counterparts of these two orphan families would 
"not be statistically significant." Nevertheless, he and other child and family 
experts see in the two new series a metaphor for the state of many American 
children today: "home alone," either physically or emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a phenomenon in families in which older teen-agers are assuming more 
responsibility than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago," Johnson said. "(The two 
series) may reflect some quieter trends within families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are unquestionably fewer parents in neighborhoods and communities 
during the day than there were before two-earner families and single-parent 
families became as prevalent as they are today. Teen-agers are taking more and 
more of the parents' responsibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Victor C. Strasberger, chairman of the communications committee of the 
American Academy of Pediatrics, said, "Kids are always dealing these days with 
the potential loss of their parents, and that's called divorce . So this 
(orphan concept) isn't that far a stretch for a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is divorce or parents too busy to tend to their kids, whether it is 
a couple in Chicago who leave their 9- and 4-year-old daughters home alone for 
nine days over Christmas while they go on vacation, or another in Pittsburgh 
who consign four children for 16 days to a 14-year-old baby-sitter, the premise 
of these series is striking a chord with the experts (although not with the 
general public; ratings for both have been low). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like children thumbing their noses at the adults who have abandoned 
them," said Ellen McGrath, a Laguna Beach psychologist and president of the 
media division of the American Psychological Assn. "(They) say, 'Well, so what? 
We don't need you anyway.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at any criteria of support for children," she implored. "The way we 
treat education, how it's become such a low priority. The way we treat abused 
children, that we have no social system that can adequately respond to that. 
The way we abandon middle-class children, that parents either have to work and 
can't provide backup support -- the latchkey generation -- or the parents are 
self-absorbed in their own interests so they don't see the children as the No. 
1 priority for their time." 
</P>
<P>
 These series, she added, "suggest an enormous amount of mistrust toward 
adults, the kind of thing the spokespeople for Generation X speak of. They're 
saying we have failed them terribly, we are stupid, we can't be trusted, and 
we're fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those interviewed cited a 1990 study by the Child Welfare League of 
America, revealing that 42% of children ages 5-9 in rural, urban and suburban 
areas were left alone to care for themselves occasionally, if not regularly. 
Percentages ranged from 28% for kindergartners to 77% for third-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidentally, as these series debuted last month, the national media were 
reporting numbers showing that the old "Ozzie and Harriet" family ideal was 
vanishing. In post-World War II America, seven out of 10 children grew up in a 
family with both biological parents married to each other; by 1991, only half 
lived within that definition of family. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives with the two shows said they didn't necessarily have these figures 
in mind when they developed the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 When "On Our Own" executive producer Robert L. Boyett and his partners first 
pitched a "latchkey" concept for "On Our Own," the audience was to have seen 
"the bottom legs of two trousers and shoes and the bottom of a skirt and heels 
go out the front door in the morning," and the same trousers and heels 
"returning at night." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when they hired an actual family of six siblings -- the Smolletts, 
with comedian Ralph Louis Harris as the oldest child -- that they dropped the 
parental presence. "We really didn't have room" for more characters at that 
point, Boyett said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bare-bones idea of siblings without parents on "Party of Five" originated 
with Sandy Grushow, then president of Fox Entertainment Group, who insisted 
that he was simply seeking to "empower" teen-agers the same way the series 
"Beverly Hills, 90210" had done; the idea was "purely coincidental to anything 
happening in society." 
</P>
<P>
 Executive producer Amy Lippman said that "Party" "allows us to tell stories in 
which kids are solving problems in a way that probably isn't such a stretch 
(from) real life."  
</P>
<P>
 David Blankenhorn, executive director of the Institute for American Values, 
cautioned that from a child's point of view, a movie like "Home Alone" or these 
series suggests that youngsters can "outwit the bad guys, without mom and dad. 
With the proliferation of this theme, you really have an adult fiction: that 
children don't need adults, and that children can get along without adult 
attention. We're becoming more adult-centered, parents are spending less time 
with their kids, there's more family fragmentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the experts, however, were heartened by the message of "Party of Five" 
and "On Our Own" about families staying together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the spirit of them," said Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a Harvard psychiatrist 
who was an adviser on "The Cosby Show." "It does carry a message of family 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Jim Brennan, a senior staff member at the National Assn. of Social 
Workers, put it: "It's 'Ozzie and Harriet' without Ozzie and Harriet." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Party of Five" airs Mondays at 9 p.m. on Fox (Channels 11 and 6). "On Our 
Own" airs Sundays at 7:30 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42).

 A Real-Life Re-Enactment?: Herbert Stempel, the real-life "Quiz Show" 
contestant who lost his title to tipped-off opponent Charles Van Doren, 
returned to the scene of the crime -- NBC's Studio 6A in New York -- on Tuesday 
and demanded a rematch. Some 40 years after the fix on the show "Twenty-One" 
was exposed, Stempel issued his challenge to Van Doren during an appearance on 
"Late Night With Conan O'Brien," which is taped in the same studio where the 
game show was held. "I would like to play Charles Van Doren anywhere, anytime 
and anyplace for charity," said Stempel, who is played by John Turturro in the 
film "Quiz Show." "I would like to play him right here on your show." A rematch 
is unlikely. Van Doren has kept a low profile since the scandal and has not 
cooperated with filmmakers or writers. TELEVISION

 Shuffling Newsmagazines: In the wake of the strong ratings for NBC's hospital 
drama "ER" at 10 p.m. on Thursday nights, ABC News plans to move its strongest 
newsmagazine, "PrimeTime Live," out of that competing time slot. The move, 
effective in January with the season's end of "Monday Night Football," will 
prompt a shuffle among several of ABC's newsmagazines. "PrimeTime Live" will 
move to Wednesday nights, following "Grace Under Fire" and "Ellen" on one of 
ABC's strongest nights. "Turning Point" will move from Wednesday night to 
Monday night, and "Day One," which has been on hiatus, will move into 
"PrimeTime Live's" Thursday slot, opposite "ER." The strong ratings for the NBC 
hospital drama had already prompted CBS to move its rival hospital show, 
"Chicago Hope," from the 10 p.m. Thursday slot to an earlier 9 p.m. slot, 
starting tonight.

 A Window for Viewpoints: NBC says it was only a coincidence, but "Today" show 
viewers got a taste of a network labor dispute Tuesday during a segment on how 
to negotiate for a raise. Viewers at home saw protesting representatives of the 
National Assn. of Broadcast Employees and Technicians through the "Today" set's 
street-level window behind anchors Katie Couric and Matt Lauer. The NABET 
representatives were holding a large sign reading "NBC Workers Must Get Fair 
Contract." An NBC spokeswoman said that it was only a coincidence that the 
cameras shot the sign during the job-negotiation segment, since NABET 
representatives have been staked out with signs at the "Today" show window for 
several days. NABET, the union that includes the network's cameramen and other 
technical employees, hasn't had a contract since March 31 and negotiations 
broke down again last week. NBC has not bleeped out the signs or changed the 
angle of its cameras onto Rockefeller Center since the NABET workers arrived.

 TV Programs Honored: Eight television programs were honored Wednesday by 
Advocates for Youth with the 10th annual Nancy Susan Reynolds Awards for 
"outstanding portrayals of family planning, sexuality and reproductive health." 
The winners were episodes of ABC's "Family Matters" and "Roseanne," and CBS' 
"Picket Fences"; an "ABC Afterschool Special" called "Jacqui's Dilemma"; the 
HBO documentaries "The Broadcast Tapes of Dr. Peter" and "Why Am I Gay? Stories 
of Coming Out in America"; the ABC soap opera "General Hospital," and the HBO 
movie "And the Band Played On." Advocates for Youth (formerly the Center for 
Population Options) is a nonprofit organization working to prevent pregnancy 
and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases among teen-agers. POP/ROCK

 Concert Changes: The Eagles have rescheduled their "Hell Freezes Over" Rose 
Bowl date for Jan. 21. The concert was planned for Saturday, but was postponed 
Monday along with the rest of the Eagles' tour because of Glenn Frey's chronic 
gastrointestinal disorder. Frey is scheduled to undergo surgery to correct the 
disorder at an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital today. . . . Health problems 
have also forced the dropping of the 25th anniversary tour of Crosby, Stills & 
Nash, who were to have performed at Universal Amphitheatre Oct. 17 and 18. The 
cancellation was prompted by a liver ailment suffered by member David Crosby, 
53, who is being considered for an organ transplant. Doctors have said there's 
a good chance for full recovery, and fellow band member Graham Nash said the 
band now intends to tour next summer. QUICK TAKES

UNITED PARAMOUNT UNVEILS ITS LINEUP; TELEVISION: FILM STUDIO'S MOVE TO SMALL 
SCREEN STARTS IN JANUARY. A NEW 'STAR TREK' SERIES IS THE KICKOFF SHOW.

 The United Paramount network, one of two new broadcast networks being launched 
by major film studios, on Wednesday announced its premiere lineup of dramas and 
comedies that will debut in January with a new "Star Trek" series. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucille S. Salhany, president and chief executive officer for the network, 
told a news conference that she believes United Paramount will triumph over the 
network being launched by Warner Bros. because of a stronger station lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the network, which initially will program only two nights a week, 
will be seen locally on KCOP-TV Channel 13. 
</P>
<P>
 United Paramount will kick off Jan. 16 with the two-hour premiere of "Star 
Trek: Voyager," which thereafter will be seen Mondays at 8 p.m., starting Jan. 
23. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 17 at 8 p.m., "Marker," starring Richard Grieco, will debut. Grieco 
plays the estranged son of a wealthy businessman who dies, leaving him a 
lifetime of markers and debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marker" will be followed at 9 p.m. by "The Watcher," an anthology series set 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Premiering Jan. 23 are two comedies, "Platypus Man," starring comedian Richard 
Jeni as the host of a cable cooking show, and "Pig Sty," about five men sharing 
a two-room apartment. The comedies will air from 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in development as a backup series is another drama, "Legend," a Western 
starring Richard Dean Anderson, the former star of "MacGyver." 
</P>
<P>
 Salhany said she hopes United Paramount will expand to three nights a week 
within the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros.' WB network also plans to launch in January, with one night of 
programming that will be seen locally on KTLA-TV Channel 5. WB also is 
developing a three-hour block of Saturday-morning children's programming for 
the fall of 1995.

ART REVIEW; CONVENTION UNITES WITH GAY FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Keith Mayerson's second solo show is a visual hallucination waiting for viewer 
participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "The Marriage of Heaven and Hell!," his intentionally disparate body of 
work at Richard Telles Fine Art is charming, barbed, baffling and wacky. 
Nevertheless, Mayerson's over-the-top piling up of pictures, styles and media 
is too confused to rise above its no-holds-barred embrace of open-ended 
potential. 
</P>
<P>
 Consisting of 106 paintings, drawings and photographs -- or about 10 times the 
number of works in an average exhibition -- his jam-packed, salon-style display 
resembles a mad-cap collection of seven or eight storyboards whose individual 
cels have been shuffled like cards and arranged in loose, thematic clusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than weaving specific stories, Mayerson's mix-and-match groupings 
elicit generic moods and evoke vague ambiences. 
</P>
<P>
 New Yorker-style cartoons, describing a dozen unverifiable Keanu Reaves 
sightings, are juxtaposed with thickly painted portraits of pets. Exquisite 
black-and-white drawings adorned with poetic inscriptions in French hang beside 
snapshots of a gray-haired man masturbating. And album-cover psychedelia from 
the 1960s serves as an all-purpose backdrop for bright acrylics in which a 
couple of boys have fantastic homo-erotic adventures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayerson's best series is based on an irreverent gloss of the comic strip 
"Archie." Any one of these dense, pastel-toned watercolors embodies more 
upended cliches than any other series exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
 This component of Mayerson's show stands out because it effectively fuses 
interpretive freedom with artistic intention. Multi-layered ambiguity and 
pointed specificity dovetail in these drawings' marriage of Middle American 
domesticity and outlandish gay fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Mayerson's other pictures look transitory and apologetic, like 
guilt-ridden efforts whose labor intensity is meant to make up for their lack 
of purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his myriad new works are not as endearing nor as loaded as those in 
his first exhibition, "Pinocchio the Big Fag," they still allow the promising, 
28-year-old, L.A.-based artist to flaunt his facility as an illustrator and to 
demonstrate his strengths as a spinner of poignantly twisted -- if indistinct 
-- tales.

 Feminine Mystique: Ellen Phelan's 10 beautiful paintings at Patricia Faure 
Gallery depict ghostly landscapes, dark flowers and creepy dolls. Endowed with 
a sinister edge, these conventional symbols of femininity are both more and 
less than what they appear to be. In the New York-based artist's seductively 
understated oils-on-linen, images seem to vanish before your eyes, only to 
stamp themselves indelibly in your memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelan's haunting land and seascapes look as if they are made of nothing but 
air. Vaporous washes of turpentine and diaphanous veils of color appear to 
drift above the surfaces of these paintings at the same time that the images 
they conjure appear to recede into the depths of illusionistic space. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of Phelan's mysterious images of fog-shrouded trees and cloud-covered 
seas, shadowy absences and shimmering presences shift positions with mesmeric 
intensity. Silent, timeless serenity teeters on the cusp of unimaginable 
disaster. Even the artist's most benignly attractive pictures seem hinged on 
the brink of impending tragedies or poised in the moment after barely averted 
traumas.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of Phelan's dolls and flowers bear similar burdens, especially those 
painted in elegiac grays and muted browns. Paradoxically, the starkest, most 
explicit images are the least captivating. "Ballerina," in which a brilliant, 
blood-red bouquet explodes like fireworks, and "A Star," which depicts a female 
figure dissolving in an orange-tinted mist, too quickly yield their secrets by 
too dramatically intimating an undercurrent of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Phelan's best paintings slowly unfold over long expanses of time. 
They never articulate particular messages or describe specific locations but 
gradually build their intrigue by preventing their metaphors from being taken 
literally. 
</P>

 Hypnotic Dances: Initially, Max Cole's six stripe paintings at Kiyo Higashi 
Gallery don't look very different from a similar group of six she showed here 
exactly one year ago. Indeed, a sense of deja vu is central to her rigorous 
abstractions, in which mind-numbing patterns repeat themselves with such 
intensity and frequency that time doesn't seem to pause or stutter before them 
as much as it seems to circle back on itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's exceptionally regimented paintings creep up on you slowly. Each one is 
a little stronger than the last. Your eyes cannot rest anywhere on their 
surfaces and your mind is drawn into hypnotic dances with their uneven rhythms. 
Eventually, it becomes clear that the artist has done something different by 
doing exactly what she has done since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Her new works are denser, more physical and vigorous than before. In some, 
like "Fire Dancer," smoothly built-up bands of paint appear to pry away from 
alternating bands of bare or barely painted linen, where the irregular weave of 
the cloth is emphatically present. 
</P>
<P>
 This contrast in texture, rather than color or shape, provides a tactile grip 
for otherwise dizzying optical experiences. It also suggests speed: Velocity 
increases over the smooth, frictionless bands and decreases over the ribbed 
fabric. Cole's highly disciplined paintings build upon such shifts in movement 
to create cadences that are part of masterful choreographies.

DANCE REVIEW; NAI-NI CHEN HITS, MISSES AT CERRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a world where labels don't stick the way they used to, there are two that 
Nai-Ni Chen just can't escape -- Eastern and Western. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all over the publicity materials for her dance company, which appeared 
Tuesday and Wednesday nights at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprising, since the program (set to taped music) began with 
theatricalized Chinese folk dancing and moved into modern dance with some 
traditional echoes woven in. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of us, Chen is inevitably a combination of surrounding 
influences -- first in Taiwan and now in New Jersey, where her company is 
based. But a complex of influences are too hard to track, so we reduce it to 
East meets West, right? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that East is not just "meeting" West anymore: they've met, 
skirmished and progressed to the tango some time ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In which case, the Chen company is dancing in one of your more intriguing 
areas, where negotiation between tradition, innovation and audience is ongoing 
-- even as the labeling system continues to generalize. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, Chen began with her traditional Chinese voice, a bright 
collection of ribbon, fan and drum dances. These were particularly well staged 
and danced, with the usual bouncing, swaying walks and the unaccountably 
pleased, tilting faces. They set the patterns for Chen's new pieces, in which 
dancers also crisscross the stage a lot, move through sculptural poses and 
cluster in decorative groups. 
</P>
<P>
 These strategies worked best in "Peach Flower Landscape," the most beautiful 
and affective of the contemporary works. Women who pranced in swishy folk-dance 
lines became more introspective village maidens from Chinese utopian legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a blissful mood were the amazingly eloquent, drifting arms in which 
the company women excel. In a lyrical solo, Catherine Green seemed to wreathe 
the air around her as if she could make clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, watery arms and waving torsos in sea-colored unitards 
brought the program below sea level in "The Hidden Cove." Chen's occasional 
tendency to rely on episodic bursts of activity and a face-forward-and-present 
mentality made this work look like a bad production number for the Academy 
Awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Movable Figures" had interesting, disjointed movements based on puppets, but 
the mechanical mood and sameness of phrasing hindered development. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Du (The Passage)," a similar malaise set in. When a duet began between 
Chen and Yu Zhang (a stunningly strong and expressive dancer), it ended 
abruptly, a reminder that emotional relationships were a missing link during 
the evening.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chen herself is an electric performer with cheekbones almost like the cliffs 
on Martha Graham's face. Like Graham in "Lamentation," she used fabric to 
accentuate grief in her solo, "Journey of a Lonely Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 But where "Lamentation" showed bound struggle within tightly wrapped folds, 
Chen mourned with the free-flowing, white silken arcs of Chinese "long 
sleeves." 
</P>
<P>
 East meets West again? The challenge is not just for Chen to fuse her "home" 
traditions, but for us to remain open to receiving the combinations.

'WHAT HAPPENED': DATE MOVIE WITH AN EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-time couples looking for a good date movie may want to shy away from 
"What Happened Was. . . ." On the other hand, the first date on display in this 
film is so inexorably weird that it might actually make you appreciate your 
partner. So it could turn out to be a good date movie about a bad date. 
</P>
<P>
 Got that? 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie (Karen Sillas) is a secretary in a prestigious law firm. She's been 
eyeing Michael (Tom Noonan), a bookish type who works there as a paralegal. She 
invites him to her Manhattan loft apartment for dinner, dresses alluringly, and 
attempts to draw him out over drinks. Sirens wail faintly in the background. 
The urban grunge outside seems to have crept indoors, into Jackie's low-lit 
apartment. This isn't just a bad date movie, it's a bad date movie New York 
style.  
</P>
<P>
 "What Happened Was . . . ," directed by Noonan and scripted by him based on 
theatrical improvisations, transforms the steady-state anxiety of a first date 
into a horror scenario. What's shocking -- and gruesomely funny -- about the 
film is that it's a familiar horror. Noonan and Sillas capture the feints and 
pauses and little seductions and infelicities that punctuate The Date. But the 
movie isn't some '90s-era dating dos-and-don'ts manual for aging singles. It's 
not likely to provoke gleeful howls of recognition from its audience -- it's 
too strange for that, and too tough-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when you think the movie is turning into one of those 
reveal-your-vulnerability love-fests, it turns a corner on you. The more these 
people "open up" to each other, the creepier it all seems. Emotional openness 
in "What Happened Was . . ." isn't a latchkey to love, it's a red flag. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie and Michael's predicament may be generic but they certainly aren't. 
Their characters have been worked up in highly specific ways -- we don't always 
know where we're going with them. When Jackie reveals that she's been writing a 
children's book, and Michael agrees to listen to it, what transpires is a real 
lulu of a monologue. Jackie's story, which careens from fairy-tale innocence 
into Gothic horror, is probably meant to be taken symbolically but it's too 
clotted with psychodrama to really function for audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Michael, you tune out, but what's important here is that Jackie has 
suddenly flipped our expectations. Michael has his turn later. His light voice 
and almost spectral, weightless presence suddenly seem brackish. Noonan is 
perhaps best known to filmgoers for the creepola he played in "Manhunter" and 
he can't -- may not want to -- shake those associations in this film. Michael 
is a sensitive, broken-down, somewhat delusionary man with a dogged sense of 
justice: a phantasmal wimp steeled by a need for payback. He claims he's 
working at the law firm because he's working on a book exposing the legal 
profession.  
</P>
<P>
 As a piece of drama, "What Happened Was . . ." isn't any great shakes; it's 
essentially an actors' workshop exercise that exists primarily as a showcase 
for its cast. And because Noonan and, especially, Sillas are so good, it 
triumphs. (It won the 1994 Sun-dance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sillas has appeared in two films by the fluky minimalist Hal Hartley, and she 
can currently be seen to not particularly good advantage as a police detective 
on CBS' "Under Suspicion." She's a rare sort of actress: forbidding and yet 
emotionally naked. Sillas doesn't sentimentalize Jackie's desperation in "What 
Happened Was . . .": Jackie is an innocent with a hard edge. She's looking to 
be brought out -- redeemed -- by love. But she is also smart enough to 
recognize that only minor victories may be possible in her life anymore. She 
idealizes Michael but she's also a rock-bottom realist when the chips are down. 
"What Happened Was . . . " isn't much more than a splendid acting exercise but, 
with all the phony-baloney movies out there about romance, it seems the most 
honest of the bunch.

PLEASURES PAST

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the articles on all the restaurants that only remain in our 
memories ("Remembrances of Restaurants Past," Sept. 29). The delicious hot 
fudge sundae with the macaroon wrapped in paper, tucked in the side of your 
dish at Wil Wright's for dessert.For dinner, Scandia was my mother and father's 
favorite restaurant. The captain and hostess were not as stiff as the article 
presents them, by any means. When our family walked in, the hostess, Eva, and 
the captain, Leonard, were warm, welcoming and glad to see our family. We were 
always treated like royalty. Restaurants like Scandia are gone but can never be 
forgotten.

 Having always been far more concerned with the consumption of victuals than 
their preparation, I have long considered the Food section merely a device for 
making Thursday's Times almost as ponderous as Sunday's -- until today's 
treatise on Los Angeles restaurants gone but not forgotten. What a delightful 
exercise in gastronomic nostalgia! 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my personal favorites were the Sunset House (Sunset and Western) -- 
marvelous chef's salad in a huge wooden bowl; Bublitchki on the Strip -- great 
beef stroganoff; Carolina Pines on Melrose -- irresistible tiny sticky buns. 
And, all on La Cienega, Solly's -- an excellent steak house; Richlor's -- 
glorified hamburger steak on a wood disk, surrounded by a garland of mashed 
potatoes; Sarnez -- both night club and eatery; Smith Brothers' Fish Shanty -- 
entered through a huge gaping piscatorial mouth; Ollie Hammond's -- ideal for a 
late evening "bite to eat," and the lamented House of Murphy, notable for 
superb Caesar salad, black bottom pie and the late bohemian proprietor's sign 
"It's my life -- I live it -- I love it -- Criticism be damned!"

HOME COOKING; CLARISSE EXPLAINS IT ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARION CUNNINGHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of my favorite books about food is "Clarisse, or the Old Cook." A very 
small book, almost 100 years old, it propounds the reflections and prejudices 
of "Clarisse," the Chinese cook of an English aristocrat. There is a small note 
in the front of the book that reads: "This book is by a French connoisseur who 
wished to remain anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
 Here is an example of Clarisse's wise observations: "Do not make a fetish of 
truffles, as the bourgeois do. Truffles are excellent, but they are not 
sublime. I do not deny that they add a pleasant flavor to a chicken or to 
scrambled eggs, but people who speak of them solemnly with pursed-up lips are 
not sincere. The aroma of truffles is dry and coarse. I blame them for not 
being really worthy either of their high price or their legendary reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the book there is a sprinkling of narrative recipes, the kind that 
just rough out the cooking instructions. I've tried a few and they are, as 
promised, good. Take the following recipe, for example: 
</P>
<P>
 "Cucumbers as a salad are not very tempting," the author writes. "It is not 
easy to season these weepers to the right extent, as a little salt brings forth 
abundant tears; in the country, I learned a way of eating them that delighted 
me. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, one must have a dish of potatoes, or, I should say, a frying-pan of 
them, for they cannot be done successfully except in this kitchen utensil. Cut 
your potatoes into fairly thin slices in your pan and pour in some water. Salt 
and pepper them, and season with a little bacon. Also put in a sprig of basil, 
a bay-leaf and a tomato. All this you cook on a fairly hot fire, keeping the 
pan covered. A quarter of an hour to 20 minutes will suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 "When ready to serve, peel a cucumber with not too many seeds and cut it into 
four slices lengthways. Add salt and pepper, and munch these cold slices at the 
same time you eat the hot potatoes. I assure you there is nothing better." 
</P>
<P>
 My American version of this recipe follows. If you wish, add to this simple 
meal some hard-boiled eggs, cut in half and then pressed, cut side down, into a 
mixture of finely chopped parsley, garlic and coarse salt, with a little olive 
oil dribbled on top. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, apple pie in a cornmeal crust would be especially good if made 
using the new harvest of Gravenstein apples now available at farmers markets. 
CLARISSE'S POTATOES AND CUCUMBERS 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 pounds peeled, sliced russet potatoes  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In 10-inch skillet add potatoes, basil leaves, bay leaves, tomato and bacon. 
Season lightly to taste with salt. Add water. Cover and cook on high heat. When 
water boils, turn heat to low. Keep water bubbling. Cook 10 to 15 minutes more. 
Pierce potatoes with fork to check if tender and done. 
</P>
<P>
 Season cucumbers to taste with salt, then chill. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Put apple slices into large bowl. In small bowl mix sugar and cinnamon. Stir 
to blend. Add to apple slices. Add more sugar to taste, if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mound apple slices over dough in pie plate. Roll remaining dough half out to 
same size as bottom layer. Place over apples. Tuck edges under, but above rim 
of pie pan. Crimp or use fork to finish edges. Place pie on baking sheet to 
catch bubbling juices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake 15 minutes at 450 degrees. Then turn oven down to 350 degrees and 
continue to bake 40 to 45 minutes, or until top is golden and juices are 
bubbling. Serve warm. Makes 1 (9-inch) pie, about 8 servings.

 Lunchers arriving at San Antonio Winery last week found that the premises had 
apparently been transported to San Francisco and taken over by Nob Hill 
Jewelry, and at the same time they were also mysteriously in Sonoma, rather 
than downtown Los Angeles. Furthermore, there had been two murders -- one in 
the barrel room and another out front. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the script for an upcoming episode of "Murder, She Wrote," 
and Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) was sniffing out the culprit as usual. 
Tentatively scheduled to air Nov. 20, the episode filmed at San Antonio Winery, 
titled "Crimson Harvest," tranforms the L.A. landmark into the fictional 
Grimaldi Winery of Sonoma County. The winery entrance will also appear as a 
jewelry shop, and the on-premises restaurant as an Italian eatery in San 
Francisco. BARBARA HANSEN

 Hot Hot Hot, the Pasadena hot sauce boutique, claims its mail-order catalogue

 Speaking of hot stuff, paprika sales were suspended in Hungary last week 
following the discovery of flour colored with red house paint in a third of the 
paprika samples tested. At least 40 Hungarians are hospitalized with lead 
poisoning from the adulterated paprika and 18 people have been arrested in the 
scandal, which has been traced to recently opened fly-by-night paprika mills 
concentrating on Hungary's voracious domestic paprika market. No warning has 
been issued about the major-brand paprika that Hungary exports to other 
countries. Java Jive

<P>
 Tejava, the brand of unsweetened, unflavored bottled tea, now also comes in 
one-liter glass bottles. OK, maybe that's not the biggest news, but it's an 
excuse to note that when we reviewed bottled teas a couple of weeks ago, we 
unknowingly didn't give Tejava a fair shake. The bottle we tried must have been 
pretty old, since it had the kind of cap that requires a bottle opener. Recent 
Tejava bottlings have twist-off caps. Fiery Cookbook 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Firefighters Recipe Cookbook" features 175 easy, hearty recipes 
from every state in the nation, plus firehouse anecdotes, a glossary of 
firefighting terminology and eager comments on every recipe from a cartoon 
spokesdog named Cinders. (Those who have to cook for big appetites will also 
appreciate the Firehouse Kitchen Rules, which begin, "1. It doesn't matter what 
it tastes like as long as there is enough. 2. The later the meal is served, the 
more food you will need. 3. When in doubt, make it Mexican.") The book is a 
fund raiser for the Phoenix Society for Burn Survivors. To order, send check 
for $15 plus $3 shipping (50 cents for each additional book) to All Hands 
Publications, 2640 E. Virginia Ave., Phoenix, Ariz. 85008. Whale on Ice? 
</P>
<P>
 Whale bootlegging is nothing new -- the Soviet Union had a secret operation in 
the Southern Hemisphere that processed 48,477 humpback whales between '48 and 
'73, while reporting only 2,710 -- and it's no surprise that the current 
whaling moratorium hasn't totally prevented it. Science Magazine recently 
published a DNA analysis of whale meat sold in Japan (limited numbers of minke 
whales, caught for scientific purposes, may still be sold for food there) that 
suggests that some of the meat was from the fin whale, which hasn't been 
legally caught since 1989, and some of the rest was North Pacific humpback, 
which, if legally caught, would have to have been in cold storage for 27 years.

GARDEN FRESH; PLEASE EAT THE GERANIUMS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family of scented geraniums is multifarious. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are poetic. In the language of flowers, if you sent a friend a rose 
geranium, you'd be saying that person was your chosen. If you sent a nutmeg 
geranium, it would mean you expected to meet. If you sent a lemony geranium, it 
would tell the recipient to expect the unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 All are elegant. Their leaves can fill the palm of your hand or balance on the 
tip of a little finger -- be ferny or oak-like, flat or furled, smooth or 
furry. Although the flowers of most are small, they resemble in miniature all 
the vivid geraniums that grace window sills around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond their lyrical meaning and beauty, the subtlety and range of fragrance 
in scented geraniums is astonishing -- around 250 have been recorded since they 
arrived in England from the African Cape about 1632. Dozens of scents are still 
available. For example, the Sandy Mush Herb Nursery offers 17 that are 
rose-scented, 12 scented with lemon, 18 scented of fruits and spices, 12 of 
assorted mints and 13 whose scents are described as "pungent." Other 
specialists offer a wealth of 60 species and more. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Which to grow? I began our collection with the rich scents of lemony Mabel 
Grey, intense Attar of Roses, biting Peppermint, spicy Nutmeg (with 
cream-dashed variegated leaves) and tart/sweet Apple. Next you might treat 
yourself to Rober's Lemon Rose, Prince of Orange, strawberry scented Countess 
of Scarborough, Clorinda (which can be eucalyptus, lemon or nutmeg depending on 
your mood and the time of day), coconut, lemon balm, ginger . . . 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen, these leaves must be used with care because their flavor 
ranges from subtle to subtlest. The highest and best use is probably layering 
them with granulated or confectioner's sugar in a tightly closed jar -- in only 
a few days, you'll have scented sugar for your fruit or cereal, to sprinkle 
over cakes and tarts and stir into tea. Some, like peppermint and lemon, make 
gorgeous tisanes -- steep a small handful of torn leaves in boiling water in a 
covered cup or a pot for five minutes, then sip. Scented geranium leaves are 
wonderful in old-fashioned puddings too. 
</P>
<P>
 Scented geraniums are the source of many pleasures. Lay branches in a linen 
closet or through bureau drawers. If anyone reading this still writes letters 
on stationery, you can bury leaves in your writing paper box. And when you pull 
out grandmother's finger bowls for holiday parties, do as grandmother did and 
float scented geranium leaves and blossoms in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Scented geraniums can be grown as long-lived perennials in ground where 
there's no frost the year around -- some will get three or more feet high. 
Where there's frost, most species are ultra-tender and must be whisked indoors 
for winter -- in containers, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indoors, geraniums are happiest in a sunny but cool spot, and they must have 
good circulation of air -- no stuffy corner. Water sparingly through winter. In 
spring, when all danger of frost has passed, back into the garden they go. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I plant them in the ground for the summer; it depends on their size 
and shape and where I want them. Since a plant in a pot has the bonus of 
several inches of added height, often I set pots in bare spaces, which they 
fill marvelously. Be sure to put a saucer under the pot so the roots won't dive 
into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether in a pot or the ground, scented geraniums need full sun, well-drained 
soil or soil mix allowed to dry out between waterings and feedings of half 
fish/half kelp solution at half-strength every month or so through the growing 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scented geraniums reproduce most successfully from cuttings. If you have 
friends who grow scented geraniums, take them a jar of homemade jelly or a 
nosegay in exchange for a cutting or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cuttings are best taken when branches are pliant enough to bend without 
snapping. From the tip of a vigorous mature plant, pick the top two or three 
inches of a stocky branch that has two or three nodes (bumpy places that sprout 
new stalks). Nip off flowers and all but the top two or three leaves, wrap the 
cutting so it won't dry out, but don't put it in water -- keep it in a cool 
place until planting. 
</P>
<P>
 For each cutting, fill a 2 1/2- to 3-inch container with commercial potting 
soil mixed with 1/2 teaspoon perlite or builder's (not beach) sand. Water 
thoroughly, then plunge the cutting into the middle an inch deep. Set in a 
saucer in bright light but no sunshine. Keep evenly moist but not wet, and 
never let water stand in the saucer. Spring through fall, the cutting will root 
in about two weeks -- longer in winter and with some species. Move to the next 
size up when the roots fill the pot -- do this all through the plant's life. 
</P>
<P>
 These dear garden mimics are as tempting as they are charming. That's why, 
should you see me on a walk in geranium country, please don't ask to see what's 
in my pockets. Sources:

 Blancmange is an antique French chilled dessert, traditionally sweetened 
almond-flavored light cream given substance with gelatin. Americans adopted it 
and named it cold shape. I've replaced the flavor of ground almonds with 
scented geraniums, rose in particular. Silken, pure and simple, just once taste 
it as the French did, using devil-may-care pure half-and-half.  
</P>
<P>
 You can serve the pudding from a bowl or unmold it. You can also turn the 
mixture into an old-fashioned moss: Chill to the consistency of unbeaten egg 
white, beat until foamy, then fold in two stiffly beaten egg whites. Turn the 
pudding into a lightly oiled five-cup bowl and chill until set, then unmold.  
</P>
<P>
 Top this white-as-snow pudding with scented geranium leaves and flowers and 
rim the base of each serving with slices of soft fruit or a crimson ribbon of 
pureed berries.  
</P>
<P>
 SCENTED GERANIUM SHAPE 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups half and half 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups milk 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup small whole or small torn pieces of fragrant scented geranium leaves, 
fairly firmly packed 
</P>
<P>
 4 3/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons sugar, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 6 large leaves or 6 sprigs small leaves of same scented geranium, with flowers 
of plant as garnish 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup lightly sweetened puree fresh or frozen berries, or thin slices soft 
fruit 
</P>
<P>
 Combine half and half, milk and scented geranium leaves in heavy 2-quart 
saucepan. Slowly bring to simmer uncovered over medium-low heat. Do not boil. 
Turn heat to lowest setting to maintain barest simmer, about 15 minutes. Remove 
from heat, cover and cool, at least 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Dampen and thoroughly wring out sturdy kitchen towel. Drape in quart measuring 
pitcher and pour infusion into it. Gather corners of cloth, and when dripped 
through, squeeze out every drop to make 3 1/2 cups. 
</P>
<P>
 Pour 1/2 cup mixture into microwave-proof bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over top. 
Whisk to blend. Let stand until thickened, about 3 minutes. Whisk until smooth, 
then cover tightly and cook at full power in microwave until gelatin has 
dissolved, about 30 seconds. Whisk in sugar, and when dissolved, whisk mixture 
into milk. Taste to adjust for sweetening.  
</P>
<P>
 Strain mixture through fine sieve into quart bowl or lightly oiled mold. Cover 
and chill until set, about 2 hours to serve from bowl, or 6 to 8 hours to 
unmold. Garnish with leaves and flowers. Surround each serving with fruit. 
Makes 6 servings.

SPICE RUB; MAKING UP FOR LOST FLAVOR

<P>
 Let's face it: Fat tastes good. The marbling or internal fat is what gives 
meats their flavor, and so does the butter and oil that we slather on during 
and after cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 When we reduce the fat in our food, whether by choosing leaner cuts or by 
reducing the amount of sauce used, we need to compensate by adding flavor 
through spices, fresh herbs and other flavor enhancers such as garlic, lemon 
and lime juices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the following recipes we used "skinny" cuts of meats -- those with the 
least intrinsic fat -- and spiced them up with low-fat marinades. As a result, 
all of the recipes come in at five grams of fat or less per serving, except for 
the flank steak, which has seven grams. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the flank steak contains a little more fat than the rest, it is still 
very lean for beef. And when trimmed of any surface fat and cooked properly, it 
can be one of the tastiest and most economical steaks on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 First, make small slits all over the top side of the meat and insert slivers 
of garlic (this dish tastes -- and looks -- best when the meat is sliced and 
there are one or two pieces of garlic in each slice). Then lightly score the 
surface with a sharp knife and rub in the adobo seasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't cook flank steak much past the medium-rare stage. When overcooked, it 
tends to toughen. To make it even more tender, slice the meat very thin, 
cutting diagonally across the grain. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A combination of spices, garlic and lemon juice rubbed on and under the skin 
gives this stuffed turkey breast a robust flavor despite containing only five 
grams of fat per serving. The skin is left on during roasting to keep the 
turkey breast moist, then removed before serving to keep the fat low. 
</P>
<P>
 The grilled chicken breast and vegetables tossed with fettuccine, a favorite 
among testers in The Times Test Kitchen, is just about a meal-in-one. All 
that's needed to complete the menu is a crisp salad. 
</P>
<P>
 After rubbing the chicken breasts with chopped herbs and letting them stand 
for a bit, we grilled them on our heavy iron stove-top grill. A light spray of 
mesquite-flavored nonstick cooking spray gave them that great barbecued flavor. 
Leaving the skin on during cooking helped to keep the chicken juicy and moist 
during grilling; taking it off before serving cut the fat by 10 grams. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Shrimp fried rice, spiked with red pepper flakes, has only three grams of fat 
per serving. Remember that cooked rice should be cold for stir-frying, so it 
doesn't get a "gummy" texture. It is fried in a wok sprayed with 
sesame-flavored cooking spray. Egg substitute, rather than of real eggs, is 
stirred into the rice at the end of frying. The remainder of the egg substitute 
is used to make an omelet that is then cut into strips and lightly stirred in 
just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 This twist on the classic Cajun jambalaya is made with grilled, marinated 
shrimp and comes out to only five grams of fat per serving. Spoon the grilled 
shrimp on top of the cooked rice -- stained bright-yellow by the turmeric -- 
and toss lightly just before serving. Don't forget the chopped cilantro. 
Despite being decidedly un-Cajun, it adds just the right touch needed to 
complete the dish.

 This terrific flank steak recipe was a favorite among tasters in The Times 
Test Kitchen. The meat can be seasoned with the dry rub and left to marinate in 
the refrigerator for one or two days. The steak can then be grilled and served 
within minutes.  
</P>
<P>

SPICE RUBS; ON THE SPICE TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I know a Frenchwoman who refuses to eat any dish with two spices in it, unless 
they're pepper and nutmeg. More than two spices, absolument no way. This French 
disdain for spices is a relatively recent thing, though. Until about 300 years 
ago, the French were throwing spices around with a free hand just like 
everybody else in Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the world, in fact. Chinese cooks have their five-spice mixture, 
the Near East its twabil and harisa mixtures, and the mind reels at all the 
masala and bumbu combinations used in spice-growing countries such as India and 
Indonesia. Back in Roman times, the 2nd-Century cookbook "De Re Coquinaria " 
called over and over for pepper and caraway, or pepper, cumin and coriander. 
Even the plainest American cooking uses pickling spice, and I don't want to 
push my French acquaintance on this, but most French sausages are flavored with 
something called quatre-epices (that means four spices, cherie ). 
</P>
<P>
 True, Europe sort of went overboard about spices in the Middle Ages. In 1420, 
Maistre Chiquart, major domo of the Duke of Savoy, proclaimed that a royal 
feast -- to be attended by hundreds of guests, of course -- absolutely required 
640 pounds of the "major" spices (cinnamon, pepper, two kinds of ginger and a 
cousin of black pepper known as grain of paradise), plus six pounds apiece of 
nutmeg, mace, cloves and galingale (a cousin of ginger). 
</P>
<P>
 You would have to have been royalty to afford hundreds of pounds of spices in 
those days. But cost didn't stop people, even in pretty remote places. Iceland 
is way out in the Atlantic and so far north it actually bumps up against the 
Arctic Circle. Any spices must have been fantastically expensive by the time 
they got there, but a 13th-Century cookbook from Iceland calls for imported 
spices in 17 of its 35 recipes. One dish alone specifies cloves, nutmeg, 
ginger, cinnamon, pepper and cardamom. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being so expensive, spices were a way of displaying your wealth and showing 
honor to your guest. Spices were not , however, a way of masking the smell of 
spoiled meat -- that idea was dreamed up by historians in the 18th Century. 
(Trust me. I've tried masking spoiled meat with spices, and it really doesn't 
work.) The ultimate reason medieval people used a lot of spices was probably 
that they just liked them. 
</P>
<P>
 Medieval European cooks had a standard hot spice combination known as poudre 
fort , usually consisting of black pepper, cubeb (another of the medieval 
cousins of pepper), cloves, ginger and galingale. Its sweet counterpart was 
poudre douce : cinnamon, cardamom, coriander and mace. Recipes also call for 
spice combinations sold in the market, such as poudre Lombard and poudre 
marchant.  
</P>
<P>
 Certain French and Italian sauces were basically spice mixtures stretched out 
with almonds or breadcrumbs and vinegar -- you could buy them readymade by the 
quart. The most famous was cameline sauce, based on ginger and cinnamon plus 
cloves or other spices. In Spanish recipes, salsa fina wasn't at all what we 
think of as a sauce but a mixture of spices, usually ginger, cinnamon, pepper, 
cloves, mace, nutmeg and saffron. 
</P>
<P>
 The recados used in Mexico today call for many of these Old World spices, and 
we can assume that they're descended in one way or another from the medieval 
European poudres. But there are big differences. Ginger rarely, if ever, 
figures in Mexican spice mixtures, though it was one of the most popular spices 
in medieval Europe (because it was the cheapest imported spice). And a high 
proportion of the Mexican spice mixtures call for cumin -- for many people, 
cumin is the flavor of Mexican food -- but cumin was rarely used in medieval 
Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cumin had been the Romans' second favorite spice, right after pepper. In the 
aforementioned 2nd-Century Roman cookbook, it shows up in more than 80 recipes, 
including most vegetable recipes and a couple of surprises such as stewed 
apricots. But while the ancient Romans liked hot spices such as cumin, caraway, 
mustard and asafetida, the medieval taste was for perfumy spices such as 
cinnamon, clove, mace and nutmeg, which aren't even mentioned in the Roman 
cookbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Arabs of Spain, heirs of a separate cooking tradition, didn't use a 
whole lot of cumin. Interestingly, when they did, the cumin was usually 
accompanied by coriander, a spice combination popular not only in ancient Rome 
but in India. The combination of cumin and coriander is found in the Yucatecan 
annatto paste recado de adobo colorado , but otherwise it's relatively uncommon 
in Mexico.  
</P>

 So where did Mexican cooks come up with the combination of cumin, cinnamon and 
clove, found so often in their cookery? It's as if they replaced the ginger in 
cameline sauce with cumin. But why?  
</P>
<P>
 Quien sabe? Maybe they just liked it.

 For years, I'd been buying and throwing out Mexican spice pastes. I'm talking 
about the kind that are sold in little nondescript boxes at the spice counters 
in Mexican supermarkets. The packaging is not exactly bright and attractive -- 
they're plain four-ounce boxes labeled something like Recado de Adobo Blanco , 
Recado Para Escabeche , Recado Rojo or Recado Para Bistec . The instructions on 
the boxes, such as they are, go something like: "For use with fish, chicken, 
turkey, in stews and when roasting or grilling." 
</P>
<P>
 So why did I buy them? I had visions of marathon cooking sessions where I 
would create this or that wonderful dish with these recados (their flavors are 
all quite complex and strong), but I must confess that somehow, I never use 
them. And after a few years, they turn hard and I have to throw them out. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I went to Quintana Roo, in the southern part of the Yucatan Peninsula, 
and met and cooked with Yara Moreno Heredia, a chef and restaurateur in the 
capital city of Chetumal, and everything changed. Well, not exactly everything. 
I did those marathon cooking sessions with spice pastes, true, but I never used 
those little boxes, because I learned to make my own recados.  
</P>
<P>
 The cooking of Yucatan is characterized by the use of these spice pastes, but 
recados are only one part of the Mexican spice story. In most Mexican towns 
there are market stalls that sell only spice mixtures -- mounds of red, green, 
yellow, brown and black, heaped up like paint on an artist's palette. All will 
go either into marinades or richly sauced dishes reflecting Mexico's 
post-Conquest heritage of native and Spanish approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main categories of spice mixtures are moles , pepianes , adobos and 
recados . Don't expect to learn precise definitions of these words -- their 
meanings tend to shade into each other, and the fact that there are terms such 
as recado en adobo doesn't help matters. But roughly speaking, recados are 
ground herb and spice mixtures, ranging from the incredibly simple (at the 
ranch where I grew up in Chihuahua, we used a mixture of garlic and oregano for 
puerco con pasta de oregano ) to rather elaborate combinations of seasonings, 
much like the garam masala mixtures used in India. 
</P>
<P>
 Adobos , which include dried chiles and (sometimes) vinegar with the spices, 
are used for marinating meat, fish or poultry before roasting or grilling, or 
by themselves as a dressing or sauce on vegetables, as in chileajo. Pepianes 
and moles are rich, multi-flavored sauces that have usually been thickened with 
ground seeds or nuts; they are a book in themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Most spices and many of the herbs we now associate with Mexican food were 
introduced by the Spaniards. The only native spices were chiles (of course), 
vanilla, achiote (annatto) and allspice, which grows wild in Yucatan. In her 
book "America's First Cuisines" (University of Texas Press: 1994), Sophie Coe 
wrote that the importation of flavorings began soon after Columbus' second 
voyage: "By pack train over the mountains . . . came ginger, cumin, caraway and 
sesame seeds, as well as saffron, cinnamon, cloves and black pepper. The last 
four were sold separately, or as a mixture of equal parts by weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Other spice mixtures were popular, and some continue to be. The combination of 
cumin, canela and cloves is one of the "trinities" of Mexican food and appears 
in all sorts of recipes. It did not take long before these Spanish spice 
combinations blended with the Mexican spice, chile, to produce new and 
versatile spice pastes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the ingredients in recados and adobos are the same, but they are used 
in different proportions in each recipe, so that one flavor predominates. Thus 
the recado para escabeche will be very peppery, and the recado de adobo 
colorado will taste of achiote . In chile spice pastes, the flavor of one 
particular chile variety will stand out above the other spices. 
</P>
<P>
 The ingredients for all kinds of adobos , recados and sauces used to be ground 
by hand in a stone mortar (the Mexican word for which, molcajete , comes from 
the same Aztec root as the sauce mole ). Today, every home with electricity 
uses a blender. But people still make the sauces by hand when they want to show 
special honor to a guest. The food processor is satisfactory for some, but not 
all, of these mixtures. It does not grind everything as smoothly as a blender, 
so I suggest that if you're going to use a food processor, first grind the 
spices separately. Where you want a very smooth texture, as in a mole , pepian 
or salsa, I recommend a blender. 
</P>
<P>
 Recados and adobos keep well and are simple ways to add lots of flavor and 
very few calories to whatever you may be cooking. Let your imagination be your 
guide, and you'll never have to throw any of them out! 
</P>

 This is the first spice paste dish I ever learned to make. The cowboys at our 
ranch in Chihuahua used to slather it on whole cows or steers, which they then 
wrapped in gunny sacks wetted with sotol, a rustic cousin of tequila. 
Previously they'd have dug a hole in the ground big enough to accommodate the 
whole animal and set a gigantic fire in it, using the scrub oak that surrounded 
the ranch house. Once the embers were blazing hot, they would arrange big rocks 
on them, place the cow or steer on the rocks and cover the hole. It would take 
24 hours to cook, but the result was definitely worth the wait -- succulent, 
garlicky, peppery, herb-infused hunks of meat.  
</P>
<P>
 My mother would make her salsa de chile verde, a roasted green chile sauce, 
and we'd flavor the meat with the salsa and roll a flaky flour tortilla around 
it. Here I suggest a recipe for chipotle salsa. In Guadalajara, they put this 
roast pork on French-type rolls called bolillos to make sandwiches called 
tortas ahogadas. Plenty of sauce goes on top so that the sandwiches are 
"drowned" in it -- which is what the word ahogada means.

</P>
<P>
 Using small, sharp knife, make gashes 1 inch deep all over roast and rub 
Oregano Paste into gashes. Place meat in shallow roasting pan and roast at 475 
degrees 20 minutes. Lower heat to 350 degrees and continue to roast until 
tender and thoroughly cooked, about 2 hours 15 minutes.

 You can use this paste on chicken or beef for roasting, or spread it on fish 
before grilling or baking. I add a teaspoon or two to plain vinaigrette to add 
some zing to a salad. I also put some in olive oil or herb butter. When I want 
something hot, I add minced jalapeno and use it to saute shrimp or boneless 
chicken pieces. With fresh mint, I use it to flavor a seafood stew.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregano Paste 
</P>
<P>
 (Pasta de Oregano) 
</P>
<P>
 8 cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon Mexican oregano, crushed between palms 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons salt, preferably kosher  
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon freshly ground black pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Put garlic, oregano, salt and pepper in mortar, blender or food processor. 
Process into paste.

 This chipotle salsa is very versatile. My mother cooks wonderful meatballs in 
it, and in Veracruz they poach fish and shrimp in this sauce. It also makes a 
delicious sauce for pasta. For a milder version, leave out the sauce that comes 
with the canned chipotles, or remove some (or all) of the chipotles before 
pureeing.  
</P>
<P>
 Chipotle Salsa (Salsa de Chipotle) 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lard or vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium onion, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Pan drippings from roast pork, optional 
</P>
<P>
 5 to 6 large tomatoes, or 1 (28-ounce) can plain-style tomatoes without puree 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 teaspoons Mexican oregano 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 canned chipotles en adobo, with sauce to taste 
</P>
<P>
 Heat lard in medium saucepan until almost smoking. Add onion and garlic. Saute 
over medium-high heat, stirring often, until onion is translucent, about 2 to 3 
minutes. Add pan drippings, tomatoes, oregano, sugar, salt and chipotles. Stir 
thoroughly and simmer uncovered over low heat 10 to 15 minutes, stirring often. 
Puree sauce in blender. With wooden spoon, force through sieve. 
</P>
<P>
 May be frozen or stored, tightly covered, up to 3 days in refrigerator. Makes 
3 to 4 cups.

 The recado used in this dish is the basis of many Yucatan Peninsula dishes. 
The most famous is cochinita pibil: a suckling pig, marinated with this spice 
paste and wrapped in banana leaves, baked in a Mayan earth oven called a pib. 
Large fish and venison or other wild game are also baked in pibs. I slather 
this paste on guinea hens and broil them on the rotisserie, or wrap marinated 
chicken breasts or fish fillets in banana leaves with slices of orange, and 
steam the packets. One of my favorite appetizers is chicken drummettes baked 
with this recado.  
</P>
<P>
 When made with vinegar, it will keep almost indefinitely in the refrigerator, 
but the flavor will be more subtle and true if it's made with a mixture of 
orange and lime juices, though that will reduce its shelf life to about three 
weeks. Quintana Roo oregano comes from a tree, not a shrub, and the long leaves 
turn black when they dry. Mexican oregano can be substituted for it.  
</P>
<P>
 RED SNAPPER WITH ACHIOTE PASTE (Huachinango con Recado de Adobo Colorado) 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup Annatto Paste

</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup chopped onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 habanero chile, veins and seeds removed, slivered 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons oil, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Spread Annatto Paste on both sides of fish, covering well. Place fish in 
refrigerator 1 to 2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In mixing bowl combine orange juice, lime juice, water, onion, habanero, 
cilantro and salt to taste to paste. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecue fish over hot coals, skin side down, until seared, 2 minutes. Or heat 
3 tablespoons oil in skillet large enough to accommodate fish until very hot, 
then place fish in pan, skin side down, and fry until seared, 2 minutes. Place 
seared fish in 1-inch-deep baking tray and pour citrus-habanero sauce over. 
Bake until fish is firm to touch and thoroughly cooked, about 5 minutes. Serve 
immediately. Makes 4 servings.

 Recados are the soul of the Yucatecan cuisines. This dish, with its vinegary 
recado, was taught to me by an earthy, sensual woman named Yara, who owns 
Lol-Be ("flower of the road," in Mayan), the best restaurant in Chetumal, 
capital of Quintana Roo state on the eastern side of the Yucatan Peninsula. 
This recipe, like many in Mexican cuisine, calls for a cinnamon-like spice 
called canela, available in Latin markets and Mexican ingredient sections of 
many supermarkets; cinnamon can be used instead, but it's worth the trouble to 
get your hands on canela.  
</P>
<P>
 One characteristic feature of Yucatecan cuisine is using two cooking methods. 
In this case, the chicken is first poached and then grilled -- there are also 
recipes that call first for grilling and then poaching!  
</P>
<P>
 You can use a thick pork chop or a piece of fish in place of the chicken to 
produce low-calorie, flavor-packed dishes. The plain broth can be served as a 
first course. I sometimes spread some of the spice paste on a steak or a 
butterflied leg of lamb before grilling, or add a tablespoon to a stew -- even 
to biscuit dough -- for a peppery aftertaste.  
</P>
<P>
 YARA'S EASTERN- STYLE CHICKEN ESCABECHE (Escabeche de Pollo Oriental Estilo

 The longer the spice mixture stands, the better it tastes -- it can become 
addictive. You can adjust the amount of vinegar to taste or add other spices 
such as canela, true (Ceylon) cinnamon and cloves to vary the flavor. I use it 
to marinate beef, veal or pork cutlets, which I saute quickly; I also put it on 
whole, full-flavored fish for baking. Sometimes I thin this adobo with chicken 
or pork stock, or even water, and use the resulting sauce to make chile con 
carne. I don't recommend this paste for grilling, because the chiles burn and 
turn bitter.  
</P>
<P>
 This recipe calls for Oaxacan pasilla chiles, which are quite different from 
the chiles usually known as pasilla in California. Oaxacan pasillas are also 
known as pasilla de Mexico or chile negro.  
</P>
<P>
 Chileajo Paste (Pasta de Chileajo) 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 cups water  
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound dried New Mexico red chiles 
</P>
<P>
 2 dried Oaxacan pasilla chiles or dried chipotle chiles 
</P>
<P>
 12 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 In pot bring water to boil, then remove from heat.  
</P>
<P>
 Rinse New Mexico and pasilla chiles. Toast on hot griddle over high heat until 
dry, about 1 minute, turning constantly to avoid scorching. (Burnt chiles will 
make paste bitter.) As chiles are done, place in hot water. Let soak 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove and discard stem end of chiles. Slice chiles lengthwise and remove 
seeds and veins. Place chiles in blender or food processor with garlic, vinegar 
and sugar. Process until smooth. Pass mixture through medium-fine sieve. Season 
to taste with salt. Makes about 1 cup.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: OLE MOLE

<P>
 Oaxacan food, it has been noted, may recently have become what Yucatecan food 
was a decade ago: a culinary souvenir of the hippest destination in Mexico, 
also the most exotic kind of Mexican food on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the beach in Santa Monica, on a stretch of surf shops and video stores, a 
few yards from a bowling alley, El Texate sits in one of the last places you'd 
expect to find a Oaxacan restaurant in the Los Angeles area. It looks like a 
surf-dude bar centered around a giant TV. Before you open a menu, unless you 
scope the plurality of tables that happen to be occupied by Mexican families, 
you might feel that memelas and nicuatole seem less likely here than tacos and 
Corona -- there's even a sign aimed at German tourists on the window. A shrine 
to the Virgin is built up in a corner; between the dining room and the bar 
hangs sort of a surrealist's macrame display supporting cacti that look as if 
they're floating in air. 
</P>
<P>
 El Texate -- the name is the owners' spelling of tejate , a traditional summer 
drink of cornmeal, chocolate and walnuts -- may not be the single best Oaxacan 
restaurant in town (I like the superb El Guelaguetza in Koreatown), but it 
serves pretty good margaritas and is authentic to the point that its menu owes 
almost nothing to standard Mexican-restaurant cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Enchiladas, for example, are the Oaxacan kind, tortillas dipped in mole and 
rolled, then garnished instead of stuffed with chicken and a few crumbles of 
salty, white cheese. Clayudas , more or less the Oaxacan equivalent of pizza, 
are plate-size dried tortillas, smeared with a black-bean puree and the 
signature crumbled cheese, garnished with a small piece of chile-impregnated 
cecina (beef jerky). Memelas (thick, fried cornmeal platforms) are also smeared 
with black beans and sprinkled with cheese. 
</P>
<P>
 Oaxacan empanadas, leathery envelopes of cornmeal baked around a few 
tablespoonfuls of stew, probably serve the same dual lunchbox/lunch purpose in 
Oaxaca as the impenetrable turnovers called pasties do in the mine country of 
northern Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes El Texate can be a little too authentic: No other restaurant north 
of Monte Alban may serve the dish called igadito , a sort of fuzzy, bland 
matzoh ball made out of scrambled eggs and plopped into a mild chicken broth, 
but igadito is not going to be replacing the fajitas platter in Los Angeles 
anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the most famous dishes of Oaxacan cooking are the moles, thick, 
rich sauces composed of as many as three dozen different roasted chiles, nuts 
and seeds, ground into a paste with a mortar and pestle and thinned out with a 
little broth, as perfect a sauce for poultry as any beurre blanc or bigarade. 
When you ask for mole here, the waitress patiently waits until you specify 
which kind of mole you'd like: mole negro , tar-black, sweet-bitter, with a 
specific gravity that lies somewhere near that of plutonium; oddly herbed verde 
de pollo ; the bright-red spice mixture that heats up the goat barbacoa to 
almost the point of incandescence. The mole called amarillo , especially mild, 
with a clear chile flavor, a strong top note of cumin and the sort of slightly 
oily texture of gravy in a chicken-dinner restaurant, seems almost like an 
ideal version of TV dinner enchilada sauce, but is somehow apt here in this 
stew of vegetables and odd cuts of beef. (Whenever I order amarillo here, I 
spend a few minutes trying to figure out the bowl-shaped pieces of beef in the 
stew. Kneecaps?) 
</P>
<P>
 It's the mole coloradito that's the best food in the house, brick-red, sharply 
spicy, a little smoky, with the roundness of toasted grain, more pungent than 
the negro , everything you're looking for when you order mole . . . and no 
kneecaps.

AMERICA'S BEST; BROOKLYN BROWNIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two types of brownies. There's the old-fashioned cake-like variety, 
crusty on top and moist and chewy inside. Then there are the dense, dark, 
creamy ones that taste more like candy than cake.For those who prefer the 
latter, none are better than Bob's Brownstone Brownies. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob is Robert Ribbler, a former chef and Culinary Institute of America 
graduate who got into the brownie business a year and a half ago. First he 
installed a commercial kitchen in the basement of his apartment; it contains a 
couple of big mixers and a convection oven. Then he went shopping for 
chocolate. "It's the most important ingredient," he says, "so I did a lot of 
research and a lot of blind taste tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Ribbler finally selected an American chocolate with a high cocoa butter 
content. But he won't divulge who the manufacturer is. "I worked too hard to 
find it. It's made in Pennsylvania but it's not Hershey's." 
</P>
<P>
 Named after the Brooklyn brownstone where they're made, Bob's super-rich 
brownies are available in 15 flavors including mocha, cappuccino, Grand 
Marnier, rum-raisin and white chocolate chunk. The classic chocolate with nuts 
and the peanut butter versions are the best. A three-pound box containing a 
dozen individually wrapped brownies costs $19.95 plus $6 for shipping 
second-day air. To preserve freshness, they are baked and shipped the same day.

TASTING NOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following wines are recommended, listed in order of preference. They were 
rated mostly in blind tastings, though a few were discovered in restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Seghesio Winery ($7.50) -- Magnificent green herbal notes with traces 
of olive, fresh snap peas, melons and pears. A soft, perfectly balanced wine 
with stunning fresh/crisp finish. A perfect example of the variety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Dry Creek Vineyards ($9) -- Olive, herbal (tarragon and thyme) aroma 
and a faint chile pepper note in the aftertaste. Perfect with seafood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 J. Fritz Winery ($9) -- Sprightly herbal and melon tones and a brisk 
pine-y finish. A wine that will be better in a year or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Buena Vista Vineyards "Lake County" ($8) -- Pear, lemon oil and melons 
in a stunningly fresh, soft wine with a slightly sweet, balanced finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Bernardus Vineyards ($11) -- Stylish olive, melon and pear aromas 
mingle with just enough oak to give the wine real depth. Not as crisp as some, 
but the richness is appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Alderbrook Vineyards ($8) -- Slightly more muted than the above wines, 
but with perfect harmonies of herbs, pear and delicate oak. Wonderful today; 
better in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Brander Vineyards ($9) -- Clean, fresh, brisk juniper/pear aroma and a 
food-matching layer of acid. Fred Brander's wines age nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Rodney Strong Vineyards "Charlotte's Home Vineyard" ($9) -- Dried herbs 
and fresh lemon rind in a soft, easy-to-quaff wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Wente Bros. Winery ($7) -- A mild level of herbs and chile notes from 
Livermore Valley; a fresh, appealing wine with a delicate lemon-y finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Robert Mondavi Winery ($9) -- Herbs (like dried tarragon) and melons 
with a fairly light finish. The Reserve ($16) bottling is only for those who 
like a hit of oak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Canyon Road Cellars ($6) -- Aroma of fresh dried hay and pears; soft 
and easy to quaff; perfectly balanced. Second label of Geyser Peak Vineyards. 
Often found at $4.50 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Geyser Peak ($7.50) -- Floral with pears and melons, creamy-soft and 
loaded with flavor. A bit simple. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Quivira Vineyards ($11) -- Melons and a trace of olives in a faintly 
oaky finish. A fine, balanced wine that will be better in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 St. Clement Vineyards ($11) -- Marvelous wine in the mode of a great 
Graves, with a steely/crisp aroma and a taste of lemon oil, grapefruit, olives 
and lime. Time will improve it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Parducci Wine Cellars ($7) -- Fresh pears, a trace of figs, and no oak 
to confuse the issue. Good value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Fetzer Vineyards "Mendocino" ($6) -- Spiced green herbs, melon and a 
trace of cumin in a refreshingly crisp, simple wine with good varietal identity 
in the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Cotes de Sonoma ($7) -- Lighter-styled wine with lemon/melon aroma and 
a flavorful aftertaste. Excellent wine often discounted at less than $6. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Columbia Crest Winery (Washington) ($8) -- Fresh basil/lime aroma and 
delicate, crisp finish. Not very complex, but appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Kendall-Jackson Vineyards "Vintner's Reserve" ($9.50) -- Fruity, 
faintly herbal; a soft, tasty wine. Avoid Kendall-Jackson 1993 "Grand Reserve" 
($14): clumsy and far too smoky, it tastes more of burnt wood than grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer strong oak in their Sauvignon Blanc, the following wines 
have it -- but they are not easy to identify as Sauvignon Blanc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Mill Creek Vineyards ($8) -- Still varietal, but the oak and butter 
notes are pretty strong. The nice thing is the fruit, which saves the wine. But 
the alcohol, 13.5%, is a bit high. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 William Wheeler Winery ($7.50) -- Melons proliferate, but the oak is a 
bit strong. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1992 Babcock Vineyards "Eleven Oaks" ($20) -- The most oak I have ever 
tasted in a Sauvignon Blanc that still has varietal character. Some olive 
notes, but I defy anyone to identify blind what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Ferrari-Carano "Reserve" ($14) -- Huge amount of oak and tropical 
fruit, slightly sweet in the finish. A curious wine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Morgan Winery ($10) -- Barrel-fermented and an "old apple" aroma with 
toasty, smoky notes. If you can handle the slightly bitter finish, the wine is 
kind of like inexpensive Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Fetzer "Barrel Select" ($10) -- A lot of oak and not very much fruit 
for it. Disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following French wines made from Sauvignon Blanc were judged exceptional, 
and worth the price. They will appeal most to those who have experience with 
French versions of Sauvignon Blanc: 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Sancerre, Domaine Delaporte ($20) -- Very complex citrus-y aroma with 
deep dried herb notes and a perfect sweet-tart finish. Worth the price. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Pouilly-Fume, Coteaux du Petit Boisgibault ($15) -- Bright fruit, a 
trace of green beans and a mild green herb finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Sancerre, Cherrier et Fils ($16) -- Lemon oil and chalky notes with 
delicate herbal nuances and a fine, dry finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1993 Pouilly-Fume, Collette Figeat "Les Loges" ($17) -- More green bean than 
anything, but an elegant lime finish; dry, crisp and perfect with food. DAN 
BERGER

WESTSIDE WATCH: 12-YEAR-OLD GETS TASTE OF THE LIFE OF A STARVING ARTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Hollywood boy has learned first-hand that artists don't get rich quick. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, 12-year-old Dan Degendorfer entered a student art contest in West 
Hollywood Park. The competition was co-sponsored by the city of West Hollywood 
and the Citibank branch on Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy ended up taking first prize with a colored-pencil sketch of animals, a 
work that had an anti-hunting theme. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations!" gushed a prize letter to Degendorfer dated March 19. "You 
have won a $100 savings bond donated by Citibank. You will receive your prize 
in the mail in three to four weeks. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe young Dan should have been tipped off by that line about the mail. Last 
Friday, the boy finally received a check from Citibank -- for $50, not $100 -- 
after a series of irate phone calls from his father, Joseph, to various 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've waited a long time," Dan said last week before he received the prize 
money. "I thought they really liked my picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank officials say they sent $50 because that's what the $100 bond would 
be worth if it were redeemed today. But nobody involved seems willing or able 
to explain why it took so long to send the check. 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank branch manager Tommy McMullins told a reporter: "We had no intention 
of withholding checks from anyone." He referred further questions to company 
publicists. A Citibank spokeswoman in San Francisco would say only: "This is 
certainly not the way we like to do things. . . . We're a bit embarrassed by 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 But evidently not embarrassed enough to give up on winning young Dan's 
business. The letter of apology sent with the check encourages the boy to 
deposit his award in a Citibank account. 
</P>

<P>
 GETTING DUMPED ON: Ah, we always suspected that Beverly Hills' majestic 
Greystone mansion was star-crossed, with its history of murder and abandonment. 
So, perhaps we should have expected an unwelcome drop-in visitor at the estate 
completed in 1928 by oil baron Edward Doheny Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a bright, sunny afternoon last week when a dump truck picked up a load 
of construction debris, and hauled it away from a residential project in the 
hilly, northern reaches of Beverly Hills -- down some steeply graded streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Greystone is known for its colossal size. The grounds, which are open to the 
public, cover 18 acres and include lavish gardens. The mansion, which is closed 
to the public, has no less than 55 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Few realize that the estate also possesses a runaway truck ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 The fully laden dump truck apparently lost its brakes, and after an exciting 
ride, exited onto the truck ramp leading onto the estate. But the truck failed 
to stop and went over the end of the ramp -- smack into the estate's stone 
gatehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported that the truck looked like an accordion, and construction 
rubble was tossed everywhere. Miraculously, the driver suffered no serious 
injuries, police said. Nor, in fact, did the gatehouse, which was apparently 
built to last. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting mess perhaps wasn't on the same scale of the 1929 shooting death 
of Edward Doheny Jr. in a first-floor guest room. Nor did it compare to the 
disrepair the mansion has suffered since it was vacated by the Doheny family in 
1955. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a trashy indignity nonetheless.

GRIM DETERMINATION; USING CONFRONTATION TO RAISE AWARENESS OF BREAST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a grim sight. Stacked high in a Bel-Air garage were hundreds of plaster 
torsos cast from breast cancer survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Jane Alsobrook, part of a group of breast cancer activists preparing 
to display the torsos in Westwood last weekend, aesthetics were never the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was never meant to be an art project," said Alsobrook, who is a breast 
cancer survivor. "This is meant to be a political (statement). It's for all 
women with breast cancer." 
</P>
<P>
 Alsobrook is a director of the Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance, the first 
grass-roots breast cancer advocacy group in Los Angeles. The 2-year-old 
alliance, headquartered in West Los Angeles, undertakes a range of projects. 
But perhaps its most dramatic is its "War Mammorial," the display of plaster 
torsos. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's exhibit (the first was held last year in the San Fernando Valley) 
took place outside the Federal Building in Westwood last weekend -- the start 
of Breast Cancer Awareness month. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight was sobering. The plaster casts, taken from women who had gathered 
over the last year in "casting parties" throughout Los Angeles, were lined like 
tombstones along the Federal Building lawn on Wilshire Boulevard. The display 
was intended to draw attention to the 1,350 breast cancer deaths expected in 
Los Angeles this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, with a 15-member board of directors and more than 1,000 people 
on its mailing list, is nonprofit and decidedly grass roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Its goals, however, are lofty. The group wants increased funding for breast 
cancer research and access for all women to high-quality breast cancer 
screening, diagnosis, treatment and care. The alliance also seeks to "create 
public awareness of the breast cancer epidemic and make its eradication a 
national priority," one of its brochures says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is disputed whether breast cancer is an epidemic, the American 
Cancer Society estimates that this year 46,300 (46,000 women and 300 men) will 
die of breast cancer nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no known cause, cure or prevention for the disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the group's members are breast cancer survivors, and although many 
have full-time jobs, breast cancer advocacy has consumed their lives.  
</P>
<P>
 Women and men in the group say they have adopted the head-on tactics of some 
AIDS activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The "War Mammorial" is certainly not subtle, with some casts taken from women 
who have undergone mastectomies and are missing one or both breasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some have voiced their discomfort with the graphic nature of such 
installations, alliance members are enthusiastic. And unapologetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women were dying of politeness and shame," Alsobrook said.  
</P>
<P>
 The plaster casting sessions also allow breast cancer survivors and their 
families to talk about their fears, share information and feel comfortable with 
their bodies, participants say. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanne Eacrett said: "The fact that these women are so committed to the cause 
(that) they let their bodies be seen and touched. It is a very moving 
experience and makes me recommit myself."  
</P>
<P>
 Along with other breast cancer activists, two alliance members, Alsobrook and 
Michelle Rakoff, met with President and Mrs. Clinton and Health and Human 
Services Secretary Donna Shalala last October to discuss a comprehensive breast 
cancer research plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobbying efforts of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, formed by 
activist groups that include the alliance, have paid off. The amount of federal 
breast cancer research funds increased from $90 million in 1991 to $410 million 
in 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the alliance is compiling an anthology of personal stories from 
breast cancer survivors. The group plans to send the book, "A Living Legacy," 
to policy-makers in Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 Such efforts, group members say, will continue until the country mobilizes 
against breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was afraid of growing old," said Eileen Brabender, president of the 
Alliance's board of directors, in her opening speech last weekend. "But I have 
had breast cancer, and now I am angry that maybe I won't grow old. So I want 
this war to be over for all of us. I want us just to go home and grow old -- 
victorious and in peace."

HOUSE CANDIDATES CLASH ON USE OF CLINTON PHOTO IN CAMPAIGN LITERATURE; DEBATE: 
HARMAN SAYS FLYER SHOWING HER WITH PRESIDENT IS A DISTORTION, BUT BROOKS 
DEFENDS IT. OTHER OPPONENTS FACE OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, they argued the issues, but in their first public matchup, Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Rolling Hills) and Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks 
exchanged some of their fiercest words over a photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 The picture -- of Harman and President Clinton during a White House ceremony 
-- has been used in Brooks' campaign literature with the caption: "Jane Harman 
beams with approval while Bill Clinton signs the largest tax increase in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harman, who represents Marina del Rey, Venice and Westchester, voted 
for the Clinton budget, she says the caption is a distortion. "I wasn't there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The August, 1993, photo was taken at another White House event where Clinton 
issued an executive order on deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with Bill Clinton . . . when he signed the Deficit Reduction Trust 
Fund. And yet here we are today, with the Brooks campaign handing out the same 
misleading captions." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo flap was the latest confrontation between the two candidates vying 
for the 36th Congressional District seat, which is split almost evenly between 
Democrats and Republicans in voter registration. Sunday's event also included 
Libertarian candidate Jack Tyler and American Independent Joseph Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign has refused to stop distributing the flyer, saying that it 
underscores Harman's support of Clinton's overall economic program, even as 
Harman tries to characterize herself as independent from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks tried to align her opponent with Washington's Democratic leadership. 
She accused Harman of voting for defense budgets that have created a "meltdown" 
in national security. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, said that she has fought for full funding of military 
aircraft projects in the district, as well as defense conversion programs. And 
she pointed to her support of a line-item veto, a balanced-budget amendment and 
further efforts to reduce the deficit -- all measures Clinton has opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates took tough stands on the immigration issue. Brooks supports 
Proposition 187, which would deny state services to undocumented immigrants. 
Harman called for adding 6,000 Border Patrol agents, stepping up workplace 
enforcement and for limiting benefits. She said after the debate that she has 
not decided whether to support the state initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields went even further: He called on the military to patrol the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, however, argued that the real issue should be government regulations 
that stem job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get rid of red tape, there won't be any problem with (immigrants) 
taking jobs at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of more than 500 at the James Armstrong Theater in Torrance also 
heard candidates in the 28th State Senate District and the 53rd Assembly 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 In their debate, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo), who represents 
Playa del Rey, and challenger David Barrett Cohen sparred over campaign finance 
reform. Cohen questioned Dills' acceptance of contributions from special 
interest groups, including $20,000 from the liquor industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, 84, angrily denied that he was influenced by the campaign 
contributions, pointing out that his support comes from a broad range of 
groups, including teachers and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills and Cohen were joined by Libertarian Neal Arvid Donner and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Cindy Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson called for limits to what the candidates may accept and spend in a 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner said the "prize is worth the cost" to lobbyists. His solution: a 
part-time Legislature, which would not have as much influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legislators would not have time to do as much damage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 53rd Assembly District matchup focused on the state bureaucracy. 
Incumbent Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) highlighted her attempts to cut 
Sacramento bureaucracy, such as her success in speeding up environmental 
permits so Smith's Food and Drug could build a shopping center at a former 
aerospace site in Redondo Beach. Her Republican challenger, Julian Sirull, said 
that the state government has to weigh the "cost and benefits" of environmental 
laws so it does not damage the business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peace and Freedom candidate Kevin Bishop argued that too much money has 
been spent to keep companies in the state. "Give them a profit and they will 
take the money and run," he said. Libertarian William Gaillard said that up to 
three-fourths of the state government could be eliminated to get the state out 
of its fiscal troubles.

WESTSIDE MERCHANT'S SLAYING STUNS NEIGHBORHOOD

<P>
 After arsonists burned down Samuel Zekarias' convenience store during the 1992 
riots, he and his wife thought they had weathered the worst crisis they could 
imagine in their adopted country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, they were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish it had stayed burned," his sister-in-law, Yeshi Robinson, said 
Tuesday. "If it had stayed burned, he would still be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Early Sunday morning, the 46-year-old Ethiopian immigrant was shot and killed 
by a man who robbed his 7-Eleven store at 4936 W. Pico Blvd. The gunman escaped 
with an unknown amount of money and was still at large, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zekarias was a businessman, he was concerned about more than making a 
profit, friends say. He used to give food to drifters who came to his store, 
and contributed time and money to neighborhood causes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say Zekarias seemed to provide the sunshine in their quiet Lake View 
Terrace neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was part of the reason why everyone enjoyed living on this street," said 
neighbor Sandy Hubbard. "Before I even knew who he was, he'd wave, say 'Hi, how 
are you, what's going on in your life?' He was so friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Brkic, who lives across the street, said she and other neighbors were 
shocked that crime, for so long a threatening but abstract concept, had claimed 
one of their neighbors. The incident makes her consider leaving Los Angeles, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be getting worse and worse instead of better," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zekarias and his wife, Emebeth Haile, 39, came to Los Angeles in 1972. They 
have a daughter, Lydia, now 12, and both studied for a time at Southwest 
College in Los Angeles, before working a series of jobs. Somehow, they scraped 
together the cash to buy their house and in 1987 the 7-Eleven franchise on the 
Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 The store had been robbed twice before, but Zekarias just handed over the 
money and nothing worse happened, said Robinson, Haile's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest incident, a 25-year-old clerk was with Zekarias when the robber 
entered the store, flashed his gun and demanded money, according to police. 
After emptying the cash register, the man ordered the merchant to open the 
store safe. When Zekarias explained that the safe is programmed to open only at 
certain times, the man shot him, according to Detective L.J. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The store clerk was not injured, Jones said. The detective said that as far as 
he knows, Zekarias and the clerk offered no resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for suspects who rob these types of locations to -- without 
provocation -- shoot and kill their witnesses," Jones said.  
</P>
<P>
 Southland Corp., the parent company of 7-Eleven, has offered a $25,000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Zekarias' killer.

BRIEFLY; EARTHQUAKE: CLINIC TO GET $1 MILLION FOR REBUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Santa Monica public mental health clinic is expected to receive $1 million 
from the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to rehabilitate and upgrade a 
building damaged in the January Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction of the Santa Monica West Mental Health Center, a County 
Department of Mental Health agency housed in a building built in 1928, will 
cost an estimated $9.2 million, half of which is expected to come from the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1 million will come from money allocated in the county budget for 3rd 
Supervisory District projects; the county government will fund the remainder of 
the construction costs through long-term financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The project includes doubling the size of the clinic's office space and 
building an 80-car garage. Construction is scheduled to begin in November.

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST LOS ANGELES; TIPPER GORE'S GOAL: TO GET DEMOCRATIC WOMEN 
TO VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're one of a million women who voted Democratic in November, 1992, and 
haven't voted since -- Tipper Gore wants you. 
</P>
<P>
 The wife of the vice president was the main attraction at a tea party at the 
West Los Angeles home of Democratic Party activist Lila Garrett last weekend to 
talk about the Women Vote! project -- a joint effort of the California 
Democratic Party, Emily's List, Dianne Feinstein for Senate and Kathleen Brown 
for Governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The project has identified California women who vote Democratic but only go to 
the polls in presidential elections. With polls showing both Feinstein and 
Brown in trouble, 1 million such women can be the margin of victory, organizers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we can't outspend the opposition, if we make our collective minds up, 
we can out-work them by getting out our voters," said Gore, speaking to guests 
who paid $100 each. "Women can make the difference because when they vote, they 
win." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, however, dismiss the Democratic effort as futile. Said Jennifer 
Grossman, communications director of the Michael Huffington campaign for U.S. 
Senate: "As soon as you hear talk about the need to re-energize your base, what 
you're listening to is the death rattle of a dying campaign."  
</P>
<P>
 According to Democratic Party chairman Bill Press, however, the $2-million 
project is the most extensive women's voter outreach project in California 
history. "We know who (the target group members) are and we have their phone 
numbers," he said. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will visit California in 
late October on behalf of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "These 1 million women originally voted for my husband and Bill Clinton. They 
voted to move the country forward and I know if we can only get the good news 
out to them like jobs are up, the economy is improving . . . that we can 
reignite their idealism and they'll put people in office who'll keep pushing," 
Gore said. LINDA FELDMAN

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; WATER ERUPTS FROM 6 BROKEN PIPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Water shot up from streets and sidewalks Tuesday after a series of mains 
ruptured under heavy pressure, but there was no major damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure was strange to see," said Hollywood resident Joe Shea, who took a 
tour of the streets. "There were little fountains blowing right out of the 
sidewalk and out of the pavement, streams of water running down the middle of 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 The six breaks were reported around Hollywood Boulevard and under the 
Hollywood Freeway on Monday night. Workers replaced ruptured portions of the 
pipes overnight and by 6:30 a.m. had restored service to the 40 customers who 
were cut off, authorities said.

 Cities will be fully reimbursed by the state and federal governments for costs 
incurred as a result of last year's wildfire and other disasters, under a new 
California law. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the bill was signed Sept. 16 by Gov. Pete Wilson, the federal Natural 
Disaster Relief Act mandated that the federal government pick up 75% of 
disaster relief costs, with cities and counties funding the remainder.But under 
the law, authored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman (D-Brentwood), the state 
will pay the costs not covered by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the new law, more than 300 county, city and other public 
agencies are eligible for funds, including Malibu, whose disaster relief costs 
stemming from the fire totaled $7.8 million. The city's state reimbursement 
will be about $487,000, said City Manager David N. Carmany. KATHLEEN KELLEHER

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; THE GATHERING PLACE OFFERS PEACE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For two years, Vincent Cook has thought of the Gathering Place as a home away 
from home, a welcome retreat from the inhospitable likes of government 
buildings and endless food lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, who has been HIV-positive since 1986, says the center's new, spruced-up 
digs on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard provide an even more inviting hangout 
than the drop-in center's previous location. "You can get some peace of mind 
here, get away," he said, helping himself to coffee and cookies in the center's 
dining room. "It's more like a house now than before." 
</P>
<P>
 Those such as Cook who have HIV or AIDS are rediscovering the Gathering Place, 
an aptly named center that provides its mostly black and Latino clientele an 
informal, homey atmosphere and a range of free services geared to provide a 
human touch: meals, massage therapy, dietitian and chiropractic services, 
individual counseling, support groups and a library for pleasure reading as 
well as keeping up-to-date on the latest AIDS research developments.  
</P>
<P>
 In August, the center moved half a block west of its second-floor quarters in 
an aging medical complex to a larger, 10-room space at 3966 King Blvd. Unlike 
the last location, it is free-standing and less clinical, said executive 
director Graciela Morales. 
</P>
<P>
 The interior walls of the new site, which formerly housed a church, are 
painted in soothing pink, purple and mauve. Furniture and doors are pale wood, 
and three overstuffed sofas are grouped around a communal television set. The 
dining room is country style, set with an oak table and chairs and outfitted 
with a coffee maker and a steady supply of snacks for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit center provides client services from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., 
Monday through Friday. The bulk of clients are referred by churches, AIDS 
agencies and other community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Though lauded by civic leaders as an exemplary community center in its 
two-year history, the center underwent a major administrative and personnel 
shake-up this year that at one point threatened to close it down. But Morales, 
who came on as executive director after serving seven years as a 
psychotherapist at the neighboring T.H.E. Clinic, said the Gathering Place got 
support from an unexpected place -- its clients, many of whom are homeless or 
impoverished. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Hang in there, girlfriend, we need you,' " recalled Morales, 
laughing. "A lot of them helped us move, right in the middle of the terrible 
heat wave. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 An energetic woman with rapid-fire speech and a penchant for hugs, Morales is 
deadly serious about enlisting whatever help she can for her clients -- a 
growing number of whom are women, children, parolees and the homeless. Of the 
nearly 125 clients the center serves each month, 20% to 25% are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gathering Place, founded by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondolet and 
the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange, relies heavily on private funding for its 
$340,000 annual budget. It has seven staff members, and most of its services 
are donated by professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The clients "deal with so much," said Morales, who has been trying to drum up 
support for the center at local black churches and on Spanish-language radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook, 31, who is homeless but says he expects to get federal housing, says he 
appreciates the fact that he can go to the Gathering Place anytime -- no 
questions asked, no cumbersome paperwork to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't let a lot of people get to know me, and I don't like to be around 
people all the time," he said. "I like that I can come here, and people share 
their problems. I take what I need away from here."

<P>
 Westwood has moved a step closer to creating a business improvement district, 
a designation that merchants and property owners are hoping will revitalize the 
economically flagging area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such a district, known as a BID, additional taxes are levied on local 
businesses.The collected fees are then put into a general fund used to pay for 
advertising and promoting the businesses, as well as for the upkeep and 
security of the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday tentatively approved the district on a 
14-0 vote. Final approval could come in November when the council is expected 
to hear from business people to weigh their support for the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The BID is an important step toward Westwood's resurgence," said Councilman 
Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents Westwood. "The business community has been 
supporting this for several years as a tool to improve the business climate and 
ambience." 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the 1,200 business people in Westwood endorse the formation of 
the BID, said Tom Carroll, executive director of the Westwood Village 
Management Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Westwood Village, long a premier walking and shopping locale, has been hard 
hit by the recession and the popularity of nearby attractions such as the Third 
Street Promenade in Santa Monica. SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; REPORT CITES IMPACT OF COMMERCIAL PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the city proceeds with a plan to expand commercial development around the 
Third Street Promenade, residents can expect more traffic, noise, people and 
garbage downtown, says a new environmental report, which also suggests measures 
to minimize the project's adverse impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bayside District plan calls for new shops, offices and apartments on 2nd 
and 4th streets.City officials and business people want to see more shops on 
4th Street and professional services on 2nd Street, said Ron Cano, executive 
director of the nonprofit Bayside District Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is accepting public comment on the environmental report, which the 
City Council will consider when it decides whether to approve the plan later 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved and developers come up with the money to build the apartments and 
offices, the report estimates that 368 people would move to the Bayside area, 
an additional 2,944 would work there and 1,842 more drivers would fill its 
streets at the evening rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not as bad as it sounds, the report says. Street improvements would 
reduce traffic congestion, leaving only the intersection of 4th Street and Pico 
Boulevard with "significant unavoidable impacts." 
</P>
<P>
 Damage to air quality would be "significant," the report says, but the 
pollution would not violate air-quality standards. Water conservation programs 
would ease the increased pressure on the sewage system. JOHN BUZBEE

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; FROWNS TURNED UPSIDE DOWN; SMILES ARE PREVALENT AGAIN 
AT BROADWAY ELEMENTARY IN VENICE AFTER A TRUCE THAT ENDED A LONG, BLOODY GANG 
WAR IN THE AREA. 'WE SURVIVED, PERSEVERED AND HAVE LEARNED FROM THE 
EXPERIENCE,' THE SCHOOL'S PRINCIPAL SAYS.

 Early on Monday mornings, before classes begin, the students at Broadway 
Elementary School in Oakwood line up in perfect formation on their playground 
for a weekly awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 As festive parents, teachers, siblings and grandparents look on, the school 
principal -- megaphone in hand -- blares out the names of the previous week's 
highest-achieving students. Pupils, ranging from pre-kindergarten to fifth 
grade, march forward to receive a special pencil and a pat on the back to the 
sound of spirited applause. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference a year makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few months ago, students and teachers often lay sprawled across the 
same schoolyard, ducking gunfire that crackled nearby. Games of hopscotch would 
be interrupted by police helicopters and sirens. And parents frequently swarmed 
the school to take their children home after neighborhood shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of last year's chaos was a deadly war between black and Latino 
gangs. In nine months of tit-for-tat shootings, 17 people died -- in many cases 
innocents who became random targets -- and 55 were wounded.  
</P>
<P>
 The violence traumatized Oakwood, a close-knit community of about 10,000 
residents in Venice. And perhaps nowhere was its fallout so apparent as at the 
elementary school, long an island of calm in the one-square-mile community. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came a gang cease-fire, which was negotiated in June by gang members 
with the help of probation officers and that remains in effect today. Now, 
Oakwood residents once again frequent local recreation centers, stroll in the 
neighborhood and hold outdoor barbecues. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Broadway Elementary, students, teachers and administrators are enjoying 
an atmosphere of calm and security that many other schools take for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more smiles, and (students) are not as anxious," said Jeannie 
Gutierrez, a psychologist at the school. "They're just happy, silly kids who 
are glad to have had a summer of peace -- to go to the beach, the boardwalk and 
the parks." 
</P>
<P>
 "This year I can walk around by myself and play outside," said one 10-year-old 
student, who asked not to be identified. "Last year I felt closed in, like I 
was in a jail. It was always hot in my house. Now I can feel a breeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Such stability is also important for the Oakwood community at large. Broadway 
Elementary has stood as a sanctuary of trust, a place where children are not 
only educated but fed and given psychological help. It's a place where parents 
take English-language and citizenship classes, seek advice and meet with 
neighbors during a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities hit by violence, local schools often serve as a refuge -- an 
important reason, experts say, that such schools must remain safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these (inner-city) environments are more lethal than most war zones 
in the world's headlines," said Jim Garbarino, author of "Children in Danger: 
Coping with the Consequences of Community Violence." "In these American war 
zones, there is a breakdown of a meaningful adult structure, and kids realize 
that their parents are not in control and cannot protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Garbarino, a professor of human ecology at Cornell University: "School 
becomes a potential safe zone, physically and emotionally, and a critical place 
for a child's safety, security and advocacy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For Broadway's principal, Ed Romotsky, providing safe schooling in a climate 
of violence became an obsession last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran administrator began his job in September, 1993, after a six-year 
stint as an assistant vice principal at Weemes Elementary School in 
South-Central Los Angeles. In South-Central, he gained plenty of experience in 
talking with irate parents, setting up large school events and dealing with 
physical attacks against teachers and other dangers -- including investigating 
a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Romotsky arrived at Broadway, he found a surreal atmosphere in which he 
was forced to search for solutions to a daunting mix of problems that at times 
seemed beyond his control. 
</P>
<P>
 Children were coming to school after witnessing shootings. Some of their 
relatives had been killed. Others spoke of bullets shattering windows at home, 
even lodging in their refrigerators. To be safe from gunfire, parents put 
babies to sleep in bathtubs and had children eat dinner while lying on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter had to cross the chalk (police) markings on the street after a 
shooting," said the mother of one Broadway Elementary student. "She was 
bewildered. She asked, 'What does this mean, are we all going to die?' To 
explain (it) to her was very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a gang shootout occurred on a street beside the school while 
Broadway Elementary was in session. In another instance, gunfire nearby caused 
students to stampede into the schoolyard bathrooms. And on a third occasion, a 
shell casing was found in the school's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Broadway's students were shot or wounded, but Romotsky brought in a 
team of counselors to deal with the psychological effects of the violence on 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them suffered from insomnia, depression, hyper-vigilance and an 
inability to concentrate. Others had an exaggeratedly startled response to loud 
noises, constant irritability or physical ailments such as chronic headaches, 
stomachaches and fatigue.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the dangers, many couldn't play outside after school, making 
matters even worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of them were being kept home and had no release for their nervous 
energy," said Robin Kay, a director at the Didi Hirsch Community Health Center, 
which provided counseling for children in the area. "Many of them had been 
deprived of the social interaction that they were accustomed to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The school's staff and teachers were devastated by the effects of the violence 
on the children and by the deaths -- from drug use or gunfire -- of young 
people in the community. Many of of the victims were former Broadway students. 
</P>
<P>
 On a wall in Gutierrez's office hangs a framed series of pictures of six 
fifth-graders, all classmates in the school seven years ago. They look like a 
close-knit bunch, arms draped around each other with ear-to-ear smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all dead," the school psychologist said of the photos, which she 
displays to memorialize the youngsters. "They were my little babies. I keep it 
there to remember." For decades before last year's strife, many of Broadway's 
black and Latino students forged close ties in the school and as they grew up 
together on the same parks and playgrounds. Black and Latino parents often 
picked each others' children up from school and shared baby-sitting duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The school has remained largely peaceful, even as its student body has changed 
demographically. In the early 1970s, a majority of Broadway's 1,100 students 
were black. Now, 87% of the students are Latino, 12% are black and 1% are 
white.  
</P>
<P>
 About 90% of the students are eligible for the federal meal program that 
provides free or reduced-price meals for needy children. (A family of four 
qualifies, for instance, if its income is $2,000 a month or less.) 
</P>
<P>
 Current enrollment is 365 students, down from 400 last year, a drop officials 
attribute to last year's violence and the Los Angeles Unified School District's 
new open enrollment policy allowing residents to place their children in other 
schools in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Broadway's students appear to get along, the nine months of gang 
violence that began last September created an atmosphere of suspicion in the 
community that sometimes made it difficult for blacks and Latino children to 
interact off campus, according to counselors who have held therapy sessions for 
Broadway students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although cash-strapped, Broadway Elementary appears well administered and 
maintained. No trash mars the schoolyard. Murals, not graffiti, decorate the 
walls. Attendance rates remain high. The children are well dressed and 
disciplined. Teachers say there have been few fights -- maybe two during the 
1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gang troubles erupted last year, Romotsky implemented emergency 
evacuation procedures and drop drills, in which students and teachers would lie 
prone in the schoolyard. The drills were put to use at least six times when 
gunshots rang out near the school, school officials say. Administrators also 
initiated continuous meetings with parents, teachers and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 With the support of his staff, Romotsky strengthened existing academic 
programs and expanded extracurricular activities. Students were taken on more 
field trips -- to colleges, hospitals and the Museum of Tolerance in West Los 
Angeles, among other places. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Avenue Elementary School in Westwood, a sister school of Broadway, 
donated food, clothing, computers and peer tutors. Parents worked as 
volunteers, painting rooms and weeding the schoolyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the face of all the craziness, we had to emphasize the positive," Romotsky 
said. "It was important we had a series of enrichment and nourishment programs 
in place. If there had been a vacuum, it would have been quite different." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake in January, which hit during the height of gang violence 
in Oakwood, the school organized a volunteer food drive for victims of the 
Northridge temblor. Hundreds of boxes of canned food, blankets and baby food 
were loaded in a rented truck and driven to a Red Cross quake-relief center in 
the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is: Our children are going to be survivors, not victims," Gutierrez 
said. "Better to teach children compassion and empathy. There's always going to 
be someone worse off than you. By giving kids power and authority, it refocuses 
their energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway Elementary was also helped by forging close ties with the Crossroads 
School for Arts and Sciences in Santa Monica. Started in the early 1970s, the 
popular private school offers a diverse curriculum, including a strong arts 
program and innovative college preparatory courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's principal, Paul Cummins, wanted to help poorly funded local 
public schools rejuvenate their virtually obsolete art programs. Backed with a 
$600,000 grant from the Herb Alpert Foundation and small grants from businesses 
and individuals, the Crossroads Community Foundation was founded in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, Crossroads has funded a comprehensive curriculum of 
music, art, dance and theater programs at Broadway, Coeur d'Alene Avenue School 
in Venice and at the Santa Monica Boys and Girls Club. The partnership between 
a private school and public schools is one of the nation's first and has begun 
to be replicated throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arts allow children to express their feelings in a positive way," Cummins 
said. "When kids find success in the arts it has a dramatic impact on their 
academic success. Art gives them a chance to say, 'I am. I have some value,' 
which is a wonderful way to make that statement instead of bottling it up and 
having it come out in destructive negative ways like graffiti and guns." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent day at Broadway, more than a dozen music students sat in a 
semicircle, imitating the rhythmic beats of their teachers with a series of 
claps and slaps. A student kept time by banging a drum; some hit gongs, temple 
blocks and a xylophone. They repeated the words to an Appalachian folk song 
while working on pitch and echo techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary goal is to experience the music through singing, listening and 
playing, teachers say. Though musical notes are drawn on the board, reading 
music remains a secondary aim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really develop a sense of ensemble. When one messes up, each helps the 
other," said Richard Geere, a teacher of the class. "They're willing to take 
risks and participate. The music really takes them to a place of joy. There's 
nothing to argue with." 
</P>
<P>
 Many teachers have noticed an increase in attention spans. And the music 
classes have pulled some students out of what seemed like an incurable 
lethargy. 
</P>
<P>
 "One kid who's always getting criticized at home just totally came alive in 
class. He now has this sparkle in his eye," said Marty Fox, a school music 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 The music teachers said such classes have given students an outlet that became 
particularly important in helping them endure -- and recover from -- last 
year's violence. Children often spend their lunch hours rehearsing. Others use 
bamboo poles on the playground for rhythm and dance practice. 
</P>
<P>
 When Geere and Fox returned for the fall term, they were greeted by a cry from 
a crowd of students who shouted, "It's them! It's them!" 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, Broadway Elementary, through its arts program, encouraged students 
to draw their Heart's Desire -- an illustration of their most fervent wishes -- 
on the sidewalk in front of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The message was clear in the many colored-chalk outlines: an overwhelming 
desire for peace. There were drawings of hearts, pastoral scenes, hands 
flashing the peace symbol and of blacks and Latinos painting out graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four months later, the colors of some of those drawings remain visible 
under the bubble gum stains and dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year's experience was a catalyst that brought many children and others 
in the community even closer together," Romotsky said. "We survived, persevered 
and have learned from the experience. Hopefully, it is a sign that we can keep 
working together."

OUT AND ABOUT / SANTA MONICA SYMPHONY: ORCHESTRATING A SUCCESSFUL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kicking off its 49th season, the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra takes center 
stage Sunday evening with a free concert featuring pieces by Mozart, Verdi and 
Villa-Lobos' "Fantasia for Saxophone and Orchestra," with soloist Douglas 
Masek. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Robert Gross, conductor and musical director and a music professor at 
Occidental College, said he is excited about the selections for his fourth 
season with the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things about our repertoire is that we try to give a mixture of 
standard repertoire and new music," Gross said. "(We perform) pieces that will 
entertain the audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Season highlights will include a performance by 17-year-old flutist Gregory 
Jefferson on Dec. 11 and cello soloist John Walz on April 30. On March 12, the 
symphony will also present Mahler's Symphony No. 5, a piece rarely performed by 
community orchestras because of its difficulty, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra, founded in 1945 by a 
group of film studio musicians, has grown into one of Southern California's 
most respected community orchestras. The orchestra is made up of professional 
and semiprofessional musicians who donate their time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have top-of-the-line musicians who stand up to the best players in the 
world," Gross said. "What is interesting is that this turns out to be a real 
community of musicians. It is a unique interplay between the dedicated amateurs 
and accomplished professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the musicians only meet a few times to rehearse before each concert, 
they work hard to produce polished performances. They also hope that their love 
of classical music and the arts can be shared with members of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are attempting to reach out to the community," said Sheila Wells, 
president of the Santa Monica Symphony Orchestra Assn. "We encourage parents to 
come with their children. . . . It could be a dual learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Symphony performs Sunday, 7:30 p.m., Santa Monica Civic 
Auditorium, 4th and Main streets. Free admission. Information: (310) 996-3260 .

BOOKSTORES: HOW INDEPENDENT SHOPS AND LARGE CHAINS INTERACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past, giant chains have targeted local independent bookstores as a 
matter of policy. It is therefore difficult to believe K-mart-owned Borders' 
western regional manager's claim ("Chain Reaction," Sept. 29) that she was 
"dismayed . . . that we were going to be such a close neighbor of such a 
respected bookshop" (as Sisterhood, an independent bookstore across the street 
from Borders' new Westwood location). 
</P>
<P>
 Equally unbelievable is her statement that she hopes Sisterhood will "do a 
better business because of spillover from us. Our employees will be instructed 
to refer people to Sisterhood." I doubt that Borders' customers who are in the 
market for Harlequin romances, Madonna videos and the latest Stephen King 
thriller will throng to Sisterhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time I took my daughter to the Sisterhood bookstore, she accurately 
remarked, "It's the kind of place where you want to spend a rainy afternoon." 
This is what the cavernous, impersonal Borders will never be.

DISABILITIES: THE PROBLEM WITH PARTIES FOR THE WHEELCHAIR-BOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thoughts on Linda Feldman's "Wheelchair Hostess Says: 'Let the Good Times 
Roll!' " (Sept. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Your article about Sue's Socialites irked me to no end. I am a severely 
physically disabled person who uses a power wheelchair. "Severely" is the 
census' definition for people like me who cannot do a central function, walking 
in my case. In the past I have attended Ms. Gordon's gatherings for the 
disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me make it clear I hold no animosity for Ms. Gordon. But I do hold a great 
deal of animosity for what she is doing. I am equally, if not more, disturbed 
by the point of view of this story and so many others. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? 
</P>
<P>
 First, Ms. Gordon is running an essentially segregated activity where disabled 
people get together to socialize with disabled people and eat surplus food. 
When she says that she is answering a need, I understand. But it is not this 
kind of party -- more ghettoization -- that solves the problem of segregation 
and stigmatization of people with disabilities. Such occasional parties are 
merely proof of the problem and perpetuation of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, this is not Ms. Gordon's fault. You get to see the context in which 
she, according to the story an able-bodied person until 30, was raised. Her dad 
described Ms. Gordon's party-goers. "These are Sue's kids," he says, "and we're 
the mama and papa." Even a cursory view of the attendees in the accompanying 
picture will tell you that they are not kids. Just as the Jerry Lewis Telethon 
and "Jerry's Kids" offend such a high percentage of disabled people, this 
activity, and your rhapsodizing over it, has a core of paternalism, 
infantilizing the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of leftover food from Canters for leftover people is from another 
era, not one in which disabled people are supposed to be equalized by their 
4-year-old Americans With Disabilities Act. It conjures up a society unwilling 
to welcome the former lepers of the socioeconomic structure into their homes, 
relationships and parties -- no matter what the law says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let the Good Times Roll!" says the headline. Another former attendee reminds 
me that Sue has never allowed alcohol at her parties. Nothing like keeping the 
lepers sober and more moral than everyone else! These are parties only a 
missionary or an administrator of an institution could think of as merry 
affairs, where some of the enormous tensions and inhibitions created by the 
daily battle with a super-physicalist Southern California culture can be 
loosened. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, I am sure something is better than nothing for some disabled people. 
Yet to romanticize and heroize such an essentially depressing undertaking, as 
so often is done by a press nearly completely devoid of severely disabled 
regular staff, merely shows where the press is rather than where we ought to be 
going. 
</P>
<P>
 I, like other visibly disabled people, would enjoy being invited to parties -- 
something that nearly never happens. But not any party, and not parties where 
the only thing that we have in common is a wheelchair and the fact that we had 
to pay an admission charge. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way such parties are a parody of parity -- a charity where people give 
away worthless things to useless people -- and exactly what is wished for by 
many able-bodied people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the type to ask for help," says Ms. Gordon, a theme that obviously 
pleases the editors, since it is placed in bold letters at the top of the 
story, even though, in the text below, Ms. Gordon says, "I don't have the 
funds, so I have to get donations." When a writer such as Linda Feldman is out 
to conjure up the stereotype of a brave cripple going it alone (and most 
important, not asking anyone to part with anything of value), the facts should 
never be allowed to get in the way.

 HEARTBREAKING LOSS 
</P>
<P>
 The disappointment in the voice of Santa Monica College Coach Robert Taylor 
was understandable after he watched his football team lose a big second-half 
lead Saturday in a 28-27 loss to rival West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor said there was something to be learned from the game, in which the 
previously undefeated Corsairs held a seemingly comfortable 25-7 advantage in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned a valuable lesson that you can't let down," Taylor said. "You have 
to play hard for four quarters. It's going to serve as a wake-up call. I hope 
everyone heard the call and it's ringing in our ears." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach was particularly upset because he thinks the Corsairs (2-1) are a 
better team than West L.A., which entered the game with an 0-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real truth is our football players lowered their standard of play to our 
opponents' level of play," Taylor said. "We made a tremendous amount of 
mistakes that we normally don't make and it cost us a victory." 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, he thinks the loss will serve to inspire Santa Monica when 
it plays struggling Glendale (1-2). The Western State Conference game is at 7 
p.m. Saturday at Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the first of five consecutive home games for Santa Monica, which 
played its first three on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "All things considered, I guess you can't be too disappointed about things," 
Taylor said. "We went out with a young football team and played three games on 
the road and we lost one. But now we have five in a row at home and we're 
looking forward to it." 
</P>
<P>
 As for West L.A., the Oilers hope to carry the momentum from the victory over 
their rival into a Western State Conference game against struggling Pierce 
(0-3) at 7 p.m. Saturday in Woodland Hills. GETTING IT TOGETHER 
</P>
<P>
 When his football team went 0-2 to start the season, Beverly Hills Coach 
Carter Paysinger could have easily been discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, the team's defense was looking downright ugly. In their first two 
games, the Normans gave up 96 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paysinger realized there were mitigating circumstances behind the team's 
difficulty. For one, Beverly Hills was missing four starters for its season 
opener and three the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the team's health improving, the Normans have won two games in a row in 
impressive fashion and appear fit to challenge powerful Ocean League rival Mira 
Costa (4-0) at 7:30 p.m. Friday in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have played well all year, and now we're finally putting it together 
on both sides of the ball," Paysinger said. "The first two weeks were like any 
year. You're feeling out your team's strengths and weaknesses and seeing where 
you need to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is still missing two starters, but Paysinger said the team's 
continuity and confidence have returned after back-to-back wins over West 
Torrance (38-14) and Morningside (36-27). The offense has been sharp all along; 
the Normans average 32.5 points behind quarterback Chris Wallace and running 
back Aaron Kogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're improving every week and we're getting to the level where we think we 
should be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Have they improved enough to play a team such as Mira Costa, defending 
Southern Section Division VII champion? 
</P>
<P>
 "We know they're a very good football team," Paysinger said. "When you win 17 
of your last 18 games, that speaks for itself. But we feel we can compete with 
them. We feel good about our football team." READY TO TEE IT UP 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the start of its season, Pepperdine finally has a men's golf 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Cody Barden, a teaching professional at the Tournament Players Club at 
Sawgrass in Ponte Verde Beach, Fla., for the past three years, has been hired 
to coach the Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Barden, 25, succeeds Kurt Schuette, who resigned July 29 to accept a similar 
position at USC. Schuette guided Pepperdine into the NCAA West Regionals the 
past three seasons, and the Waves earned their first berth in the NCAA 
championships in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Athletic Director Wayne Wright, who has been the team's interim 
coach, is confident the success will continue under Barden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kurt Schuette did a tremendous job of building the program and developing a 
national reputation for Pepperdine golf," he said. "Cody's extensive golf 
background and skills will keep the momentum of our program moving in a 
positive direction."

 Barden, a graduate of Arizona, earned his PGA card in 1992 and has played on 
the Florida mini-tour circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He will take over a Pepperdine squad that was ranked No. 29 in a preseason 
national poll by GolfWorld. The Waves opened their 1994-95 season by finishing 
in a tie for sixth place at the Washington Husky Golf Classic two weeks ago. 
MOWING THEM DOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Four standouts from the Beverly Hills Lawn Bowling Club will compete against 
many of the best in the nation in the 1994 United States Lawn Bowling 
Championships that begin Saturday and run through Wednesday at Sun City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Topping the list are Anne Barber and Heather Stewart, who will compete in the 
women's pairs division. They finished second in the division at the 1993 U.S. 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber, considered among the top players in the U.S., has won two national 
titles in the past. She won pairs titles at the 1992 U.S. Championships and the 
1993 National Open, both times with a different partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others representing the Beverly Hills club are not strangers to national 
competition. Joe Siegman, who will compete in the men's pairs division, won the 
pairs title at the 1993 National Open. Richard Simon will compete in men's 
singles after qualifying for the U.S. Championships in pairs in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The four participants from the Beverly Hills club will represent the 
Southwest, one of seven regions competing in the national event. The Beverly 
Hills club will also play host to a tournament Sunday at Roxbury Park Lawn 
Bowling Greens, 401 S. Roxbury Drive. MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Murphy, a 6-foot-3 point guard who averaged in double figures in scoring 
last season at St. Monica High, has transferred to Notre Dame in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy's strongest asset may be his free-throw shooting, having made more than 
90% of his attempts last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Former All-City guard Sam Crawford from Westchester High has signed a free 
agent contract with the NBA's Seattle Supersonics. After graduating from 
Westchester, Crawford went on to star at Moorpark College and New Mexico State.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Leo Kottke 
</P>
<P>
 "6- and 12-String Guitar" (1969) 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino  
</P>
<P>
 Kottke's approach to music making is uniquely American -- in the best sense of 
all that entails. Combining unswerving dedication to craft, a complete 
disregard for musical convention and deliriously eclectic tastes, this 
Georgia-born, Minnesota-reared singer-songwriter-guitarist virtually invented 
his own musical category. 
</P>
<P>
 His phenomenally accomplished guitar technique was born fully matured on this 
debut album, released the same year that man stepped into the powdery dust of 
the moon and the viscous mud of Woodstock. 
</P>
<P>
 What's immediately apparent here is his instrumental proficiency, whether it's 
the nimble folk-flavored finger-picking of "The Driving of the Year Nail" that 
opens the album, his purely classical plucking on Bach's "Jesu, Joy of Man's 
Desiring," or the slashing, stinging slide work on "Vaseline Machine Gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years he has refined and expanded his art, but the seeds of nearly 
everything he's done in the 25 years since his debut are here. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing missing from this all-instrumental outing is his equally unique 
voice, the perfect vehicle for his predictably unpredictable lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his physical voice didn't show up until later, his musical voice 
is unmistakably clear. RANDY LEWIS

SCOTT HARRIS: LIMBO OF THE UNNAMED DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case report describes the victim as a male Caucasian. His age is noted as 
35+. Height is 73 inches. Weight is 182 pounds. Brown hair, brown eyes. A 
mustache. The form asks the investigator to choose among four types of death: 
NAT, ACC, SUI and HOMI. There's a circle around SUI. 
</P>
<P>
 There was never a doubt. Witnesses first spotted him on Sept. 4 at the 
intersection of 3rd Street East and Lightcap Street in Lancaster. He had 
climbed a utility pole and was grabbing a wire, "apparently trying to 
electrocute himself." People heard him declare, "The world made me do this!" 
Authorities managed to coax him to step on a fire truck ladder, but then the 
man dove head first to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no identification. A check of prints turned up nothing. There have 
been no calls from worried relatives and friends. So more than a month later, 
coroner's investigators are still trying to find the true name of John Doe No. 
154. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's got to know this guy," Nick Romero says, displaying the file. 
"Somebody's got to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sentiment that echoes throughout the county morgue, where an unusual 
number of John and Jane Does now exist in kind of earthly limbo. In normal 
times, Nick Romero and partner Gilda Molano might actively work 10 cases, with 
dozens more from past years filed away awaiting a break. Last week, as the 
unsolved caseload for 1994 grew to 30, their phones seemed strangely quiet. Not 
all of their Does were old, rootless drifters. Several were young -- in their 
teens, 20s and 30s. Where were their families and friends? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must know John Doe No. 154. And somebody must know Jane Doe No. 41, a 
homicide victim whose half-burned body was found Aug. 7 in Sun Valley near La 
Tuna Canyon Road. And somebody must know Jane Doe No. 35, a teen-age girl whose 
body was found July 12 in an inch of water on the concrete bed of the Los 
Angeles River, below the 6th Street bridge. Investigators don't know whether 
she jumped or fell or was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators show a snapshot of the girl, her eyelids slightly open as if 
nodding off to sleep. She's described as Latino, 4-foot-11 and weighing 105 
pounds with medium-length brown hair. The condition of her corpse is described 
as "good." 
</P>
<P>
 On a windowsill above Molano's desk rests a school photo of a teen-age girl, 
smiling prettily. "My niece is 16," Molano says. Jane Doe No. 35 looks to be 
about the same age. "If she were mine, I'd be looking for her. She could be a 
continuous runaway, but still. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the dead are easily identified. There's I.D. in a pocket and the next 
of kin is easy to find. Otherwise, coroner's investigators rely on a network of 
fingerprint files at the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department, the Department of 
Justice and Veterans Affairs. If the initial checks turn up nothing, the case 
goes to Romero and Molano, who usually manage to solve the mysteries within a 
few days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 We pay them to give the dead a measure of dignity and to give survivors some 
answers. We also pay them to assist in the cause of justice. Homicide 
detectives assigned to Jane Doe No. 41 won't know where to start unless Romero 
and Molano can figure out the identity of this young woman. The case report 
describes her as 5 feet, 4 inches, 133 pounds, with brown eyes and 
medium-length black hair beneath a wig. She was wearing "a yellow metal chain 
with a charm of Jesus Christ around her neck."  
</P>
<P>
 The Does are typically kept about one month before they are turned over to the 
county hospital for cremation. Some exceptions are made. Nearly three months 
after she was found in the L.A. River, Jane Doe No. 35 remains stored in Crypt 
40, because the investigators figure somebody will step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration over the Does prompted Scott Carrier, the coroner's public 
information officer, to issue a press release seeking the public's assistance. 
The phone has been ringing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get calls here: 'I haven't seen my mother in seven years,' " Romero says. 
"I mean, it's been seven years and now you're checking?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The press release paid off. Romero was able to tell one woman that her brother 
had died in 1992. Molano was able to help a man whose mother had been missing 
for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded like the young man might be asking about Jane Doe No. 60, a 
68-year-old woman who had been killed in a traffic accident on Sept. 27. 
Sometimes, Molano says, people have a hard time accepting the sad truth. 
</P>
<P>
 This man dropped by the coroner's office twice. The first day, he looked at a 
snapshot and wasn't sure. The second day, Molano was able to show him the 
personal effects found with Jane Doe No. 60. The clothes were certainly 
familiar. And there was no mistaking her key ring, with its little frame 
holding the photo of a grandchild.

<P>
 While I recognize the need for a federal courthouse in Orange County, (General 
Services Administrator Roger) Johnson's, (Sen. Dianne) Feinstein's and (Sen. 
Dennis) DeConcini's actions should be recognized for what they represent -- the 
liberal's credo of pork over principle (especially within weeks of a

MORNING BRIEFING: WITHOUT HOCKEY, CANADIANS ARE AT A LOSS ON SATURDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, life without hockey isn't going over too well in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 For many fans, Saturday night broadcasts of "Hockey Night in Canada" are where 
the memories started. It's a national tradition that might as well date to the 
time Lord Stanley first sipped from a cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Saturday night, there were no NHL games in Canada, or anywhere else 
for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since I was a little kid, there's always been hockey on Saturday 
nights," said fan Mike Conway of Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad is it? Worse than we thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sitting here watching all this junk on TV," Conway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia question: Besides Magic Johnson, which Lakers wore No. 32? 
</P>
<P>
 Sticks and stones: ESPN's Keith Olberman roundly criticized Ken Burns for, 
well, committing errors in Burns' 18 1/2-hour "Baseball" documentary. Burns' 
response? 
</P>
<P>
 He called Olberman a "petty-minded nit-picker." 
</P>
<P>
 Ho Hummer: Once he started counting all the bad things that have been 
happening in sports, Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution had sort 
of a bleak outlook for the Toy Dept. 
</P>
<P>
 The headline on Hummer's column: "Sports enters bleakest period in its 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Hummer said the summer's greatest highlight was "a soccer tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hummer: "Heaven help us, we've turned into England." 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck: Shaquille O'Neal on how he defends against NBA most valuable player 
Akeem Olajuwon: "I just put my hands up and hope he misses." 
</P>
<P>
 Start thinking, Wade: Yes, there's a lot of head-shaking going on in Denver, 
where the 0-4 Broncos have given up 34.2 points a game. There is also a lot of 
finger-pointing going on, often in the direction of Coach Wade Phillips, who 
wishes he knew what's going wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew what it was, I'd change it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or just pro sports: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer doesn't think much 
of the owners' tactics in the NHL labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lyon: "This doesn't sound like negotiation as much as it sounds like 
extortion." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough, uh, love: Dallas Maverick Coach Dick Motta doesn't sound as if he is 
going to use the sweet-talk approach on Roy Tarpley, reinstated by the NBA 
after being banned for running afoul of the league's drug policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Motta: "I don't want him contaminating my team. . . . I don't want to get 
into baby-sitting. I can't give him preferential treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Jim Krebs, Jerry Grote, Bill Bridges and Cazzie Russell. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: From Shreveport Pirate linebacker Mario Perry on the struggling 
Canadian Football League team's lack of unity: "We should be like brother to 
brother. Instead, we're more like cousins." THOMAS BONK

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Alex Solis began riding here in 1985, he sought help from his idol and 
fellow Panamanian, Laffit Pincay. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Please do me a big favor," Solis asked Pincay. "When I do something wrong, 
tell me. Keep an eye on me." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Nice guy Laffit complied, but he hasn't had to pass along many tips the past 
few years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, 30, has become one of the most successful jockeys on the toughest 
circuit in America. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has won the last two riding titles at Hollywood Park and finished fourth at 
the most recent Del Mar, Santa Anita and Oak Tree meetings. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 About all he needs to achieve stardom is a big horse, and he might have one in 
Call Now, the 2-year-old filly who will be heavily favored in the $200,000 Oak 
Leaf Stakes on Saturday at Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "She's very special," Solis said. "I've never ridden one quite like her. She's 
strong and smart. She does everything so easily. She doesn't waste any energy." 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Solis also rides another promising 2-year-old trained by Ron McAnally and 
owned by Verne Winchell, On Target. Three hours before Call Now's race at Santa 
Anita on Saturday, On Target will be running in the $500,000 Champagne at 
Belmont Park in New York. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Ron made the decision that I will ride Call Now," Solis said. "But he said On 
Target is still my horse too." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On Target should appreciate that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Solis is strong, disciplined, and virtually mistake-free. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 He has earned the reputation of being among the hardest workers in his 
profession, one who rides regularly in the mornings and studies tapes every 
night while atop a wooden horse at his home in Arcadia. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had Chris McCarron, Eddie Delahoussaye, Steve Cauthen and Craig Perret," 
said Solis' agent, Harry (the Hat) Hacek. "Alex will prove to be as good as any 
of them." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a note sent out with season-ticket applications, Angel President Richard 
Brown virtually guarantees there will be a 1995 season. If there isn't, buyers 
will get not only their money back, but 5% interest. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the solution to the labor dispute is the same as it was 
weeks ago -- eliminate arbitration and don't create a salary cap. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, told by Manager Marcel Lachemann that he will be the Angel first 
baseman next season, will leave Tuesday to play in the Venezuelan Winter 
League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 L.A. writers will miss Jim Gott, who was always honest and cooperative. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Is there anybody who hasn't been mentioned for the Baltimore Orioles' 
managerial job? . . . It's remarkable how well the Philadelphia Eagles are 
rushing passers without Reggie White, Seth Joyner and Clyde Simmons. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NFL trading deadline is Tuesday, but major deals during the season are 
rare. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Larry Parker, a true freshman wide receiver from Bakersfield, is going to 
catch a lot of passes for USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Expect the Trojans to be angry Saturday in Corvallis. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA outside linebacker Donnie Edwards is having a great season. He leads the 
team in unassisted tackles, tackles for losses, sacks and interceptions. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' other outside linebacker, sophomore Phillip Ward, is quietly 
emerging as a star of the future. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Colorado State's high-powered offense should give the Arizona defense a good 
test Saturday in Tucson. These Rams can throw the ball. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Boston College has the kicker, David Gordon, who beat Notre Dame last year, 
but not the quarterback, Glenn Foley, so don't expect the Eagles to repeat the 
upset Saturday. . . . Don King is in Mexico trying to secure a site for 
Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez-Michael Carbajal III. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 CBS' six-fight series will begin with Kenny Keene-Terry Ray on Saturday and 
end with Oscar De La Hoya-John Avila on Dec. 10 from the Grand Olympic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State has passed the halfway mark of its goal of selling 1,290 
season tickets for the first basketball schedule at the Pyramid. The opening 
game is Nov. 30 against Detroit Mercy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Basketball Legends" will be the theme of the newsmakers' luncheon Tuesday at 
the Anaheim Stadium Club that will feature Elgin Baylor, George Yardley and 
Jerry Tarkanian. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 John Lucas coaching Lloyd Daniels was a nice success story while it lasted, 
but Lucas is now coaching Philadelphia and Daniels has been cut by the San 
Antonio Spurs.

NEWSWIRE: DALY LOSES HIS $30-MILLION DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Daly, who withdrew from the PGA Tour last month because of personal 
problems, lost his 10-year, $30-million sponsorship Wednesday with Wilson 
Sporting Goods Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it has suspended its contract with Daly, one of golf's most 
popular players. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said it will resume its relationship with him under a "restructured 
agreement" once the company is satisfied Daly has met "specific behavioral and 
performance objectives." Wilson did not elaborate on those requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson has been very supportive of me during my career, so I understand and

</P>
<P>
 The jury in the civil trial of five Los Angeles Police Dept. officers being 
sued by Olympian Al Joyner heard testimony from Joyner's coach, who said the 
1984 gold medalist in the triple jump was on pace to make the 1992 U.S. Olympic 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommie Lee White testified that Joyner was certain to qualify for the U.S. 
team in the 110-meter hurdles and would have done well in the Barcelona 
Olympics. White said that after the police incident Joyner lost his focus, 
became "hyper-vigilant" to noises and was unable to train properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner is seeking monetary damages for a traffic stop on May 8, 1992 in which 
Joyner was ordered from his car at gunpoint and handcuffed after police had 
mistakenly read his car's license plates. His attorneys are arguing that the 
incident caused emotional stress that prevented Joyner from qualifying for the 
Olympic team. Tennis

MOTOR RACING / SHAV GLICK: PARKER POISED TO BECOME FIRST TO WIN FIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A stunning turnaround in the American Motorcyclist Assn.'s Grand National 
dirt-track series last Saturday night in Sacramento has Scott Parker close to 
winning an unprecedented fifth championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, who won four in a row from 1988 to 1991, and Carroll Resweber, who won 
from 1958 to 1961, are the only four-time champions. Ricky Graham, Bubba 
Shobert, Jay Springsteen, Bart Markel, Joe Leonard and Jimmy Chann all won 
three, and Kenny Roberts got only two before moving on to road racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two races remain and Parker has a five-point lead over 1992 champion 
Chris Carr, 271-266, in a battle of 750cc Harley-Davidson teammates. The 
championship of the 22-race series will be decided in the Pomona Half-Mile on 
Saturday night at the Fairplex, and the Del Mar Mile on Sunday, Oct. 9, at the 
Del Mar Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we win No. 5, Sacramento will be the race we'll remember most," Parker 
said after winning his record 59th Grand National in the Sacramento Mile. "When 
I got there, all I could think about was '92 when I kept winning, but when the 
season ended I was two points back of Chris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that even if I swept Sacramento, Pomona and Del Mar that Chris could 
win the championship by finishing second each time. I didn't know how lucky I 
was until the (Sacramento) race was over and a couple of guys held up four 
fingers (Carr's number) and said he broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr, leading by 14 points when the race started, dropped out when the 
carburetor fell off his bike. He was credited with a 14th-place finish, good 
for only one point. Parker got 20 for winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too busy fighting off Steve Morehead to know anything happened to 
Chris, but I knew how he felt when it was over. I'd had an even worse night at 
Castle Rock (Wash.) in the last race before Sacramento. I went there with a 
six-point lead and came out 14 behind when I didn't qualify for the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I'm still wary about Pomona and Del Mar even though I'm back in front. I 
like the Pomona track -- it's such a beautiful facility and has such a great 
atmosphere -- but in the back of my mind I know how fast things can turn 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker has won four of the last six races held at the Fairplex, including one 
last spring. Carr has won one, in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Mar horse racing track, where Chris Agajanian will promote the season 
finale, has not been used for motor racing since 1949, when Rex Mays was killed 
in an accident during an Indy car race. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a pacesetter is nothing new for Parker, who keeps in shape during the 
off-season by racing on ice near his home in Swartz Creek, Mich. When he won 
his first Grand National in 1979 in the DuQuoin Mile, he was only 17, the 
youngest rider to win a national event. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he won nine races, including two at Ascot Park, between 1979 and 
1985, Parker's fortunes took off in 1986 when he hooked up with Bill Werner, a 
tuner from the Harley factory. Werner, 50, already had won three championships 
with Springsteen and two with Gary Scott before adding four more with Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner has a record 95 victories as a dirt bike tuner, including the seven 
Parker has this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We work real good together," Parker said of his association with Werner. "He 
is cautious, but very thorough. When I show up for the first race each year, he 
has everything in place, all the parts we're going to need for the whole 
season. He doesn't like dilemmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker will be 33 on Nov. 21, an advanced age for Grand National riders. And 
he knows it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, anyone my age would be retired, but today the riders are 
better conditioned and take care of themselves, so we're able to ride longer. 
Look at Morehead, he's 39 and he's won three races this year, and Ricky 
(Graham) was 34 when he won the championship last year. It's when you see those 
22-year-old kids coming at you that you know you've got to work that much 
harder. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know I'm not getting any younger myself. If I'm going to win my fifth, 
I'd better get it on." 
</P>

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: BEAN BRINGS SCORING TO PACIFIC 
CHRISTIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like all great soccer scorers, Ryan Bean is a marked man, and he has the 
bruises to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean, a sophomore forward for Pacific Christian, has scored 25 goals this 
season. That success has brought on swarms of defenders, but Bean said he tries 
to ignore them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if they are hitting me -- I'm used to it," Bean said. "If the 
ball is played through, I can take two or three guys but more than that I 
sometimes have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone notices. Bean has scored a goal in all but one of the Royals' 
games this season and in six he has scored three or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he scored 33 goals in 20 games and led Pacific Christian to its 
first spot in the National Christian College Athlete Assn. national tournament. 
Pacific Christian finished third in Division II as Bean scored four goals in 
three games and was named a first-team All-American selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great dribbler and he's very, very, very quick," PCC Coach Rich Davis 
said. "He can score from anywhere on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean, who scored 30 goals as a senior at Kennedy High, could have played 
elsewhere. He has trained with former Salsa Coach Rildo Menezes and had offers 
to play club soccer in Mexico. Davis says he has NCAA Division I talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bean was introduced to Pacific Christian through his church, and his 
Christianity played a big part in his decision to attend the small school 
across Nutwood Avenue from Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really think of any other school," he said. "I figured if I was 
going to go on to a higher level it would be later, if I decide to keep working 
at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bean, who is working on a degree in youth ministries, said hopes to eventually 
play professional indoor soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he is giving opponents fits. Monday he broke his school record by 
scoring five goals in a 8-2 victory over La Verne. He could have had six, but 
he hit the crossbar on a penalty kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get the ball at the 50-yard line and I have to go through however many 
guys, I have to create something from nothing," Bean said. "Defenders only have 
to destroy. It's much harder to create than it is to destroy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than Bean: Bolstered by a strong recruiting class, the Royals (7-2-1) are 
off to their best start in school history. Davis has brought in 10 freshmen, 
including three from Kennedy, and a transfer from Golden West College, 
midfielder Joey Bahash. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahash is the team's second leading scorer with three goals and eight assists. 
Andrew Mehr and James Oates, both from Kennedy, and returners Jeff Lunz, a 
second-team All-American, and Tony Barber anchor the defense. Goalkeeper Greg 
Gunderson was an honorable mention All-American. Derek Bean, Ryan's younger 
brother, is the backup goalie. 
</P>
<P>
 PCC plays host to Simpson College at 3:30 p.m. Friday at Chapman Park in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Panther power: Midway through its first season as an official NCAA Division 
III program, Chapman is doing exceedingly well. The five team sports -- women's 
volleyball, men' soccer, women's soccer, football and water polo -- all have 
winning records. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The volleyball team, ranked second in the west region, is 15-4. Tuesday, 
Occidental ended the Panthers' eight-match winning streak with a victory in 
five games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The men's soccer team, which upset Division I UC Santa Barbara, 6-4, 
Friday, is 6-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The women's soccer team is 7-3 after beating Pomona-Pitzer, 2-0, in 
overtime Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The water polo team, ranked No. 20 in the nation, is 7-3 and has a key 
tournament at Claremont-Mudd Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The football team is 2-0-1 with a game at 1 p.m. Saturday at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Football notes: Chapman quarterback Todd Gragnano celebrated his 23rd birthday 
by leading the Panthers on a last-minute drive to salvage a tie with Redlands 
on Saturday. Playing with an injured finger on his passing hand, Gragnano 
completed three consecutive passes to move the ball from their 38 to the 
Redlands six. Two plays later, Oscar Ford tipped Gragnano's pass and Dave Poltl 
caught it and scored. After a two-point conversion, the Panthers had a 14-14 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was Dave Poltl with the greatest birthday present ever," Gragnano said 
after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Galasso, who started at tailback against Redlands but was forced to play 
quarterback for three series when starter Curtis Robinson and Gragnano were 
injured, has been taking some more snaps in practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who was scratched in the eye while being pulled down by his facemask 
against Redlands, practiced in non-contact drills Tuesday and was awaiting a 
doctor's clearance so he could participate in contact drills Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 After drawing a sellout crowd of 4,194 for its first home football game Sept. 
24, Chapman has adjusted its pre-sale ticket policy. About 500 general 
admission tickets will be available to the public for each game, depending on 
on-campus demand. The Panthers have three more home games: Oct. 22 vs. Menlo, 
Oct. 29 vs. La Verne and Nov. 5 vs. Pomona-Pitzer. . . . The Southern 
California College men's cross-country team moved into the national NAIA 
rankings this week. The Vanguards are ranked No. 14. Azusa Pacific is ranked 
No. 3 and Westmont No. 11.

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: MISTRI LOOKS FOR WAY TO LIFT SOCCER 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Al Mistri found it surprising when he thought about it. The Cal State 
Fullerton men's soccer coach was talking about this season and saying that he 
was "a little disappointed at this stage." 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed with a team that is 6-3-1? 
</P>
<P>
 That's why Mistri did something of a double-take when hearing his own words. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we haven't done as well as we hoped at this point, and I'm sure the 
players feel the same way about it as I do," Mistri said. "It's not like we're 
having a bad season or anything close to that, but we were hoping we could be 
in the top 10 right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching the NCAA semifinals last season boosted hopes for this year. 
Fullerton started the season ranked seventh in the nation by Soccer America, 
but has dropped out of the top 20 and now is unranked. 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and illness have played a role.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've played very well at times, but it seems as though we've never been able 
to start a game healthy and ready to go," Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans defeated Washington, 2-0, but lost to Portland, 2-0, in the 
Washington tournament in Seattle last weekend. The Titans had more injury 
problems, one of them serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Demian Brown, who was having vision problems from a concussion in the 
Washington game, injured his knee against Portland, and he will be out the rest 
of the season. Brown was an intimidating force for the Titan defense last 
season, and was one of its key players this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also has been troubled several times with outbreaks of the flu. Eddie 
Soto, the team's top player, was fatigued by dehydration during one stage of 
the season, and troubled by stomach flu at another turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Lak also was injured over the weekend, losing two teeth in a collision 
in the Washington game. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Titans fail to win the automatic bid to the NCAA playoffs that goes to 
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation champion, Mistri says the Titans will 
need a strong finish to gain an at-large bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were 12-6 last year and made it in," Mistri said. "But right now, all this 
considered, you'd have to say our at-large bid is in jeopardy. A lot will 
depend on what happens in our last 10 games of the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans defeated San Diego State in its only Pacific Division conference 
game. They play two conference games this weekend, one at UC Santa Barbara 
Friday and the other at Cal State Northridge Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri is still hoping the team will become more consistent, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's been one of our problems," he said. "One of the games we lost this 
season was to Stanford and that's the only game they've won all year. Right 
now, it seems like a season of missed opportunities, but those things can 
change too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton cross-country Coach John Elders said his men's team was "pretty much 
overwhelmed" at the Stanford Invitational last weekend, with the Titans 
finishing 15th in a field of 16 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had five freshmen, a sophomore and a junior competing, so we were asking 
quite a bit from a team that young," Elders said. "But this is a great young 
group, and they'll continue to improve. Our goal is to finish in the top three 
in the Big West, and I still think that's a reasonable goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's highest individual finish in the men's division was by Mark 
Sinderson, who was 59th in the meet. "I think he's much better than that, but 
he was fatigued at this meet because he's been running so many training miles 
right now. He's never run this much before, but we feel it will pay off for him 
in the championship phase of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan women's team fared slightly better at Stanford, taking 11th in a 
field of 17. Heather Killeen, favored to win the Big West title, also was 
below-par but still finished 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders also expects the women's team to be among the top three in the 
conference. UC Santa Barbara, which won last year, has many of its runners 
back. "We're probably just a tad behind Irvine right now for the No. 2 spot in 
the conference," Elders said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Titan basketball Coach Bob Hawking is optimistic about making some recruiting 
inroads in the early basketball signing period, Nov. 9-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're working on a lot of players and we'd like to sign some guys early if 
that's possible," he said. "Of course, it's still very early in the process, 
but our goal is to sign two players in the early-signing period." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking still has one vacancy on his staff for an assistant coach. "We hope to 
be able to do something on that before too long," Hawking said. George Tuttle 
moved into a full-time position when Hawking became interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman outfielder C.J. Ankrum and sophomore pitcher-outfielder Mark Kotsay 
are among 72 college baseball players invited to the U.S. baseball team's fall 
tryouts, Nov. 2-6 in Homestead, Fla. The trials are designed to identify the 
top players for the national team for the 1995 and 1996 seasons. Titan junior 
pitcher Ted Silva played on the U.S. team this past season. . . . The Titans 
will have a "Midnight Madness" program for the opening of basketball drills. 
Practice officially starts at midnight Oct. 14. An introduction of the men's 
and women's teams is planned beginning at 11 p.m., with a dunk contest for the 
men's team starting practice at midnight. . . . The women's soccer team is 3-4 
this season, already surpassing last season's two victories. Jennifer Patterson 
and Amber Dickey lead the team in scoring, each with three goals. Regular 
goalkeeper Jennifer Bryant has given up 10 goals and recorded 20 saves.

OAK TREE; ON TURF OR OFF, STAROLAMO'S A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Kim Lloyd was a little disappointed when rain forced the $81,225 
Autumn Days Handicap, the traditional opening-day feature at Oak Tree, off the 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
 He was eager to try Starolamo, who had won her only previous start on the 
turf, on Santa Anita's hillside course. 
</P>
<P>
 How the 5-year-old Bargain Day mare would have done on the grass Wednesday 
will never be known, but it wouldn't have been an improvement on her main track 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-5 favorite against a field reduced to six starters after four late 
scratches, Starolamo found room late under Kent Desormeaux and went on to beat 
Sophisticatedcielo by a half-length in 1:16 for the 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the fourth victory in five starts for Starolamo since she returned to 
the races after being away for nearly nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very impressive today because she was stuck, stuck, stuck with 
nowhere to go," Lloyd said. "But when she's right, she'll always give you that 
run the last part of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud of her. The only thing that would have kept her from running is a 
sealed track. She's had her problems -- she's sound now -- but I don't want to 
run her over anything hard. But I really wanted to run her on the turf because 
the best race of her career was on the turf after a nine-month layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, I wanted her to get used to the configuration of the downhill turf 
course because her next race is going to be in the Cal Cup (Oct. 29) on the 
turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Lamont Isom and Stanley Moore, Starolamo has earned $193,275 from 
seven victories in 13 lifetime starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophisticatedcielo finished nearly three lengths ahead of Beautiful Gem, then 
came 5-2 second choice Desert Stormer, Forest Haven and Booklore. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Tree Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Desormeaux and Pat Valenzuela both won twice Wednesday. Desormeaux 
completed a sweep of the late double, winning the ninth with Cardinal Peak 
after Starolamo's victory. Valenzuela scored upsets with Raising Havoc in the 
sixth and Ashtabula in the seventh.

SETTING, ACTING TURN 'TEMPEST' INTO DRIZZLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To begin with, Shakespeare's original idea for "The Tempest" came from reports 
of a violent tornado that had sunk a ship called the Sea Venture off the coast 
of Barbados in 1609. He long had been fascinated by the New World and the 
stories adventurers brought back. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicholas E. Boicourt Jr., in his production of "The Tempest" at the 
Tribune Theatre, has set the play on "an unknown Mediterranean isle," which not 
only subverts its historical and political intent but takes away its theatrical 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes Caliban (Jennifer Bishton) into a screeching, indecipherable 
cockney hag, instead of what Shakespeare intended: a representation based on 
contemporary reports of the natives found in the New World. 
</P>
<P>
 Boicourt's edited version has taken most of the magic, emotional and social, 
out of the play, and it was magic in various forms that the Bard was talking 
about. Even more noticeable than Boicourt's indiscreet cutting is the inability 
of most of the cast to make any dramatic connection with the text, or to 
exhibit any understanding of the poetry of the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The two exceptions are Bradley A. Whitfield as Prospero and Robert Shirreffs 
as Ariel. Though he looks too young to be Prospero, Whitfield misses neither 
the intent of the dialogue nor the poetry; his is a solid performance that 
deserves a richer setting. Shirreffs' Ariel is earthbound, more like Puck, but 
the actor understands the little-boy-lost quality in the character, the 
desperate hunger to be freed from bondage, and Ariel's infectious sense of 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prospero's naive, innocent young daughter Miranda (Cammie J. d'Entremont) and 
her just-as-naive new lover Ferdinand (Michael Murphy) look deliciously 
enamored. But like the rest of the company they sound as though they're in 
junior English class and suddenly have been asked to read their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The production itself is fascinating visually, especially considering all it 
accomplishes on such a postage-stamp-sized stage. The storm at the beginning is 
exciting, Gina Karaba's costumes are on target, Joaquin Rodas and Lisa 
Gonzalez's lighting is effective, and Jerry Chavez's special effects are 
impressive.

THEATER REVIEWS; 'CRUCIBLE' AT OCC: THERE'S STRENGTH IN TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are some plays that beg for revival on a pretty constant basis. The 
human race doesn't learn much from the past and has to be reminded. Arthur 
Miller's "The Crucible" is one of those plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller wrote it in angry protest of the witch hunts conducted by Sen. Joseph 
R. (Tailgunner Joe) McCarthy and the House Committee on Un-American Activities, 
when so many lives were destroyed. Miller's point is as valid today as it was 
then, and for the most part, director John Ferzacca's production in Orange 
Coast College's Drama Lab frames Miller's anger and wisdom well. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is Puritan Salem, Mass., in 1692, when a group of young women, 
caught dancing in the woods, began relating imaginary memories of spiritual and 
psychological harassment in order to defend themselves against the slings and 
arrows of public opinion. The witch hunt was on; many innocents were hanged 
after refusing to confess. 
</P>
<P>
 How well Miller's historical perspective can apply to each generation depends 
on how powerfully, and that means how naturalistically, the action in his 
script is played out. Ferzacca has a good grip on the tragic events in Salem, 
and if some of the minor roles are not rendered with the bite and honesty they 
deserve, the major figures stand out sharply, doing the text and the author 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferzacca's sense of timing is right on the button. His actors pick up cues 
brightly when tension calls for it, and his rhythms during the heavier, meatier 
moments are impeccable. 
</P>
<P>
 John Proctor's wife, Elizabeth, is accused of keeping poppets in the farmhouse 
in order to work spells. Then John himself is accused by Abigail Williams, a 
maid-of-all-work who was thrown out by Elizabeth for committing lechery with 
John. PJ Agnew as Proctor, Rita Renee as Elizabeth and Terri Mowrey as Abigail 
are the strongest in the cast, caught up in the aura of the period and the 
innocence that breeds their doom. Solid performances all. 
</P>
<P>
 George Almond, as the Salem minister who acts as the McCarthy figure, has a 
realistically sincere exterior, beneath which the embers of hatred and fear 
glow intensely. Melissa Cook easily balances young Mary Warren's unwitting and 
terrified shifts from one political camp to another, and Cristina Rabano has 
several fine moments as the Barbadian black from whose exoticism the false 
accusations spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Hebler is a bit mannered in the beginning as the Rev. Hale, who turns 
from religious firebrand to regretful defender of the damned, but he calms down 
as the action progresses and is very effective. So is Tom Titus as Deputy Gov. 
Danforth, who tries the victims; he captures the pomposity and anger of the 
character well, missing only the senses of intelligent responsibility and 
kindness that often confuse this basically good man, who cannot in good 
conscience wander from the letter of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 If David Dunbrack's lighting design is generally too bright throughout for the 
mood and look of the production, and if many of the minor actors seem a bit at 
odds with the text (particularly a young marshal with red streaks like Indian 
war paint on his face), the core of the company makes up for it.

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; CITY EXPECTS TO NET WORLD CUP PROFIT; FINANCES: AS 
MUCH AS $2 MILLION MAY GO INTO MUNICIPAL COFFERS ONCE THE SOCCER ORGANIZATION 
MAKES ITS REMAINING PAYMENTS FOR RENT AND VARIOUS EXPENSES. 
</P>

<P>
 The soccer hooligans didn't show up in Pasadena for World Cup games, and the 
dreaded massive traffic jams never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, World Cup security expenses were lower than expected, and the 
city was able to put away more money in its coffers than anticipated, according 
to a report to the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials initially thought they would have to use as much as $400,000 of 
the $2 million that Pasadena would receive in lease payments for the Rose Bowl 
to pay for security costs away from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pasadena was able to keep the $2 million, half of which already has been 
budgeted to pay for more police and for anti-gang and recreation programs, 
officials said. The remainder is being held in reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, World Cup USA made about $2 million in improvements to the Rose 
Bowl, including widening of the field and a new handicapped seating section, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a successful event, and we're proud of what happened," City Manager 
Philip A. Hawkey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city is still waiting to receive most of its money. World Cup USA owes 
the city $500,000 in rent and $3.3 million for public safety and other 
reimbursable city expenses, said Assistant City Manager Edmund F. Sotelo. 
Payment is expected later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted to refer the report for further review to its Business 
Enterprise Committee, chaired by Councilman Rick Cole. One of the things the 
committee will examine is whether Hawkey's figures for the city's costs of 
staging the World Cup are accurate and whether all of the $2 million represents 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Isaac Richard said he is concerned that the city has not been fully 
reimbursed for all staff time spent during two years of planning and 
preparation for the soccer tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I question these numbers. I don't think they're accurate," Richard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bill Crowfoot, who is on the Business Enterprise Committee, said he 
also wants to be sure the city is able to accurately total the costs of major 
Rose Bowl events in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't really have any sense, I think, of what our break-even points are." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkey said he stands by his figures and also noted that the city will benefit 
from increased sales and hotel taxes. The city will receive $250,000 in 
increased bed taxes as a result of the World Cup, but sales tax figures are not 
available, Finance Director Mary Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, the main glitch in the World Cup effort was Soccer 
Carnaval, a city-sponsored festival. After World Cup exercised its contractual 
right to keep the festival closed on game days, Soccer Carnaval flopped and 
merchants lost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has paid $58,000 to settle claims with 10 merchants, and 11 claims 
are pending.

 ALHAMBRA: A hearing to challenge the firing of Alhambra school board member 
Steve Perry from the city Police Department will be closed to the public at 
Perry's request, said Ann Wilson, Alhambra's personnel director. Perry, 32, has 
worked as an Alhambra police officer for more than 12 years. He was fired from 
the department on Aug. 8 for undisclosed reasons. Perry has appealed his 
dismissal to the city's five-member Civil Service Commission. The hearing has 
been scheduled for Oct. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: More than 200 homes and several commercial buildings fronting 
Foothill Boulevard have been annexed into the Highland Homeowners Assn. by the 
City Council. The zoning change means any additions or alterations to the 
exterior of those buildings will now have to be approved by the city's 
architectural review board. The new boundaries for the association will be 
Virginia Avenue to the north, Santa Anita Avenue to the West, Highland Oaks 
Avenue to the east and Foothill Boulevard to the South. 
</P>
<P>
 ARCADIA: Police Chief Neal R. Johnson, 59, has announced plans to retire on 
Dec. 31 after 38 years in law enforcement. He will join a private security 
company. Johnson has been police chief in Arcadia since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 COVINA: A City Council majority that led successful efforts to recall the 
entire previous council last year for imposing a 6% utility tax ignored threats 
of another recall and charges of betrayal Tuesday and gave preliminary approval 
to an ordinance for an 8.25% utility tax. The council, which voted two weeks 
ago to have staff members draw up the ordinance, stuck to its guns Tuesday and 
voted 4 to 1 to impose the tax despite opponents' promises they would be ousted 
unless the issue is put to a vote of residents. 
</P>
<P>
 EL MONTE: The City Council approved a lease agreement with U.S. Helicopters 
Inc. of Long Beach to provide a police helicopter at a cost of $124,800 
annually. The council also formally agreed to a mutual-aid helicopter service 
between Baldwin Park and El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: The City Council has voted to oppose Proposition 187, a measure 
on the November ballot that would deny health benefits and education to illegal 
immigrants. The council voted 4 to 0 for the motion proposed by Mayor Judy Chu. 
Councilman Francisco Alonso abstained. The council also voted to postpone from 
Oct. 12 to Oct. 19 interviews for city commission positions up for appointment, 
including a seat on the library board.  
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: The city hired a new planning director from Oakland, filling a 
position that has been vacant for nearly a year. Alvin D. James, deputy 
director of planning for the Bay Area city, starts Nov. 7 in the $96,000-a-year 
job. The hiring of James, who is African American, was welcomed by local black 
leaders, who have criticized the city for failing to hire more top-level black 
employees. City Manager Philip Hawkey said James was hired based on his 
qualifications, not his ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 SOUTH EL MONTE: The council has unanimously approved a motion opposing 
Proposition 187, a measure on the November ballot that would deny health 
benefits and education to illegal immigrants.

WOMAN WHO TURNED IN SONS GROWS WEARY OF LIFE IN HIDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After turning in her two teen-age sons to police for murder and fleeing her 
home early this year because their gang member friends vowed to kill her, 
Marilyn Ross seems to have found the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Azusa woman brought her young daughter back from hiding out of 
state and the two now live rent-free in a roomy home with a back-yard pool. 
Movie producers have phoned to discuss deals. The William Morris Talent Agency 
represents her, and an attorney is working to get a book written about her 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture is far from idyllic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a job," Ross said recently as she opened the door on her nearly empty 
refrigerator. So far, all she has been able to find are temporary stints. 
</P>
<P>
 Her footsteps echo on the bare wooden floor of her sparsely furnished living 
room. She points to a mattress on the floor in a corner of one room that serves 
as her bed. She has had to fend off criticism from people who questioned her 
motives and whether she has been a fit mother. And she has nightmares of being 
murdered herself -- tracked down like the hunted person she is, to be shot and 
killed on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ross counts herself luckier than most crime witnesses who go into 
hiding, she figures that much of the help came from her own persistent 
scrambling and from sympathetic strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's witness protection program, set up to aid crime witnesses facing 
threats, is woefully inadequate to the task, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were going to hide me," she said. "I thought they were going 
to protect me."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she had to abandon her misperceptions, as others have before her, and 
face the reality of the sparse help available. Under the county's witness 
relocation program, only first and last month's rent on a new apartment is 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 And outside help has been narrowed, Ross believes -- although some people 
familiar with her case disagree -- by a state Assembly bill that takes effect 
Jan. 1. The Right to a Fair Trial bill prohibits crime witnesses from receiving 
payment for information about a crime for one year after the date of the crime 
or until a final court judgment is reached. The bill was prompted by 
revelations that some witnesses in the O. J. Simpson case had sold their 
stories to the media.  
</P>
<P>
 The crime that changed Ross' life occurred about 9 p.m. on Feb. 5 when Raj 
Kumar Sharma, 40, of Covina, a clerk at an Azusa market, was robbed, shot and 
killed for $72 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said that five days later, after an argument with his mother, her eldest 
son, Nicholas, 16, confessed to her that he and his younger brother had killed 
Sharma. Dumbstruck and fearful, Ross went to police and her days in hiding 
began. For six months, she called a hotel room home. 
</P>
<P>
 But after her story was published in The Times, a dizzying number of calls 
poured in from television talk shows, movie producers and talent agents, 
seeking interviews and possible story deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was flown to New York City to appear on the nationally syndicated Rolonda 
Watts television show. On camera, she was confronted by her angry mother, Elsie 
Newman, 61, the boys' care-giver for most of their lives. Newman insisted that 
her grandsons are innocent, called Ross a negligent mother and accused her of 
abandoning her sons years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross has not been in touch with her sons' father since the boys were infants. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial interest, the movie deals dried up, said Rick Rosenthal, an 
attorney representing Ross. Producers who came forward wanted to pay Ross only 
a small sum and then shop around her story to the major studios on speculation, 
Rosenthal said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Ross' race -- she is African American -- adds to her difficulty, 
limiting the commercial appeal of her story. Rosenthal said television 
producers prefer stories about perfect "Brady Bunch" families. Stories about 
minorities are a harder sell, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, hotel staff and others who had helped Ross said they began 
to resent her and accused her of making too many demands. They questioned her 
credibility and motives. Some talked of money they loaned to Ross, which she 
never paid back. Some called her ungrateful and complained of the star attitude 
she seemed to take on in response to media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sheriff's Sgt. Rey Verdugo, the detective assigned to the Azusa murder 
case, attributes Ross' behavior to stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime witnesses "suffer indignities, threats, having to relocate, get a new 
job, and all they've done is follow the law and do the right thing," he said. 
"And, suddenly, the whole world turns upside down for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross finally escaped her prolonged hotel stay when an ex-social worker heard 
her story on a news radio show and offered to put her up temporarily in a 
vacant rental home the person owned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops were going into their own pockets to help her, and there was nothing 
in place for someone who had done the honorable thing," said the former social 
worker, who requested anonymity. "I decided to see if I could help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross now has a temporary job and her daughter is enrolled in school. She hopes 
to find a permanent job to begin paying rent when her free stay ends in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, her younger son, a 15-year-old, was convicted June 9 in Pomona 
Juvenile Court of the Azusa murder and robbery. He was sentenced to confinement 
in the California Youth Authority until age 25 
</P>
<P>
 Her elder son, Nicholas, is scheduled to be tried as an adult later this 
month. Ross will likely be a key witness against him, said Verdugo and the 
county prosecutor assigned to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cary Rudman, an attorney in Sacramento who helped fashion the crime victim 
payment bill for Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, said Ross will be able to 
receive money for her story because the new law will likely not apply to her. 
Ross' involvement with the criminal justice system began before the law was 
proposed and goes into effect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her role as a witness and the threats against her life made her eligible for 
help from the county's witness relocation program. Ross, like many others, 
mistakenly thought the program would bring comprehensive help: personal 
security guards, a legal change of identity, relocation in a place far away, 
help with housing, food and a job. 
</P>
<P>
 But the program provides only first and last month's rent, usually in an 
apartment in Los Angeles County. Yearly, only about 120 people qualify for even 
this limited help countywide, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ross was luckier than most. 
</P>
<P>
 For six months, Compton police kept her in a city-owned hotel with free room 
service. Police Chief Hourie Taylor said Ross knew someone on the Compton 
police force who put her and her daughter in the hotel for a night. Compton 
police then agreed to extend her stay as a favor to the Sheriff's Department, 
which was investigating the Azusa murder, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the days stretched into months, Ross said, when repairs to her disabled 
van came to a standstill. The county witness relocation program paid two 
months' rent on a new apartment for her. Sympathetic acquaintances in the hotel 
paid for her daughter's air fare out of state. But without transportation, Ross 
said, she was unable to move from the hotel and lost the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Ross said she was down to $100 in cash and all her belongings -- 
pots and pans, clothes and a personal computer -- piled in her non-working 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threats against her, she said she feared returning to her 
apartment, her family and her former job as a real estate manager. Friends who 
knew of her plight were reluctant to help, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'Gee, Marilyn, you can't come here. They might shoot up my house. 
Can I send you 10 dollars?' " Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get by, Ross did odd clerical jobs and eventually landed a temporary job 
working on a political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, no one knows her past in the quiet, suburban community where she lives. 
She said she walks in anonymity to the grocery store and feels safe. 
</P>
<P>
 But still she worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed I got shot," she said, recalling the nightmare in which a gunman 
appeared as she was unloading groceries. "I tried to run, but the bullet hit me 
in the back and I fell on the grass." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she sometimes freezes in fear when she sees a young man who reminds 
her of a gang member or she remembers afresh that she is a hunted person and 
recalls all she has gone through. It has changed her, she said, to be more open 
to life, less repressed and uptight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just in case I die tomorrow, I want to do a little living today," she said.

ARCADIA POLICE ACCUSED OF RACIAL, SEXUAL BIAS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: FOUR CLAIMS 
CHARGE THAT THE CITY'S 73-MEMBER FORCE HAS TARGETED YOUNG PEOPLE, MINORITIES 
AND THE DEPARTMENT'S OWN FEMALE OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last year, the Arcadia Police Department has been hit by four separate 
claims of racial and sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Those filing the claims accuse the city's 73-member force of unfairly 
targeting young people, minorities and the department's own female officers for 
harassment and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusations are detailed in a $1-million claim against the city, a federal 
discrimination complaint and two recent lawsuits, including one seeking $1 
million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the face of our community is changing," said 10-year resident Alicia 
Alfaro, one of the complainants. "We're seeing more and more brown faces in our 
community and I don't think these officers have been sensitized to that." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials deny the accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Arcadia Police Department is an extremely professional organization," 
said Arcadia Police Capt. David Hinig. "We can on any given day make several 
thousand contacts with the public. The number of people who come forward and 
make this type of complaint is very small, two or three people, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Mike Miller characterized all the complaints as "unproven, 
speculative, general allegations without any support." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have defamed the Arcadia Police Department," Miller added. 
</P>
<P>
 Those making accusations against the department are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Beverly Hayden, owner of the Burger Palace, who filed a $1-million federal 
lawsuit in July alleging that Arcadia police discriminated against young people 
and Latino customers at her "classic car night" by targeting them for increased 
traffic scrutiny and citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden says problems arose in 1989 when she began the car shows Thursday 
nights at her restaurant on West Las Tunas Drive. The events drew up to 400 
people, many of them young Latinos, who displayed their vehicles in the 
restaurant parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Arcadia police created a special task force using officers from 
El Monte and Glendale, as well as Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
deputies and California Highway Patrol officers. The task force strictly 
enforced traffic and vehicle code violations near the restaurant three 
Thursdays in a row last year in July. More than 300 of her customers were 
ticketed, Hayden said, which shut down the car club and discouraged customers 
from visiting on other evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, filed July 8 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, Hayden 
seeks $1 million in compensatory damages, $50,000 in punitive damages and an 
injunction to end police surveillance and enforcement at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hinig said police paid special attention to the business only because it 
drew alleged gang members and drug dealers, as well as complaints from 
neighboring businesses and residents. Police arrested one drag racer who, after 
leaving the Burger Palace, sped at 100 m.p.h. on nearby streets, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gus and Alicia Alfaro, who filed a $1-million damage complaint against the 
city in March, also accused Arcadia officers of harassing Latinos, specifically 
their son, Gus Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alfaros say their son, then 14, was harassed by police officers in August, 
1993, as he stood outside a house with his friends; in September, 1993, as he 
was walking to a football game with other boys, and on Oct. 14, 1993, at a 
football game at Arcadia High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicia Alfaro said other youths have told her of similar treatment, but they 
are reluctant to come forward. Although her son has not been physically harmed, 
she fears that he could be singled out for more and harsher treatment unless 
she speaks up. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials dismiss the Alfaros' complaints as frivolous and unfounded. 
Police said that the boy refused to sit down in the bleachers when ordered to 
do so by officers and that he cursed at the officers, prompting their response. 
An internal police department investigation of all the Alfaro's complaints 
found no police misconduct, Hinig said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deborah Pierce, a former Arcadia probationary police officer who filed a 
discrimination lawsuit after she was fired last year, and a woman cadet who 
filed a federal discrimination complaint in April both accuse the department of 
sexual harassment and discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 In her complaint, Pierce, 30, claims that racist and sexist attitudes 
translated into discriminatory on-the-job actions against women and minority 
Arcadia residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, who worked for the Arcadia Police Department from June 24, 1991, until 
her firing on Jan. 20, 1993, said she was shocked to find that Asians, Latinos 
and African Americans were targeted for extra field interrogations, searches 
and traffic stops to discourage them from entering the city. Police officers 
freely used racial epithets and jokes and regularly "roughed up" people of 
color, Pierce claims in her lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 She herself was sexually harassed by one officer, exposed to X-rated videos 
watched by officers in the station break room during their dinner hour and was 
the target of unfounded rumors of sexual misconduct, she said. She alleges that 
her performance ratings declined and she was fired when she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Her complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, filed 
in October, is pending. Meanwhile, in January she filed a civil lawsuit in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce's attorney, David Fertig of Pasadena, said he also is handling a 
similar complaint filed in April, 1993, with the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission by a former female Arcadia police cadet. Fertig declined 
to give the woman's name but in documents filed with the EEOC the woman alleges 
sexual harassment similar to that claimed by Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arcadia Police Department conceded that it has no African American police 
officers. But six officers are female, eight are Latino and two are Asian 
American, according to Arcadia Personnel Department documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia Police Chief Neal R. Johnson said his department is sensitive to 
ethnic and sexual issues. Two years ago, department captains and lieutenants 
were trained to recognize and prevent sexual harassment. The information from 
the sessions was passed down to patrol officers, he said. Further, the 
department conducts outreach programs to the city's Asian community using 
awareness videos and printed materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia police also declined to give details about the firing of Pierce and 
the female cadet because of the pending litigation. But they said both women 
were fired for justifiable reasons. The department's 18-month probation period 
sometimes weeds out those that initially appear to be good candidates, said 
Hinig, who added, "You can look good on paper but if you can't perform in the 
field, then the employment is terminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Johnson said Pierce's discrimination lawsuit is a first for the 
department. The city has never paid damages in a discrimination lawsuit, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief questioned how his department could even be accused of 
discriminating against women and youths. His officers take their lead from him, 
he said, citing his 26-year involvement with youth car clubs, 36 years of 
volunteering for Boy Scout activities and his post as coordinator and founder 
of a Boy Scout Explorers police academy. Further, Johnson, a former Arcadia 
Citizen of the Year, was twice awarded a national Scouting award for his work 
with youths.

EXTENSION; LEGISLATION SIGNED BY GOV. WILSON GIVES FINAL STATE SANCTION TO THE 
FREEWAY PROJECT. BUT FEDERAL APPROVAL AND POTENTIAL LEGAL HURDLES STILL LOOM. 
</P>

<P>
 The long-delayed Long Beach (710) Freeway extension got another boost Friday 
when Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill eliminating the need for South Pasadena to 
approve the highway's passage through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three decades, tiny South Pasadena has stalled Caltrans' efforts 
to close the 6.2-mile gap between the San Bernardino (10) and Foothill (210) 
freeways with legal challenges, lobbying and a refusal to sign an agreement 
required by state law to allow the freeway to cut through the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the other cities on the route -- Los Angeles, Pasadena and Alhambra 
-- have agreed to the plan, South Pasadena has vowed never to approve the 
extension, which would split the historic city in half, threaten nearly 1,000 
homes and destroy 6,000 trees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law signed by a Republican governor and written by a Democratic 
lawmaker stripped the city of any veto power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The completion of the Long Beach Freeway is of critical importance to the 
Southern California economy. It is years overdue," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials this week promised to consider more litigation to 
challenge the constitutionality of the law's erosion of home rule for local 
governments. Meanwhile, they downplayed its significance in the freeway's 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally we're disappointed. It is bad law that erodes home rule for cities, 
but I don't think it is going to have much effect on the freeway with so many 
other major hurdles," Mayor Amedee O. Richards Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's action comes two weeks after the California Transportation Commission 
gave final state approval to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 All eyes are now on Federal Highway Administrator Rodney E. Slater, who must 
approve the route for the $670-million project to go forward. Although funding 
problems and litigation could delay the extension beyond its projected 
construction in 10 years, Slater is the freeway opponents' last chance to kill 
the project, according to highways lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, freeway supporters hailed the governor's decision as a 
consensus for construction and a signpost for Slater to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sends a clear message to the folks back in Washington that we have a 
unified effort under way. The region as well as the state want the gap closure 
completed," said Julio J. Fuentes, Alhambra city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Monterey Park), who was author of the bill and 
represents the Alhambra area where much of the traffic now travels, applauded 
Wilson's action, saying it would lessen traffic congestion on surface streets 
and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law revitalizes 1982 legislation written by her father, Rep. Matthew 
G. Martinez (D-Monterey Park), when he was a state legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government expects to make a decision on the route in February or 
March of 1995, said Eugene W. Cleckley, Federal Highway Administration chief of 
environmental operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also faces an expected legal challenge by South Pasadena to the 
route's environmental impact assessment, which would delay the project for at 
least two more years. 
</P>
<P>
 If all these hurdles are cleared, the cost by the time construction would 
start is expected to have risen to $1 billion, with 85% from the federal purse.

TOPICS / EVENTS; 1.3 MILLION VISITED 67TH COUNTY FAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 67th Los Angeles County Fair closed Sunday after a 24-day run that 
attracted 1.3 million visitors, about 3% fewer than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission prices were the same as last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after admission prices increased, attendance fell by 23% compared 
with the previous year. Admission prices in 1992 had increased from $8 to $10 
for adults, from $5 to $6 for children, and from $6 to $7 for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 When prices were rolled back in 1993, attendance rebounded to 1.4 million -- a 
12% increase over the previous year. This year's attendance was 9% higher than 
1992, when the fair had 1.2 million visitors, but this was still lower than the 
all-time high of 1.6 million, set in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials said this year's fair was the safest in years, with only minor 
accidents and crimes reported. This year's fair also had more entertainment 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's fair, themed "The Big Howdy," was the first in 16 years to be held 
without President and Chief Executive Officer Ralph M. Hinds, who died July 30. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials also announced a permanent theme for all future fairs, rather 
than creating a new theme each year. Starting in 1995, the fair's permanent 
theme will be "America's Fair." Fair officials said it has been difficult to 
choose a theme each year that encompasses all the fair's various activities and 
sub-themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative dates for next year's fair are Sept. 8-Oct. 1.

TOPICS / LAW; MONROVIA RAISES DUI IMPOUND FEE TO $230 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The price paid by drunk drivers just shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monrovia City Council on Sept. 20 approved an ordinance allowing police 
officers to charge convicted drunk drivers $230 to have vehicles released from 
impound, up from a $50 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will be used to fund DARE drug and gang prevention programs in local 
schools, Monrovia Police Sgt. Jay Olds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even those found not guilty of drunk driving charges must pay a $50 
administrative fee to retrieve an impounded vehicle.  
</P>
<P>
 Other police departments also charge impound fees when citizens are arrested 
and their cars impounded, regardless of whether the person is eventually found 
guilty or innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Arcadia, Baldwin Park and El Monte all charge $30 to $55, according to records 
clerks in those departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just started this year when we found out most cities were charging," said 
Stella Weimer, a records clerk for the Arcadia Police Department, which charges 
$30. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never really get any complaints."

GENERAL EDUCATION PLAN ADOPTED; CURRICULUM: NEW POMONA COLLEGE PROGRAM IS AIMED 
AT DEVELOPING MORE ACTIVE, HANDS-ON LEARNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA WALKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a two-year process of rethinking the fundamentals of a liberal 
education, the Pomona College faculty has adopted an innovative general 
education program designed to prepare students for lives and professions in a 
rapidly changing world. 
</P>
<P>
 The new requirements, which went into effect Sept. 1 with this year's freshman 
class, are a major shift from lecture-driven course requirements in the 
humanities, social sciences and natural sciences, to requiring courses aimed at 
developing more active, hands-on learning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students should be generating ideas instead of just receiving them," said 
Betsy Crighton, professor of politics at Pomona College. "We're trying to get 
students away from merely regurgitating information and getting them to discuss 
ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Physics professor Thomas Moore, who served on the curriculum committee that 
drew up the framework, said the old models of teaching just don't cut it any 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students need to be flexible thinkers," Moore said. "Most students gain some 
skills learning how to research textbooks, but not skills for the everyday 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls on professors to focus on encouraging students to acquire 
specific intellectual capacities in each class, rather than absorb a series of 
facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to pull that off yet," Crighton said. "I have to become more 
single-minded and most of us professors have a lot of agendas in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The new focus requires Pomona College's 1,400 students to gain 10 intellectual 
capacities aimed at equipping a person for a life of intellectual resilience: 
</P>
<P>
 * Read literature critically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use and understand the scientific method. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use and understand formal reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 * Understand and analyze data. 
</P>
<P>
 * Analyze creative art critically. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perform or produce creative art. 
</P>
<P>
 * Explore and understand human behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 * Explore and understand a historical culture. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compare and contrast contemporary cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Think critically about values and rationality.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH EL MONTE; EX-MAYOR PARDO ENTERS PLEA IN ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former South El Monte Mayor Raul Pardo entered a plea of innocent at his 
arraignment on two charges of misdemeanor battery after he allegedly assaulted 
two men outside a public meeting in July, the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo, 32, was arraigned last month in connection with attacks on Larry 
Rodriguez, a photographer for the South El Monte Mirror, and David Santos, an 
El Monte resident, outside a heated July 6 town hall meeting on whether to 
allow a card club in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A pre-trial hearing date was set for Oct. 26 on the charges, which could 
result in six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. He was charged with serious 
battery in the assault on Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor, who lost his council seat in last April's election and is 
now a city planning commissioner and a county health commissioner, has said he 
acted in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo, a strong supporter of the card club, told sheriff's deputies that 
Rodriguez, whose newspaper opposed the club, allegedly started the fight by 
directing profanities at him, elbowing him in the side and then punching him in 
the forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Pardo said he struck back in self-defense and punched Santos in the face for 
restraining him because it placed him at a disadvantage, according to police 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy James Kozak, who interviewed four witnesses, wrote in his report 
that the attack was "deliberate and unprovoked."

COMMUNITY NEWS: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; $1.25-BILLION SUIT FILED OVER TUNGSTEN 
MINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Upland man has filed a $1.25-billion lawsuit against the federal 
government, saying that Angeles National Forest officials have illegally 
blocked access to his $250-million tungsten mine, one of the largest in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Curtis, 47, filed suit last month in U.S. District Court in an effort to 
restart mining on his 1,426-acre Mt.Baldy claim. U.S. Forest Service officials 
shut down his 24-person mining operation in 1992, posted armed guards at his 
mine and blocked his private road with large rocks, Curtis said. Consequently, 
he lost a $16-million contract to deliver tungsten to GTE. Tungsten is used to 
make ammunition and light bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials never explained why they prohibited access to his 
mine, Curtis said. They simply sent him a letter that said he could no longer 
use the road to his mine, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I figured it was a joke," Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials said they could not comment on pending litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis declined to reveal how much money he has made from tungsten sales since 
he started the mining operation in the 1970s. Curtis has fought several court 
battles related to his mining rights. His father discovered the claim in 1951.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; REAL LIFE CLIFFHANGERS; TRAGEDY CAN BE JUST A 
STEP AWAY FOR THOSE WHO ENTER THE ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST UNPREPARED FOR ITS 
DEADLY VARIETY OF NATURAL HAZARDS.

<P>
 Rick Perez was a standout college baseball player more at home on a baseball 
field than on a hiking trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old El Monte resident was on a rare tramp July 2 through the 
Angeles National Forest, on his way with friends to go swimming in Santa Anita 
Canyon. He stepped off the trail to take a shortcut, lost his footing and 
tumbled 75 feet down the steep, rocky incline into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez was one of six people killed accidentally since January among the rocky 
canyons of the 655,000-acre forest northeast of Los Angeles. During that time, 
the Angeles also was the site of 17 nonfatal falls; 18 incidents of people 
getting stuck on cliffs; seven mountain bike accidents; 76 motorcycle 
accidents; scores of incidents of people driving cars, motorcycles and 
recreational vehicles under the influence of alcohol -- and sometimes off 
cliffs -- and 44 reports of overdue friends and relatives, most of whom 
eventually turned up alive and well. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like to think of the forest as their back yard. I don't think they 
realize sometimes that their back yard has ticks and rattlesnakes and uneven 
ground that you can't hike on in thongs," said U.S. Forestry Service 
spokeswoman Randi Jorgensen. 
</P>
<P>
 Its proximity to a vast urban area can make the Angeles appear to be just 
</P>
<P>
 another version of Frontierland or a scenic neighborhood park, rangers say. As 
a result, it draws many inexperienced hikers or people who don't take its wild 
and rugged nature seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 In comparison with other disasters and near disasters in the forest, Perez's 
story is not all that unusual. Many people who go into the forest for an 
afternoon or once-in-awhile weekend outings don't know what they're getting 
into, forest officials and county rescuers say. 
</P>
<P>
 A typical scenario goes something like this: A person or group decides to get 
away and goes into the mountains for a day of hiking, biking or skiing. At 
first, there are plenty of other people around and there doesn't seem to be 
much chance of getting lost or hurt. But as time passes, they move farther into 
the wilderness and farther from other hikers. The sun and the temperature start 
going down. The terrain becomes a little less familiar, a little more 
dangerous. By this time it begins to sink in that they're lost. And they can't 
find the right trail to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case with three Southern California Edison Co. contract workers 
from Burbank who in May, 1993, entered the forest at Big Tujunga Canyon to 
clear brush away from power lines near Suicide Canyon, known for its scenic 
waterfalls and steep cliffs. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they were finished working, the sun had set and the three men 
found themselves standing on a cliff, clueless as to how to backtrack out of 
the wilderness. They were all wearing short-sleeved shirts and jeans, 
inadequate clothing for a night or longer in the mountains. They had no food or 
water with them. Luckily, a sheriff's helicopter spotted them the next day.

 A similar rescue occurred just this week. Justin Van Hecke, 20, of Diamond Bar 
didn't know much about hiking in the wilderness when he and two friends from 
Wrightwood set out Sunday morning for an overnight camping trip to Pine 
Mountain, just south of the vast San Gabriel Wilderness. When Van Hecke 
separated from his companions in thick, 12-foot-high brush, he became 
hopelessly lost. His friends had given up the search and spent the rest of that 
day walking out of the woods to the nearest ranger station for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hecke might not have known much about camping, but he did know enough to 
stay put, said Sheriff's Deputy David Smail. In a few hours, Van Hecke was 
spotted from the air and lifted to safety by a sheriff's rescue helicopter. He 
was treated for scratches and abrasions at Foothill Presbyterian Hospital and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just stayed there," Smail said. "That's what kept him alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all unprepared hikers are so lucky. In late 1992, Jeremy Sullivan, a 
senior varsity football player at Katella High School in Anaheim, was hiking 
with four friends near the East Fork Ranger's Station, just north of Glendora 
Ridge, near La Verne. His father says Sullivan, 18, was an inexperienced 
camper. While walking along a trail, the teen-ager slipped, dropped 40 feet off 
a mountain trail and died. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibly the most famous cliffhanger in the forest in the past two years 
involved 23-year-old Christopher Simon, nephew of movie director Steve 
Spielberg through his wife, actress Kate Capshaw. In this case, Spielberg 
personally made sure the story had a happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 In early July, 1992, Simon was on an outing at Strawberry Peak near Mt. 
Wilson. When Simon didn't return home, his roommate called the Sheriff's 
Department. After county rescuers were unable to find Simon, Spielberg hired 
two jet helicopters, at a cost of about $2,700, and Simon was found later that 
day, standing on a cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people look at the forest as an extension of their own locality (in 
the city or in the suburbs). It's a lot greener. A lot cleaner. And I don't 
think people really give it a lot of thought as to what the true environment 
is," said Capt. Alex Kirkaldy, head of the sheriff's 24-member Search and 
Rescue Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkaldy's squad averages about 90 calls a month, from stranded and lost 
hikers to cars that have gone over the side of roadways, Kirkaldy said. The 
number of incidents in those three categories breaks down about evenly into 
thirds, with most rescues performed from ground level. Air 5, the sheriff's 
medically equipped helicopter, has assisted about 40% of all calls for help 
this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most rescues occur when the weather is nice, rangers said. In the winter, 
however, when the forest is especially beautiful -- and treacherous -- rescue 
efforts present unique challenges. Snowfall in the forest's 8,000- and 
9,000-foot elevations offers some of the best back-country skiing in Southern 
California. But the price of skiing unchartered slopes can be high, as four 
experts found out last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had driven to Waterman Mountain, just east of the Arroyo Seco and Mt. 
Baldy Ranger District Line, and thought they were headed for the fresh powder 
left by an avalanche on the west side of the mountain. Instead, after skiing 
about 3,000 feet downhill, they realized they had gone the wrong way and were 
headed south, straight for the bottom of Devil's Canyon, Kirkaldy said. It took 
a full day for the rescue helicopter to pull the men to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all very capable skiers. They just got on the wrong side of 
Waterman," Kirkaldy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the most experienced outdoors person can run into serious trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Dahl of La Canada Flintridge was considered an expert in his field of 
mountain biking. A mechanical failure on the bike is blamed for causing the 
fall that led to Dahl's death.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a variety of ways people get in trouble," said Pasadena 
environmentalist Tim Brick, director of the Arroyo Seco Council and an avid 
mountain bike rider and camper in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "One way is not being prepared to go up there for a day. People get stuck and 
end up staying there overnight," Brick said. "They have signs posted all over 
the place. But people from the city come up here not aware that it's a wild 
area, and they end up getting lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Brick knew Dahl and also was aware of Dahl's bike riding abilities. Brick also 
knows that, as he says, "it's real easy to fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Brick was riding near Switzer Falls, just north of Altadena. His 
front tire went out and Brick went headfirst down a 12-foot slope. The bike was 
inoperable. Brick, 44, suffered cuts and bruises and ended up walking nine 
miles to a hospital in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Reece Vogel, 40, of Pasadena, estimates he has logged about 20,000 miles 
riding his mountain bike in the San Gabriel Mountains over the past 11 years. 
"People do underestimate how rugged the San Gabriel Mountains are," he said. 
But Vogel doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said he's had no serious mishaps, primarily because he is 
safety-conscious and always prepared. Vogel doesn't hit the road without 
wearing a helmet and packing food, water, spare bike parts and tools. He 
warned: Make sure everything works and tell someone where you're going. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the forest being possibly too wild for greenhorns from Los Angeles, 
it's all a matter of common sense and being ready for the unexpected. "I've had 
worse luck driving a car in the city," Vogel said. STAYING SAFE 
</P>
<P>
 Here are forest rangers' top 10 tips for safety when visiting Angeles National 
Forest:  
</P>
<P>
 1. Don't feed the animals. The animals are wild and may bite if disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Wear appropriate shoes and watch where you put your feet. Rattlesnakes are 
year-round residents of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Don't hike in steep, undeveloped areas. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Know where you're going, stick to established routes and don't take 
shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Don't dive into streams or rivers. They're often shallower and rockier than 
you think. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Carry drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Tell someone where you're going and what time to expect you back. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Check weather forecasts and be prepared. Also carry a flashlight, blanket, 
tire chains (after October) and a jacket in your car. 
</P>
<P>
 9. In the wintertime, avalanches are a real danger. So is ice on the trails. 
Watch your step. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Get a fire permit if you want to start a campfire. TRAGEDY IN THE ANGELES 
</P>
<P>
 In the first eight months of this year, six people suffered fatal accidents in 
the Angeles National Forest:  
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 15: A swimmer drowns in Jackson Lake, near Big Pines Highway west of 
Wrightwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 11: A hiker is killed at San Antonio Falls, just above Mt. Baldy Village 
on Mt. Baldy Road. 
</P>
<P>
 June 30: A diver drowns while swimming in San Gabriel Canyon, just north of 
Azusa. 
</P>
<P>
 July 2: El Monte's Rick Perez, a star baseball player with the Upper Iowa 
University baseball team, falls from a mountain trail and later dies at a 
Pasadena hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 July 31: A motorcyclist crashes and dies in a late-morning accident on Angeles 
Crest Highway near the Arroyo Seco Ranger Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 14: Another motorcyclists dies, this time on Bouquet Canyon Road, north 
of Santa Clarita.

SURPRISE SOME PEOPLE. SHE IS RESEARCHING WAYS IN WHICH INFORMATION IS PROCESSED 
AND STORED IN THE BRAIN.

 The ticket agent at Los Angeles International Airport looked skeptically at 
Erin Margaret Schuman. Schuman's tickets had her title as Dr. and standing 
before the agent was a woman much younger than the average college professor.  
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old assistant professor at Caltech is used to that look, used to 
people thinking that someone so young, especially if that someone is a woman, 
couldn't possibly hold a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one ever believes I'm a professor," said Schuman, who teaches biology and 
was on her way to a neurobiology conference in Israel. "They'll see the word 
doctor, look at me and think it's a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 But all Schuman has to do is turn to her microscope and describe how the 
transference of nitric oxide between neurons in a rat's brain affects memory to 
persuade nonbelievers that she is, indeed, Dr. Schuman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman received her Ph.D in neuroscience from Princeton University in 1990 
and joined Caltech last year as the biology department's youngest faculty 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with teaching introductory neurobiology this fall, Schuman is 
researching a number of ways in which information is processed and stored in 
the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of eight assistants and five grants, ranging from $30,000 to 
$350,000, Schuman will continue to explore the human body's most mysterious 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
 By studying live tissue from the hippocampus region of the brain, where memory 
activity takes place, Schuman is trying to learn more about illnesses such as 
Alzheimer's disease and Attention Deficit Disorder, which hinder a person's 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Schuman is tracking how far nitric oxide can travel between 
neurons before it is metabolized by other chemicals and what effect that 
relationship -- between the gas and surrounding neurons -- has on long-term 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-proclaimed perfectionist, Schuman is intent on understanding the 
elusive nature of memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being an artist; I'm consumed by my work. I think and dream about 
my experiments all the time," she said. "My mood is completely determined by 
what happened in the lab that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman did not explore her interest in biology until graduate school but was 
always an intense student. She used to get migraine headaches from the 
self-imposed pressure to achieve perfect grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman's mother, Susan, who lives in Fullerton, called her daughter "a 
compulsive learner. I was concerned about her, because anything less than an A 
devastated her. I just wanted her to relax," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuman's office windowsill is lined with papers about such topics as 
farnesyltransferase inhibitors, while a pink and black Mickey Mouse hat sits 
conspicuously on the shelves behind her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a young, successful scientist has had its disadvantages, Schuman says. 
"I didn't get to do the Europe thing," she said about the common post-college 
adventure. At this point, she said, she often feels lucky just to get a weekend 
away from the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 "But someday, when people ask me why they always lose their car keys, I'll 
have an answer for them," she said. "That will feel good."

SCOTT HARRIS: SOMEBODY MUST KNOW JANE DOE NO. 35, A TEEN-AGE GIRL WHOSE BODY 
WAS FOUND JULY 12 IN AN INCH OF WATER ON THE CONCRETE BED OF THE LOS ANGELES 
RIVER.; JANE AND JOHN DOE IN LIMBO AT MORGUE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The case report describes the victim as a male Caucasian. His age is noted as 
35+. Height is 73 inches. Weight is 182 pounds. Brown hair, brown eyes. A 
mustache. The form asks the investigator to choose among four types of death: 
NAT, ACC, SUI and HOMI. There's a circle around SUI. 
</P>
<P>
 There was never a doubt. Witnesses first spotted him on Sept. 4 at the 
intersection of 3rd Street East and Lightcap Street in Lancaster. He had 
climbed a utility pole and was grabbing a wire, "apparently trying to 
electrocute himself." People heard him declare, "The world made me do this!" 
Authorities managed to coax him to step on a firetruck ladder, but then the man 
dove headfirst to the pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no identification. A check of prints turned up nothing. There have 
been no calls from worried relatives and friends. So more than a month later, 
coroner's investigators are still trying to find the true name of John Doe No. 
154. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's got to know this guy," Nick Romero says, displaying the file. 
"Somebody's got to miss him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sentiment that echoes throughout the county morgue, where an unusual 
number of John and Jane Does now exist in kind of earthly limbo. In normal 
times, Nick Romero and partner Gilda Molano might actively work 10 cases, with 
dozens more from past years filed away awaiting a break. Last week, as the 
unsolved caseload for 1994 grew to 30, their phones seemed strangely quiet. Not 
all of their Does were old, rootless drifters. Several were young -- in their 
teens, 20s and 30s. Where were their families and friends? 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody must know John Doe No. 154. And somebody must know Jane Doe No. 41, a 
homicide victim whose half-burned body was found Aug. 7 in Sun Valley near La 
Tuna Canyon Road. And somebody must know Jane Doe No. 35, a teen-age girl whose 
body was found July 12 in an inch of water on the concrete bed of the Los 
Angeles River, below the 6th Street bridge. Investigators don't know whether 
she jumped or fell or was pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators show a snapshot of the girl, her eyelids slightly open as if 
nodding off to sleep. She's described as Latino, 4-foot-11 and weighing 105 
pounds with medium-length brown hair. The condition of her corpse is described 
as "good." 
</P>
<P>
 On a windowsill above Molano's desk rests a school photo of a teen-age girl, 
smiling prettily. "My niece is 16," Molano says. Jane Doe No. 35 looks to be 
about the same age. "If she were mine, I'd be looking for her. She could be a 
continuous runaway, but still. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the dead are easily identified. There's ID in a pocket and the next 
of kin is easy to find. Otherwise, coroner's investigators rely on a network of 
fingerprint files at the LAPD, the Sheriff's Department, the Department of 
Justice and the Veterans Administration. If the initial checks turn up nothing, 
the case goes to Romero and Molano, who usually manage to solve the mystery 
within a few days or weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 We pay them to give the dead a measure of dignity and to give survivors some 
answers. We also pay them to assist in the cause of justice. Homicide 
detectives assigned to Jane Doe No. 41 won't know where to start unless Romero 
and Molano can figure out the identity of this young woman. The case report 
describes her as 5-foot-4, 133 pounds, with brown eyes and medium-length black 
hair beneath a wig. She was wearing "a yellow metal chain with a charm of Jesus 
Christ around her neck."  
</P>
<P>
 The Does are typically kept about one month before they are turned over to the 
county hospital for cremation. Some exceptions are made. Nearly three months 
after she was found in the L.A. River, Jane Doe No. 35 remains stored in Crypt 
40, because the investigators figure somebody will step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration over the Does prompted Scott Carrier, the coroner's public 
information officer, to issue a press release seeking the public's assistance. 
The phone has been ringing ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get calls here: 'I haven't seen my mother in seven years,' " Romero says. 
"I mean, it's been seven years and now you're checking?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The press release paid off. Romero was able to tell one woman that her brother 
had died in 1992. Molano was able to help a man whose mother had been missing 
for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounded as if the young man might be asking about Jane Doe No. 60, a 
68-year-old woman who had been killed in a traffic accident on Sept. 27. 
Sometimes, Molano says, people have a hard time accepting the sad truth. 
</P>
<P>
 This man dropped by the coroner's office twice. The first day, he looked at a 
snapshot and wasn't sure. The second day, Molano was able to show him the 
personal effects found with Jane Doe No. 60. The clothes were certainly 
familiar. And there was no mistaking her key ring, with its little frame 
holding the photo of a grandchild. 
</P>

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; VOLUNTEERS IN RUNNING FOR 
TOP AWARD

 For the 36th year, the Fernando Award, a statuette of a young Native American, 
will be awarded next month for outstanding community service to the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, five finalists are vying for the award, which has been described as 
the highest honor a Valley resident can earn for volunteerism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say that people usually go through this routine three times," said Clyde 
R. Porter, a Woodland Hills businessman who this year was nominated for the 
award for the third time. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley chambers of commerce and past winners of the award nominate and vote 
for the winner. The nominees and those who know them say they do not do the 
work for any award, but for personal satisfaction, love of community and a 
honest desire to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the things he has done, so much would not have happened here in 
Woodland Hills and the West Valley area," Sheri Polak, past president of the 
Woodland Hills Rotary Club, said of Porter. "He's very, very humble, and if you 
thank him for something it's almost an embarrassment to him."  
</P>
<P>
 Porter is president of the P.L. Porter Co. -- started by his father in 1947 -- 
a company that builds reclining seats for airlines and automobile 
manufacturers. He has worked with the Woodland Hills Rotary Club, helped 
complete the Lou Bredlow Pavilion at Warner Park and has been a supporter of 
Valley Cultural Center, Pierce College and other West Valley groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter, 68, has also helped renovate the facilities for Haven Hills, a shelter 
for victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Polak said that although he helps financially with a lot of projects, Porter 
is also quick to lend a hand, such as setting up trailers that he donated for 
an event at a community concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really get a high in doing these things for other people," Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth C. Banks Jr., 57, of North Hollywood, was nominated by the Universal 
City/North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce because of his work, which in recent 
years has focused on helping the community's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the first to volunteer and the last to leave," said Paul Jacobs, chamber 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "You play as hard as you work and work as hard as you play," said Banks, who 
in addition to the chamber, does volunteer work with the North Hollywood Rotary 
Club and the East Valley Family YMCA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken is one of these people who has an innate desire to help the community," 
said chamber executive director Jim Mahfet, who was hired when Banks was 
president in 1992. "He's always had this passion. He's very tenacious." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks, originally from North Dakota, moved here with his family in 1946. He 
said that his father instilled in him a strong sense of values and an arsenal 
of sayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't take someone on unless you can finish it," Banks said, quoting his 
father.  
</P>
<P>
 Mahfet said that some of the older members of the community look at Banks now 
and see the spitting image of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I am, that's a compliment," said Banks, who said he is most proud of his 
work with the Studio City and Universal City/North Hollywood chambers of 
commerce, and with the Medical Center of North Hollywood in doubling the size 
of a scholarship awarded to local youths to attend trade schools in the medical 
profession. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very significant because that kind of thing could make a difference 
for a lot longer than I will be around," Banks said. 
</P>

ELECTION ORDERED TO RESOLVE LONG BEACH COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ordered a special election in Long Beach to resolve 
a seesaw City Council race in which the apparent loser emerged with a two-vote 
victory in June after several uncounted ballots were discovered during a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donelon, a contractor who was declared the winner, will step down, 
leaving the seat vacant until the special election determines whether he or 
community activist Tonia Reyes Uranga should represent the city's 7th Council 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will decide Tuesday on the election date, which by law must 
be in late January or early February, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time that an election has been voided in the city, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly a victory, not just for me but for the voters," said 
Uranga, who filed the lawsuit challenging the outcome. "This was a fight for 
truth in the election process." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, Long Beach officials acknowledged that the city 
clerk's office made errors on election night, including mistakenly allowing 
some improper votes to be tallied, said Assistant City Atty. Robert E. Shannon. 
Therefore, he said, the city will pay the candidates' legal fees as well as the 
expense of a special election, expected to be about $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we're being forced to have a new election is ludicrous," 
Donelon said. "The election process, both on the state and local levels, is so 
flawed that it's easy for improper votes to be counted. I feel I won the 
election, but illegal votes were cast by unknowing people." 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, former president of the Long Beach Children's Museum, had seemed the 
victor by a 29-vote margin on election night. But her lead was wiped out during 
a June 22 recount, when previously uncounted ballots were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga challenged Donelon's narrow victory in court, contending among other 
things that ballots were improperly tallied and improper votes accepted. The 
case went to trial last week, but Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin halted 
proceedings Thursday to allow attorneys and the city to try to work out an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Chirlin accepted the agreement to schedule a special election. 
The Long Beach City Council had voted unanimously in closed session Friday to 
support the new election. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The agreement) saved a lot of aggravation on the part of truly third 
parties, who had no personal stake in this, other than fany resident of the 7th 
District has in the accuracy of the (elections)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach City Council had voted unanimously in closed session Friday to 
support the new election.

NHL TALKS SOUR AS PLAYERS REJECT PROPOSALS; HOCKEY: BOTH SIDES REFUSE TO BUDGE, 
PUTTING SEASON IN JEOPARDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pessimism about saving the full NHL season set in among negotiators Wednesday 
after the players' association, fighting the imposition of a payroll levy to 
subsidize weak clubs, rejected two contract proposals from the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to be able to reach an agreement," said John 
McMullen, owner of the New Jersey Devils and a participant in the last two 
bargaining sessions. "It's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks: "This is a joke. I cannot 
believe there is absolutely no movement on the part of the NHLPA. They're 
clearly sending a message they have no intention of making a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman last week delayed the start of the season for 
two weeks, until Oct. 15, to continue intensive talks. He said if no collective 
bargaining agreement had been drafted by then -- or no substantial progress had 
been made -- he would be forced to cancel games. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL had reduced the rate of the levy from a maximum of 200% and changed it 
to a gradual increase before revising it again to a maximum of 125% on Tuesday. 
Those moves led McMullen to say Tuesday he believed a compromise was possible 
and a complete season could be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's events, however, killed that optimism and touched off accusations 
from each side. 
</P>
<P>
 Because players consider the concept of a levy unacceptable, they were not 
swayed by the NHL's two last modifications in the levy formula. They object on 
the grounds that clubs would keep players' salaries low to avoid exceeding the 
limit and paying penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "At what point does a tax become a salary cap?" said Mike Gartner, president 
of the NHLPA. "Until we come up with a solution to our philosophical 
differences, we'll be negotiating for a long time, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Howard Baldwin, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins: "The lines are 
hardening. I'm very disappointed, very frustrated. I'm not optimistic at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHLPA, said he will devise a 
counterproposal "over the next day or so" and contact the league to arrange 
additional talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow and his negotiating team have proposed a flat tax of 5.5% on the 
payrolls and gate receipts of the 16 top-revenue clubs. The proceeds would be 
distributed to the 10 small-market clubs. The NHL contends that would not help 
needy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's frustration also sparked criticism of Goodenow from management 
representatives. Previously, most of the angry words have come from players 
decrying Bettman's lack of hockey knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never capitulate because of the tactics he (Goodenow) is using on the 
league," said Harry Sinden, president and general manager of the Boston Bruins. 
"All my fears are realized. I had hoped we would be able to work out a deal. He 
has no intention of doing anything to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares suggested Goodenow had not fully informed players about the issues. 
Although Goodenow has said the NHL never gave him complete financial data, 
Tavares said that information had been made available to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's shocking to me is the perception by the NHLPA that the league is 
inflexible and the league is not trying to make a deal," Tavares said. "I don't 
think anyone is working harder to make a deal than Gary Bettman. I think the 
players are basically disinterested. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . My understanding is we have moved several times and the union is 
standing back at 20 paces and not moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck forward Stu Grimson disputed Tavares' characterization of the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think to this point, the players have been extremely flexible in terms of 
coming around to the position of assuming some of the responsibility for the 
problems (of the small-market clubs)," he said. "Is it the employee's 
responsibility to fix any other industry?"

MUIR MAKES COACHING CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena Muir High, annually one of the Southland's top schools for football 
talent, made an abrupt coaching change on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Allen, in his second year as head coach, was relieved of his duties and 
replaced by former assistant Mike Harrison. Harrison, a history teacher at the 
school, will serve on an interim basis and the job will be opened up at the end 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, rated high in several preseason polls, is struggling at 2-2. It is 
coming off a 39-12 loss to Los Alamitos last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our record had nothing to do with why I let Jack go," said Gary Talbert, 
Muir's principal. "Contrary to popular belief, coaches here are not under 
tremendous pressure to win. After a series of meetings with Jack, I just 
decided I was not happy with the direction of the program and that a change was 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbert said he met with between 15 and 20 varsity players on Monday, who 
expressed varying concerns about the team. Many of those players suggested Jim 
Brownfield, who coached the school to a pair of Southern Section championships 
in the 1980s, be brought back. Brownfield coaches girls' track at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't contacted about coming back," Brownfield said. "I told Jack earlier 
in the season that if things got ugly and he needed some help, I would do what 
I could, but that's as far as it went." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was 8-3 last season, but Muir was eliminated in the first round of the 
Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is an unlikely choice. He has never been a high school head football 
coach before and has limited experience as an assistant. He coached the 
baseball team at Muir in 1992 and '93 but was reprimanded several times for 
arguing with umpires. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is Muir's eighth coach since 1987.

RESIDENTS PROTEST LAPD'S TRANSFER OF 15 HARBOR DIVISION OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The transfer of up to 15 officers from the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Harbor Division will be a blow to safety and rapport in the Wilmington 
community, residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Five officers who have worked in the harbor area for several years began work 
in new districts Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others were transferred from the division in August. Capt. Betty Kelepecz, 
the division's patrol commanding officer, said a third group will be 
transferred this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelepecz said all the officers are being replaced with police from other 
divisions of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raymond E. Carlson, a Wilmington resident for 36 years, is one of many 
residents who worry that the new officers will not have the same experience and 
community understanding as the ones that the Harbor Division is losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (officers) live here, work here and do their business here," the group of 
residents protested in a letter to Police Chief Willie L. Williams. "They know 
the people and the problems of the community on a personal level. This is what 
community-based policing should be all about." 
</P>
<P>
 In another letter sent to Williams, Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who 
represents the harbor area, said the transfers are causing a severe drop in 
morale at the division. The issue also "is beginning to have a destabilizing 
effect on the communities the division serves," Svorinich wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Both letters ask that the transfers be reconsidered.  
</P>
<P>
 The transfers are administrative orders based on interviews and evaluations of 
officers who have been at the division for five years or more. It is the first 
major administrative transfer at the division in about seven years, Cmdr. David 
J. Gascon said.  
</P>
<P>
 Officer Bob Smith, 53, was transferred Sunday to the Southeast Division in 
Watts after working in the harbor district for 13 years. He said none of the 
harbor officers facing transfers want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "People (in the community) see them and they know them," Smith said. "There's 
a trust there. When you start bringing new people in, the trust has to be 
developed all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said he will appeal the reason for his transfer -- that his productivity 
has declined and that he and his work will improve at a new division. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that is the case, I should have been transferred years ago," he said. "Why 
transfer me now when I'm old?" 
</P>
<P>
 However, Kelepecz, who recommended the transfers after being at the Harbor 
Division for nearly a year, said the movement of officers throughout the LAPD 
is healthy and necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the division's 165 officers, she has interviewed 26 in the last four 
months who are eligible for transfers.  
</P>
<P>
 Kelepecz said the need to move officers throughout the department to new 
divisions has been emphasized throughout the LAPD Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officers at the Harbor Division should have been transferred years ago, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And not all the officers are being replaced with rookies. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD would not release details about the replacement officers, but 
Kelepecz said one is a sergeant who lives in San Pedro and has more than 20 
years of experience in the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that their (community) has become very attached, and that is good. . 
. . It means they care about their officers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the new officers will be effective, if not more effective. They move here 
with new ideas and new eyes."

ELECTIONS; HOUSE CANDIDATES CLASH ON USE OF CLINTON PHOTO; AT FORUM, HARMAN 
SAYS FLYER SHOWING HER WITH PRESIDENT IS A DISTORTION, BUT BROOKS DEFENDS IT. 
OPPONENTS IN STATE SENATE, ASSEMBLY RACES ALSO FACE OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Yes, they argued the issues, but in their first public matchup, Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Rolling Hills) and Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks 
exchanged some of their fiercest words over a photograph.  
</P>
<P>
 The picture -- of Harman and President Clinton during a White House ceremony 
-- has been used in Brooks' campaign literature with the caption: "Jane Harman 
beams with approval while Bill Clinton signs the largest tax increase in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Harman voted for the Clinton budget, she says the caption is a 
distortion. "I wasn't there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The August, 1993, photo was taken at another White House event where Clinton 
issued an executive order on deficit reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with Bill Clinton . . . when he signed the Deficit Reduction Trust 
Fund. And yet here we are today, with the Brooks campaign handing out the same 
misleading captions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign has refused to stop distributing the flyer, saying that it 
underscores Harman's support of Clinton's overall economic program, even as 
Harman tries to characterize herself as independent from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an identical twin representative," Brooks said at the debate. "She is 
one person in this district, and she goes back to Washington and votes a 
different way." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo flap was the latest confrontation between the two candidates vying 
for the Congressional seat in the 36th District, which is split almost evenly 
between Democrats and Republicans in voter registration. Sunday's event also 
included Libertarian candidate Jack Tyler and American Independent Joseph 
Fields. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of more than 500 at the James Armstrong Theater in Torrance also 
heard candidates in the 28th State Senate District and the 53rd Assembly 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The debate format, however, afforded little opportunity for candidates to 
engage in one-on-one exchanges. Candidates made opening and closing statements, 
and a moderator selected questions that were submitted from the audience, with 
each candidate given an allotted time to answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, in fact, refused to call the event a debate, given its structured 
format, and challenged her opponent to more meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did counter Harman's attacks, accusing her campaign of "character 
assassination." She referred to a Harman spokesman who called Brooks a 
"pathological liar" in a newspaper article about the White House photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks tried to align her opponent with Washington's Democratic leadership. 
She accused Harman of voting for defense budgets that have created a "meltdown" 
in national security. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only compromised jobs in our district, but it's compromised our 
national security as well," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, however, said that she has fought for full funding of military 
aircraft projects in the district, as well as defense conversion programs. And 
she pointed to her support of a line-item veto, a balanced-budget amendment and 
further efforts to reduce the deficit -- all measures Clinton has opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each issue, I have stood for what I thought was right, and I have not been 
afraid to take on the Clinton Administration," she told the audience. ". . . 
I've been on your side." 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates took tough stands on the immigration issue. Brooks supports 
Proposition 187, which would deny state services to undocumented immigrants. 
Harman called for adding 6,000 Border Patrol agents, stepping up workplace 
enforcement and for limiting benefits. She said after the debate that she has 
not decided whether to support the state initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Fields went even further: He called on the military to patrol the borders: "If 
you want to control immigration, that's how you do it, pure and simple. We need 
to take back our sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler, however, argued that the real issue should be government regulations 
that stem job growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get rid of red tape, there won't be any problem with (immigrants) 
taking jobs at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues, the candidates tried to define their differences. Both are 
supporters of abortion rights. But Harman tried to puncture her opponent's 
position, charging that Brooks does not support Roe vs. Wade, the landmark 
Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said Brooks opposes federal funding of abortions, leaving decisions in 
the hands of states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many states, as you know, oppose the right to choose for women," Harman said. 
She campaigned heavily on an abortion rights platform two years ago, when she 
beat Republican Joan Milke Flores, who opposed abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, however, charged that Harman has "misrepresented my position." She 
said that she supports abortion rights but argues that funding of abortions 
should be at the state and local levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Jane Harman wants to do is ensure that every woman, whether she can pay 
for one or not, should get an abortion and have the federal government pay the 
tab," Brooks said. Fields opposes abortion, and Tyler is against funding of 
abortions at any level of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 In their debate, state Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) and challenger David 
Barrett Cohen sparred over campaign finance reform. Cohen questioned Dills' 
acceptance of contributions from special interest groups, including $20,000 
from the liquor industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at Mr. Dills' list of contributors and voting record, you don't 
need to be Oliver Stone to see that something is going on there," said Cohen, 
an attorney and educator from Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dills, 84, angrily denied that he was influenced by the campaign 
contributions, pointing out that his support comes from a broad range of 
groups, including teachers and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm all that bad, I should have gone to prison where some of those guys 
have gone and should have gone," he said. "It's easy to say, 'Look at the 
record.' He better look at the record to find out what the record is, because 
he obviously hasn't read very far." 
</P>
<P>
 Dills and Cohen were joined by Libertarian Neal Arvid Donner and Peace and 
Freedom candidate Cindy Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson said that "too many races have become money contests" and called on 
limits to what the candidates may accept and spend in a campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner said the "prize is worth the cost" to lobbyists. His solution: a 
part-time Legislature, which would not have as much influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the 53rd Assembly District matchup focused on the state bureaucracy. 
Incumbent Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) highlighted her attempts to cut 
Sacramento bureaucracy, such as her success in speeding up environmental 
permits so Smith's Food & Drug could build a shopping center at a former 
aerospace site in Redondo Beach. Her Republican challenger, Julian Sirull, said 
that the state government has to weigh the "cost and benefits" of environmental 
laws so it does not damage the business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peace and Freedom candidate Kevin Bishop argued that too much money has 
been spent to keep companies in the state. Libertarian William Gaillard said 
that up to three-fourths of the state government could be eliminated to get the 
state out of its fiscal troubles.

 ELECTION FALLOUT: Former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance filed a 
complaint against a San Pedro publisher and 36th Congressional District 
candidate Susan Brooks over a publication sent out just days before he was 
defeated by Brooks in the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 Florance claims that Brooks and Ronald R. Yates acted in "concert and 
coordination" to put out a publication called California's Republic Reporter, 
which included a front page article on Brooks, two of her campaign ads, and an 
article titled "Ron Florance: Republican Asset or Political Embarrassment?" The 
paper also endorsed Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The publication was made to look as if it came from the Republican Party, 
Florance said, when candidates had to pay to be included. Brooks, he said, 
bought a package that got her on the front page. 
</P>
<P>
 According to campaign finance records, the Brooks campaign paid the 
publication almost $4,000 in the months leading up to the Republican primary. 
Brooks defeated Florance by 1,302 votes after a bitter campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did (the publication) influence 1,000 voters? You bet," Florance said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Florance's complaint to the Federal Election Commission and the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission charges that Yates' publication, because it took 
money from Brooks and other candidates, was in fact a political committee. But 
Yates failed to register with state and federal officials or file campaign 
finance statements, as required by election laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates, however, said that he has "never worked for Susan Brooks in a paid 
capacity." Her campaign paid only for the two full-page advertisements. Other 
articles about the campaign were editorial decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Ron Florance wants to fight my First Amendment rights, let him," Yates 
said. "It's sour grapes because he's a sore loser. He found out he can't buy an 
election."  
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign manager, John Perkins, called the complaint baseless. "It's 
clearly a political ploy," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A HELPING HAND: House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) said he would work 
actively to make sure that Brooks gets on the House Armed Services and the 
Science, Space and Technology committees if she beats Rep. Jane Harman 
(D-Rolling Hills) in the Nov. 8 election.  
</P>
<P>
 Harman holds positions on those same committees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice difference . . . is that Susan actually believes in both," Gingrich 
told about 200 people at a Rolling Hills Estates fund-raiser for Brooks on 
Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich is stumping for candidates across the country, as Republicans try to 
gain a majority in the House of Representatives. If the GOP wins 40 seats, 
Gingrich hopes to be elected Speaker of the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan's chances are better than even money," Gingrich said after his speech. 
"As Jane Harman's record gets known here in California, and as Susan's record 
as local leader and a mayor gets known, the contrast will be so dramatic that 
Susan has an excellent chance of winning this race."

COMMUNITY NEWS: PENINSULA; INCIDENTS OF VANDALISM, FIRE DAMAGE LIBRARY

<P>
 Two apparent acts of vandalism have disrupted the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
library and caused thousands of dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday evening, a custodian dropping off books at the closed Peninsula 
Center Library noticed that lights that are normally left on were off, said 
Nancy Mahr, a library spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation revealed that the metal door to the electrical room had been 
pried open, the power had been shut off and a 1/2-inch bundle of cables had 
been cut. Three to four circuit breakers, which will cost $500 to $2,000 to 
replace, were stolen, Mahr said.  
</P>
<P>
 Mahr said electrical damage closed the main library Monday, and caused 
telephone and computer disruptions at the two branch libraries Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, on Sept. 28 about 3 p.m., someone apparently set fire to a paper 
towel dispenser in the restroom of the Peninsula Center Library. The blaze 
spread to a nearby plastic trash can. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs in the library at 650 Deep Valley Drive, which is being renovated, warn 
that the automatic sprinkler system has been shut down. Firefighters 
extinguished the fire, which produced a dense, black smoke and forced the 
evacuation of about 50 patrons, Mahr said. Damage was estimated at $1,000, Mahr 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department arson squad is investigating the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahr said the two incidents do not appear to be related. JEFF KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: RANCHO PALOS VERDES; PLAINTIFF TO REFILE SUIT OVER PROPERTY 
LIENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 One day after the Supreme Court declined to consider her lawsuit, Erica Stuart 
was preparing to refile her case with the high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the court announced Monday, the first day of its 1994-95 
session, that it would not hear the case filed by Stuart and 13 other Rancho 
Palos Verdes residents.They are fighting $10 million in liens placed on 
property to help pay for measures in the Abalone Cove area to stop landslides 
that destroyed or damaged nearly 50 homes.  
</P>
<P>
 Some residents sued the county in 1979, alleging that county actions 
contributed to a 1978 landslide. In a 1987 settlement of the suit, the county 
agreed to spend $10 million on anti-landslide measures, including a drainage 
system, but placed liens on neighborhood homes to help repay the bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart alleges that the liens are unfair because they have been placed on 
property owners who were not part of the 1979 suit.  
</P>
<P>
 Stuart, who has a doctorate in government from Claremont College, has 
represented the landowners in the suit. She says the court may reconsider her 
case if she presents new evidence, and cited the lack of anti-landslide 
measures implemented since she filed her case in 1991. JEFF KASS

 EL MONTE: A 41-year-old El Monte man who was allegedly trying to steal copper 
wire from an electrical transformer was hospitalized Monday after he touched a 
live wire. William Albert was severely burned in the 3:30 a.m. incident, which 
caused a brief power failure in southeast El Monte. He was taken to Greater El 
Monte Hospital for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 LA VERNE: A 35-year-old Ontario man and his 9-year-old daughter remained 
hospitalized Tuesday after their car rolled over during a two-car accident 
Sunday. Brian Sterling and daughter Nancy were airlifted to Long Beach Memorial 
Medical Center after the 2 p.m. accident at Arrow Highway and Fairplex Drive. 
Brian Sterling was listed in fair condition with broken bones in both legs, and 
Nancy was listed in serious condition with facial fractures. Sterling's car was 
traveling east on Arrow Highway when it collided with another vehicle trying to 
make a left turn in a controlled intersection. The driver of the other car, 
Thang Nguyen of Long Beach, was taken to Pomona Valley Hospital Medical Center, 
where he was treated and released. Police are investigating the cause of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Two men and a teen-age boy were arrested on suspicion of auto burglary 
Friday night after police conducted a stakeout in a parking area used as a 
shuttle location for the Los Angeles County Fair. Shawn Donald Pruitt, 19, of 
Ontario, Sixto Barrera, 20, of Chino and a 17-year-old boy from Ontario were 
arrested after police officers saw one of the suspects cut into the soft top of 
a car, reach in, open the car door and get in. Police were conducting the 
stakeout because of two reports of auto burglaries the previous evening. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIMAS: Sheriff's deputies arrested nine people on suspicion of 
manufacturing methamphetamine after a raid on a 40-acre plot of land Sept. 29. 
Deputies said they found a portable meth lab and 3,300 pounds of red phosphorus 
-- a chemical used in the making of methamphetamine -- in various trailers on 
Sycamore Canyon Road. All nine suspects, who are from various cities in the San 
Gabriel Valley, were taken to the Walnut Sheriff's station, where they were 
each held on $500,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN GABRIEL: A 24-year-old San Gabriel man who had holed up in his house 
Monday surrendered to sheriff's deputies after they fired tear gas into his 
house. Deputies were sent to the 5300 block of Burton Avenue at 6:45 a.m. to 
serve a warrant to Guiseppe Dell Acqua, 24, who was wanted on a weapons 
violation. Acqua was taken to the Temple City Sheriff's Station on suspicion of 
weapons violations. He is being held on $85,000 bail. LISA O'NEILL

ELECTIONS / COUNTY SUPERVISORS; RACE BECOMING ONE OF THE AREA'S MOST EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidates Frank Schillo and Trudi Loh have 
raised more than $150,000 to finance their campaigns, fast becoming one of the 
most expensive supervisorial races in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, a Thousand Oaks attorney who is mounting a pro-environment campaign, 
raised a total of $79,739 by Aug. 30, according to reports filed Wednesday with 
the county election's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks councilman who is running on his record of 10 years, 
raised $74,406 through the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates said they expect to raise more than $100,000 each before the 
Nov. 8 election to make their case to voters in the 2nd Supervisorial District, 
which includes most of the Conjeo Valley and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what it's going to take to get enough mail out," Loh said of her 
planned political mailers. "People can't decide if they don't have enough 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 In the county's other supervisorial race, Simi Valley City Councilwoman Judy 
Mikels and her opponent, Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery, had raised 
similar sums to finance their campaigns in the 4th Supervisorial District. The 
district includes Simi Valley and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels has raised a total of $37,000, while Montgomery has raised about 
$30,000. But Montgomery said a recent fund-raiser would add $10,000 to his 
political war chest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for county auditor-controller, appointed incumbent Thomas O. Mahon 
held a large fund-raising lead over opponent Richard Morrisset. Mahon so far 
has raised $40,250, contrasted with Morrisset's $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrisset, who owns a Camarillo accounting firm, said he plans to dip into 
his savings to finance his campaign, but declined to say how much he would 
personally contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take money to win a campaign, just effort," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor unions and real estate developers were prominent among contributors in 
all three countywide races. 
</P>
<P>
 The county employees' union gave $2,400 to Mahon, $600 to Loh and $600 to 
Montgomery. The county firefighters' union gave $250 to Loh and $1,800 to 
Montgomery. And the county deputy sheriff's association gave $600 to Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, who opposes a proposed landfill for Weldon Canyon near Ojai, so far has 
received more than $3,500 from businesses and residents of Ojai. A group of 
Ojai business owners also are planning a fund-raiser for Loh's campaign later 
this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Schillo's largest contributors were Amgen Inc., which donated $500, and 
the California Real Estate PAC, which gave $750. Schillo has also received 
contributions of about $1,200 from Pruner Health Services and company 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both Schillo and Loh have contributed more than $27,000 of their own money to 
their campaigns and pledged to dip into their pockets again if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to match whatever she does," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisorial race would rank among the most expensive if the total amount 
raised by both candidates exceeds $200,000. In 1990, Simi Valley City 
Councilman Bill Davis and then Councilwoman Vicky Howard together spent 
$212,000 in a race that Howard won. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, challenger Madge L. Schaefer spent $56,184 to unseat Supervisor Ed 
Jones, who spent $156,180. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp contrast, hefty donations have yet to play a large role in the race 
for three open seats on the Ventura County Community College District's board 
of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Appointed incumbent Karen M. Boone, who faces challengers Jim Hibbs and John 
Tallman, has raised $2,745 for her campaign through the end of August. Tallman 
leads Boone with reported contributions of $3,248 as of June 30. Tallman's 
latest report had not been filed by Wednesday's deadline. And Hibbs had not 
raised or spent $1,000, the threshold amount that requires the filing of a 
campaign finance report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate district, four candidates are seeking the seat being vacated by 
Trustee Greg Cole, who is running for the Thousand Oaks City Council in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Annette Broersman Burrows and Donald E. Stevens also said they 
would spend less than $1,000 apiece on their campaigns. Candidate Norman Nagel 
leads all others in amassed political cash, by contributing $4,000 of the 
$4,570 in his campaign fund. Candidate Donald W. Kingdon is close behind, with 
contributions of $4,555. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Pete Tafoya faces no opposition in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In local races for the state Legislature, Republican Brooks Firestone has 
raised about $413,600, while Democrat Mindy Lorenz raised more than $218,000 in 
the 35th Assembly District seat. The district includes Ventura, Ojai, Santa 
Paula and most of Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz, an art history professor, has loaned her campaign $10,000. Firestone, 
a Santa Barbara County winery owner and grandson of the Firestone Tire & Rubber 
Co. founder, has received more than $90,000 in loans and contributions from 
himself and family members. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state's 18th Senate District, Republican Steve MacElvaine raised more 
than $420,000, including a $100,000 personal loan. MacElvaine, who is running 
against Assemblyman Jack O'Connell (D-Carpinteria), also received more than 
$100,000 in contributions from the Republican Party and GOP officials. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The district includes the same areas as the 35th Assembly District, but 
stretches into San Luis Obispo County. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell, whose finance statement was not available Wednesday, reported 
raising more than $400,000 as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) reported total contributions of 
$82,777. Her Democratic challenger, Josh Arce, 19, of Chatsworth raised $12,400 
to challenge Boland in the the 38th Assembly District. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial reports were also not available for Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard). His Democratic opponent Dorothy Maron, a former Oxnard 
councilwoman, has raised more than $8,000, which includes a $6,000 personal 
loan.

ELECTIONS / COLLEGE DISTRICT; TRUSTEES REMAIN NEUTRAL ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hours of stirring testimony have failed to persuade Ventura County Community 
College District trustees to endorse or oppose Proposition 187, the 
controversial plan to deny most public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Before more than 50 people, many carrying banners and recounting their 
ancestry to trustees, the governing board early Wednesday rejected one 
resolution to oppose the measure and another to signal its support. 
</P>
<P>
 Two trustees with conflicting political ideals directed staff members to place 
the competing resolutions on the same agenda, prompting a rare panel discussion 
in which leaders on both sides of the issue were invited to address the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Gregory P. Cole and Pete E. Tafoya said the potential passage of 
Proposition 187 warrants that the district take a position on the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Issues of public policy should be debated in public," said Cole, who strongly 
supports the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials invited Ventura County taxpayer advocate H. Jere Robings 
and Proposition 187 local coordinator Stephen Frank to debate Moorpark 
Councilman Bernardo Perez and Cal State Northridge Dean Jorge Garcia on the 
merits of the would-be legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some district administrators publicly opposed the measure, as did 
representatives from all three area colleges' academic senates, which all voted 
in recent days to oppose the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College President Jesus Carreon called the measure a "simple solution 
for simple-minded people." 
</P>
<P>
 Chancellor Thomas G. Lakin simply said, "Proposition 187 to me is Jim Crow II. 
It is racially based." 
</P>
<P>
 The exchanges and public testimony made for lively discussion, Trustee Timothy 
D. Hirschberg said, but both sides failed to persuade him that the governing 
board should take a position on statewide issues over which it has no control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public wants us to be here to run the colleges, not decide immigration 
policy," said Hirschberg, who abstained from both votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Cole and Karen M. Boone voted in favor of the resolution supporting 
Proposition 187, with Tafoya and board President Allan W. Jacobs opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot support illegal conduct," Boone said. "That is why I am supporting 
Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Tafoya and Cole sparred on the merits of the initiative at length before it 
finally came to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "My constituency is right back there," Tafoya said at one point, gesturing 
toward dozens of students crowding the entryway to the meeting hall. "Where's 
yours?" 
</P>
<P>
 When the resolution opposing the initiative was voted on, it failed on a 3-1-1 
vote, with Cole, Boone and Jacobs all opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs said laws already exist to control the borders and limit the number of 
illegal immigrants who migrate to California in search of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is we're not enforcing those laws," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the panel discussion, Robings said Proposition 187 is not about 
immigration. "It's about illegal immigration," he said. "It's a matter of 
protecting our national borders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't accept illegal immigrants simply because they have an excuse to 
leave their country," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garcia, a Ventura County resident who works at Cal State Northridge, 
called the initiative "illegal, unconstitutional and immoral." He said the 
United States has a rich history of investing in its residents and pointed to 
himself as an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he picked peaches in the Central Valley during school, earned his 
doctorate virtually free due to scholarships and now pays $18,000 a year in 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was still picking peaches, you wouldn't get a dime out of me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public testimony included nearly two dozen speakers -- all of whom opposed 
the measure. Fred Pierce, a mortgage banker from Oxnard, called Proposition 187 
"legal racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure "all non-whites would have to carry a pass, just like they 
did in South Africa," he told trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherie Ruzic, an Asian American who lives in Ventura, said the initiative 
reminded her of the World War II internment of Americans of Japanese descent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you don't remember the roundups," she said. "But we can't forget."

 CHANNEL ISLANDS DISTRICT PROTESTS $170-MILLION HARBOR PLAN; DEVELOPMENT: BOARD 
FEARS PROPOSED AQUARIUM AND HOTELS WILL LEAD TO CONGESTION AND TARNISH 
'AMBIENCE' OF COMMUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Politicians from Oxnard, Port Hueneme and Ventura County envision an aquarium 
at Channel Islands Harbor as an ideal source of revenue and family 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But residents of the adjacent Silver Strand, Hollywood and 
Hollywood-by-the-Sea beaches have a different vision of the aquarium, part of a 
new development proposal for the harbor: They fear a congested tourist trap 
that will tarnish their placid communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The board of the Channel Islands Beach Community Services District, which runs 
the area's utilities and weighs in on political matters, is drafting a letter 
to the county protesting a $170-million plan for the harbor that includes the 
aquarium, condominiums and two hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 The project "would change the ambience of the harbor and the community," said 
Gerard Kapuscik, the district's general manager. Although he said some 
residents support the plan, "naturally, there are concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which would be funded primarily through leases, is expected to be 
reviewed by county supervisors in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very concerned about the impact of 1 million people coming into 
the area," said Marcia Marcus, one of the district's five directors. "Where are 
they going to park? How are they going to get in and out of here? . . . 
(Residents) are just concerned about protecting our way of life here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Channel Islands Harbor already attracts about 1 million visitors a year, 
officials say. That figure would double if the aquarium -- expected to cost $20 
million to $60 million -- is built and performs as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, county leaders are proposing the construction of an aquatic-theme 
hotel alongside the aquarium, to be located off Victoria Avenue at Murre Way. 
That would add to clogging in the area, detractors say. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver Strand resident Gordon W. Birr said traffic from the harbor has always 
been a nuisance to residents of the beach community. The aquarium plan, he 
said, would only make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get that much money out of the harbor," Birr said. "But we suffer 
from all the traffic and the problems surrounding it. . . . If they want to 
build an aquarium, they should put it next to the ocean, not in a man-made 
environment like the harbor."  
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Avenue is the only way to reach Silver Strand and 
Hollywood-by-the-Sea, and residents worry that the aquarium would create a 
ceaseless traffic jam for them to trudge through every day. 
</P>
<P>
 George Johnson, who has lived in Silver Strand since the 1950s, said he 
supports plans for an aquarium -- somewhere else.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think an aquarium would be nice, but maybe they should put it (further) 
into Oxnard," Johnson said. "Why they're going to ram it in here is beside me. 
It's too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in the beach district is against the aquarium, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," said Eleanor Oliver, owner of the Beachcomber bar in 
Silver Strand. "It would probably help my business." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he and other aquarium backers have considered 
the effect the facility would have on beach district residents and are aware 
that some measures to alleviate traffic may be needed.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you plop something down that is going to bring in 1 million people a year, 
it would not be approved," Lopez said. "We know that traffic mitigation is an 
important element of this plan. It's natural that the residents there would be 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the aquarium plan involves using a Navy-owned parcel across Victoria 
Avenue for parking, and county Supervisor John K. Flynn has said that some 
method of diverting traffic will be devised. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors and the Oxnard and Port Hueneme city councils chipped in 
for a $16,000 study on an aquarium at Channel Islands Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two consultants will work with a local committee to recommend the best size 
for the facility, the type of exhibits it should contain and how many people it 
would attract.

COUNTY IMPOSES MEDFLY QUARANTINE; FRUIT: AREA COVERS 86 SQUARE MILES OF 
FARMLAND AND NEIGHBORHOODS. SOME RESIDENTS WORRY IT'S A FIRST STEP TO AERIAL 
SPRAYING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An agricultural quarantine aimed at combatting Ventura County's Medfly 
infestation was imposed Wednesday over 86 square miles of farmland and 
residential neighborhoods stretching from Camarillo into Moorpark and Thousand 
Oaks -- the first such emergency action in county history. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and farm leaders, who called the quarantine crucial to 
efforts to control the devastating pest, said they had worked hard in recent 
days to keep the quarantine area as small as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pushing to have as little agriculture land affected as possible," 
David Buettner, chief deputy agriculture commissioner for the county, said of 
negotiations with federal officials, who had asked for a larger quarantine 
area. "There was a lot of give-and-take." 
</P>
<P>
 But the inclusion of residential areas outside Camarillo, where all the 
Medflies have been found so far, raised some concerns that the quarantine is 
only a first step toward possible aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion. 
</P>
<P>
 Aerial spraying, if it were ordered, would provoke a "great deal of 
opposition" in Thousand Oaks, said City Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski. "We're not 
as dependent on agriculture as the rest of the county. It's not part of our 
economy here."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor Maggie Kildee said residents in the quarantine area should stay 
calm. "They have to understand it's not a map for aerial spraying," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine will be imposed through at least three life cycles of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, which in the cool fall weather could be up to six 
months. The quarantine could be extended indefinitely until the pest is wiped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 The action covering 40,000 acres of farmland has been expected since the first 
two mated female Medflies were found in eastern Camarillo on Friday. Inspectors 
confirmed Wednesday that another 10 flies were found in a grove at St. John's 
Seminary, bringing the total count to 53 flies -- 51 wild males and two fertile 
females all found within a quarter of a mile of the original site. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine boundaries -- which lie along roads, highways and canyons -- 
were drawn by local, state and federal officials after days of mapping and 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine order came from California Agriculture Secretary Henry Voss, 
with the U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture expected to issue a federal 
quarantine with identical boundaries. Federal officials earlier had sought to 
draw the boundaries about half a mile farther from the discovery site. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine establishes a protocol for treatment with malathion and other 
means that commercial growers must follow before they can ship host fruit or 
vegetables from within the infested area. 
</P>
<P>
 Crops considered by U.S. officials or importers to be hosts to the Medfly 
include lemons, oranges, grapefruit, avocados, strawberries, peppers and 
tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an avocado crop to pick within a month, so I'll have to spray them or 
let them drop," said grower George Sorich, whose grove falls within the 
quarantine area. "But the main concern here is that we have to get rid of the 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents within the quarantine area are asked not to move any home-grown 
produce outside the area unless it has been cooked or canned. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials, who are still trying to determine the extent of the infestation, 
will not decide whether to use aerial spraying or other eradication methods 
until they know how far the infestation has spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of folks are asking us why we don't jump in now with a treatment 
program," said Doug Hendrix, a spokesman with the Cooperative Medfly Project in 
Los Angeles, which includes experts from the federal and state agriculture 
departments. "But we can make that decision much better once we have all the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly Project, which has overseen the efforts to eradicate the Medfly 
from the Los Angeles Basin and elsewhere in Southern California, will make 
recommendations for treating the infestation to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those recommendations are expected by the end of the week, a state spokeswoman 
said. It would take an order from the governor to begin aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Medfly Project team are experts," said Sean Walsh, a Wilson spokesman. 
"And we expect that we are going to take their advice." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles Basin, where aerial spraying of the pesticide malathion 
caused protests in 1989 and 1990, officials now use a combination of ground 
malathion spraying and sterile male flies to keep the infestation levels low. 
</P>
<P>
 Since March, a new eradication program calls for the release of 430 million 
sterile male Medflies a week across the entire basin.  
</P>
<P>
 The flies come from two laboratories in Hawaii, and the supply is supplemented 
by more flies from labs in Guatemala and Mexico, all areas where wild 
populations of Medflies are already established. 
</P>
<P>
 But 430 million flies per week is top capacity for those labs, Hendrix said, 
and at present, none of the sterile flies is available for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, however, that some flies from the Los Angeles project could be 
diverted to Ventura County, said Agriculture Commissioner Earl McPhail. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inspectors in Ventura County have sprayed a combination of 
malathion and bait on the ground within the half-mile core area of the Medfly 
discoveries. In addition, they have set more than 700 traps within the 
quarantine area to trap the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to possible aerial spraying varied throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In Camarillo, where the retirement community of Leisure Village lies inside 
the quarantine area, City Manager J. William Little said there is no danger 
from the pesticide "as long as people stay out from under the spray itself. We 
certainly want to cooperate to get rid of this thing as quickly as possible," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moorpark, where the quarantine area covers mostly unpopulated areas, City 
Councilman Scott Montgomery said he would welcome aerial spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Agriculture is almost a billion-dollar industry in the county, and we have to 
act aggressively to stop this threat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Atty. Mark Sellers said he thought spraying would spark 
protests in his city, but considered it unlikely that any legal challenge would 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Mayor Paul Lawrason said he dislikes the idea of spraying, but "it 
looks like that's what we're going to have to do. As much as I don't like it, I 
don't think we have a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a declaration of emergency by Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter on 
Tuesday, Ventura County agriculture officials estimated potential losses at up 
to $439 million, which represents the total value of all crops considered to be 
hosts to the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Office of Emergency Services recommended Wednesday that Wilson 
approve a California state of emergency, which would clear the way for state 
disaster assistance, Ventura County disaster officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's disaster declaration also asked Wilson to request a similar 
declaration from President Clinton, opening up federal disaster assistance 
funds as well. However, Wilson had made no decision by late Wednesday, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal disaster assistance could become important to county 
growers if Japan, the county's most lucrative market for its top crop of 
lemons, cuts off trade from the entire county, rather than just from the 
quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county loses the Japanese market, it could cause a domestic glut on 
lemons, causing prices to fall, said officials at Sunkist Growers Assn., the 
world's largest citrus cooperative, which represents 900 growers in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura county is one of the largest lemon producers in the world," said 
William Quarles, vice president of corporate relations for Sunkist. "If Japan 
should cut off the whole county, it would be a large concern. But there has 
been no such announcement from Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not consider lemons to be a host to 
Medflies, so lemons being sold domestically do not have to be treated before 
they can be shipped from within the quarantine area. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most lemons and oranges have already been picked and shipped and 
strawberries are out of season until spring, the immediate financial impacts on 
growers are expected to be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 However, farmers were bracing for long-term effects that will surely include 
increased expenses for pesticide applications and could mean lower prices on 
the market for their fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Japanese have asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track 
any fruit shipped from the county for the 30 days prior to the first Medfly 
find. 
</P>
<P>
 That request could take days or weeks as packinghouses go through records to 
determine the grove where the fruit was grown, where it was shipped and on 
which vessel, officials said.

COUNTY IMPOSES MEDFLY QUARANTINE; GROWERS BATTLE THE PEST WITH INFORMATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 If there was one thing Ventura County farmers and fruit packers wanted to 
avoid in the face of a Medfly crisis, it was the flurry of protests and legal 
battles touched off by the pest's appearance in Riverside County eight months 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing education was the best antidote to such controversy, the county's 
farming industry in February launched the Ventura County Fruitfly Action 
Cooperative Task Force, or FACT, to teach the public about the dangers of the 
crop-eating fly. 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches to service clubs, city councils and county supervisors, the group 
warned it was only a matter of time before the Medfly arrived. When that 
happened, aerial spraying of malathion would be a safe and effective option for 
killing the pest, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have tried to head off is a reaction from people not knowing what 
this all meant," said Bob Tobias, operations manager of Mission Produce in 
Oxnard and a task force member. 
</P>
<P>
 In Riverside County earlier this year, Corona city officials sued the state to 
block malathion spraying after residents expressed fears about blanket use of 
the pesticide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the elected officials just didn't know anything going in and when the 
crisis hit them, they didn't know how to react," Tobias said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To fund their campaign and hire a full-time executive director, the group 
raised $50,000 from growers, packinghouses and organizations such as the Citrus 
Research Board, the California Avocado Commission and the California Strawberry 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura is actually the role model for this," said Steve Peirce, a manager 
with Calavo Growers of California who is trying to organize similar volunteer 
groups in San Diego and Santa Barbara counties. 
</P>
<P>
 And though they hoped the day would never come, task force members were 
prepared when word came last week that the first wild Medflies had been trapped 
in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a crisis plan written only two weeks ago, Elisabeth Brokaw, the 
group's executive director, alerted local growers and began distributing 
information about potential impacts to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really seeing -- no pun intended -- the fruits of our labor," she said. 
"It's fortunate we started the group when we did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force say it is difficult to measure the impact of the 
speeches they have made and the pamphlets and videos they have distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, most of the elected leaders who represent the Camarillo area support 
aerial spraying of malathion if needed -- a tactic that has sparked controversy 
in other Southern California communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the spraying was ordered in Riverside County, helicopters were loaded 
under military guard because of concerns about sabotage attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor Maggie Kildee, who represents much of the area 
covered by the quarantine, credits the task force with curbing Medfly hysteria 
by supplying information ahead of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very good about the fact that the farmers were putting together an 
information packet to help those of us who live in cities understand," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're good stewards of the land," she said. "When they finally say this 
area may need to be sprayed, they know what they're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Deeter, a member of the Conejo Valley Organic Garden Club, said she 
opposes aerial spraying and disputed much of what the task force has said. 
Outlining the arguments of anti-spraying groups, Deeter said malathion has not 
proven to be effective and raises serious health questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "FACT is not giving the facts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brokaw, who works out of an office in Ventura donated by the county Farm 
Bureau, said she expects such objections to grow louder if spraying becomes 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the group faces a barrage of speaking requests, including one 
tonight at St. John's Seminary near Camarillo where the first two Medflies were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Brokaw said she has had little time to worry about the fact that 
her six-month contract expires at the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been totally unworried about it and now I know why," she said. "I just 
had a feeling something was going to happen."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: REFUND NO CURE-ALL FOR COLLEGES' BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Ventura County Community College District could use an 
expected $1-million health-insurance refund to make up an $800,000 deficit, but 
that would leave more than $1 million in other liabilities unfunded, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed a bill Friday that would have reimbursed money 
community colleges have lost to shrinking property tax revenues, the district 
has been unable to meet the $59.6-million budget it adopted last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chancellor Jeff Marsee recommended that trustees use reserves, cut 
operating expenses, close classes or lay off teachers to make up the shortfall 
if the board elects not to use the health-insurance refund. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying very hard to figure out where we go next," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But several trustees said they would not support using the district's cash 
reserves because it would further threaten the fiscal viability of the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Karen M. Boone said she would rather consider lowering the salaries of 
college professors. "If they're not open to negotiations, then let's talk 
layoffs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsee said the district was counting on the health-insurance refund to pay 
for more than $1 million in unfunded projects, including nearly $800,000 in 
benefit payments to teachers and a $128,245 payment on a Moorpark College 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Allan W. Jacobs said staff members should come back next month 
with a more specific list of potential cuts, and that trustees should be ready 
to act on them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see us do more than the $800,000 (in cuts), because it looks like 
we have other liabilities," Jacobs said. JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CLOUDS TO CLEAR, LEAVING SUNNY WEEKEND SKIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The storm clouds that dropped more than an inch of rain on parts of Ventura 
County this week are expected to clear today, leaving sunny skies that should 
last throughout the weekend, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daytime temperatures are predicted to stay in the 70s, with evening 
temperatures falling into the 40s and 50s. 
</P>
<P>
 The first storm of the season, which moved in early Monday and lingered 
through Wednesday morning, saturated the mountains north of Ojai with nearly 
three inches of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks received 0.67 of an inch of rain during the two-day storm, the 
government center in Ventura recorded 0.35 of an inch, and Ojai and Fillmore 
each received more than an inch of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said at least one another similar storm system should move through 
Ventura County this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are pretty much into the fall system," said Stuart Seto, a weather 
specialist with the National Weather Service in Oxnard. "We will probably see 
temperatures getting cooler and the chance of rain increasing. From now on, 
every three or four days, we will see fronts coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 An Oak View woman was killed when her car skidded off a rain-slicked road 
north of Ojai and plummeted about 300 feet down a ravine Tuesday afternoon. She 
was identified Wednesday as Vicki Ann Small, 43. 
</P>
<P>
 Small was intoxicated and not wearing a seat belt when she lost control of her 
car on a curve on California 33, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, who was married with two children, was pronounced dead at 6:13 p.m. at 
Ventura County Medical Center, where she had been taken by helicopter after 
firefighters reached her about 50 feet down an embankment beside the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm also caused about a dozen minor accidents, but no road closures or 
serious flooding, CHP officials said Wednesday. County Rainfall Here are 
rainfall figures from the Ventura County Flood Control Department for the

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE EMPLOYEES PROTEST STALLED TALKS 
</P>

<P>
 Angry over stalled contract negotiations that have left them without pay 
raises, secretaries and maintenance workers picked up placards and protested 
before the Ventura County Community College District's governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching hand-painted signs that proclaimed slogans such as "Settle Now," 
dozens of classified employees protested late Tuesday that they have been 
working without a contract for more than 15 months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm frustrated," said Candace Peyton, a secretary in the Moorpark College 
counseling office. "We're insulted that they have settled with the teachers but 
they're dragging their feet with the classified negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 The picketing followed symbolic work stoppages that occurred at all three of 
the district's colleges earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 College district officials, who have declared an impasse in the contract 
talks, said there is simply no money for raises for the 360 classified 
employees, who are members of Service Employees International Union, Local 535. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had the money, definitely I would support the raise," Trustee Karen M. 
Boone said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The district is facing an $800,000 deficit that may force officials to dip 
into district reserves, lay off teachers or other staff members, or close class 
sections and risk losing students. 
</P>
<P>
 But union members are upset that trustees approved a 1% pay hike for teachers, 
and that they have budgeted money for consultants and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're asking for 2% at a cost of $180,000," said Jim Crowley, a Moorpark 
College warehouseman. "That's birdseed." JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARIES PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County has opened up the information superhighway to all residents, 
providing computer links in library branches across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 A few taps on the computer keys will bring up information on agricultural 
exports, pro football schedules, NASA space lifts or weather conditions 
anywhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the Internet system, the library will provide access to thousands of 
databases for federal, commercial, even sports information, said Ruth Hartman, 
adult services manager for the library system. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers now are available in every library except the Saticoy branch, 
which is in temporary quarters, she said. Also, residents can tap into the 
network from home computers with the appropriate software and instructions from 
the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan uses existing computers, leaving the library to pay about $2,000 this 
year to the company providing the Internet connection. 
</P>
<P>
 The system could eventually include a "county bulletin board," providing 
information on meetings and new policies. County data processors are now 
studying ways to develop the computer information system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to determine whether the demand is there, what the needs are and 
how expensive it is going to be," said George Mathews, director of the county's 
Information Systems Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the county clerk's office is assessing whether to put the Board 
of Supervisors' weekly agenda on the computerized program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have 57 subscribers to this thing, plus the press," said County Clerk 
and Recorder Richard Dean, waving a copy of the agenda. "Is there enough demand 
to make it financially viable?" PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY: CABRILLO VILLAGE; STOREFRONT STATION TO BOOST POLICE 
PRESENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to improve community relations and ease gang-related fears, the Ventura 
Police Department plans to open a police storefront this weekend in Saticoy's 
Cabrillo Village, a community just east of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the project is to address concerns of the residents living in the 
crime-plagued area and to establish neighborhood patrol programs. 
</P>
<P>
 A 37-year-old father of four was shot to death Saturday night after leaving a 
community meeting in Cabrillo Village. Police believe the man was the innocent 
victim of a gang-related incident. In 1991, two men were killed in the same 
neighborhood after leaving a party. 
</P>
<P>
 The storefront station will open Saturday and operate until Oct. 21. It will 
be open daily from noon to 6 p.m., and will be staffed by Ventura police 
officers and volunteers from the Cabrillo Village community. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, officers will patrol the area throughout the day and into the 
late evening and early morning hours. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; 4TH-PLACE FINISHER MAY FILL SCHILLO'S 
JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hoping to save money, the Thousand Oaks City Council has recommended that the 
fourth-place finisher in the upcoming city election be appointed to the council 
should Councilman Frank Schillo vacate his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Mayor Alex Fiore said, the city would have to hold a costly special 
election if Schillo is successful in his Nov. 8 bid for a seat on the Ventura 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The non-binding decision came Tuesday night on a 3-0 vote, with Councilwoman 
Jaime Zukowski abstaining and Councilwoman Elois Zeanah absent. The vote 
followed a spirited debate over the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore, who suggested the idea, said it would save the city $105,000 -- the 
cost of a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a significant chunk of money, and I don't see why we shouldn't 
consider saving it if someone runs a close fourth," Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opposed the idea said it undermined the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spending this much money is a tough pill to swallow for everyone who pays 
taxes," council candidate David Hare said. "But sometimes democracy has its 
price." 
</P>
<P>
 Fiore conceded that the fourth-place finisher should only be selected if there 
is a large margin of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he agreed with Councilwoman Judy Lazar that if an incumbent 
finished fourth out of the field of 16, it would be seen as a vote of no 
confidence for that incumbent. Should an incumbent finish fourth, the council 
recommended that the city hold a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision has to be made by the newly seated council after the 
election is over. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY: VENTURA; LIBRARY BOARD AGREES TO TURN TO VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With no help in sight from the city, county or state, Ventura's library 
advisory board agreed Wednesday to use volunteer help for raising money needed 
to restore hours and staff at the city's four branches. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of a bill that offered an escape from the 
library's budget crunch, the panel agreed to survey city residents about 
library needs and seek donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would need an additional $250,000 a year to bring the Ventura 
libraries back to the same hours and staffing they had three or four years ago, 
advisory board member Keith Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, more than half of the public library's employees have been 
laid off, and hours of operation have been slashed from 65 hours a week to 20 
or less at each of the city's two main branches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two large libraries open every other day with the same staff 
shuttling back and forth," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
 One option for restoring services -- a proposed special assessment for 
libraries -- was eliminated when Wilson vetoed the measure. The county 
government, which operates Ventura's four libraries, provided only a minimal 
budget for the year ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Ventura City Council has expressed little interest in supplementing 
the branches. "I don't think it's likely the city is going to contribute money 
under the current system into the county framework," said Mayor Tom Buford, who 
attended the meeting. IRA E. STOLL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY: OXNARD; DUMP NOT LEAKING TOXINS, TESTS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tests of water from 15 wells around the Bailard landfill near Oxnard show that 
the dump is not leaking dangerous chemicals, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tests were required by the county as a condition for extending Bailard's 
operational permit through May, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Regional Sanitation District officials said they are encouraged 
because the tests did not detect any vinyl chloride. Presence of the chemical, 
which causes cancer at concentrations as low as two parts per billion, is "a 
good indicator that you've got a landfill problem," Solid Waste Director John 
Conaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other chemicals detected in well water may come from a variety of sources, but 
vinyl chloride almost always comes from a landfill, Conaway said. 
</P>
<P>
 Above-standard levels of vinyl chloride showed up in January at four wells on 
the Bailard landfill site, district spokeswoman Allison M. Maires said. On-site 
tests in April showed no problems from the chemical. And the most recent round 
of off-site tests is another encouraging sign, Maires said. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results showed above-standard levels of total dissolved solids in 
three wells. Authorities said the dissolved minerals are a problem linked to 
nearby ocean and farming activity and are not traceable to the landfill. IRA E.

<P>
 Operation Sparkle, an annual event sponsored by the Los Angeles Police 
Department and the city of Los Angeles, is an attempt to encourage businesses 
and community leaders to participate in cleaning up the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHILLO, LOH BACK LAKE RESTORATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County supervisorial candidates Frank Schillo and Trudi Loh have vowed 
to ensure that developer David Murdock follows through with an agreement he 
struck with the county years ago to fully restore Lake Sherwood for 
recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking before members of the Lake Sherwood Homeowners Assn. on Monday night, 
Schillo and Loh promised to put pressure on Murdock to speed up plans to 
develop a comprehensive lake management program. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock acquired the nearly dry lake and surrounding Lake Sherwood property in 
1985. In exchange for residents' support of a luxury housing development, the 
developer agreed to restore the lake and put together a long-term plan to keep 
it clean. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Murdock has hired maintenance workers to clean the lake regularly, he 
has yet to develop a full-scale restoration plan, which some estimate would 
cost more than $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdock has said in the past that such a plan is in the works, although 
residents have grown frustrated with his promises. The lake can now be used for 
boating, but not for fishing or swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 To move things along, Schillo said he would schedule regular meetings with 
Murdock to discuss the developer's progress in developing a permanent 
maintenance plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But Loh said the county needed to be more forceful with Murdock by demanding 
that he stick to his original agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to send a very clear signal to Mr. Murdock that the quality of the 
lake and the lake management plan was part and parcel of the agreement in which 
he got the right to develop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, a Thousand Oaks City Council member, and Loh, a local attorney, are 
competing for the 2nd Supervisorial District seat that represents Thousand 
Oaks, Oak Park and Port Hueneme. CARLOS V. LOZANO

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS, SIMI VALLEY COUNCILS; CANDIDATES REPORT ON FINANCES; 
AUTO MALL GIVES 1 CONTENDER $12,750 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City council and school board candidates in Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley 
filed campaign finance statements Wednesday, including one by a young dark 
horse who disclosed a huge contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael V. Friedman, 27, reported receiving $12,750 from the Thousand Oaks 
Auto Mall Assn., plus $250 from Nesen Motor Car Co. in his bid for one of three 
Thousand Oaks council seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel that certain City Council members have supported business 
growth in the community," said Gary Nesen, co-owner of the dealership and 
association vice president. "So we are supporting the candidates that share 
similar business views and that understand the priority of having stable 
businesses in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Mall donation was the largest in any council race in recent memory, 
and eclipsed the amount most council candidates spend in an entire campaign, 
county elections chief Bruce Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Thousand Oaks . . . They take their city elections so seriously," 
Bradley said. "In Moorpark, only three people filed for three offices. No one 
filed against the mayors in Oxnard and Simi Valley. Yet Thousand Oaks has, 
what? Sixteen candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Auto Mall also gave $2,000 to retired businessman Marshall Dixon, 69, who 
received a total of $6,518 by the end of the reporting period that ended Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 The $12,750 gift was a shock and a surprise, said Friedman, co-owner of a 
finance company. In all, he received about $13,800 in donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said the association has asked for nothing in return, nor will he be 
beholden to it. "I'm not anybody's boy. I'm very independent in what I think 
and say." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar raised more than any other Thousand Oaks candidate, 
$15,074. That includes $1,000 from Amgen and a $3,000 loan she made to herself. 
Councilwoman Elois Zeanah raised $7,667, including a $2,500 loan from her 
husband, James Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former Planning Commissioner Andy Fox, a 36-year-old Los Angeles fire captain, 
raised $14,558. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of hundred-dollar and smaller contributions," Fox said. He 
received $500 and an endorsement from the county firefighters' union. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first run for City Council, community college trustee Gregory Cole 
raised $4,393 and lent himself $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide Detective Michael Markey raised $4,466, including $1,000 from the 
California Organization of Police and Sheriffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, Councilwoman Sandi Webb led fund-raising by seven candidates 
vying for two council seats. She raised $8,500 in the last three-month filing 
period and has about $15,000 for the entire campaign, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the campaign statement filed by Webb's treasurer declares 
contributions of $46,835. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is definitely an error," Webb said. "Fifteen thousand is the actual 
number." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb's single largest contribution was $1,000 from the city police union, 
which endorsed her last month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions from developers and property managers also made up a significant 
chunk of Webb's contributions. Great Northern Marketing and Management of Reno 
gave her $1,000 and HapiManagement of Beverly Hills has donated $625. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb also received $275 from Lloyd Maitland, an attorney who arranged the 
controversial $3.5-million city purchase of 32 acres zoned for a regional mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller reported $8,300 in the last period and 
a total of about $11,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Miller's largest contributors are Friends of District Attorney Mike 
Bradbury, which gave $250, and Boys and Girls Club President Timothy Shannon, 
who donated $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chamber of Commerce President Michael S. McCaffrey has raised $5,900, 
including $1,000 from Spectrum Land Planning, a Simi Valley architectural 
design company. He has received $500 worth of wood for campaign signs from 
Councilwoman Barbara Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, political unknown Douglas K. Dubin has not 
raised a penny, and has spent just $30 of his own money. Instead of 
fund-raising, he is asking his supporters to make contributions in his name to 
their favorite charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should you spend thousands of dollars on a campaign for a job that only 
pays $7,000 or $8,000 a year?" Dubin asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other candidates, Planning Commissioner Dean F. Kunicki reported 
$4,789.39 in contributions, Joseph R. Vesalga reported $1,140. The city had not 
received a statement from Ernest W. Federer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton, who is running unopposed, received $3,300. 
</P>
<P>
 Development consultant Robert H. Levonian gave generously. He works for Mt. 
Sinai Cemetery on a cemetery-and-housing sudivison project recently approved by 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Levonian gave Stratton $500, Miller $200 and Webb $125. Councilwoman Judy 
Mikels, who is running for county supervisor, received $1,000 from him. 
</P>
<P>
 School board candidates in Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks raised smaller 
amounts than most council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, Cheryl Heitmann reported raising more than any trustee 
candidate in the east county, $5,885. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heitmann, one of 10 candidates seeking three seats on the Conejo Valley school 
board, contributed $1,500 to her own campaign.  
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Ellyn H. Wilkins, Susan Witting, Elroi Reimnitz, and Elaine McKearn 
filed statements by Wednesday afternoon, but none received more than $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Because this is the first time the Conejo Valley school board race has 
coincided with the general election, candidates need to campaign harder, 
Heitmann said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes more money to reach more people." she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley school board race, where six candidates are vying for two 
seats, candidates Janice DiFatta and Jacquie Richardson have raised the most 
money, with DiFatta's campaign contributions topping $2,900. Richardson has 
raised about $2,100. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta has contributed nearly $1,800 of her own money, while Richardson has 
contributed $1,250 of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates Sharon Hushka, Glenn Woodbury and incumbent board president Carla 
Kurachi have raised less than $1,000, according to county records. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three Moorpark school board candidates who had filed statements by late 
Wednesday, David Pollock had raised the most, about $2,300.

AROUND THE VALLEY: RUGGED ANTELOPE VALLEY STRIKES A FEW NEW CLASSICAL CHORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 With a breeze to cool the night air and the stars shining overhead, the 
orchestra eased into the soothing strains of Johann Pachelbel's "Canon in D," 
followed by two Mozart pieces, a clarinet concerto and the familiar "Eine 
kleine Nachtmusik."  
</P>
<P>
 The large crowd on this balmy Saturday evening applauded warmly between each 
lilting piece as the concert progressed. Some people hummed or swayed in their 
seats to the music while others sipped soft drinks or munched on cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Another night for the cultured at the Hollywood Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 No, try a baseball diamond in a park, 60 miles away in the rough-and-tumble 
Antelope Valley, supposed home of "Cowboy Boots and Country Roots" as the local 
fair's theme proclaimed this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the success of this Saturday night brush with the classics has 
introspective locals wondering: Does the high desert really still deserve its 
hick reputation? And the question had to be asked: Has a spark of a more urban, 
Los Angeles-style culture finally taken root there? 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first classical concert Palmdale officials had sponsored in more 
than a decade, and with good reason. The last time the city tried, with a 
Sunday afternoon chamber music series, "The response, to put it mildly, was 
horrible," recalled city Parks Director John Lasagna. 
</P>
<P>
 So for this first-ever outdoor solo concert by the Antelope Valley Symphony 
Orchestra (yes, there is one), organizers had expected perhaps a few hundred 
people. Jaws dropped when the crowd swelled to more than 1,000, nearly filling 
the park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really what we look at now as a happening. The whole atmosphere of the 
event was incredible. We were absolutely astonished," said Steve Buffalo, 
Palmdale's special events coordinator, who has spent most of his years booking 
country and pop oldies acts for city events. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, you could tell it wasn't the Hollywood Bowl even before the concert, 
when it was announced that the cappuccino stand promised for the evening was a 
no-show. Once the music began, the sound system at times gave the impression it 
truly belonged on a baseball field, and the tower lighting really did. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one seemed to mind much, and the city gamely tried to create atmosphere 
by fitting the stage erected on the baseball infield with white latticed wood 
panels and strings of decorative lights. Concert-goers settled into lawn 
chairs, rolled out blankets or cuddled in sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 As the concert progressed from light classics into medleys from musicals, 
younger children roamed through the crowd. And when they became too restless, 
parents took them aside to play elsewhere in the park, although not quite out 
of earshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the orchestra shifted into a trio of marches that culminated with 
the rousing "The Stars and Stripes Forever" -- no one expected the crowd to sit 
still for an entire evening of classical music -- did the local color of the 
Antelope Valley reassert itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, an elderly man wearing a cap jumped to his feet and began marching 
and waving his arms like a drum major, finally leading much of the audience in 
clapping along with the music. That, and the themes from "Superman -- The 
Movie" and "Star Wars," and the evening was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Conductor Laura Hemenway and her 32-piece orchestra, which had fought the 
breezes sending their sheet music flying, drew such prolonged standing applause 
that they wanted to do an encore, but embarrassingly had prepared nothing, 
apparently presuming they'd be tolerated at best. 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone was left wondering: What was it in this land of pickup trucks and 
leather boots that drew more than 1,000 Antelope Valley residents for a 
starlight concert -- especially when the advertising referred only to the 
classical selections. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the classics have long had a home in the Antelope Valley, with the 
local symphony in various forms surprisingly dating back more than 50 years, 
Hemenway said. Someone has been attending the concerts all those years. But it 
was the size of the Saturday turnout that left many amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hemenway, a 16-year veteran of the orchestra, said she saw few of the group's 
regular patrons, who attend its more formal indoor concerts at Lancaster's 
performing arts center, in the audience. So, she suggested, "it might have just 
been the ambience" of the night more than the music. 
</P>
<P>
 But a longtime thirty-something friend I met at the concert -- who grew up in 
the Los Angeles area and then moved to the Antelope Valley with his wife to 
raise a young family -- said it was their appreciation of classical music that 
drew them. 
</P>
<P>
 That and the fact it was free. 
</P>
<P>
 They had never attended any of the oldies or country music events that have 
been local staples over the years. Plus, taking their youngsters to an indoor 
classical concert was generally too daunting and expensive. So when the outdoor 
concert beckoned, they jumped. 
</P>
<P>
 There are many such folks in the growing ranks of Antelope Valley residents, 
often L.A.-area transplants who arrive with what Lasagna called "a metropolitan 
attitude," expecting more from their new home than its traditional rodeos, 
community parades and weekend target shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 As a five-year resident, I've often found it hard to tell whether the 
old-timers or the newcomers have the upper hand. The newcomers certainly are 
gaining in numbers, but many are gone most of the week because they commute, 
making it tough for yuppie cafes or coffeehouses to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there's clearly change afoot. Palmdale officials were equally surprised 
last year to see the results of an informal survey of residents' top choices 
for future local concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop saxophonist Kenny G topped the list followed by crooner Michael Bolton, 
leaving country acts in the dust.

ELECTIONS / WEST VENTURA COUNTY; COUNCIL, SCHOOL BOARD INCUMBENTS LEAD 
CHALLENGERS IN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Incumbent candidates in west Ventura County's largest cities and school board 
districts have outpaced challengers in fund-raising, financial statements filed 
Wednesday show. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, Councilman Tom Holden has raised $23,590, more than the 10 other 
candidates vying for two council seats, according to his latest campaign 
disclosure statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Councilman Stanley J. Daily, one of six candidates running for three 
council seats, collected the largest sum in that race with $4,530. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oxnard School District, where seven candidates are running for three 
seats, incumbent Mary L. Barreto raised the most with $6,262. 
</P>
<P>
 And Oxnard Union High School trustee Jean Daily-Underwood, who has served on 
that board for 20 years, has raised $10,856 -- apparently the largest amount 
raised in any school board campaign in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the race for Ventura County Board of Education, it is the challengers 
who have raised the most money. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative Christian candidate Angela Miller, running against incumbent 
trustee Juanita Sanchez-Valdez and Jeffrey N. Moss to represent Oxnard and 
Ventura, has amassed $4,332. That is more than the total raised by 
Sanchez-Valdez and the two other incumbents seeking reelection to the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's largest contributor was Ray Ellison, a politically conservative 
Ventura millionaire who gave $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, where 14 candidates are hoping to land one of three seats, 
challenger Robert Turner, a dentist, has raised the most money with $3,369, 
most of which came from members of a local dentists' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 And five of eight candidates vying for three seats on the Santa Paula City 
Council filed forms indicating that they plan to spend less than $1,000. Of the 
remaining three candidates, newspaper publisher Don Johnson leads the pack with 
$3,314. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six candidates for the Ojai City Council, only Suza Francina, who 
raised $1,700, plans to spend more than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, John Zaragoza, a former Oxnard solid-waste superintendent, had the 
second-largest war chest with $17,463, much of which came in donations of less 
than $100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of those who have given me money are ordinary people," Zaragoza said. 
"Being a fourth-generation Oxnard resident helps me a lot. I know half the 
city."  
</P>
<P>
 Roy Lockwood, a retired federal fire official who has run and lost in every 
council election since 1972, has the third greatest sum -- $16,000 of his own 
money. He refused comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Maulhardt, a businessman and descendant of one of Oxnard's pioneer 
farming families, has raised $11,658 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Oxnard City Council candidates who submitted forms said they 
plan to spend less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to spend my money on rent, auto insurance, and (car) registration," 
said candidate William Winter. "When people contribute money, they usually want 
something in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, running unopposed for his second term, had not 
submitted his statement to the Oxnard City Clerk's office by late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates for public office in California who plan to spend more than $1,000 
are required to periodically submit financial statements detailing all campaign 
contributions over $100. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements filed Wednesday cover the period from July 1 to Sept. 30. 
Candidates who do not submit statements in person or mail them by Wednesday are 
subject to fines of $10 a day.

AUDITORIUM TO BE NAMED FOR ARTS PLAZA DONOR; THOUSAND OAKS: TWO OFFICIALS 
QUESTION TIMING OF GIFT AND HIS APPEAL OF A PLANNING ISSUE TO COUNCIL NEXT 
WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 North Ranch businessman Charles E. Probst donated $2 million to the Thousand 
Oaks Civic Arts Plaza on Wednesday, a gift that will result in a new auditorium 
being named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This generous contribution will allow us to breathe life into this fantastic 
building," said Tom Mitze, executive director of the $64-million arts center. 
"The gift is an unparalleled act of faith in the future of the Civic Arts 
Plaza." 
</P>
<P>
 But two City Council members questioned the timing of the donation, which was 
announced less than a week before Probst is scheduled to ask the council for a 
permit to landscape his 16-acre estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The landscaping proposal is controversial because Probst scraped his parcel 
clean of native vegetation last year in violation of a 1985 development 
agreement that the city reached with a previous owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Jaime Zukowski and Elois Zeanah said that they think the timing 
and size of the gift create a conflict for the council, and that Probst should 
have delayed it until after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of Alliance for the Arts said the timing was a coincidence and should 
not diminish the significance of the gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The contribution brings the alliance to within $1.6 million of a $10-million 
endowment goal it had not expected to reach until spring. Endowment interest 
will help pay for plaza maintenance and eventually to underwrite programs that 
would otherwise be too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it, folks," proclaimed Mayor Alex Fiore, announcing Probst's gift at a 
lavish press conference Wednesday in the plaza's Forum Theatre. "We appreciate 
this outstanding gift made by this gentleman and his family." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar said she was also elated by the donation and saw no 
underlying motive. "(I) could not imagine anyone donating $2 million to get 
approval of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will raise questions, undoubtedly, but I think it's wonderful," she 
said. "All I can say is, 'Thank you very much, with all sincerity.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The civic auditorium, the larger of two theaters in the new arts plaza, will 
be renamed the Charles E. Probst Center for the Performing Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst, 51, did not attend Wednesday's press conference and could not be 
reached for comment. But he said in a prepared statement that he was proud to 
contribute to the city's newest landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is truly a unique opportunity for all of us living in this city and 
surrounding communities to enjoy world-class entertainment and cultural events 
in an outstanding performing arts facility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Probst was identified by arts officials as the owner of a Woodland Hills 
computer software service company, Bankers Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Probst did not comment on the timing of his donation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski and Zeanah said they thought that the announcement should have been 
delayed until after Tuesday's hearing, when the council will determine whether 
Probst can replant his spacious yard with flowering plants and trees. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At a Planning Commission hearing in August, neighbors told commissioners that 
they opposed Probst's plans to build an 1,800-square-foot bunker to store 
gardening equipment on the hillside at Westlake Boulevard and Kanan Road. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that Probst should not be allowed special consideration just 
because he had plowed under existing vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors supported Probst's efforts, saying the natural growth on the 
hillside created a fire risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners denied Probst's request and ordered him to return the 
hillside to its original state. Probst appealed to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the timing is not the best for objective review, and I'm probably 
going to be lambasted for saying that," Zukowski said. "But it doesn't leave 
people feeling confident about the council." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Zeanah: "There's always the possibility that donations to civic causes 
will make the decision-makers feel beholden. I hope in this case the council 
members will be able to separate the two issues." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading Civic Arts Plaza supporter, Larry Janss, said he is confident that 
the council can remain objective. 
</P>
<P>
 "I applaud the council in advance for maintaining its independence and for not 
making an issue out of what might be perceived as a highly coincidental 
juxtaposition," Janss said. "I don't see the two issues as being in any way 
connected."

DEFENDANT, 17, BREAKS DOWN ON THE STAND; COURTS: BOY BEGINS CRYING AT MURDER 
TRIAL AS HE DESCRIBES AIMING GUN AND FATALLY SHOOTING JACQUELINE REAY, HIS 
16-YEAR-OLD GIRLFRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bringing his trial to a temporary halt, a Thousand Oaks teen-ager broke down 
in tears on the witness stand Wednesday as he described aiming a loaded handgun 
at his teen-age girlfriend and squeezing the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the emotional breakdown, the 17-year-old defendant had calmly fielded 
questions about the events that led to the July 13 death of Jacqueline Reay, 
16, who was shot once in the eye in the kitchen of a Las Casitas condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth began sobbing when his attorney, Victor Furio, zeroed in on the 
shooting itself. The lawyer asked the husky teen-ager, "Were you serious or 
playing when you pointed the gun at Jackie?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing," insisted the youth, who suddenly began crying uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. quickly called a recess as family 
and friends of the defendant -- and the victim -- also began to sob. 
</P>
<P>
 The first defense witness in the 3-day-old trial, the boy regained his 
composure and finished testifying after a lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 Charged with seven offenses, including murder, the defendant is being tried as 
a juvenile because prosecutors think he did not intend to kill his girlfriend. 
He could be imprisoned until age 25 if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy testified that he had been pointing the gun at Jacqueline and several 
other teen-agers as "a joke." But he never intended to harm or even scare 
anyone, he maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, the boy admitted he has trouble getting along with 
people and acknowledged that he committed a dangerous act by pointing the gun 
at Jacqueline without knowing whether a bullet was in the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 He began carrying the gun for protection a week before Jacqueline's death 
after being threatened by local gang members, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he pointed the gun repeatedly at Jacqueline, the boy said he was only 
trying to have some fun. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he enjoyed Jacqueline because she seemed to understand him, unlike 
most other people. He said he liked his girlfriend of two months "a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that she was somebody I could spend a lot of time with. And I 
did," he testified. "I was never annoyed with her, as I am annoyed with a lot 
of people who I am subjected to for a long time. I was subjected to her a long 
time, and she never got on my nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy quickly responded to questions from lawyers about the 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic handgun. But he said he had never undergone firearms training. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that before the shooting, Jacqueline had gone upstairs to shower. She 
was irritated that he would not stop aiming the gun at her legs, he 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 While she was showering, the boy allowed another teen-ager in the house to 
inspect the gun. He suggested that the boy may have inadvertently moved the 
bullet from a clip into the gun's firing chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got the gun back, the defendant said, he immediately pointed it at 
Jacqueline, who had returned downstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miffed, she went into the kitchen, where he continued tracking her with the 
gun, he said. He aimed and pulled the trigger. He was shocked when it fired. He 
said he ran into the kitchen where she was lying on the floor, dying. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran outside and flung the shell casing away. He ran. But five minutes 
later, he returned and surrendered to police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to run," he said. "I wanted to get rid of anything that could have 
incriminated me."

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; AN EXPLORATION OF FATHERLY PASSION; TAFT BY ANN PATCHETT ; 
A RICHARD TODD BOOK; HOUGHTON MIFFLIN $21.95, 305 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't believe in ad hominem -- or in this case, ad feminem -- reviewing, and 
I mostly object to the proposition that you should belong to a human category 
-- gender, race, ethnic group -- to write about it. But it would be gross 
affectation not to notice that Ann Patchett is a young white woman. Not only 
has she written one of the most winning evocations of a father's love that I 
can think of, but she has lodged it in a first-person narrative by the 
middle-aged black manager of a Memphis bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchett takes a number of chances along with this one, and they are carried 
off with an occasional roughness. It is tempting to speak of her gait as 
coltish; not only because of the roughness, and because this is only her second 
novel -- her first was the well-praised "The Patron Saint of Liars" -- but most 
of all because "Taft" has a gait ; lilting and with considerably more than the 
promise of the thoroughbred. 
</P>
<P>
 John Nickel, the narrator and protagonist, is grounded in a satisfying 
convention -- the stoical voice of a man weathered by what he has been through 
and seen; as a private eye, say, or as in this case, behind a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickel tells things as they are. How they are includes the fact that he is 
kind and that kindness is a chink he has learned to live with. 
</P>
<P>
 Patchett knows how to present goodness as an affliction, and how to write a 
good man without making the reader feel pushed. 
</P>
<P>
 She grounds Nickel before she lifts him. He was a jazz drummer: "I was as 
solid a drummer as you were going to find and everybody wanted me. I made the 
other people look good. That's what a good drummer does. He keeps everybody 
steady and paced. He shines his light at just the right time. That was me." 
</P>
<P>
 He had a girlfriend, Marion, whom he got pregnant. He treated her 
indifferently. Then he saw his son in the hospital. "A visit to a nursery may 
not be Paul's road to Damascus: I was a bad man before I saw and a good man 
after, but it's something like that. Children get right to the point." 
</P>
<P>
 It might as well have been the Damascus road; it is just as rough. Nickel, 
previously cool and self-centered, wants desperately to make a family with 
Marion and Franklin, his son. Now it is she who turns cold; she will agree only 
if he gives up drumming, gets a steady job managing the bar, and pays her way 
through nursing school. He does, abandoning his art for his fatherhood. And 
when she graduates, she abandons him and takes Franklin to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taft" is the story of Nickel's long penance and gradual redemption. That 
sounds heavy. In fact, Patchett's novel is light-voiced, almost lilting, about 
sorrowful things, and she manages the lightness and the sorrow with an 
equilibrium that does both justice. Until the end, we don't see Franklin, but 
Nickel's longing and memories evoke him vividly. And as surrogates, the author 
introduces two waifs: Fay and Carl Taft, a white brother and sister in their 
late teens, who themselves are adrift after the death of their own loving 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Fay persuades Nickel to give her a job in the bar; Carl, moody, drugged-out 
and under his sister's protection, is allowed to hang out there. Fay, seemingly 
a flower child, falls wholeheartedly in love with Nickel; reluctantly he 
responds. It is mainly the need of a bereft father for a child, and of a bereft 
child for a father; Patchett manages to infuse it with a strong sexuality whose 
constraints both inflame it and purge it of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The final reconciliation takes a good deal of hectic plot work. But the plot 
is all that Patchett forces, and only a little; her characters are splendidly 
free and unpredictable. Perhaps Nickel is slightly abstract in his identity as 
an African American, but this is no real flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Always believable, he becomes more than his ethnic identity. Patchett, in 
fact, creates a counterpart for him in Fay's and Carl's dead father. The loving 
and graceful details of the older Taft's fatherhood converge with Nickel's own 
journey; at one point they achieve a ghostly joining. Together, they are a 
moving emblem of fatherhood's rarely explored passion.

WINE: NO SMOKE, NO OAK: JUST FUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Going just by the numbers, Chardonnay is a success. Sales are brisk, 
especially in restaurants, both by the bottle and by the glass. By the same 
measure, Sauvignon Blanc is a disaster. Sales haven't risen in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if you rated the two wines based on whether the average consumer, someone 
with little or no knowledge of wine, could count on getting a good bottle, the 
story would be the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 I have blind-tasted about 400 Chardonnays this year and have found only 20% I 
could recommend -- and far fewer I'd personally drink. Yet of some 250 
Sauvignon Blancs I've sampled, at least half were worth recommending, and I'd 
be happy to sip any of more than 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the average price for a bottle of good Chardonnay is somewhere 
between $12 and $18; yet most excellent Sauvignon Blancs are priced at $10 or 
less and are frequently deeply discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 So you may wonder why Sauvignon Blanc isn't yet the household word that 
Chardonnay has become. I have a number of theories, chief among them the simple 
facts that 1) Chardonnay is easier to pronounce than Sauvignon Blanc, and 2) 
Chardonnay is a less complex wine, so it's easier for beginners to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sauvignon Blanc has one additional failing: two different names (Fume Blanc is 
the other -- in an oft-told bit of wine history, it is a name invented by 
Robert Mondavi as a marketing ploy) and a multitude of styles. As the names do 
not distinguish two different styles of wine, consumers have no way of knowing 
what they're getting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the popular styles of Sauvignon Blanc are wines that focus on melon and 
pear flavors (often with a trace of mint), on grassy-herbal flavors, on citrus 
flavors, and on an oaky style with a smoked element as a central theme. In each 
style, a winemaker may choose to either make the wine totally dry or leave a 
noticeable amount of sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 Though these wines are not comparable to one another, they are equally 
enjoyable when matched with the proper foods. But since few wine labels state 
precisely just what kind of wine the consumer is likely to find under the cork, 
confusion is the result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sauvignon Blanc sales are pretty flat," says Jon A. Fredrikson, president of 
the San Francisco wine consulting firm Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on supermarket scanner trends, sales (of Sauvignon Blanc) were down a 
(percentage) point last year and up a point this year," he says. "It's clear 
that Sauvignon Blanc continues to be hurt by the genericization of Chardonnay 
-- people calling for any Chardonnay. And that's too bad, because Sauvignon 
Blanc is a varietal that goes well with many foods." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, talk to California winemakers and you'll find they favor 
Sauvignon Blanc over Chardonnay by a wide margin. "I make Chardonnay for other 
people," confided one Napa Valley winemaker. "I make Sauvignon Blanc for me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrikson says the current status of Sauvignon Blanc is bleak for the 
industry, though it is a buyer's paradise. There is a vast oversupply of the 
wine in the bulk wine market, and prices for it are down. As are prices for the 
grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned because no one is replanting (Sauvignon Blanc)," says Michaela 
Rodeno, chief executive at St. Supery Winery in the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey released this month, Wines and Vines Magazine said only 269 U.S. 
wineries said they made Sauvignon Blanc last year, compared with 579 making 
Chardonnay. And the proportion of Sauvignon produced is even smaller than those 
figures suggest. Since 1983, Chardonnay plantings in California have more than 
doubled from 28,000 acres to 60,000 acres; in that same period, Sauvignon Blanc 
acreage increased only about 30% -- from 10,400 acres to 13,500 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the trade organization that is dedicated to improving the image of 
Sauvignon Blanc, the Society of Blancs (SOBs), is in disarray. Formed in 1990 
at the urging of Dave Stare, owner of Dry Creek Vineyards, the SOBs are 
"rebuilding and regrouping," according to executive director Lynn Garvey. She 
said the organization recently added five new members, bringing membership to 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously open just to the trade, anyone can now be an SOB. This week the 
group announced that for a $25 membership fee, new members would receive the 
society's cookbook, a tasting kit featuring a flavor spectrum wheel, 
instructions for hosting a Sauvignon Blanc party, a T-shirt and discounts at 
member wineries. For details call Lynn Garvey at (707) 944-8031 or write to 
SOBs, 1925 Vintner Court, Yountville, Calif. 94599. 
</P>
<P>
 SOBs president Carolyn Wente, of Wente Bros. Winery, does speaking engagements 
about Sauvignon Blanc's great affinity for food. But the group's only major 
event this year was a public Sauvignon Blanc tasting in San Francisco . . . at 
which no food was served.

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; PLAN FOR MARKET NEAR WETLAND TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hear public comment Tuesday on plans to construct a 
Smith's Food & Drug Center in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing comes after the August release of a report outlining the 
development's potential environmental effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the 10-acre site at Artesia Boulevard and Vermont Avenue has 
been a contentious issue in recent months. Opponents are concerned that the 
market will hurt a wetland, known as the Gardena Willows, next to the 
development site. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Los Angeles Recreation and Open Space Assn. have designed an 
alternative proposal to the Smith's center, advocating turning the vacant site 
into a park that incorporates the Willows wetland. Other community members are 
concerned that a park would draw crime to the area.  
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning and Environmental Quality Commission approved the 
development plan after hearing three hours of public testimony Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Duane M. Hinds praised activists who advocate an alternate plan to 
turn the site into a park, incorporating the Willows. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was torn between the two proposals. But he said he had to vote for 
the market development because a park would be a threat to public safety and 
the city could not afford its upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 The council hearing will be at 7:30 p.m. in council chambers, 1700 W. 162nd

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; SUIT SAYS OFFICERS ILLEGALLY SEARCHED CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three teen-agers have filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against two 
Torrance police officers who they say detained them at gunpoint and illegally 
searched their car. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that the officers, identified as A. Cramer and S. Danjou, 
stopped the high school seniors' car without probable cause and subjected them 
to "a frightening and humiliating search." 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also names Police Chief Joseph E. De Ladurantey and the city of 
Torrance as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials and a police spokesman would not discuss the details of the 
incident, but confirmed that it is being investigated. City Atty. John L. 
Fellows said he has not seen the file, but that the police department started 
an investigation after a complaint by one of the boys' parents.  
</P>
<P>
 In his letter to De Ladurantey, the father of one of the boys expressed his 
anger about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Cramer, who is an assistant city attorney in Los Angeles, said his son 
Nicholas, no relation to the officer, and friends Lohren Price and Dan Mason 
went to see a movie on May 26 to celebrate their graduation from the 
Harvard-Westlake School, a private preparatory school in North Hollywood. 
Cramer is white, Price and Mason are black. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I am understanding of the pressures borne by the police, I do not wish 
my son to live in a world in which . . . police officers believe a white boy 
traveling with two blacks is unusual, or an indication of potential crime," 
Cramer wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 After the movie they stopped to get gas for Price's 1979 Chevrolet at a 
station near Crenshaw and Artesia boulevards. The boys saw a police car parked 
near the station while they bought gas. When they headed up Crenshaw, Cramer 
said the officers pulled them over and approached the vehicle with guns drawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Cramer alleges that the two officers kept guns pointed at the teen-agers while 
they searched their pockets, patted them down and searched the car. The 
procedure took almost an hour, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fellows said the investigation of the incident has been hampered by the 
parents' refusal to let investigators talk to the teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not been very helpful," Fellows said. "If there is a legitimate 
claim, we want to satisfy it."  
</P>
<P>
 The officers cited Lohren Price for a defective turn signal, and Nicholas 
Cramer for not wearing a seat belt. The attorney representing the boys, Howard 
R. Price (no relation to Lohren Price), said the two citations were dismissed 
in traffic court. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed on Sept. 29 in U.S. District Court demands $750,000 in 
damages. The city has 60 days to file a response to the suit, Howard Price 
said. MARY GUTHRIE

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; A GRAY MATTER; LIFESTYLE CHANGES, AGING MEMBERS HAVE 
CUT NUMBERS IN ONCE-STRONG FRATERNAL GROUPS SUCH AS KIWANIS CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is nearly business as usual at an Inglewood Kiwanis Club weekly meeting: A 
dozen gray-haired members munch on fish and chips in a Motel 6 meeting room as 
the club's president announces the death of a longtime member and distributes a 
brochure on a retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, after a video presentation, a raffle and the final 
pleasantries, the 69-year-old club adjourned for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 Its members, whose average age had risen to 74, voted recently to retire the 
blue-and-yellow Kiwanis banner and brass bell and disband, after membership 
plummeted and a last-ditch effort to recruit younger members failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Much had changed since the 1950s, when the club drew more than 100 of 
Inglewood's movers and shakers, young judges and doctors who each week motored 
their Studebakers and Cadillacs to the Inglewood Country Club for lunch 
overlooking the 18th green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten a lot older, as has the world," President John Nicosia told the 
small group before they walked out of the meeting for the last time. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not alone. Although new clubs form from time to time, membership at 
decades-old South Bay fraternal lodges and service clubs -- from the Carson 
Moose to the Manhattan Beach Soroptimist -- has dropped off dramatically in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Members are graying, and many old-timers have died or retired and moved away. 
Young, enthusiastic upstarts, who build the baked-potato booth for the local 
fair or organize the annual pumpkin-sale fund-raiser, no longer join in the 
numbers they once did. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is a world of weekly lunches and evening dances that, over the years, 
has brought together thousands of men and women to socialize, exchange business 
cards and raise thousands of dollars for charity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inglewood Kiwanis contributed to the Inglewood YMCA, the Salvation Army 
and a local senior citizen's club. And for many years, members gave 
scholarships to outstanding students at Inglewood High School.  
</P>
<P>
 "The older generation was more compassionate," said Rusty Napolitano, 49, a 
regional Kiwanis representative who lamented that club membership has fallen 
50% in much of Southern California in the past decade. "People would rather 
shoot someone than help them these days." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that people don't care, sociologists say. But many agree that 
transformations in the way people live are responsible for the decline: More 
people commute out of their hometowns to work these days, diminishing community 
ties; the ethnic mix of many communities has changed, and a century-long shift 
from collectivism toward individualism has left many less inclined toward group 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, people have more leisure activities and charities to choose from 
now than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I go to my mailbox, I'm constantly solicited for donations and 
involvement in the local chapter of anything," said sociologist Bob Harootyan, 
a senior researcher with the Washington-based American Assn. of Retired 
Persons. "You pick and choose." 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the world these clubs were born into. Most service and fraternal 
organizations were formed in the late 1800s and early 1900s out of a need for 
camaraderie and community service. All-male fraternal lodges like the Elks and 
Moose focused on brotherhood, while men's clubs like the Rotary and women's 
service groups like the Soroptimist raised money for charity as members quietly 
swapped business cards. 
</P>
<P>
 As clubs and lodges grew, many took on increasingly significant and visible 
roles in communities, welcoming new teachers, buying library books and 
sometimes even constructing city buildings. Politicians and police chiefs were 
expected to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to say the Rotary owns the town, the Kiwanis run the town, and the 
Lions, they just have fun," said former Inglewood Kiwanis Club member Walter 
Haskell, 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders saw club membership as a way to share their success with 
others in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you were in business and you took out of the community, it was your 
responsibility to put something back," recalled Bette Deziel, 68, who joined 
the women-only Manhattan Beach Soroptomist Club in 1952 after her husband, Don, 
bought a jewelry store in the city. He joined the local Kiwanis club several 
years later.  
</P>
<P>
 Each Monday at noon, Bette Deziel grabbed her purse from under a desk and 
strolled down Manhattan Beach Boulevard to a meeting hall near the base of the 
city pier to plan the next fund-raiser with the club's 30 members. "I didn't 
want to join a social club -- a knife-and-fork club -- I wanted to do service," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Deziel served punch and cookies at monthly dances, raised 
money to erect a flagpole in front of City Hall and worked to build a swimming 
pool at a local school. 
</P>
<P>
 But the call-to-clubs has quieted over the years. In the last decade, Deziel's 
club has lost 30% of its members. The remaining members decided recently to 
drop one of the club's four meetings each month. "Most people say they don't 
have the time anymore," said Soroptomist member Sally Reinburg. "My opinion is 
you have time for what you want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent gathering in a small room at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Manhattan 
Beach, about a dozen professional women sipped iced tea as Reinburg asked for 
volunteers to spend a weekend working at the Manhattan Beach Old Hometown Fair, 
an annual festival that attracts many local service clubs. Reinburg was lucky: 
About 10 members scrawled their names on a sign-up sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Such activities become increasingly difficult with declines in membership, but 
the Soroptomist members plan to sponsor a game booth and a baking contest to 
raise money for scholarships and literacy programs. Officials hope the club's 
presence at the fair will also boost membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Manhattan Beach Lions Club hope that a booth selling broiled 
chicken will do the same. The club recently celebrated its 75th anniversary in 
the city, but membership has dipped to half what it was in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions Club used to recruit new members who represented a varied line of 
professions, and sometimes would exclude an individual if the group already had 
a number of people in the candidate's line of work.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was the original premise, but we don't stick to that anymore because of 
(declining) membership, and we don't want to turn people down," said Bob Smith, 
who last year served as club president.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, service clubs also excluded members of the opposite sex, but in 
1987, the Supreme Court ruled that clubs such as the Kiwanis and Rotary were 
public service organizations and must be open to both genders. Since then, the 
number of women has risen dramatically in many previously all-male local clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the ethnic mix in some cities have also affected membership in the 
clubs. Inglewood, for example, was predominantly white before 1965, and by 1992 
it was 50% black and 38% Latino. As the mix changed, clubs composed of mainly 
minority members came and went. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aging, all-white Kiwanis Club in Inglewood was calling it quits 
recently, a younger, predominantly African American Kiwanis Club planned its 
first meeting. The two clubs considered joining forces, but decided against it. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the now-defunct white club say they tried to attract African 
Americans to their group, but none stayed. Ray Snowden, 57, of the new club 
said each organization has its own personality and that "some clubs are more 
playful than others." Many members of the new club are in their 30s, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the members (of the older club) were doing what they were supposed to be 
doing, their club wouldn't have dwindled in membership," Snowden said.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the service clubs, many local fraternal orders have suffered a decline in 
membership. South Bay Elk and Moose lodges that 50 years ago bustled with 
raucous poker games and noisy, smoke-filled bars have quieted in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carson Moose Lodge two decades ago claimed more than 1,000 members but 
today boasts less than 500. In Redondo Beach, the 75-year-old Elk's Lodge has 
lost nearly 2,000 members since the 1970s, and the average age of the remaining 
600 members is about 72, said Norman McHale, the lodge's exalted ruler. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the problems with this lodge is its age," he said. "We lose about 30 
members a year due to deaths." 
</P>
<P>
 Rooms in the lodge resonate with Elk history. Yellowed newspaper clippings 
heralding lodge happenings are displayed in a large case near the entrance. And 
one room's walls are lined with photographs of 75 years of former exalted 
rulers -- more than half of them now deceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many area lodges, the Redondo Elks is scrambling to attract new members. 
The lodge recently added a workout room, complete with an exercise cycle and 
weight machines, as well as a sports bar, to attract younger members who might 
otherwise be lured to a trendy health club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to change our image," McHale said. "This place used to be so 
dark and dingy with the old '50s decor, so we've really been working on it." 
</P>
<P>
 McHale said the lodge long ago dispensed with the illegal gambling activity 
that made headlines several years ago in Simi Valley, where officers 
confiscated video gambling machines from a Moose lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Elks members sometimes mock lodge stereotypes, as well as some 
arguably archaic Elk titles, by calling exalted ruler McHale "the Grand 
Pooh-bah," the title of the fictitious Leopard Lodge's leader in television's 
"Happy Days." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has also tried to make the club more attractive to women. A musty 
odor in the lodge kept many wives away for years until members cleaned and 
redecorated the rooms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But women outnumbered men 5 to 1 recently for Thursday night line dancing in 
the main hall. The room echoed with "Achy Breaky Heart" as Lorraine Berro 
reminded members when to pivot and shift their feet. Four mounted elk heads 
looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though many clubs are making an effort to include women, private 
fraternal lodges such as the Elks are not required to open their doors to them. 
Many have auxiliary clubs for members' wives, but women are frequently excluded 
from lodge business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are slowly changing," McHale said. His wife, Melaney, who is a member 
of the lodge's Deer club for women, said she doesn't mind being excluded from 
dull business discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've got it the best," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to attract more women and children, the Carson Moose recently changed 
the name of their meeting place from a "Lodge" to the Moose Family Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to think we're more than a bingo palace or a gambling hall," 
said lodge administrator Howard Duffy. "We're trying to make these places where 
people can go for fun and relaxation and where they don't have to worry about 
being molested." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Service clubs also experiment with new practices to attract new members. 
</P>
<P>
 When some members of a Torrance Rotary Club could no longer make time for the 
club's weekly lunch meetings, some members started a breakfast club. Membership 
is down to only 17, but, for the first time, members plan to distribute 
invitation cards to attract others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to get membership back up into the 30s again," said President 
William LeBrun, 64. "I think we've been really hurt by the economy, but I think 
things will turn around." 
</P>
<P>
 A few clubs say enthusiasm and membership never wavered.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the 35-member Kayumanngi Lions Club, a predominantly Filipino 
club in Carson, say membership and youth interest are stronger than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us came from a poor country and experienced a lot of hardships," said 
former President Marcelino Ines Jr., 63. "We have enjoyed the American way of 
life, and we want to share what we have."  
</P>
<P>
 And a Rotary club in Palos Verdes that was formed in 1962 has grown 30% in the 
past decade to more than 100 members, including many young professionals, said 
former President Mike Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But such clubs are the exception in the South Bay, and many old-timers now 
must decide whether to struggle to revive their clubs and continue the 
century-old tradition or relegate them to memories and scrapbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood Kiwanis member W. J. (Bill) Worthington, 88, who taught in local 
schools for more than 40 years, decided to join the Hawthorne Kiwanis rather 
than call it quits after decades in service clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haskell, who joined the Inglewood Kiwanis Club in 1955 as a public 
relations representative for Southern California Edison, decided against it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad to see it go," he said, but added that he would rather pursue other 
hobbies, such as amateur filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather make a complete ending rather than just let it disintegrate," he 
said. "I think there's a season for everything -- a season to begin and a 
season to end. This is change, and (the club's) no longer appropriate." Service 
Clubs and Fraternal Lodges 
</P>
<P>
 Lions: With a membership of 1.4 million men and women in 179 countries, the 
Lions are generally considered the world's largest service organization. The 
first club was formed in Chicago in 1917 by an insurance agent seeking social 
interaction. Over the past three years, Lions clubs have raised $146 million to 
fight preventable and reversible blindness, club officials said. The South Bay 
has 22 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotary: Rotary International was formed in Chicago in 1905 by an attorney 
seeking camaraderie among men from varied professions. The club's weekly 
meetings rotated from one member's place of business to another, so the club 
was called "Rotary." Over the years, the organization has grown to 1.2 million 
members in 150 countries. Last year, clubs donated nearly $53 million to 
educational and humanitarian programs, officials said. The South Bay has 18 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiwanis: Kiwanis International claims 327,000 members in 77 countries. The 
first club was formed in 1915 by two Detroit businessmen seeking networking 
opportunities. According to club literature, Kiwanis is an Indian name meaning 
"We have a good time" and "We make noise." Last year, Kiwanis clubs raised 
about $18 million for children's health causes, club officials said. There are 
14 clubs in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimist: Optimist International was founded in 1919 in Kentucky for business 
networking and community service. The organization has a $40-million annual 
budget for charities and claims 157,000 members in the United States and 
Canada. Members are expected to project a positive outlook in the community. 
There are four clubs in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Soroptimist: The all-women Soroptimist club was formed in 1921 by 80 women 
seeking to do community service. The organization, which is unrelated to the 
Optimist clubs, claims 95,000 members in 111 countries. The name Soroptimist is 
roughly translated from Latin as "The best for women," said spokeswoman Darlene 
Friedman. The organization emphasizes hands-on community work over fund 
raising, but clubs in 20 countries raised $500,000 to promote literacy, 
Friedman said. There are eight clubs in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Moose: The Loyal Order of Moose was founded in 1888 in Kentucky by five men 
who wanted a fraternal organization combining ritual with social activity. The 
name Moose was chosen because of the animal's size, strength and devotion to 
protecting its family. The organization spends about $50 million a year to 
support a residential school for needy children, a retirement center and a 
drug-and-alcohol-awareness program for teen-agers. The Moose claim 1.7 million 
members in the United States, Canada and Great Britain. There are six lodges in 
the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Elks: The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks claims 1.3 million members 
around the country. The fraternal order was formed in 1868 by an entertainer 
seeking social activity. The name Elks was chosen because the animal is 
"indigenous to North America and is quick and gentle and ferocious in defending 
its young," said spokesman Mike Manning. Lodges are open to men 21 and older. 
Each year, the Elks donate about $132 million to various causes, including aid 
to war veterans. There are four lodges in the South Bay.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: REGULARS KEEP JOE'S LEGACY ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Filkosky may have willed Joe's, his Redondo Beach restaurant, to his two 
children, but when he passed away last month at 61, in a way he really left it 
to his other family: the workers at Joe's, from the cooks and dishwashers to 
the managers and waitresses.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really miss him a lot. We were like his family too," says manager Teri 
Boyd, who has worked at the popular Pacific Coast Highway roadhouse for 20 
years. She isn't the only longtime employee at Joe's -- 20 employees have been 
working there for more than five years. And hundreds of customers have been 
eating at Joe's for as long. Some have come there regularly since the place 
opened in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a counter with six stools when Philadelphia-born Filkosky took 
over a quarter of a century ago. Through the years, he turned it into one of 
the most popular South Bay beach restaurants, complete with outdoor patio with 
six long communal tables. Regulars know that to avoid the inevitable wait, 
especially on weekends, the best bet is an early (say, 5:30 a.m.) start. Others 
claim that the wait is part of the Joe's Experience.  
</P>
<P>
 Many of the breakfast crowd come for the John Wayne special ($4.50): two eggs 
over medium topped with cheese on a bed of fried potatoes covered with bell 
peppers, onions, and tomatoes, served with two sausage patties. Others prefer 
the Joe's special ($4), two biscuits topped with sausage patties drenched with 
country gravy, served with two eggs and fried potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 A few chalkboard specials are always available, perhaps a guacamole omelet 
with bacon ($5.50) or the chile verde ranchero ($5.50), chunks of pork in a 
green chili sauce over eggs and tortillas. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, the most expensive item is a 16-ounce porterhouse steak ($8.50), 
served with mashed potatoes, vegetables, and soup or salad. A frequent special 
is roasted turkey served with stuffing, mashed potatoes, cranberries, a 
vegetable and a biscuit ($5.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Joe's is at 400 N. Pacific Coast Highway, Redondo Beach. (310) 376-9570. Open 
Monday through Saturday, 5:30 a.m. to 9 p.m,., and Sunday, 6 a.m. to 4 p.m.

 BODY COUNT 
</P>
<P>
 When a majority of Coast Area administrators voted to disband the Pioneer 
League last year, the league's high schools cried bloody murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're getting killed on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 In their reincarnation as members of eight-team Bay and Ocean leagues, the old 
Pioneer League schools have come back as cannon fodder. 
</P>
<P>
 All six of the former Pioneer League schools lost league openers last week and 
were outscored, 190-40. El Segundo took the worst beating, 49-2, against Mira 
Costa, but the Torrance schools didn't fare much better. Only Torrance managed 
to score in double figures in a 28-14 loss to Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, not everyone is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do the former Pioneer League schools really have any football future in the 
Bay and Ocean leagues, or will they just become body bag opponents to fill out 
the schedules for the original Bay and Ocean League schools?" asked an official 
from a former Pioneer League school who requested anonymity. "How long can the 
former Pioneer League schools take these poundings before the football programs 
and athletic morale deteriorate?" 
</P>
<P>
 The situation looks especially bleak for West, North and Torrance, which are 
competing for playoff spots against established football powers Hawthorne, 
Leuzinger and Peninsula in the Bay League. West and North tied for the Pioneer 
League title last season, but Friday they were overwhelmed by Peninsula, 35-7, 
and Hawthorne, 34-6, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 South should be competitive in the Ocean League, although the Spartans were 
badly outplayed in a 24-3 loss to talented Culver City. As for El Segundo and 
Centennial, it's apparent they have little chance of ever making the playoffs 
in the Ocean League's current setup. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Pioneer League administrators had hoped to keep three leagues. But 
their counterparts from the five-team Bay and Ocean leagues, wanting to reduce 
scheduling hassles, voted unanimously to go with two expanded leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the leagues are in place for a four-year cycle, one-sided football 
scores could become commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's not good for anyone. NOT FORGOTTEN 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mira Costa's football team is 4-0, it's only natural to wonder how 
much better the Mustangs would be if Phil Fonua and Dino Rossi were playing. 
</P>
<P>
 They were the only All-Southern Section players back from the 1993 Division 
VII championship team, but both had their senior seasons wiped out before the 
first game. Fonua, a preseason All-American nose tackle, suffered a ruptured 
cerebral aneurysm. Rossi, a wide receiver-defensive back who was one of Mira 
Costa's fastest players, had surgery to repair a torn knee ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Don Morrow has dealt with the disappointment of losing two of his best 
players, but occasionally he still asks himself, "What if?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that I wonder what our record would have been or how we 
would have stacked up against other teams with those guys," Morrow said. "I 
just wanted to see what they would have done in their senior years." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, though, pointed out that Fonua and Rossi are still contributing in an 
inspirational sense. They joined Mira Costa's captains on the field before 
Friday's game against El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our senior group is very close and they always want both of those guys 
around," Morrow said. "The kids who are playing have a good feel for what has 
happened. They know what has been taken from these guys. Our attitude has been 
good, but we still miss them. We've never denied that." SEEK AND DESTROY 
</P>
<P>
 With Mira Costa's Fonua sidelined, the area's most disruptive defensive player 
clearly has to be Banning lineman John Toavalu. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-11, 280-pound senior was a one-man wrecking crew last week in the 
Pilots' 17-0 victory over San Pedro, getting three sacks and forcing a fumble. 
As a team, Banning had six sacks and forced five turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot assistant Titus Tuiasosopo says there's a simple reason why Toavalu is 
so effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can block him," he said. ON THE RUN 
</P>
<P>
 The South Bay's most dominant offensive player has been Mira Costa tailback 
Mike Fikes, who leads the area with 690 yards rushing and nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 195-pound senior has rushed for more than 200 yards in each of 
the past two games and has rushed for more than 100 yards in all six of his 
starts at tailback for Mira Costa since becoming eligible late last season. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Fikes has to be the best running back Morrow has coached, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "He could end up being (the best), but I've had some good tailbacks in the 
last few years," said Morrow, who took over the Mira Costa program last year 
after coaching South Torrance for four seasons. "He doesn't have blazing speed, 
but he can get to the corner and has real good moves. And he's a load (to bring 
down)." GAME OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 Can the ever-changing Leuzinger defense stop the option? 
</P>
<P>
 Can the fast-improving Peninsula offense continue to rack up yardage? 
</P>
<P>
 These and other questions will be answered Friday when Leuzinger (3-0-1, 1-0 
in league play) visits Peninsula (3-1, 1-0) for a 3 p.m. game that will go a 
long way toward deciding the Bay League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger Coach Fred Boehm promised more defensive changes after the Olympians 
struggled to defend the option last week against Torrance. He realizes they'll 
have to perform better against Peninsula, which, led by quarterback Peter 
Krogh, ran the option to perfection against West Torrance. NOTABLE 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mira Costa girls' volleyball team, which beat St. Mary's of Stockton en 
route to a second-place finish in a Chicago tournament last weekend, moved up 
to second in the CIF coaches state poll. The Mustangs, ranked seventh in the 
previous poll, lost in the final to Lincoln East of Nebraska. Mira Costa's Lori 
Garber was named all-tournament. Newport Harbor remained in the state's No. 1 
position, with St. Mary's dropping from second to third. 
</P>
<P>
 * It was a case of good news/bad news for the Cal State Dominguez Hills 
women's soccer team Sunday. The Toros shut out Metropolitan State of Colorado, 
4-0, but they lost leading scorer Gwen Nakashima (Torrance High) for the season 
because of a knee injury. Dominguez Hills rallied Monday with a 3-1 victory 
over Cal Lutheran, improving to 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simone Ferrera of South Torrance was the fastest girl at the Kenny Staub 
cross-country meet last weekend at La Crescenta County Park, covering the 
three-mile course in 19:20. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amanda Basica of Lomita is part of a five-player, under-21 United States 
women's tennis team that will compete against Great Britain in the 22nd annual 
Maureen Connolly Challenge Trophy starting today at Colorado Springs, Colo. The 
U.S. team is coached by former U.S. Open winner Tracy Austin.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; CITY WITHDRAWS FROM LIBRARY TAX DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carson has pulled out of the special district formed by Los Angeles County to 
fund public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to rescind a resolution it passed last month 
that allowed the county to create a special district to tax each property owner 
$28.50 per year for library services.Councilwoman Kay A. Calas did not attend 
the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 After Carson approved the new assessment, the county discovered it may have 
additional funds in its budget. However, the supervisors have not committed to 
using the extra money for libraries.  
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council felt the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors had not, at 
this point, acted in good faith," Councilwoman Mary Anne O'Neal said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the county set a deadline for participating in the district and Carson 
had asked to be included at that time, residents may have to pay the fee this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may be taxed this time. We're trying to see if we can avoid that," said 
Mayor Michael I. Mitoma. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the council is displeased with library services, Mitoma said, the city 
might try to form its own library system. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question on the council that the library is one of our most 
important services, especially for kids," Mitoma said.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal said that if the county suddenly had no library funding, the city might 
rejoin the special district. 
</P>
<P>
 "If at some time it turns out that they don't have the money, I am sure that 
we will listen," O'Neal said. "We just don't want them to use that money for 
something else."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CARSON; MALL DEVELOPERS CLAIM VICTORY IN BID FOR SITE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Developers of the Metro 2000 site in Carson say they made the highest bid to 
buy the federal government's interest in the proposed outlet shopping mall.  
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. auctioned off $28 million in loans on the 
157-acre site, which the government inherited when it took over Consolidated 
Savings & Loan of Irvine in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Until escrow closes on the deal in about 2 weeks, neither side will reveal the 
exact sales price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a substantial discount from the face value of the notes . . . we are 
very pleased," said Bob Sonnenblick, an investment banker who is one of the 
partners in the development. 
</P>
<P>
 FDIC officials would not confirm the buyers.  
</P>
<P>
 Investors in the project include Robert A. Ferrante, who owned the defunct 
savings and loan, and the Southern California Glaziers, Architectural Metal and 
Glass Workers Pension Fund, which Sonnenblick said financed last week's 
purchase of notes.  
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1993, the Carson City Council approved an agreement with a group 
of investors to provide special financing for development of an outlet shopping 
mall. Critics of the project have expressed concern about the cleanup of toxic 
waste on the property, formerly the Cal Compact landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonnenblick estimated it would cost about $200 million to develop the site, 
including cleaning up the property. He said they have already solicited bids on 
the cleanup and would complete construction of the project in about 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Varenchik of the state Department of Toxic Substances Control, which 
supervises cleanup of toxic materials on the site, said negotiations on the 
cleanup were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro 2000 is one of the largest undeveloped sites in Los Angeles County. It 
has been considered for a variety of projects, including a mobile-home park, 
office complexes and a football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlet mall is expected to include 225 manufacturer's factory outlet 
stores and 12 clearance centers for department stores, Sonnenblick said. More 
than 70% of the spaces are already leased, he said. MARY GUTHRIE

 McDonnell Douglas employees have donated $5,000 to the Marine Mammal Care 
Center for sick and injured seals and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The donation by the aerospace workers is the largest ever received by the 
nonprofit organization at Ft. MacArthur, director Don Zumwalt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will help enlarge the center, which has been operating for two 
years, Zumwalt said. "We're building a new 15,000-gallon tank and expanding our 
medical capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The marine center rescues and rehabilitates sea mammals from Los Angeles and 
Ventura county beaches before returning them to the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was donated by employees of McDonnell Douglas West in Long Beach and 
Huntington Beach. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: REGION; GOT A DISPUTE? COUNTY SERVICE HELPS SETTLE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies receive a call about an armed man in a quiet residential 
neighborhood. They find the man, but there's no gun. A decade-long neighborhood 
feud has turned into a tattling match, and the deputies are caught in the 
middle -- with guns drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the neighbor called the police, and the falsely accused man knows it, 
police officials fear the dispute might escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This particular incident could have resulted in a really volatile situation," 
said Sgt. Henry Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis recommended that the neighbors call Voluntary Mediation Services, a 
county program to help people resolve conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Escorted by Davis, Jean Salk, who heads the local mediation office, visited 
the neighborhood and talked to both neighbors. Eventually they worked out their 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Salk supervises 40 trained volunteers based in the San Pedro Service Center. 
In both English and Spanish, they mediate everything from divorce settlements 
to ruined laundry and barking dogs. Funds for the program come from a reserve 
collected from civil court filing fees. Referrals to the program come from 
courts, law enforcement agencies and city officials. But anyone can call for an 
appointment to settle a dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 In the South Bay, Salk's team handles disputes for residents of San Pedro, 
Wilmington, Carson, the Palos Verdes Peninsula and Lomita. They also refer 
people to similar services in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically the agency works on disagreements between landlords and tenants, 
employees and their bosses, and consumers and companies. They can also help 
settle divorce disputes.  
</P>
<P>
 The most important thing, Salk said, is that the mediators don't take sides in 
the quarrels. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're concerned with is the process of getting the people to 
communicate," Salk said. When the communication works, she said, a solution 
usually follows. By her estimate, 90% of the time, people who attend mediation 
come to some agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediator's creativity helps people resolve their differences without going 
to court, Salk says. Sometimes, for instance, people can use barter to settle 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 A landlord may offer to replace carpeting in exchange for prompt payment of 
back rent. A store owner who put the wrong dress on layaway might give store 
credit for other merchandise rather than demanding payment for the unwanted 
dress. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the emotion in disputes that often creates an impasse, Salk said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can turn the words around and get the message across without the emotion," 
Salk says. 
</P>
<P>
 Mediation services are offered at no charge, and the meetings are 
confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said if more people use mediation, it could be a big help to the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediation services can be reached at (310) 519-6248. MARY GUTHRIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: PORT OF LOS ANGELES; CORPS TO RESUBMIT PLAN TO DREDGE CHANNEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will try for a second time to get the 
California Coastal Commission to approve a major dredging project in the 
entrance channel of Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public hearing Tuesday, the commission will discuss the Corps' plan to 
dredge 132,000 cubic yards of debris from the channel and dispose of it in port 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was rejected by the commission at its September meeting in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the Corps' plan failed to outline a long-term solution to 
handle the debris that travels from Ballona Creek and accumulates in the Marina 
del Rey channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns also were raised about a plan to store the dredged material inside 
special plastic tubes, to be placed in shallow areas of the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Army Corps spokesman Fred-Otto Egeler said some of the commission's concerns 
have been addressed in the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 And a memorandum of understanding between the Corps, the commission and Los 
Angeles County to investigate a long-term solution could result in a different 
decision by commissioners this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission staff now recommend approving the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 10 a.m. at the Crowne Plaza Holiday Inn, 5985 W. 
Century Blvd., Los Angeles. SUSAN WOODWARD

A FRIEND INDEED; A STORE CLERK WAS SHOT AND PARALYZED BY ROBBERS WHILE 
PROTECTING HIS BOSS, WHO NOW STEPS IN WITH SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Francisco Gonzalez, a South-Central Los Angeles liquor store clerk, thought 
Young S. Choo was the perfect boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Choo gave him pay advances, grocery discounts and time off on his birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Choo thought Gonzalez, his sole employee, was an ideal worker, hard-working 
and liked by all the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years they worked side by side, until a robber's bullet tore through 
Gonzalez's spine on Sept. 23, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down. 
</P>
<P>
 All the robbers got was a $2.25 bottle of pineapple drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they took my money, that's a lot better than this happening," said Choo, 
47, who was spared in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Choo is promising to take care of the 37-year-old clerk's pregnant wife, 
who is expecting her baby in a week, and the Gonzalezes' 3-year-old daughter. 
He has contacted victim-assistance programs and state welfare organizations, 
and says he will pay the $400-a-month rent on the Gonzalezes' house behind the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Choo is a beautiful owner," said Gonzalez, bedridden in the Memorial 
Rehabilitation Hospital in Long Beach. "He helped me so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez says he had worked about five years for the previous store owner. 
Choo kept him on when he bought the South Vermont Avenue store the day the 1992 
riots erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riot was Wednesday," Choo said from behind his counter, now protected by 
a bulletproof shield. "I expected to change ownership Friday. I closed the deal 
on Wednesday, and the riot was the same night. Then everything was on hold. 
About three months later, I took over." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the robbery, business was peaceful. Children walked in to buy eggs, 
chips and bubble gum. Adults came for soft drinks and liquor. The area is not 
one of the safest in the city, but Los Angeles Police Department Detective Dan 
Meyer said there had not been a robbery in the store "for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows Chico," Choo said, using Gonzalez's nickname. "All my 
customers ask about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Choo said two armed robbers posing as customers demanded that he empty his 
cash register, which contained about $500 cash.  
</P>
<P>
 "I stepped back," Choo said of the confrontation, which was captured on his 
surveillance camera. (It was later broadcast on TV and led to the arrest of one 
of the suspects.) "One guy pointed his gun at us. The other guy jumped over" 
the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Choo, who said he does not carry a gun, explained that Gonzalez tried to 
prevent the robbery and protect his boss by pulling out his own gun. 
</P>
<P>
 During the struggle that followed, Gonzalez shot one of the attackers, Joseph 
Graham, 31, who died after fleeing the store. Police said the second attacker, 
Lynn Stewart, yelled to his partner to "get the cash register," then reached 
over the counter and shot Gonzalez in the back. The robbers, however, did not 
get the chance to touch the register.  
</P>
<P>
 Lying in the hospital, where doctors say he might spend months undergoing 
rehabilitation to adapt to a wheelchair, Gonzalez seems not to regret what he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy wanted to kill Mr. Choo," Gonzalez said. "I wanted to help Mr. Choo. 
That's why I took out my gun."  
</P>
<P>
 The loyalty did not escape his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He protected me," Choo said. "He would not be hurt if he was not trying to 
protect me." 
</P>
<P>
 Choo is especially concerned about Gonzalez's 25-year-old wife, Evelia 
Gutierrez. She goes to the hospital every day to be with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, Choo called everywhere looking for help for Gonzalez and 
his family. Now his insurance is paying the hospital bills, Choo said. But he 
said that even if the Gonzalezes get the financial help they are seeking, it 
will not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will give her $100 a week to pay the rent," he said, even though he is 
uncertain how long he can continue to provide financial assistance. "Maybe 
he'll stay (in the hospital) for a full year, or two. I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Choo, who formerly owned a dry cleaners, recently hired a man who would only 
give his name as Sergeant Smith. But he said that if Gonzales can eventually 
return to work, he is willing to make his store wheelchair accessible. "I need 
him," Choo said, "because he's a really nice guy and he's good to the 
customers."

CITY SCRAPS LITTLE TOKYO OFFICE PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying that the city must take steps to cut expenses, the Los Angeles City 
Council voted Wednesday to scrap a 6-year-old proposal to build a municipal 
office building in conjunction with a private hotel, apartment and retail 
development near Downtown's Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members, voting 11 to 2, said they can no longer justify building 
the $151-million municipal office tower when the city is reducing staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times have changed, things have changed," Councilman Hal Bernson said. "Our 
prime commitment has to be to the people by trying to manage the city in the 
most cost-effective manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's decision, however, came under heated criticism from the project 
developer and Little Tokyo merchants, who were counting on the development 
known as First Street North to bring more business to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sad day for not only for Little Tokyo, but also for Los Angeles," said 
Tom Kurai, spokesman for the Japanese Village Plaza on 2nd Street. "A lot of 
people were waiting a long time for the City Council to help the community and 
a lot of people were disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Frances Hashimoto, president of the Little Tokyo Business Assn., said: "We 
have looked forward to this project. To stop it now is a slap in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael D. Barker, the managing director for the Barker Pacific Group, said 
his company would file a claim against the city to recoup the $7 million that 
Barker Pacific has spent planning the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city has made a major mistake," Barker said. "It has confirmed 
that doing business with the city of Los Angeles is very risky. The City 
Council does not have the gumption to follow through with what it set out to 
do. It's spineless." 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said the city would be remiss to continue with the 
ambitious development in the wake of the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are obligated to have the courage to say circumstances have changed," 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said. "This is not 1988. The economy has changed, 
the city needs have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that the city consider buying or leasing a small office building 
near the Civic Center if it needs more space. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Councilman Richard Alatorre, a strong supporter of the project, 
accused his colleagues of being shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has really changed that would dictate to us that it is a better deal to 
lease than to own?" Alatorre asked the other council members. "Ladies and 
gentlemen, it is illogical. I know that ownership is better than leasing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said it sends a bad message to pull out of a deal with a developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't change the rules midstream and get sued and have to pay time 
and time again," Alatorre said. "It is time that we live up to our 
commitments." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs also voted against the proposal to kill the project, 
saying he needed more information on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city began negotiating in 1988 to build the 1.25-million-square-foot 
project on 11 acres of city property bounded by 1st, Alameda, San Pedro and 
Temple streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was to include a 500-room hotel, shops, hundreds of apartments, a 
plaza, two museums and a memorial to Japanese American veterans of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this year, the project had met little opposition from council members. 
</P>
<P>
 However in February, Mayor Richard Riordan sent a letter to the council asking 
it to scrap the project, saying it was too costly. He added that the plan did 
not coincide with the guidelines to bolster development in the downtrodden 
historic core of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undoubtedly the project offers many potential benefits, particularly for the 
Little Tokyo community," Riordan wrote. "However, I have concluded that the 
potential benefits do not justify the costs of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Tommy Li contributed to this report.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: PULLING THE PLUG WON'T COOL OFF TRIAL COVERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America loved its murder trials long before television, devouring news about 
them with an insatiable appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 And, like eager chefs -- more accurately, short-order cooks -- we in the press 
have generously served the country what it wanted, garnishing the fare with 
every sensational trimming. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know whether this historical view will be of any help to Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito as he decides whether to carry out his threats to cool 
down coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial by banning TV cameras from the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 I doubt it. Ito seems harried, having been suddenly thrust into the media maw, 
transformed from an obscure but respected jurist to the object of Howard 
Stern's jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito was certainly impatient this week when he yanked the Los Angeles Daily 
News' courtroom press pass because the paper obtained and published the jury 
questionnaire a day before the judge released it. Elevating this bit of 
journalistic enterprise to the level of the Pentagon Papers, Judge Ito said he 
considered the paper's possession of the questionnaire a felony theft of a 
court document. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's really making Ito mad is television. News leaks infuriate him. So 
have television stations that broadcast pictures of jurors. The judge blew up 
after KNBC's erroneous report about blood tests on a sock. Ever since that 
incident, Ito has been considering banning live television coverage of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to give the judge some advice: It wouldn't do any good. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Newspaper and radio reporters swarmed over the great trials of the 
pre-television era. City editors screamed at their reporters for exclusives for 
the many extra editions the papers used to put out during big trials. A 
reporter who bothered one of those old-time city editors with questions of good 
taste or ethical practice would have been fired on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Since early in the century, cameramen were allowed in the courtroom and 
everyone knew they were there. They lighted their shots with flash powder that 
sounded and smelled like a small explosive charge. In the '20s, the electronic 
media became just as visible. Radio broadcast the Scopes "Monkey Trial" of a 
Tennessee teacher charged with violating the state's law against teaching 
evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 So out of control was the press during the 1937 trial of Bruno Hauptmann for 
the kidnaping and murder of the Lindbergh baby that judges and lawyers agreed 
to kick cameras and radio out of the courtroom, a ban that didn't begin to lift 
until the '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 The definitive trial, as far as outrageous news coverage, occurred when 
television was an infant. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1955, Dr. Samuel Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath, was tried and convicted 
of the murder of his pregnant wife, Marilyn. Sheppard said he was innocent and 
that the murder was done by a "form" with whom he struggled before being 
knocked unconscious. We know the "form" as the "one-armed man," the villain of 
the movie and television series "The Fugitive, " inspired by the Sheppard 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court overturned the verdict because of "massive, pervasive and 
prejudicial publicity." Sheppard was acquitted in a second trial in 1966. The 
lawyer who represented him before the Supreme Court and in the second trial was 
F. Lee Bailey, today a member of the Simpson defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Justice Tom Clark several pages of the Supreme Court decision to 
detail all the abuses committed by the media. But for the most part, it was the 
newspapers, not television, that he criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quit Stalling, Bring Him In," was the headline over one editorial. "Doctor 
Balks at Lie Test," proclaimed a headline. While the jury was being selected, a 
two-inch headline asked "But Who Will Speak for Marilyn?" A leak resulted in a 
story saying "The prosecution has a bombshell witness on tap who will testify 
to Dr. Sam's display of fiery temper." Walter Winchell reported during the 
trial that a woman under arrest for robbery in New York City had been 
Sheppard's mistress and mother of his child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I know a lot of people think the Simpson trial is soap opera trash and 
shouldn't be televised. A thousand of columnist Mike Royko's readers sent Judge 
Ito letters to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them probably watch the trial like mad anyway. They can't get enough 
of it. They're the kind of people who claim to watch PBS while never missing 
Oprah or an episode of "Days of Our Lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Their hypocrisy aside, I hope Judge Ito doesn't follow their advice. That's 
because of Los Angeles' experience with another trial, this one from our recent 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trial of the police officers accused of beating Rodney G. King, 
held in Los Angeles federal court, was not televised. Nevertheless, it turned 
into a dangerous media circus. 
</P>
<P>
 With cameras banned from the courtroom, news came from defense attorneys who 
briefed the press in unruly news conferences outside the Edward R. Roybal 
Federal Building. Sometimes a few of the lawyers tried to be straight, but 
mostly the attorneys feverishly pitched their versions of what happened in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Print and broadcast reporters in the courtroom came out with reports trying to 
give both sides of the story, but on the news, the pictures were of lawyers 
giving their accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, the memory of the 1992 riots vivid, was tense through the trial. 
Second-hand accounts of the courtroom proceedings heated up the atmosphere even 
more. Live coverage might have countered this, focusing attention on the 
testimony and evidence rather than on the lawyers' often superheated rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito, don't pull the plug.

WRECKERS BEGIN ERASING PAINFUL REMINDER OF QUAKE; RECOVERY: LONG-DELAYED 
DEMOLITION OF NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS COMPLEX, WHERE 16 DIED IN COLLAPSE, IS 
EXPECTED TO TAKE A MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers set out Wednesday to finish the job nature started nine months ago, as 
wrecking crews commenced demolition of the Northridge Meadows apartment 
complex, the most searing symbol of human loss in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., a steel-jawed excavator rumbled onto the north end of the Reseda 
Boulevard complex, chewing through stucco, wood and glass and laying bare rooms 
and hallways once inhabited by college students, young couples, families and 
the elderly. Light flooded into long-darkened rooms, revealing remnants of 
everyday life at the apartment complex where 16 tenants died when the top two 
stories of the building collapsed onto the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Posters of rock groups were still tacked up on walls. A second-floor bathroom 
was ripped open, exposing the shower stall and toilet. Near a brown door marked 
Apt. 303, a single hanger swung inside what was once a hall closet before heavy 
equipment tore it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," Northridge Meadows survivor Susan Pearson of Temecula said, when 
told of the long-postponed demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in evidence Wednesday were the stray cats reported by worried 
residents to be living in the collapsed structure. Concern over the safety of 
the cats was one cause of the delay in demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials said that traps set around the complex over the past 
few days produced a couple of opossums and fewer than 10 feral felines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few, substantially less than we had been led to believe," 
said George Weissman, district supervisor at the West Valley Animal Care and 
Control Center. If any cats remain inside, "as the vibrations (from demolition 
work) over the days get a little closer, they'll know to leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's morning downpour drenched the dilapidated remains of the complex, 
once a placid suburban haven with 164 units, a swimming pool, putting green and 
Jacuzzi. But wrecking company representatives said wet weather could be helpful 
during the monthlong demolition by suppressing dust that may contain traces of 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light rain would be perfect for this operation," said Lawrence E. Grauman 
of Cleveland Wrecking Co., which was awarded the $282,000 contract by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Few onlookers stopped to watch the first day of demolition, in contrast to the 
curious crowds that gathered for months after the quake to look, snap photos 
and buy T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were eventually allowed quick dashes inside for small items, but 
larger possessions -- furniture and appliances -- were left behind. "They 
wouldn't let us get our stuff out -- just clothes, photos and small things," 
said Pearson, 30. The tear-down was postponed this year by court order to give 
investigators time to sift through the rubble for evidence that building flaws 
may have been partially to blame for the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 relatives, heirs and neighbors of those who perished have joined in 
seven wrongful-death lawsuits alleging negligence by the apartment owners, 
Shashikant and Renuka Jogani. A handful of attorneys involved in the case were 
on hand to observe the demolition. A trial is scheduled for March.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; FAIR ATTENDANCE 
DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM LAST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attendance at the 67th Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona, which ended its run 
last weekend, dipped slightly this year, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1,365,631 guests visited the fair over 24 days from Sept. 9 through 
last Sunday -- 36,245 fewer than in 1993. The record of 1,612,097 was set in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil O'Dwyer, the Fair Assn.'s vice president of administration and racing, 
said the 1994 fair was the safest in many years.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had our usual share of incidents, but they were minor," he said. 
"Everybody, including our own employees, has shown a greater awareness and 
concern for safety-related issues.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; ALLRED 
LOSES SUIT AGAINST L.A. IN HER FATHER'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feminist attorney Gloria Allred lost a personal battle Wednesday when a Santa 
Monica jury ruled against her lawsuit alleging that incompetence by Los Angeles 
paramedics led to the death of her father, Morris Bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury voted 10 to 2 in favor of the paramedics after 2 1/2 hours of 
deliberation after a three-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it (the suit) was frivolous," said Deputy City Atty. Bob 
Pulone. "I firmly believe if Ms. Allred had known then what she does now" she 
would not have filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred had alleged that paramedics were negligent when transporting her 
father, 89, from his Pacific Palisades home on Nov. 17, 1991. The suit said 
paramedics left Bloom on a gurney in front of the home, failing to notice 
eating and breathing tubes in his stomach and throat. 
</P>
<P>
 He died 18 days later in Santa Monica Hospital, which was also named in the 
suit. Allred had sought unspecified damages from the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred's attorney, Richard L. Knickerbocker, said he is considering an appeal.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; KING TO 
GET MOST OF HIS $3.9 MILLION IN LUMP SUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodney G. King will receive most of his nearly $3.9 million settlement from 
the city of Los Angeles for his 1991 beating by police in one direct payment, 
rather than in a previously negotiated settlement that would have placed the 
funds directly into an annuity, the City Council agreed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 King's attorney, Steven Lerman, said King prefers direct payment so that he 
can invest the money on his own.Most of the money will still go into annuities, 
but ones that will provide more flexibility and liquidity, Lerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no trip around the world planned," Lerman said. "Mr. King has to pay 
a quarter-million dollars in medical bills. The rest he is just investing to 
plan for his future and his family's future." 
</P>
<P>
 Lerman declined to say how much he and other lawyers who represented King will 
receive. But he said that lawyers fees in such cases are typically one-third of 
a settlement amount, and that King's fees will be "fairly typical." 
</P>
<P>
 The council's action withheld nearly $253,000 of King's settlement until the 
courts decide whether King must reimburse the Los Angeles Unified School 
District for its legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 King sued the district, charging that its officers at the scene did nothing to 
stop his beating. But the school district was dismissed as a defendant and U.S. 
District Judge John G. Davies subsequently awarded attorneys fees to the 
district. Lerman has appealed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU; OFFICIALS 
SEEKING RELATIVES OF BOY, 17, SLAIN AT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old boy who was stabbed to death at a Malibu beach Tuesday morning 
has been identified as Abel Silva of Jalisco, Mexico. Sheriff's officials said 
Wednesday they were releasing his name because they have been unable to locate 
any relatives and hope that someone will now come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who officials said had been either visiting or seeking work in the 
United States, was attacked by six men at approximately 12:10 a.m. as he sat 
with a friend at Topanga State Beach. He died about half an hour later at Santa 
Monica Hospital, sheriff's deputies said. The unidentified companion was not 
harmed. Investigators said they have not established a motive. Anyone with 
information is asked to call the Sheriff's Department at (213) 890-5500.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; CITY 
CASHIER ACCUSED OF STEALING $150,000 IN FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cashier in the Long Beach Planning and Building Department was arrested 
Wednesday and charged with stealing more than $150,000 in city funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Alicia Valdez, 37, a resident of Bellflower, was being held in lieu of 
$205,000 bail.Long Beach police investigators said that Valdez, who has worked 
for the city for seven years, handled cash payments for building permits and 
other fees as part of her job. A co-worker discovered the theft in August and 
reported it to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges of embezzlement and grand theft were filed against Valdez in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court by the district attorney's major fraud detail. 
</P>
<P>
 A city spokeswoman said that the city's insurance is expect to cover all but 
about $10,000 of the losses.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
CUTS OFF OVERTIME TO TOP DWP OFFICIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council moved Wednesday to prevent any more top managers at the 
Department of Water and Power from claiming overtime, which has permitted top 
bureaucrats to receive massive severance checks when they left office. 
</P>
<P>
 The council decided to cut off overtime payments after DWP General Manager Dan 
Waters cashed in a total of $75,000 in accumulated overtime when he left office 
in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters had been ineligible to receive the payments as the DWP's top official, 
but he accepted a demotion to assistant general manager on his last day, 
allowing him to receive the funds. The council action would prevent both DWP 
general managers and assistant general managers from receiving overtime pay.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; 2 TEEN-AGERS 
GET PROBATION FOR CRIMES DURING RIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Altadena teen-agers, previously accused of a 1992 riot-related murder, 
this week were given five years' probation on related charges. O'Dell Whitley 
Jr., 19, and Leonard Hampton, 18, were sentenced in Pasadena Superior Court for 
commercial burglary of an Arcadia sporting goods store and attempted robbery of 
a pedestrian. 
</P>
<P>
 The two originally were charged with a series of crimes that included the 
stabbing death of Lucy Maronian, 52, in her Altadena home. The crimes occurred 
May 1, 1992, during riots that followed not guilty verdicts for four Los 
Angeles police officers accused of beating motorist Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitley and Hampton were found guilty in April, 1993, of the lesser crimes. 
But a mistrial was declared on the murder charge when only four of 12 jurors 
voted for conviction. The district attorney decided Sept. 6 this year not to 
retry the two for murder.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ELECTION ORDERED TO 
RESOLVE LONG BEACH COUNCIL RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has ordered a special election in Long Beach to resolve 
a seesaw City Council race in which the apparent loser emerged with a two-vote 
victory in June after several uncounted ballots were discovered during a 
recount. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Donelon, a contractor who was declared the winner, will step down, 
leaving the seat vacant until the special election determines whether he or 
community activist Tonia Reyes Uranga should represent the city's 7th Council 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will decide Tuesday on the election date, which by law must 
be in late January or early February, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time that an election has been voided in the city, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly a victory, not just for me but for the voters," said 
Uranga, who filed the lawsuit challenging the outcome. "This was a fight for 
truth in the election process." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the agreement, Long Beach officials acknowledged that the city 
clerk's office made errors on election night, including mistakenly allowing 
some improper votes to be tallied, said Assistant City Atty. Robert E. Shannon. 
Therefore, he said, the city will pay the candidates' legal fees as well as the 
expense of a special election, expected to be about $65,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we're being forced to have a new election is ludicrous," 
Donelon said. "The election process, both on the state and local levels, is so 
flawed that it's easy for improper votes to be counted. I feel I won the 
election, but illegal votes were cast by unknowing people." 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga, former president of the Long Beach Children's Museum, had seemed the 
victor by a 29-vote margin on election night. But her lead was wiped out during 
a June 22 recount, when previously uncounted ballots were found. 
</P>
<P>
 Uranga challenged Donelon's narrow victory in court, contending among other 
things that ballots were improperly tallied and improper votes accepted. The 
case went to trial last week, but Superior Court Judge Judith C. Chirlin halted 
proceedings Thursday to allow attorneys and the city to try to work out an 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Chirlin accepted the agreement to schedule a special election. 
The Long Beach City Council had voted unanimously in closed session Friday to 
support the new election. JOHN POPE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ESTATE 
OWNER ORDERED TO EVICT HIS 800 OSTRICHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Siding with ruffled neighbors, a Los Angeles zoning panel this week ordered 
the owner of a seven-acre Chatsworth estate to get rid of his 800 or so 
ostriches and emus, calling the big, flightless fowl a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Zoning Appeals ruling was a victory for about 30 neighbors in 
Monteria Estates who had complained about odors, dust and airborne feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smell is there and it comes from one source: 800 animals urinating and 
defecating," longtime neighbor Warren Berlinger told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 The board took the unusual step of ignoring a recommendation by a zoning 
administrator to merely limit to 195 the number of ostriches -- the largest and 
strongest birds in the world -- and emus, a similar but slightly smaller 
Australian creature. 
</P>
<P>
 Jay S. Bulmash, attorney for the estate's owner, David Mohilef, said he plans 
to appeal.

SLAIN MAN WAS PROMINENT GAY ACTIVIST; CRIME: JON A. SIMMONS, WHO WAS FOUND SHOT 
TO DEATH LAST WEEKEND IN BEVERLY HILLS, WAS A FORMER ADVISER TO CHICAGO'S MAYOR 
ON GAY AND LESBIAN ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chicago man found shot to death in a Beverly Hills alley this week was a 
high-profile gay activist who had worked as Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley's 
liaison to the gay and lesbian community. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills police said they have not determined a motive for the killing of 
Jon A. Simmons, 39, who was found Sunday morning naked and shot in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons' killing shocked the gay community in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 He began working with the mayor's office in 1988, serving as director the 
Commission on Human Rights' Advisory Council on Gay and Lesbian Issues until he 
left to go to law school in 1991. He had taken an active role in seeking 
passage of a human rights ordinance that would protect gays and lesbians from 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon was a dedicated public servant committed to human rights, and a strong 
advocate for the gay and lesbian community," Daley said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gay community suffered a major loss," said Robert Dachis, Simmons' 
longtime friend and attorney. "But it goes beyond that to the whole community 
losing a dedicated public servant and a leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons resigned from the city post to attend the Illinois Institute of 
Technology's Kent Law School, graduating in July. He also had been caring for 
his companion, who died of AIDS in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Simmons had looked forward to his first trip to California as a 
respite from a difficult couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days after he arrived, Simmons' body was found at 7:20 a.m. Sunday in an 
alley between Sierra and Oakhurst drives by a woman out for a walk. Police said 
they believed he had been killed at that location. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Simmons of San Francisco said he and his brother had come to Los Angeles 
for a vacation, and that Jon had planned to leave for Honolulu last Tuesday to 
visit a friend from law school. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, Jon Simmons had left the Century Plaza Hotel with plans to 
meet friends at The Abbey coffeehouse in West Hollywood at 10 p.m., Barry 
Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon called around 11 p.m. to say his friends did not show up and he was going 
to go out for a drink. That was the last time I talked to him," Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jon did not return by Sunday morning, Barry Simmons said he filed a 
missing persons report with Los Angeles police. By that time, Jon Simmons had 
been found slain in Beverly Hills. His burned-out rental car was found later 
that day in El Monte. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities began circulating a bulletin in West Hollywood on Wednesday, 
requesting anyone who saw or had contact with Jon Simmons to contact Beverly 
Hills police at (310) 285-2150. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher John Beckham in Chicago contributed to this story.

2 BROTHERS CHARGED IN HOME EQUITY FRAUD CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EFRAIN HERNANDEZ JR., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two brothers who allegedly conned dozens of Los Angeles homeowners in home 
equity scams were arrested Wednesday on charges that include grand theft and 
fraud, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Barnett, 31, who promoted his business as "one of Southern 
California's largest Christian-owned and operated mortgage companies," and his 
brother, Darryl Barnett, 33, were charged in a 16-count complaint accusing them 
of fraudulently taking advantage of half a dozen unsuspecting homeowners and 
causing some to lose their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Barnett, known as a smooth talker who often quoted the Bible to gain 
peoples' trust, had been the subject of numerous complaints to consumer and law 
enforcement agencies since the late 1980s, but officials had not filed charges 
or warned the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for some of the alleged victims, and documents reviewed by The Times, 
show that Barnett had allegedly defrauded at least 40 people and that about 30 
former clients had sued him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims were unsophisticated in real estate, sometimes elderly, sometimes 
more vulnerable," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Clifford Klein of the major fraud 
division. "The crimes affected their basic housing needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Barnett, of Yorba Linda, formed American First Funding Inc., Funding 
21 Mortgage Corp. and other companies. For a fee, Barnett and his 
representatives offered to help customers find loans for home repairs or catch 
up on mortgage payments. The complaints came from customers who said they were 
fooled into deeding their property to Barnett, or who believed he was investing 
their money but later found out that their money was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett, who has said that he never intended to cheat anyone but was a victim 
of the depressed real estate market, and Darryl Barnett could not be reached 
Wednesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said Timothy Barnett faces eight counts of grand theft, two counts of 
securities fraud, two counts of failure to register securities, two violations 
of the Foreclosure Consultant Act, one violation of the Home Equity Fraud Act 
and one count of issuing a check without sufficient funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Barnett was charged with two counts of grand theft, one count of 
violating the Foreclosure Consultant Act and one count of violating the Home 
Equity Fraud Act, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Timothy Barnett could face up to eight years in state prison. 
Darryl Barnett could face up to six years in prison, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's justice at last," said Eugene L. Trope, a lawyer for one of the 
alleged victims, Betty Young. "Let me tell you, they've hurt a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said Barnett approached her and offered to refinance her mortgage to pay 
for home renovations. She signed for a loan, but laborers recommended by 
Barnett never finished the work, leaving the home uninhabitable. Young and her 
family were forced to move to a rental unit while she struggled to pay the 
mortgage for the house. Eventually, volunteers who heard of Barnett's plight 
helped her build a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank the Lord," Young said after learning of Barnett's arrest. "He won't be 
able to hurt anybody else, hopefully. It's a beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney at the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles said several residents 
who became involved with Timothy Barnett turned to the foundation for help in 
trying to salvage what for many was their life savings.

STUDENT'S APPEAL LACKS IT; PLEA FOR COLLEGE FUNDS IS GREETED BY MORE DISDAIN 
THAN CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The student body president at Whittier College was only hoping to raise some 
cash when he sent out a mass mailing that appeals for help in paying this 
year's tuition. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, 21-year-old JaMarr Brown is raising hackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get a job," sniff classmates. "Get a loan," complain business owners in 
Whittier. "Get a scholarship," grumble college administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown is unapologetic about the donations of $25 and $30 that are arriving 
at his college dorm. Without outsiders' help in meeting his $23,000 tuition and 
room-and-board costs, he said, he is in danger of dropping out. 
</P>
<P>
 "My education is top priority for me. I'll do what I have to do to continue my 
education," said the senior business administration major. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual solicitation has been mailed to friends and acquaintances in his 
hometown of San Diego and to merchants in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being that I am now student body president, I will be unable to work for the 
remainder of the 1994-95 academic year," states the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a result, my financial need has increased to more than $8,000. . . . I am 
asking that you extend a helping hand and make an investment in this college 
student's education and in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown declined to say how much the appeal has raised. But a portion of his 
tuition "is still not covered," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The charity-style solicitation has angered many of the college's 1,300 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he wants to go to a private school, he should cut back his activities and 
get a job," said 21-year-old Ken Persing, a senior social studies major who is 
financing his tuition with a scholarship and with money raised by summer jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Psychology student John Chier, 23, said the student body presidency term ends 
in January. That leaves Brown with plenty of time to hustle up a springtime job 
if he wants to, according to Chier -- who is paying for college with his 
personal savings, coupled with loans and a school grant. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Whittier business owners are irritated by the solicitation. They say 
Brown's appeal is far different from those they often receive from campus 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ridiculous -- it kind of disgusts me personally," said Ivan Schultz, 
owner of Whittier Lumber Co. "We support the college all year long. But I just 
don't buy that kind of request."

 Monte Wicker, a former Whittier mayor and co-owner of Monte's Camera Shop, 
said Brown should seek a student loan. "Money's available -- I give the college 
money. I feel they know better which students need it than I do," Wicker said. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said Brown's mass mailing has embarrassed them. They said 
numerous scholarships, grants and other forms of financial aid are available to 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was wrong for Brown to "go to the same people who are already 
supporting the institution," said Jonathan Meer, executive assistant to the 
college president. 
</P>
<P>
 "What ended up is people thought his letter was sanctioned or approved by the 
college. It wasn't. We've heard from about a dozen people concerned about how 
their names and addresses got out." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the Whittier mailing was arranged by friends in San Diego who 
obtained a membership list from the Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, I found that income from my summer work and assistance from my 
parents wasn't going to be enough," Brown said. "So we talked to our church 
pastor and he said write a letter so he could approach his board for a 
donation." 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by the letter -- which outlined Brown's campus accomplishments and 
his years of work as a volunteer reading tutor in San Diego -- the minister 
suggested he send it to other churches. After that, Brown's father, a shipping 
clerk, mailed copies to his acquaintances and extra copies were mailed out by 
other volunteers at the Reading Is Fundamental program. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said members of the tutorial group had the idea of extending the mass 
mailing to Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got no negative comments from San Diego, whether I got money from people 
there or not," Brown said. "I was surprised that people here reacted as they 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has reacted negatively, however. "JaMarr's basically selling 
himself -- that's what they say to do when you apply for a scholarship," said 
Aurelio Alba, a 21-year-old senior English major. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's mass mailing idea, he hinted, may find mass appeal among students in 
the future.

SPANISH-LANGUAGE CRIME-TIP HOT LINE STARTED; LAW ENFORCEMENT: CORRA LA VOZ WILL 
ALLOW CALLERS TO PROVIDE POLICE WITH INFORMATION ANONYMOUSLY, WITHOUT FEAR OF 
GANG RETALIATION OR DEPORTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Citing the need for improved police access to the eyes and ears of Los 
Angeles' burgeoning Spanish-speaking community, an eclectic coalition of 
community leaders, law enforcement officials, entertainers and media Wednesday 
established a Spanish-language crime-tip hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Corra la Voz (Spread the Word), a subsidiary of the nationwide We Tip hot 
line, is the pilot program for a planned national network that will allow 
people who speak Spanish to provide police with information anonymously. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents who speak only Spanish are afraid that they will suffer 
retaliation from gangs if they tell police what they know, Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina told a gathering at her office. Others believe that 
police will inquire into their immigration status and take action to deport 
them if they try to report crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the program hope that the hot line will ease those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of how you feel about immigration or illegal immigration, no 
innocent person in this county deserves to be treated like a criminal when 
reporting a crime," Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said. "We know crime in these 
communities is going unreported. We are here to help every person in this 
county regardless of their immigration status." 
</P>
<P>
 But some Latino community leaders, though applauding the new service, said it 
needs to be supplemented by more personal contact by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Martha Escuita (D-Huntington Park), who represents a 
predominantly immigrant district, said police are passive in their approach to 
community relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you've got to do is walk the damn precincts and introduce yourself and 
tell them, 'I am Officer So-and-so and I am here to protect you.' That's the 
only way you can reach these neighborhoods," Escuita said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Sherman Block said the uneasy relationship with immigrant communities 
"is a universal concern in law enforcement." He said the Sheriff's Department 
is accepting record numbers of Latino recruits into its academy to address the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti acknowledged that law enforcement has struggled to establish a bond 
of trust with recent immigrants. "There is a basic lack of credibility," he 
said. "But this ( Corra la Voz ) can help in turning that around." 
</P>
<P>
 A first-year budget of $100,000 to hire four Spanish-speaking operators and 
create a small reward fund has been donated by General Telephone, the Gas Co., 
Pacific Bell and the county Department of Public Works. A quarter of We Tips' 
55 operators are now Spanish-speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 A widespread media campaign will publicize Corra la Voz with public service 
announcements on KMEX Channel 34 television, KLVE and KTNQ radio, and in La 
Opinion and Nuestro Tiempo, The Times' Spanish-language publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular hip-hop group A Lighter Shade of Brown will be featured in television 
spots promoting the hot line in English and Spanish. In one ad, over a thumping 
rhythm track, members of the group exhort the audience to "help stop the 
madness. If you see someone getting jacked (robbed) . . . make the call." 
</P>
<P>
 The group also plans to record a song written specifically to promote Corra la 
Voz . 
</P>
<P>
 KMEX promised to give out the hot line number after any news story in which 
police are seeking witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no one in the Hispanic community that will not know of this 
number," said We Tip's Bill Brownell. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is (800) 472-7766 and is available 24 hours.

APPEALS COURT WILL REVIEW CONVICTION OF 'FREEWAY KILLER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court Wednesday agreed to consider whether to overturn the 
death penalty for "Freeway Killer" William Bonin, who was convicted of killing 
14 boys and young men. 
</P>
<P>
 If he loses the appeal and final reviews by the U.S. Supreme Court, Bonin 
could be the next person executed in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other federal appeals have failed for Bonin, who is on Death Row in 
San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in Pasadena took under 
submission an appeal to overturn Bonin's sentence and hold a new penalty 
hearing. A decision could take months. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonin's lawyers argued that the attorney who represented Bonin in the penalty 
phases of his two Southern California trials a decade ago was incompetent and 
had a conflict of interest because he allegedly had a book deal with Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have confidence in our claims," said Emry Allen, the deputy state public 
defender representing Bonin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervising Deputy Atty. Gen. Esteban Hernandez said: "We feel this will 
move along quickly and that we will have an execution next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonin had sex with boys and young men before robbing and killing them, dumping 
their bodies along California freeways in 1979 and 1980. He was convicted of 10 
murders by a Los Angeles jury in 1982 and of four killings by an Orange County 
panel the next year. Former Los Angeles attorney William Charvet represented 
him in both cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Charvet resigned from the State Bar in 1990 during a disciplinary 
investigation unrelated to the Bonin case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonin's new lawyers argue that Charvet was incompetent because he was addicted 
to painkillers at the time, failed to properly investigate and present evidence 
that Bonin had a mental disorder, and that he failed to mount a proper defense 
because of "his contempt for his client" and his monetary interest in a book 
rights agreement he reached with Bonin.

U.S. CUTS OFF FUTURE FUNDING FOR SUBWAY; TUNNELS: NUMEROUS CONSTRUCTION 
PROBLEMS MUST BE ADDRESSED, OFFICIALS SAY. MOVE JEOPARDIZES METRO RAIL 
EXTENSION TO SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, EAST LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal government took the extraordinary step Wednesday of cutting off 
all expected future funding for the Los Angeles subway project until local 
officials demonstrate that they can competently manage the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing to the litany of engineering, construction and inspection problems 
that have emerged, Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton said that 
about $1.6 billion of funding for subway construction will be frozen 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly," Linton said at a Washington news conference, "the quality of 
the work has not met our standards." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement jeopardizes plans for extending the subway to the San 
Fernando Valley and East Los Angeles. But construction of tunnels and stations 
along Wilshire Boulevard and Vermont Avenue will not be affected, because 
funding for the work is already in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials in Los Angeles said that they are moving swiftly to address 
all of the federal government's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said he is 
considering terminating the contractor who is building the problem-plagued 
subway tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard, as well as the agency's inspection 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement from Washington comes as a stinging blow to the contractors 
and officials who are building and administering the multibillion-dollar subway 
project -- the most expensive, per mile, in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has provided the greatest share, nearly 50%, of money 
for the subway. Other funding comes from special sales tax revenue collected in 
Los Angeles County and from the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton ordered the MTA not to resume tunneling in Hollywood, where failure of 
tunnel bracing and surface sinkages have halted excavation, until federal 
officials are assured that the work can be performed safely. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit administrator also delivered to Los Angeles officials the 
long-awaited findings of engineers retained by his agency to review the 
problems in Hollywood. Their report raises more questions about the design, 
construction and supervision of the tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal engineers said that the greatest cause of the sinkages and related 
difficulties was the crushing of wood wedges used for bracing, which Metro Rail 
engineers approved two years ago as substitutes for metal struts. Local 
engineers "incorrectly calculated" the ground forces that the wedges could 
withstand, according to the federal report. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also called for more and better stabilizing of the soil, with 
grout, whenever excavation resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton said he was taking action with the full support of his boss, U.S. 
Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 "These steps," Pena said in a statement, "are meant to deliver a firm message 
that the Clinton Administration believes in the (Los Angeles subway) project, 
supports its continuation, but insists that it be built in a safe and fiscally 
responsible manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal transit agency's confidence in the Los Angeles project has been 
shaken by revelations last year of thin concrete in Downtown tunnels already 
open to passenger service, followed by the structural troubles in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin tunnel concrete, the inadequate grouting of the tunnels in Hollywood 
and the decision by project engineers to authorize the wood bracing instead of 
steel struts were brought to light over the past 14 months by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The management of the Red Line project must make sure quality assurances can 
be fulfilled, and the American public can be confident that safety issues can 
be resolved," Linton said, adding: 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, new technical problems continue to emerge while proposed 
corrective measures remain incomplete or inadequate. After considerable effort 
to correct these difficulties, our patience has been exhausted and I have no 
alternative but to take action." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter Wednesday to the MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. White, 
Linton said: "We perceive there to be inadequate management controls at the 
(MTA) for executing the (subway) project." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has been blocked by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and City 
Councilman Richard Alatorre in his efforts to gain more direct control of rail 
construction, said he would move swiftly to satisfy the federal government's 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at everything, including (changing agency) personnel," White 
said. "All of the options are on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 White also said for the first time publicly that he is examining whether the 
MTA will seek to terminate the construction contractor of the Hollywood 
Boulevard and Vermont Avenue tunnels, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, along with the MTA's 
construction management firm, Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the appropriateness of continuing construction with these 
two firms," White said. "But it isn't a simple matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parsons-Dillingham, a spokesman said: "We stand behind our work. 
Parsons-Dillingham is currently working . . . to (help) expedite FTA 
authorization to resume tunneling." The firm on Tuesday alleged that 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny "concealed" some of the tunnel problems from inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the MTA, pledged "some major 
improvements" as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to pinpoint responsibility for what happened under 
Hollywood Boulevard," Edelman said. "I'm the first to admit that the procedures 
we've had in place have not picked up some of the noncompliance (with contract 
specifications)." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who sits on the 13-member MTA board and controls three other 
appointments, was traveling in Europe and unavailable for comment. Alatorre, 
one of those appointees, said he generally supports the MTA doing "whatever it 
takes" to satisfy the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "I don't want to point fingers. There's enough blame to go 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Subway work already under way along Wilshire Boulevard, at tunnels and 
stations extending to Western Avenue, will not be affected by the cutoff of 
future federal funding. However, extension of the subway from Hollywood over 
Cahuenga Pass to Universal City and the San Fernando Valley is affected by 
Wednesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in jeopardy is funding for extension of the subway from Union Station to 
Indiana Street, in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton and representatives of the MTA said that they had been close to 
reaching an agreement to increase by up to $186 million the federal 
government's participation in the East Los Angeles extension. Talks regarding 
part or all of that money will continue, but Linton said he will sign no 
agreement until he is satisfied that the MTA is doing its job properly. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Rep. Henry A. Waxman, who represents Hollywood and has 
questioned the safety and costs of subway construction, said Wednesday's 
announcement "is a fine first step" toward rectifying the problems in Los 
Angeles. Waxman also said that an engineering assessment performed for the city 
and unveiled this week "confirmed my worst fears about decisions made at every 
level of this project." 
</P>
<P>
 "A comprehensive solution, rather than small measures, will be necessary to 
get to the bottom of the problems that are occurring," Waxman said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz said he urged 
White in a phone call Tuesday night to "act quickly, decisively, to 
re-establish the credibility of the agency." Katz said it is time to dissolve 
the MTA's subsidiary agency, the Rail Construction Corp., and to terminate any 
private contractors or agency officials found responsible for the defective 
work and supervision now at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything short of firing these folks will look like you're not taking the 
kind of action you ought to be taking," Katz said. "You've got to fire the 
people who are screwing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz also urged the immediate firing of Edward McSpedon, who as RCC president 
heads the MTA's rail-construction unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The RCC . . . should have been eliminated a long time ago," Katz said. "It is 
a large reason for the problems we are seeing. . . . They're not accountable. . 
. . The sooner that (rail construction) gets brought under the MTA board, the 
more accountable it is going to become." 
</P>
<P>
 McSpedon said he hopes to remain on the job. "We'll always have problems as 
long as we're trying to do this difficult, difficult work," he said. ". . . I 
think our record of performance and accomplishments will stand up against any 
project of comparable size and magnitude in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, an appointee to the transit 
authority board, said the actions announced Wednesday should spur the MTA to 
overhaul its construction management. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship between the agency, the contractors, and their overseers 
(has) been too cozy. . . . At long last, the (Federal Transit Administration's) 
decisiveness will help protect public safety and the public treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky criticized MTA board members for failing to clean up problems 
themselves. "The board has ignored recommendations from (White) and others to 
create an effective, safe and accountable construction program. This is not 
only unfortunate, but it is shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who sits on the MTA board, called the 
federal response "a body blow to the subway." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal report on Wednesday provided recommendations and some new 
information about the MTA's handling of the problems in Hollywood: 
</P>
<P>
 * Representatives of the federal transit agency were not informed of the 
ground sinkages until Aug. 18 -- or 22 days after project engineers learned 
part of Hollywood Boulevard had fallen four inches. In the future, the report 
said, the MTA should provide quick notifications "to protect the public 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 * The wood wedges should be replaced by steel struts for the remainder of 
tunneling. Concrete or grout material of adequate strength must be placed 
alongside the wedges. 
</P>
<P>
 * The "contact grouting" of soil from within the tunnel must be performed, as 
required originally by the contract but not fully enforced by the MTA. The 
report concluded that portions of the most-distressed tunnels had not been 
grouted. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is "a pattern of increased settlement" at the cross streets of 
Hollywood Boulevard. This "may reflect a structural problem" with the tunnel 
design or construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is a "possible connection" between damage inflicted by the Northridge 
earthquake and the ruptures of pipes along Hollywood Boulevard. An engineering 
assessment prepared for the city of Los Angeles this week concluded that the 
subway tunneling most likely caused the ruptures, which soaked the loose soils 
and contributed to surface sinkages.

U.S. FORCES LIBERATE HAITIAN TOWN HELD HOSTAGE BY FEAR; CARIBBEAN: PRESENCE 
TRANSFORMS FORT LIBERTE. 'IT IS AS IF GOD HAD DESCENDED FROM THE HEAVENS,' 
RESIDENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 U.S. Special Forces swept into this grim town before dawn Wednesday, seizing 
weapons from the Haitian military and quickly arresting key local leaders of 
Haiti's repression. Immediately, Fort Liberte, until now a town ruled by fear, 
was transformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who scarcely two days earlier had spoken in whispers now filled the 
dirt streets outside the yellow army garrison where the American GIs set up 
base, waving creased pictures of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and 
chanting welcomes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is as if God had descended from the heavens," shouted Dimas Deauville, a 
fisherman who has not worked since his union was broken up by the military 
leaders who ousted Aristide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd began gathering in small numbers at sunup, stunned that the 
Americans had really arrived. Within minutes, their number grew to more than 
1,000. They played musical instruments removed from the local school and dared 
the hated attaches , or paramilitary agents, to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops descended on the homes of reputed attaches and other supporters of 
the dictatorship, arresting nine, including a man identified as a former 
ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hours that followed, roving bands of Haitians took justice into their 
own hands, seizing people, binding them with rope and then parading them to the 
army headquarters to be turned over to the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Just two days earlier, the scene in Fort Liberte had been radically different. 
</P>
<P>
 Fort Liberte was a forbidding town, where suspicious Haitians stared nervously 
from their tiny homes built on the ruins of once-grand plantation estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men who most likely belonged to attache ranks congregated in scattered, 
vigilant groups. Bitter Haitian army officers sat on the cracked concrete front 
porch of the garrison, playing dominoes and cursing. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast between Fort Liberte before and after its occupation shows the 
dramatic influence the U.S. military is having in parts of rural northern 
Haiti, where authority based on intimidation and cronyism is shattering. 
</P>
<P>
 The phenomenon has been repeated as U.S. forces spread their control over town 
after town in this miserable, long-exploited region, where few communities 
boast even electricity or running water. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new sense of relief, towns such as Ouanaminthe, Limbe and even Cap 
Haitien are now the daily scenes of the kind of pro-Aristide demonstrations 
that would have landed participants in prison, or worse, just a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fort Liberte, population 6,000, is particularly significant because it has 
long been a bastion of support for the Duvalier dictatorships, their dreaded 
henchmen -- the Tontons Macoutes -- and their successors, the equally dreaded 
attaches . 
</P>
<P>
 In Wednesday's operation, among the first arrested was Pascal Blaise, 
identified by U.S. forces as a prominent leader of FRAPH, a French acronym that 
stands for the paramilitary political party formed to back Haiti's 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns drawn, the U.S. soldiers marched into Blaise's home as several young men 
tried to escape out the back. The troops ordered Blaise, a former mayor and 
head of the high school, and the other men to the ground, handcuffing them and 
carting them off to the army prison. Arrests followed at several other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Monday, Blaise said he was sure that Aristide supporters 
were scheming to destroy the homes and businesses of their enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Aristide supporters) are numerous," he said. "Our people are numerous as 
well. If they come to attack us, we are ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's pre-dawn occupation started with the disarming of the Haitian 
military. Some of their guns were later returned to encourage them to begin 
patrols of the town under new rules. But most of the Haitians were afraid to 
leave the barracks, fearing attack from the crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Percy Golmain, a tall, slender 25-year-old Haitian lieutenant from 
Port-au-Prince who is working with the Americans, implored people to respect 
the men on patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know the Americans have come to work with everybody, not just one side, 
so let us do our job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only with two hands!" the crowd shouted in unison -- a demand that Haitian 
officers not be allowed to carry arms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Special Forces ordered the Haitians not to use batons. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the people of Haiti, the baton is a symbol of brutality," Master Sgt. 
Stan Goeff told two dozen Haitian officers who lined up outside the garrison 
when the GIs arrived. "You will no longer carry them." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd gathered outside the home of Nyll Calixte, director of the university 
law school here and by most accounts one of the most affluent men in town, 
threatening to lynch him. After concluding Calixte was a senior FRAPH leader, 
the military handcuffed him to his French-born wife and loaded them into the 
back of their Humvee. The crowd cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 Around midday, the highest-ranking Haitian military officer in the northeast, 
Col. Estimien Simon, paid a visit to the prisoners, who were being held on the 
dirt patio of the military jail. An argument broke out. The handcuffed 
detainees leaped from the bench where they sat and shouted that their arrests 
were unfair and unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this democracy?" Calixte asked. "Release us!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of humiliation we've experienced today I will never forget!" cried 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon listened and shook his head. Speaking to a reporter, he bitterly 
complained that the arrests were illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several months, it was the Aristide supporters who were being 
arrested, beaten and jailed, townspeople said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those was Alfred Joseph, a 27-year-old mechanic. On Monday, Joseph had 
sat in a dark office, recounting quietly to two reporters his arrest and 
beating last week at the hands of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Joseph was one of the first outside the newly occupied military 
garrison. As the crowd cheered, Joseph planted an Aristide flyer on a pole in 
clear view of the Haitian soldiers and challenged them to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day when I talked to you, I had a great amount of fear in my 
heart," he said Wednesday. "Now I am fine because I can post one of these 
(flyers) wherever I want."

OFFICIALS URGE SHAKE-UP, MORE CONTROL OF MTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Local officials demanded a major shake-up of the transportation agency's 
construction arm Wednesday, expressing outrage that the subway -- intended to 
be the crown jewel in the county's transportation network -- has instead become 
an embarrassment plagued with construction defects. 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that the Federal Transit Administration was withholding funds 
for subway tunneling, officials raised their voices in an increasingly critical 
chorus, asking for greater accountability from the county's transportation 
agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal action presented the Metropolitan Transit Authority with "an 
opportunity to finally set the MTA's construction apparatus in order," said Los 
Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who is an MTA board member. "It is 
frustrating and infuriating that the MTA board of directors, made up of elected 
officials from throughout the county, has missed opportunity after opportunity 
to clean up its own act." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing that sentiment, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke 
said the MTA needs to consider the "whole reorganization of our construction 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, MTA officials announced that stretches of subway tunnel had 
not been built to contract specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials in Washington on Wednesday halted the flow of federal 
dollars to construct Los Angeles' first modern subway until it is clear that 
the project is being safely built with sufficient supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and local business people said Wednesday that they were concerned 
that the federal actions would mean increased delays in construction -- a blow 
to their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jacobs, president of the Universal City-North Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce, said local businesses are anxious for the Red Line subway to be 
completed on time in 1998. Construction has begun on the North Hollywood 
station, which is the linchpin in redevelopment plans for the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's an extended delay, it'll hurt the Valley's transportation . . . it'll 
hurt business," said Jacobs, who owns an office supply store. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local officials, however, said the drastic measure of withholding funds 
demanded dramatic changes immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz, chairman of the Assembly Transportation Committee, 
called for the immediate firing of the private contractors involved in the 
subway construction. He also asked for the elimination of the Rail Construction 
Corp., the semi-independent arm of the MTA, with its own board of political 
appointees, that oversees rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to disband the RCC has long divided the MTA board, but has been 
supported by the MTA's chief executive officer, Franklin E. White. It is now 
expected to gain increased political momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 The RCC and its proponents have long argued that as specialists, they can best 
oversee construction of complicated projects like the subway. Critics, however, 
counter by citing the RCC's track record and the recent disclosures of 
construction defects, including the discovery that the subway tunnel walls were 
built with less concrete than specified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope this is the final nail in the coffin for the RCC," Katz said. "The RCC 
has been out there like rogue operators. . . . Their arrogance and their focus 
on speed over quality has led to the problem we're seeing." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said she hoped the federal agency's action would "open up the eyes to 
some of those members who want to continue the RCC." 
</P>
<P>
 The federal action, she said, "might get us to really develop an effective 
strategic plan of how we're going to be held accountable for construction." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman and MTA board member Richard Alatorre said the cutoff of funds 
is not a major blow to the project. "I think it is a wake-up call by the 
federal government that we have to get our act together," Alatorre said. "They 
need to have a sense of confidence in our oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members contacted Wednesday by The Times said they were not 
prepared to dissolve the RCC. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is go forward by convincing Washington this is a temporary 
situation only," said MTA Vice Chairman Larry Zarian. "We need to start looking 
at the whole structure." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the agency needs to take drastic steps to rebuild confidence but that 
he was not ready to specify a course of action. 
</P>
<P>
 For others, the latest round of bad news meant an opportunity to promote an 
alternative to the underground trains. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor and MTA board member Mike Antonovich, who has long promoted 
the idea of a San Fernando Valley monorail, said the federal action "allows the 
public to voice their opposition to further expansion of the subway. We don't 
need to have sinking homes and cost overruns." 
</P>
<P>
 With Mayor Richard Riordan vacationing this week in Europe, Deputy Mayor for 
Transportation Rae James asked MTA Chairman Ed Edelman to call an emergency 
meeting of the MTA board to discuss the federal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to develop solutions to these management and construction issues as 
quickly as possible, put this behind us, and get our transportation plans back 
on track," James said.

MAN JAILED AT TIME CLEARED OF SETTING LAGUNA FIRESTORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Admitting they were duped by a bogus confession, Orange County prosecutors 
dismissed charges Wednesday against the man accused of setting last year's 
destructive Laguna Beach fire -- charges that some fire officials said were 
filed hastily when details about the prime suspect began surfacing in the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the suddenness of the inquiry and questions from you guys (in the 
media) put some pressure on the D.A. to file," said Fullerton Fire Chief Marc 
Martin, who was among those flanking Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi when the 
charges were announced Friday. Martin described that news conference as "put 
together hastily." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Fullerton Fire Marshal John Clark, whose firefighters captured Jose Soto 
Martinez at the scene of a Fullerton fire: "There was lots of pressure to put 
the story out because of the rumors that he was involved in the Laguna fire." 
Clark said he was informed of the Friday news conference about three hours 
before it began. Martinez is still in jail on charges that he set three small 
Fullerton fires. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Capizzi acknowledged that the media played a part in 
determining the timing of the filing, but said the decision was not made in 
haste. "It had been a matter that had been investigated for two weeks. The fact 
that on Thursday members of the media became aware of it meant that it was no 
longer possible to do any confidential investigating." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the evidence was "quite strong, and there was no reason to 
delay." He said the decision to proceed with charges immediately after the 
first newspaper reports was a "consensus" decision of the agencies involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Public defender Ronald Y. Butler, whose office is representing Martinez, said 
that the wrong person occasionally gets accused of a crime when prosecutors 
"rush to judgment" and don't do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens every day that innocent people are arrested," Butler said. "But it 
never rises to the level of a press conference being called to announce that 
someone is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator involved in the case said that the district attorney's office 
was cautioned against filing the charges prematurely by one county official, 
and that there were suggestions that authorities should simply announce that 
Martinez had been jailed on suspicion of setting the Fullerton fires and had 
confessed to the Laguna fire. That way, authorities could have asked the 
public's help in verifying Martinez's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after Martinez was accused of the Laguna fires, information surfaced 
that he was five months into a 14-month stint in a Mexican prison when the 
October, 1993, firestorm occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Having confirmed his alibi with Mexican authorities, the district attorney's 
office filed a motion in South County Municipal Court on Wednesday to dismiss 
the charges involving the Laguna Beach fire, and to transfer the remaining 
charges on the Fullerton fires back to North County court. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion also included an extraordinary five-page declaration explaining the 
prosecutors' move and defending their original decision to charge Martinez with 
the fire, which destroyed or damaged 441 homes or businesses, causing $528 
million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The document stated that "although Martinez admitted setting this (Laguna 
Beach) blaze several times, he did so with some hesitancy, leading 
investigators to believe he was telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael L. Fell, who handled the case and made the motion 
in court Wednesday to drop the Laguna arson charge, said, "The information 
given to investigators was very concise. The information, drawings, statements, 
tenor and repeated consistency of his stories led us to believe that we 
actually had the suspect who started the Laguna Beach fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Fell said that on Sept. 19, Martinez guided Fullerton investigators -- who did 
not know where the fire started -- to within 10 feet of its point of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the document filed in court, Martinez then proceeded to re-enact 
how he had set the fire, and "correctly indicated the device (used to start the 
fire), weather conditions and direction of the fire, once set." 
</P>
<P>
 Peering into the television cameras that lined the courtroom's jury box, Fell 
stressed that "at no time from Sept. 16 until (his Monday arraignment) did the 
defendant ever deny that . . . he started that fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did the defendant ever say he had an alibi or that he was in a 
Mexican prison. The defendant never said that he had family in the States; his 
contention was that his family was all in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's mother has said, however, that her obviously disturbed son 
confessed to the fire because he felt safe behind bars and feared that Mexican 
mobsters were out to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 South Court Municipal Judge Arthur G. Koelle granted Fell's motions, and also 
teased him for launching into an explanation of why the motion should be 
granted after the action had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, Mr. Fell, you really didn't have to give a closing argument -- you 
had already won the point," the judge said, and both men laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Laguna charge was dismissed, Martinez faced up to 30 years in 
prison because he was charged with four felony counts and had a previous 
serious felony conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Martinez now faces a prison term of 19 years and 8 months, 
although the overwhelming majority of those convicted over the past five years 
on such charges have been punished with less than a year in jail and three 
years or less probation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's court hearing, Fell defended the district attorney's 
office's handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you frankly, that's what we're here for," Fell said. "It is just as 
much our responsibility to dismiss charges against an innocent person as it is 
to prosecute a guilty person. That's exactly what we did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fell declined to answer questions about the other, unexplained evidence 
prosecutors cited in defending their decision to charge Martinez. "We don't 
want to get into specifics at this time. Our policy is that there still is 
someone out there who did this." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Laguna charges were dismissed, Teresa Campos, Martinez's mother, 
said, "I had a lot of faith that (a conviction) couldn't happen because of all 
the proof we had. . . . I knew he was innocent. And, now I feel very contented, 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, 50, said she was not angry at the Orange County district attorney's 
office for filing the Laguna arson charges against her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. No, I don't feel anger," said Campos, who attended the court hearing with 
other family members. "I knew that he had a problem. He has this (mental) 
problem. But I knew that the system here, given proof that he was somewhere 
else . . . that he would be found not guilty."

ITO REJECTS DEFENSE BID TO BAR SEIZED EVIDENCE; SIMPSON CASE: RULING DEFEATS 
EFFORTS TO EXCLUDE ITEMS FROM DEFENDANT'S ESTATE, INCLUDING GLOVE, BLOODSTAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Returning to the volatile issues of police credibility and the lawfulness of 
searches, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito ruled Wednesday that new questions 
about whether officers lied on the stand during O.J. Simpson's preliminary 
hearing cannot be used to suppress evidence they seized. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also upheld the right of investigators to test blood found at Simpson's 
estate, rejecting an unusual defense argument that police should have secured a 
separate warrant to justify those tests because they can reveal private 
information about the person from whom the blood was drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito called that argument by Simpson attorney Gerald F. Uelmen "rather 
interesting and novel," but said he could find no case law to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 The rulings Wednesday struck down the latest efforts by Simpson's lawyers to 
exclude a number of potentially significant items from evidence -- including a 
bloody glove found outside Simpson's house and blood recovered from his 
driveway. Although Ito's rulings do not guarantee that any of those items will 
be introduced as evidence, they remove obstacles for prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The search that yielded the bloody glove has been contested on several 
grounds, each time unsuccessfully, and Simpson's lawyers are still moving on 
one last front, hoping to show that they should be allowed to renew their 
objections to that search based on allegations that Detective Mark Fuhrman is a 
racist. For months, Simpson's lawyers have waged an aggressive attack on 
Fuhrman's credibility and have suggested that he might have planted the glove 
outside Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Simpson's attorneys renewed their campaign against Fuhrman, 
arguing that they had only learned many of the specifics of the detective's 
alleged racism after the preliminary hearing was over. Because of that, they 
asked Ito to let them reopen the argument about the initial search of Simpson's 
estate, during which Fuhrman said he found the bloody glove on a walkway at the 
back of Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sworn declaration obtained by The Times, a lawyer who alerted Simpson's 
defense team to allegations about Fuhrman said he delivered a copy of a pension 
file involving the detective July 15, after the preliminary hearing ended. In 
that file, Fuhrman is quoted making racially inflammatory remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by lawyer Robert Deutsch could help corroborate Simpson 
attorneys' contention that they became aware of new details about Fuhrman after 
the preliminary hearing ended, even though the file was in the public record 
and Deutsch said his initial contact with defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro's 
office was July 5, while the hearing was under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito deferred a ruling on reopening the issue of the search based on questions 
about Fuhrman's credibility. He is expected to return to it in the coming week, 
however, because he is trying to resolve the lingering evidentiary issues 
before jury selection resumes Oct. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ito rejected the latest defense attempts to discredit the 
officers who searched Simpson's estate after the discovery of the bodies of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders, and his attorneys 
maintain that he is the victim of sloppy and overzealous investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Wednesday, defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen said that recently 
obtained transcripts from a private security company raise questions about the 
truthfulness of sworn testimony by some officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen read transcripts of calls between Westec Security officials and LAPD 
officers in which the dispatcher from the private Westec firm said officers 
were at Simpson's front door and about to force entry when they first called to 
see whether he was home. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the transcripts that Uelmen read, a Westec patrol officer 
informed a dispatcher at 5:23 a.m. on June 13 that police officers were "at the 
front door, and they are requesting entrance." 
</P>
<P>
 One minute later, that dispatcher, in a conversation with an LAPD sergeant at 
the West Los Angeles station, said: "I am going to call the residence right now 
to see if anyone is there because my patrol officer said you guys are there at 
his front door." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. David Rossi of the LAPD responded: "Yeah, we are." 
</P>
<P>
 If true, that could contradict testimony that the police only entered the 
property after first trying to reach Simpson over the phone. During the 
preliminary hearing, officers said they had repeatedly tried to telephone 
Simpson from outside the estate but had only reached an answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives testified that they finally decided to jump the wall after 
seeing a small red stain -- it later turned out to be blood -- on the door 
handle of Simpson's Ford Bronco and after learning through Westec that Simpson 
had a live-in maid. Those discoveries raised their fears that additional 
victims could be inside the estate, the detectives testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers have disputed those statements, maintaining that the officers 
jumped Simpson's fence to engage in an illegal search of the property. Citing 
the transcripts that he read in court Wednesday, Uelmen accused the LAPD 
officers of presenting a "well-orchestrated tissue of lies." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark responded by saying that the transcripts were 
unclear and that neither the Westec dispatcher nor the LAPD sergeant was at the 
scene. Moreover, she maintained that the officers could have been referring to 
the front gate when the officers said they were at the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Clark noted that the Simpson team could have raised the issue 
earlier and neglected to, making it improper for them to do so now. Under 
California law, attorneys must choose whether to try to suppress evidence 
either in Municipal Court or Superior Court but may not do so in both places 
unless new facts emerge that were unavailable to them during the earlier 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 During the preliminary hearing, several officers testified about cellular 
phone calls between the detectives and Westec. The defense did not act on that 
information at that time, however, and only raised it recently because 
Simpson's lawyers obtained the transcripts after prosecutors secured them 
through a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark disputed the defense's rationale for failing to act sooner. She said 
defense lawyers knew from the preliminary hearing that officers were 
communicating with Westec via cellular phone. "They did nothing about it," 
Clark said. "They had the opportunity and they failed to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Without addressing the question of whether he believed the transcripts raised 
new doubts about the detectives' credibility, Ito agreed that defense attorneys 
had missed their chance to raise those points. 
</P>
<P>
 That ended that defense challenge, but Simpson's lawyers moved simultaneously 
to contest an array of other searches. One involved the seizure of a pair of 
Simpson's shoes June 13, and that too was challenged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the objection to that seizure was based on vague language in a 
property report, attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. used his questions about the 
shoes to raise other issues about the search. Breaking frequently to consult 
with an animated Simpson, Cochran asked LAPD Detective Tom Lange whether the 
detective had seen a large amount of money in Simpson's closet at the same time 
he took the shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange, who said Simpson was with him with he took the shoes, said he had not 
seen any money. Cochran did not pursue that line of questioning, and Ito ruled 
that the shoes had been properly seized. 
</P>
<P>
 As Wednesday's hearing continued, Simpson's lawyers pressed ahead with their 
efforts to force the exclusion of certain other items of evidence, most notably 
papers, fibers, debris and bloodstains recovered from Simpson's car when it was 
repeatedly searched at a police garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty with those searches is that an employee of the towing company 
broke into the Bronco while it was being held and stole receipts from it. That 
threatens the chain of custody that protects evidence from being contaminated, 
and Uelmen painstakingly questioned the towing service manager about gaps in 
the supervision of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager, Robert B. Jones, conceded that one of his employees had 
apparently broken into the car, but denied that detectives had failed to place 
the vehicle under an "investigative hold." Simpson's lawyers hope to establish 
that the LAPD lifted that hold while the car was in the garage. If so, that 
would strengthen their argument that police have badly bungled the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, however, countered that the Police Department had maintained its hold 
over the car throughout, and that the break-in did not compromise any of the 
evidence seized. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense's courtroom efforts drew a skeptical comment from one of Nicole 
Brown Simpson's sisters who has regularly attended the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking briefly to reporters Wednesday, Denise Brown questioned why defense 
attorneys are contesting evidence if Simpson has nothing to hide. "If O.J. is 
so innocent, why are (his defense lawyers) trying to suppress all the 
evidence?" 
</P>
<P>
 As the debates over evidence continue, both sides are gearing up for an 
extensive court hearing on the admissibility of DNA tests that are being 
conducted on blood samples from the murder scene, as well as Simpson's home and 
car. Late Wednesday, the defense filed a motion that challenges the 
admissibility of the DNA tests by asserting that the process is not generally 
accepted in the scientific community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecution seeks to introduce DNA evidence derived from a variety of 
testing methods," says the defense motion, written by DNA specialists Barry C. 
Scheck and Peter J. Neufeld. "Many of these methods are novel: Some have never 
been reviewed for admissibility by an appellate court in California, some have 
never been reviewed by any appellate court anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 That argument has long been predicted and sets the stage for what could be the 
trial's most important debate -- the so-called Kelly-Frye hearing that will 
determine whether DNA results are admitted and, if so, how much statistical 
significance jurors can attach to any findings.

</P>
<P>
 A look at some of the key events in the O.J. Simpson murder trial on 
Wednesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito considered several defense 
efforts to suppress evidence collected from O.J. Simpson's home and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court action: Ito ruled that the defense could not raise a new challenge to 
the detectives' credibility by introducing transcripts of discussions among the 
detectives and a private security company. He also ruled that tests of certain 
blood drops were legal, dealing a setback to defense efforts to have the 
results excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the stand: Detective Tom Lange described seizing a pair of O.J. Simpson's 
shoes after Simpson told him they were the ones he had worn on the night of the 
slayings. Robert B. Jones of Viertel's Automotive Service testified that one of 
his employees admitted to breaking in to Simpson's car after it was seized. 
Receipts with the signatures of O.J. and Nicole Simpson were taken from the 
vehicle, Jones said. Other witnesses also described the towing and safeguarding 
of the Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outside the court: One of Nicole Simpson's sisters, Denise Brown, met with a 
small group of reporters and asked: "If O.J. is so innocent, why are (his 
lawyers) trying to suppress all the evidence?"

CARTILAGE GROWN IN LAB REPAIRS KNEES, STUDY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a remarkable surgical advance that could benefit professional athletes and 
hundreds of thousands of weekend warriors, Swedish researchers report that they 
have been able to repair damaged knees using cartilage tissue grown in the 
laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartilage is the soft tissue that cushions joints, and when it is damaged, the 
trauma sets off a chain reaction of decay and disintegration that ultimately 
leads to the loss of the entire knee joint. More than 190,000 Americans have 
knee joints replaced each year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is currently no effective treatment for cartilage damage, but the 
Swedish scientists report today in the New England Journal of Medicine that 
they have used the lab-grown tissue to treat 23 people, with "good to 
excellent" results in 16 and some improvement in virtually all. 
</P>
<P>
 In several cases, individuals who could not work because of their knee damage 
are not only holding down jobs, but are back on the soccer field and the hockey 
rink as well, said Dr. Lars Peterson of the University of Goteberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said that since the study was completed, the research team has 
performed the procedure on an additional 65 patients with equally good results 
and is in the process of teaching surgeons from the United States how to 
perform it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, this gives us an effective tool with which to treat these 
patients," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is indeed effective, it really does open up another door to treating 
people with knee injuries," said Dr. Ralph Gambardello of the Kerlan-Jobe 
Orthopedic Medical Clinic in Los Angeles, where many athletes are treated. 
"There is no doubt that this is an exciting area of research and that it will 
have significant implications for clinical practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Gambardello cautioned, however, that the results need to be confirmed in a 
controlled trial in which the surgery is compared to a sham operation in which 
an incision is made but the laboratory-grown tissue is not implanted. Such a 
trial is now being organized in Europe and will begin early next year, Peterson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Myron Spector of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston hopes eventually 
to conduct a U.S. trial, which will be necessary before the federal Food and 
Drug Administration can approve the procedure for general use, but he wants to 
see more data about long-term wear in the joints first. Spector said the new 
results were "quite compelling . . . but not yet ready for widespread use." 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly wouldn't mind (heading) one of the groups that participates in 
the trial," said Dr. William Garrett of the Duke University Medical Center. "It 
looks very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartilage lines the inner surfaces of the knee and other joints to minimize 
friction. It is extremely slippery, with only one-fifth the friction of ice 
sliding on ice. In healthy joints, cartilage slowly regenerates as it wears 
out. But it cannot recover from the more severe damage caused by a serious 
athletic injury. "If we leave a hole in it, a year later there is still a 
hole," Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have made many efforts to regenerate cartilage in damaged joints, 
but without success. That may be because the cartilage does not have its own 
blood supply or because something destroys it faster than it can regenerate, 
according to Dr. Henry J. Mankin of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 In one current procedure, a somewhat different form of cartilage can be grown 
at the site of the injury by drilling holes in the bone, which allows cells 
called fibroblasts to migrate from the bone and fill in the injury site. But 
this "pseudocartilage," said Gambardello, is less durable and much rougher than 
original cartilage. This procedure does not restore complete motion and the 
repair is not durable. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson and his colleague, Dr. Anders Lindahl, circumvented this problem by 
removing a small section of cartilage from a spot on the joint that does not 
receive wear. They then grew the cells in a laboratory dish using a variety of 
techniques and growth factors that have recently been developed for growing 
cells outside the body. Within three weeks, they had 10 to 20 times as many 
cells as they started with. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgeons then cleaned all the dead cartilage cells out of the wound, 
covered it with a flap of membrane removed from nearby bone to hold the cells 
in, and injected the cells. The procedure now requires cutting open the knee, 
but the researchers are developing an arthroscopic procedure to minimize 
recovery time. Patients receive a special exercise program to help them 
strengthen their knees. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lindahl and Peterson cut into the repaired knees later to examine the 
cartilage, they found that in most cases it was like the original tissue rather 
than the rough, fragile cartilage produced by conventional procedures. "That's 
very significant," said Gambardello. "If they can get a better surface to form, 
then obviously those patients are going to do better." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries to the knee can occur in either the upper, or thighbone, portion of 
the joint or the lower portion, the kneecap. The procedure worked best in 
patients with damage to the thighbone portion: 14 of 16 patients had good to 
excellent results. In the seven patients with kneecap damage, only two showed 
"good to excellent" results, although five had improved mobility of the joint. 
</P>
<P>
 One of their patients was Henrik Esbjornsson, 24, a professional athlete who 
plays a form of ice hockey called bandy. Seven years ago, he injured the 
cartilage on his thighbone, which caused his knee to be very painful and to 
lock up frequently. Now, he told the Associated Press, "I can use the knee as I 
could before. It's completely OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson noted that the lower success rate with damaged kneecaps was not 
unexpected because kneecaps undergo more stress than the thigh bones. He said 
his team is revising the kneecap procedure in an attempt to make it more 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical trials of the procedure are being supported by BioSurface Technology 
Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., which is developing new ways to grow the cells. If 
the procedure is eventually approved by the FDA, BioSurface would take the 
biopsy specimen from the surgeon, grow the cells in the lab and then return 
them for implantation. A New Knee 
</P>
<P>
 Swedish researchers have developed the first technique to repair damage to 
cartilage, the tissue that cushions joints. 
</P>
<P>
 A) They remove a small slice of cartilage from a non-weight-bearing area of 
the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 B) The cartilage cells are multiplied in the lab to increase their volume at 
least tenfold. 
</P>
<P>
 C) Surgeons clean all the dead tissue from the wound and cover it with a flap 
to hold the cells in. 
</P>
<P>
 D) The cells are then injected into the cavity, where they grow and fill the 
gap, ultimately restoring function.

48 DIE IN CULT MURDER-SUICIDE; SWITZERLAND: FIREFIGHTERS FIND 23 BODIES IN A 
REMOTE FARMHOUSE AND 25 MORE IN THREE ALPS CHALETS. VICTIMS WERE APPARENTLY 
MEMBERS OF A SECT LED BY A FUGITIVE CANADIAN. 
</P>

<P>
 Volunteer firefighters responding to a farmhouse fire in this tiny village 
early Wednesday uncovered an underground chapel and the robe-clad bodies of 23 
people, members of an obscure cult joined in an apparent murder-suicide by 25 
other adherents in three chalets 100 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48 grisly deaths were caused variously by suffocation, gunshots and 
perhaps drug overdoses, police said. The victims included French, Swiss and 
Canadian citizens, ranging in age from 10 to 73. Some died with their hands 
clasped in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe the deaths may be connected to similar deaths in Canada on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cheiry, 19 of the victims were found in one 30-yard-long room hidden 
beneath a secret door under a carpet in the garage. On the wall was a drawing 
of a bearded man, a "Jesus Christ-like figure," as one official described it, 
wearing a cape and carrying a rose. 
</P>
<P>
 On a makeshift altar were the French words for "the cross and rose," which 
authorities believe is the name of a doomsday sect based in the Canadian 
province of Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if we were entering a wax museum," said Andre Piller, the Swiss 
prosecutor investigating the massacre here. "Everything was peaceful, and the 
people looked passive. It was very horrifying." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the victims here had been shot once or twice in the head, and 10 had 
plastic bags cinched over their heads as well. Police said they found 52 
casings at the scene from a .22-caliber rifle. The victims were lying on their 
backs in a circle. Most were wearing what the police said were ritual robes of 
white and red, white reportedly being the lowest rank in the order. One man, 
whom police described as a "grand master" of the sect, wore a black robe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was blood everywhere," said Pierre Torche, 35, the town mayor and one 
of the first firefighters to discover the bodies. "It was a bizarre sight." 
</P>
<P>
 In two other rooms of the house, police and firefighters found four other 
victims, including a 10-year-old boy, who had been shot in the head. A woman, 
possibly the boy's mother, lay dead next to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the farmhouse, identified as Alberto Giacomino, 73, was found on 
his bed, with gunshot wounds and a plastic bag over his head. In addition to 
the boy, the victims included 10 men, one 18 years old, and 12 women. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the sect evidently intended to disappear in a fireball. Throughout 
the house, located about 40 miles northeast of Geneva, authorities found 
plastic bags filled with gasoline and bottles filled with propane gas. Some 
were hooked up to timing devices and telephone lines, apparently so they could 
be detonated by a phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few of the devices worked, however, and none of the victims in Cheiry 
was burned, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still reeling from what we found," Piller told a late-night news 
conference. "We have no indication why they chose this day for their mass 
suicide. At the moment, we have no idea why these people died. We aren't even 
sure whether it's a homicide or a suicide yet." 
</P>
<P>
 An audiocassette tape found at the scene contained remarks about astrology, 
the police said, but it gave no reasons for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time that firefighters were making their discovery here, fires 
broke out in three ski chalets in the Swiss Alps, near Granges-sur-Salvan. A 
total of 25 bodies were pulled from those smoldering chalets Wednesday. There 
were no signs of violence in those deaths; most of the victims appeared to have 
died before the fires, perhaps having been poisoned or drugged, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators linked the two events when they found cars from Cheiry at the 
Alps massacre site. And two of the chalets were owned by Luc Jouret, 46, said 
by authorities and cult experts to be the leader of two related extremist 
sects: the Cross and Rose and the Order of the Solar Temple. Literature for the 
Cross and Rose was found in the Cheiry farmhouse along with other religious 
artifacts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although all the victims in Switzerland have not been identified, authorities 
said that Jouret, who once described himself as "the new Christ," did not 
appear to be among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities were investigating links to the sect in Quebec, where an arson 
fire in a duplex next to one owned by Jouret left two people dead Tuesday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Those victims, a man and a woman, were not yet identified. But police said 
they believed they were members of the cult. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found medallions around their necks with the inscription T and S, which 
could stand for Temple Soleil," Michel Brunet, a spokesman for the provincial 
police, said. Temple Soleil is the French translation of Solar Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunet also said the Canadian fire, on a mountainside in the town of Morin 
Heights about 50 miles north of Montreal, was caused by the same type of 
explosive device blamed in Switzerland -- five gas tanks linked to each other 
with wires and timers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quebec police have long had the Solar Temple cult under investigation. Police 
arrested several members last year and charged them with illegal possession of 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Jouret reportedly fled from Canada to Switzerland in 1993, when Canadian 
authorities issued a nationwide arrest warrant charging him with weapons 
possession and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal Crown Prosecutor Jean-Claude Boyer, who worked on the arms case, said 
members of Solar Temple "saw themselves as superior human beings whose survival 
was needed to relaunch the human race after a cataclysm they saw coming because 
of the deterioration in world affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boyer said Jouret and his associates "looked like businessmen; there was 
nothing crazy about them." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the two-story farmhouse in Cheiry was blackened and smoldering. 
On a table inside in a room undamaged by fire was a red rose in a vase. The 
shells of two burned cars and a tractor were in the barn. 
</P>
<P>
 The tranquil, picturesque town of 230 inhabitants was shocked by the deaths 
but even more astonished that a cult could be operating in the prominent 
hillside home without being noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Giacomino bought the farmhouse four years ago and lived there with four other 
people, residents said. Torche, the mayor, said the property had been purchased 
by a company that wanted to do "biological cultivation" research and had chosen 
the spot because it received more sun than houses nearer the town center in the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in town remembered seeing the owner buying cigarettes at the cafe or 
stocking up on building supplies that he said were being used to renovate the 
farmhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know him well," said one neighbor. "But he seemed OK, just a nice 
old guy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't find anything strange about the fact that they kept to themselves," 
said Torche, the soot from the fire still clinging to his gray fireman's 
jumpsuit 12 hours later. "A lot of people up here do. 
</P>
<P>
 Swiss authorities surmise that the house was a meeting place for the sect. 
</P>
<P>
 When the firefighters first arrived at the house, shortly after midnight, they 
battled the blaze for nearly four hours. Then, joined by the police, they 
searched for what they thought would be just the residents, starting in the 
woods and moving into the living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after finding four victims in the house that they discovered the 
door leading to the windowless underground chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frightful," said Beat Karlen, a spokesman for the police. "When you 
enter into a place like that, where you find so many bodies, it's atrocious. 
Just atrocious."

VENUS PROBE'S GRAND FINALE: A FIERY FALL INTO PLANET; SCIENCE: A FINAL LESSON 
IS SOUGHT IN MAGELLAN'S DESTRUCTION. FOUR-YEAR TREK CALLED PROFOUNDLY 
REVEALING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Behind three locked security doors in a windowless operations room at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, James M. Stewart patiently is arranging the destruction 
of a $900-million spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASA craft, called Magellan, is orbiting Venus. Since its arrival at the 
evening star in 1990, the probe has overcome repeated misfortunes and 
transmitted to Earth a revealing portrait of a seared planet pockmarked by 
towering volcanoes and etched by sinuous canyons longer than the River Nile. 
Because of Magellan, scientists have come to know the planet in more detail 
than they do parts of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the spacecraft has faltered. Its solar power sails, alternately frozen and 
broiled every day for four years, are coming apart. Power is falling to 
dangerous lows. Money to carry on the mission has diminished steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than turn off its transmitters and abandon the craft, the mission team 
decided that there could be one last thing to learn about Venus from a 
spacecraft's fiery fall from grace. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday the craft will be ordered to begin a fatal plunge into the planet's 
dense, acidic atmosphere. Scientists hope that they can learn more about 
aerodynamics in the superheated sulfuric mist enveloping the planet, as the 
thick gases pull at the spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over a planning meeting this week, mission director Stewart listened 
stolidly as, amplified on a speaker phone, a disembodied voice from Denver 
argued with a voice from Washington about how best to nurse the damaged 
spacecraft until then. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no joy in the debate. Project manager Douglas G. Griffith 
interrupted the technical discussion. "We are trying to live long enough to get 
to our funeral," he said sardonically. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending destruction of Magellan is a bittersweet ending to what 
scientists say is one of the most successful missions in the history of space 
exploration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magellan was responsible for a very profound revelation of the planet," said 
Clark Chapman, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, 
Ariz. "It showed a wealth of surprising features, toppled a bunch of hypotheses 
and showed us more detailed geological mapping than for any other planet, 
including our own." 
</P>
<P>
 The Magellan mission has returned more information than all other U.S. 
planetary missions combined. And, because they have been recorded on small 
computer CD-ROM disks instead of bulky computer tapes, its images have been 
more widely distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Many high school science teachers have a set for their students. The images 
are even on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet surprisingly few scientists will be able to analyze the data in detail 
because funding for planetary studies has dwindled, scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Venus data analysis program was canceled. Next week, a special 
panel of NASA officials and their science advisers plan to meet to consider 
funding cuts of up to 20% in the agency's entire space research and analysis 
program, to free up money for other projects, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, NASA allocates about $90 million a year for the study of all the data 
gathered from 25 years of planetary missions -- barely a quarter of the cost of 
a single space shuttle flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Some space scientists are dismayed that the funding for studying the data 
Magellan gathered at Venus is vanishing just when they are beginning to 
understand the fundamental features of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of really interesting discoveries about Venus now are only beginning to 
come home, especially in the question of how Venus works in comparison to 
Earth," said Victor Baker, a professor of geosciences and planetary science at 
the University of Arizona who has been involved in NASA's exploration of the 
solar system since the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception more than a decade ago, the Magellan mission has taxed the 
ingenuity of JPL engineers and scientists to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan began as an act of recovery when the Ronald Reagan Administration 
canceled a more ambitious Venus mission to save money. JPL mission planners 
then created Magellan as a replacement from spare parts and leftover antennas. 
Delays caused by the space shuttle, which launched the probe in 1989, swelled 
the program's cost. 
</P>
<P>
 When the spacecraft arrived at Venus in 1990 after a perilous 15-month flight, 
it vanished -- just as the space agency's $900-million Mars Observer space 
probe would do during its approach to the red planet last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Observer, Magellan resurfaced. Fourteen hours after Magellan 
disappeared from their screens, JPL operations engineers re-established 
contact. Griffith remembers the loss of Magellan's signal as the single worst 
moment in a mission filled with emergencies. Four more times, the spacecraft 
vanished during the mission, only to be recovered by imaginative acts of 
engineering millions of miles away in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, two of the craft's four gyroscopes failed, one of its two data 
recorders broke and persistent static jeopardized its transmissions. 
Overheating threatened to end the mission prematurely. Nonetheless, the 
spacecraft and its distant controllers persisted and prevailed. 
</P>
<P>
 To extract an additional useful year from the mission -- and a unique gravity 
map of the entire planet -- the JPL team coaxed the craft through an unplanned 
and risky maneuver called aerobraking, to slow Magellan down and lower its 
orbit by skimming it across the planet's atmosphere like a stone skipping 
across a pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's annual funding was $45 million in 1991 but was canceled by the 
George Bush Administration in 1992. The mission managed to survive on a meager 
surplus until funding at a much lower level -- about $6 million -- was restored 
last year. Staff dropped from 220 in 1991 to about 27 people today. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Magellan team have joined the ranks of those preparing the 
agency's next mission to Mars, the Mars Environmental Surveyor Pathfinder, in 
1996. There are no plans to return to Venus in the foreseeable future. Griffith 
and Stewart are not certain what they will be doing next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, they are eager to ensure that Magellan has something new to 
teach with its finale. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not destroying it," Griffith said. "We are trying to get the last bit 
of good out of it before it destroys itself." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Magellan will fire its thrusters four times to lower itself 
progressively deeper into the planet's atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists on Earth will measure the more powerful atmospheric flow from the 
thicker gas by noting how hard Magellan's stabilizing system must work to keep 
the speeding craft from twisting off course. 
</P>
<P>
 JPL planners suspect that the craft may not last any longer than a day at 
lower altitude before burning up from the friction generated by the dense 
gases, or losing its electrical power as the clouds obscure the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not survive too long down there, but it is going to be good 
science," Stewart said. Venus Unveiled 
</P>
<P>
 NASA engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory plan to send the Magellan 
spaceprobe on a fatal plunge into the atmosphere of Venus next week, 
culminating one of the most successful planetary missions in the history of 
spaceflight. 
</P>
<P>
 Magellan revealed that Venus: 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Has a surface barely 500 millions years old, with craters showing almost no 
erosion.

HOUSE POSTPONES TRADE VOTE UNTIL AFTER ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Republicans throwing obstacle after obstacle in the path of a massive 
global trade agreement, House Democratic leaders decided Wednesday not to vote 
on the plan until they can reconvene in a rare lame-duck session three weeks 
after Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton had made the plan a centerpiece of his economic program as 
midterm elections approach. But two days of feverish work by the White House 
and its allies in Congress failed to gain enough support -- particularly from 
Republicans -- to overcome a split within Democratic ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to pull back on the measure, which would cut taxes on imports by 
an average of 40% around the world, represented a setback for the 
Administration but one that is not likely to be permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a strong consensus among both Republicans and Democrats that once the 
measure is removed from the volatile political atmosphere leading up to the 
election on Nov. 8, Clinton should have little trouble gaining approval when 
the House returns for the trade vote on Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay sent an uneasy shiver through America's major trading partners, who 
are waiting to see whether the United States approves the measure before 
ratifying it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate, where the eventual outcome is more precarious, already had decided 
to put off a vote until Dec. 1 -- an action that became a major element in the 
House decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has drawn opposition from a diverse group that includes some major 
labor organizations and Ross Perot's United We Stand, America, Inc. With the 
Senate holding off on a decision, House members balked at being forced to take 
a stand just one month before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 By the Administration's estimate, the trade plan would cut tariffs, the taxes 
charged on imports, by $740 billion around the world during a 10-year period, 
and by $36 billion in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also force European nations to cut the subsidies they pay to farmers, 
bringing prices for European agricultural products more in line with U.S. 
prices in the world market, and extend the rules of trade to the growing 
services sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Clinton, the bipartisan leadership of the House -- Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.), Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), 
Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.) -- said that "attempting to pass the legislation in the current 
atmosphere will weaken the strong bipartisan spirit we want to see for final 
passage." 
</P>
<P>
 They said the delay in the Senate "has quite frankly undermined our ability to 
guarantee strong bipartisan support for this effort in the House at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt said the lame-duck session would be limited to consideration of the 
trade plan and "no other business would be addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 The House voted, 298 to 123, to approve the delay, overcoming objections that 
putting off the decision would give the final say on the matter to members 
leaving Congress, who no longer could be held accountable by their 
constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade measures have become tricky to deal with in the political arena because 
they involve jobs as well as U.S. relations with other nations. They require 
bipartisan support and often present a case in which moderate Democrats must 
look for backers among the captains of American industry while fending off 
attacks from liberal colleagues and organized labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case a year ago with the North American Free Trade Agreement and 
the same appears to be occurring now -- although at a lower volume -- with the 
plan to redraw the rules of global measure, the 47-year-old General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, into a new World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is substantial support in both parties, but it does require both 
parties. One party can't do this alone," Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, election pressures forced apart the coalition of Republicans and 
moderate Democrats expected to support the agreement. Republicans who are 
almost certain to vote for the measure next month made it impossible for 
Clinton to gain a vote this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich in recent days had made it clear that while he supports the trade 
plan, he would try to block a vote before the election to deny Clinton an 
important legislative victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems were on the Republican side," said Rep. Timothy J. Penny 
(D-Minn.). He said the Republicans would have produced only about 15 votes in a 
key procedural vote originally scheduled for Wednesday night, which was not 
enough because of division among Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people wondered why, with Nov. 8 a month away, we wanted to be 
creating a controversy for ourselves," Penny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans are playing games," grumbled a senior White House aide who 
has worked aggressively for passage of the measure during the last several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas), who supports the trade plan, said the 
uncertainty about the outcome was the key factor in deciding to postpone the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows us to comply with the Senate arrangements," he said. "Anyone making 
an attempt to say (the Republicans) are behind this is off base." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added: "The Administration's strategy has been to confuse the 
opposition by having no strategy at all." 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate was forced to delay action on the measure as a result of a 
procedural move by Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Ernest F. Hollings 
(D-S.C.), who is normally a reliable Clinton ally but is also one of the 
angriest critics of the proposed agreement and efforts to open up world trade 
in general. BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 The last lame-duck Congress was convened in 1982 during Ronald Reagan's 
presidency. During the session, Congress passed a 5-cent-a-gallon gasoline tax 
and approved the creation of more than 120,000 acres of new wilderness areas in 
five states. In the last 40 years, there have been seven such sessions.

 DOG'S BEST FRIEND: Remember Lazarus, the Rottweiler rescued from a Santa Ana 
trash can in July, where he'd been left to die in a plastic bag with his mouth 
and legs duct-taped? The local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals 
is still fighting back. . . . It's now set up the Lazarus Fund to pay small 
rewards to people who call in information leading to the arrest of anyone 
abusing an animal. You can call its number -- (714) 536-0050 -- to report 
someone or to contribute to the new fund.

 LESS JUICE? The Orange County Urban League had bad luck with timing at its 
last job fair on June 17. It happened to be the day that O.J. Simpson led the 
police on a freeway chase through the length of Orange County. . . . "It 
definitely cut back attendance," says the local affiliate's president, George 
Williams. The Urban League has another job fair today -- 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. -- at 
the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Anaheim. "Anybody interested in employment is 
welcome," he says. Nearly two dozen businesses will be there to recruit.

 BASEBALL BANK: The California Angels are making an offer to season ticket 
holders they hope is too good to be refused: If there's no baseball in 1995, or 
some games are canceled, the Angels will refund season ticket holders' money, 
with interest. Angels President Richard Brown has written to new season ticket 
holders that if there is a strike in 1995, the Angels will pay back 5% interest 
with their refund -- for the '94 people, it would accrue all the way back to 
Aug. 23 -- date of the first strike-canceled home game. 
</P>
<P>
 FAINT PRAISE? You have to read between the lines perhaps, but Brown's letter 
to Angels fans shows he's not expecting a winner in '95, the team's 35th 
season. Brown says it will be an exciting year for fans to "help us achieve our 
goal in building a championship contender." The Angels were in last place in 
the American League West when the strike began. Brown adds: "We are confident 
there will be a baseball season in 1995."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; WILSON HOLDS FUND-RAISING LEAD OVER BROWN; 
INCUMBENT COLLECTS $23 MILLION OVERALL TO CHALLENGER'S $18 MILLION. WITH FIVE 
WEEKS TO GO, RACE IS EXPECTED TO BREAK CAMPAIGN RECORD SET IN 1990. 
</P>

 In what is heading toward the most expensive gubernatorial campaign in 
California history, Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign committee Wednesday reported 
collecting $7.8 million for his reelection campaign over the past three months 
while his Democratic challenger, state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, took in $5.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The money collected to date by the two campaigns is even more staggering: 
almost $23 million for Wilson since January, 1993, compared to $18 million for 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Their combined total of $41 million with a heavy month of fund raising still 
to be reported is within easy reach of the record $43 million raised by Wilson 
and Dianne Feinstein in their record-setting 1990 campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign reports are bad news for Brown, who trails Wilson not only in 
raising money but in most public opinion polls. Wilson ended the reporting 
period with $2.3 million on hand compared to $780,000 for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown campaign contends that in October it will raise all the money 
that its candidate needs to run a competitive race. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just returned from Washington, D.C., and New York on an extensive 
fund-raising trip," said Brown campaign spokesman John Whitehurst. "We feel we 
are very competitive with Wilson. Traditionally, Republicans have raised more 
money than Democrats; incumbents have raised more than challengers, and both 
dynamics are at work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign press secretary Dan Schnur expressed confidence that the 
governor will reach his goal of raising -- and spending -- more than $25 
million in his reelection race. 
</P>
<P>
 And like his challenger, the governor will continue to raise money in the 
weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a fund-raising schedule in place and continue to raise money, and 
this will put us right on track to maintain our campaign strategy in terms of 
paid media and other expenses that we laid out at the outset," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all statewide candidates, this is the season when money talks -- where the 
amount of campaign cash on hand determines whether candidates for statewide 
office can get their messages out over the airwaves or into mailers directed at 
likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's a critical time. With less than five weeks left until Election Day, 
the battle of the checkbook can prove as important as the charges and 
countercharges made by candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that these numbers for everybody are just blowing a hole 
through the sky," said Steven Merksamer, who ran former Gov. George 
Deukmejian's first gubernatorial campaign in 1982. This is the time when 
candidates "must come up with the cash to hold commercials. . . . You have to 
put up the cash on the barrel head to keep them." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming up with the money is a special problem for candidates in the 
"down-ballot" races, many of them unknown to voters and running for offices 
that elicit little public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the attention on the races for governor and U.S. Senate, other 
candidates with only modest amounts of cash to buy broadcast time often wonder 
whether they will be heard above the babble. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for lieutenant governor, Democratic state Controller Gray Davis 
has continued to outdo the fund-raising efforts of his Republican rival, state 
Sen. Cathie Wright of Simi Valley. Davis, a seasoned campaigner, reported 
raising $664,000 in the three months ending Sept. 30, compared to $206,000 for 
Wright. By that date, Davis' committee showed a cash balance of $1.7 million 
compared to Wright's $73,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright's campaign director, John Theiss, maintains that the GOP lawmaker will 
have enough money to battle her opponent down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for state treasurer, Democrat Phil Angelides reported raising 
almost $2 million over the past three months -- most of it in loans -- compared 
to $482,000 for his Republican opponent, State Board of Equalization member 
Matt Fong. That left Angelides well-positioned in the final weeks of the 
campaign, with $1.5 million on hand compared to $780,000 for Fong. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren reported raising $688,000 over the three months -- not 
a great deal more than his Democratic challenger, Assemblyman Tom Umberg of 
Garden Grove. Lungren's campaign had $1.1 million on hand at the end of last 
month compared to $712,000 for Umberg.

VOLCANIC GAS IMPLICATED IN TREE DIE-OFF; GEOLOGY: HIGH LEVELS OF CARBON DIOXIDE 
ARE FOUND IN THE GROUND AT THE SITE NEAR MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN. THE AREA IS HEAVILY 
USED IN SUMMER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal scientists are investigating whether the deaths of hundreds of trees 
near a popular recreation area at Mammoth Mountain are due to increased levels 
of carbon dioxide produced by volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Forest Service said they have found no 
indication of a hazard to public health and are uncertain whether the high gas 
level is a sign of increasing volcanic activity within the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of things we still don't know about this yet," said David 
Hill, a USGS scientist who is in charge of monitoring seismic and volcanic 
activity in the Mammoth area. "We know that some carbon dioxide is in the 
ground and is coming out of the ground on the south side of Mammoth Mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, people in the area first noticed that trees were dying near a picnic 
area in the vicinity of Horseshoe Lake, above the town of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The area affected is about 200 yards in diameter with several acres of trees. 
It is not in the area used by downhill skiers in the winter but is heavily used 
in the summer because there is access by road and a parking lot nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geological Survey is continuing to conduct tests in an attempt to pinpoint 
the source of the carbon dioxide but early investigation indicates volcanic 
activity is the most likely cause, agency scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial studies indicate there is more carbon dioxide in the ground than could 
be produced simply by the decay of vegetation. The emission of carbon dioxide 
from the ground is a phenomenon often associated with volcanic activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a series of earthquakes at Mammoth Mountain about 15 years ago, the USGS 
has been monitoring seismic and volcanic activity in the region. Since 1990, 
they have observed a bulge in the central part of the Long Valley Caldera that 
is growing an average of 2 centimeters a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although plants absorb carbon dioxide, excessive quantities can kill plant 
life, scientists said. "The concentrations in the soil are quite high and it 
might indeed be the thing that is killing the trees," Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is possible the trees have died from other causes. Vern McLean, a U.S. 
Forest Service geologist, said increasing ground temperatures associated with 
volcanic activity appear to have killed trees and vegetation elsewhere on the 
mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbon dioxide is generally harmless to people unless breathed at high 
concentrations; humans and other animals convert oxygen to carbon dioxide when 
they breathe. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said it is conceivable the carbon dioxide could affect people in the area 
if it is coming out of the ground fast enough. Because carbon dioxide is 
heavier than oxygen, it could displace oxygen and collect in low-lying areas on 
a still day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the experts agreed that there is no evidence the gas poses a risk to the 
public. "I don't think we have gotten any indication there is a reason to keep 
the public out of there yet," McLean said.

MEDFLY QUARANTINE IS IMPOSED ON PARTS OF VENTURA COUNTY; AGRICULTURE: AFFECTED 
ARE PARTS OF CAMARILLO, SOMIS, MOORPARK AND THOUSAND OAKS. THE ORDER COULD LAST 
FOR UP TO SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A quarantine on agriculture susceptible to Medflies was imposed for the first 
time Wednesday in Ventura County, encompassing 86 square miles of fields and 
homes within a 4.5-mile radius of the site where two fertile flies were found 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, which has been expected since two mated female Mediterranean fruit 
flies were found in eastern Camarillo on Friday, came as inspectors confirmed 
Wednesday that an additional 10 flies were found in a grove at St. John's 
Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine boundaries overlap parts of Camarillo, Somis, Moorpark and 
Thousand Oaks. The lines were drawn by local, state and federal officials after 
days of mapping and negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine will be imposed through at least three life-cycles of the 
Mediterranean fruit fly, which in the cool fall weather could be up to six 
months. The quarantine could be extended indefinitely until the pest is wiped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 It establishes a protocol for treatment with malathion and other steps that 
commercial growers must follow before they can ship host fruit or vegetables 
from within the infested area, which includes 40,000 acres of farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Susceptible to the pest are lemons, oranges, grapefruit, avocados, peppers, 
tomatoes and strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have an avocado crop to pick within a month, so I'll have to spray them or 
let them drop," said grower George Sorich, whose grove falls within the 
quarantine area. "But the main concern here is that we have to get rid of the 
fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents within the quarantine area are asked not to move any home-grown 
produce outside the area unless it has been cooked or canned. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the latest 10 male flies brought the total count to 53 flies 
-- 51 wild males and two fertile females -- all found within a quarter mile of 
the original site. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarantine order came from California Agriculture Secretary Henry Voss, 
with the U.S. Department of Food and Agriculture expected to issue a federal 
quarantine with identical boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are still trying to determine the extent of the infestation and will 
not decide whether to use aerial spraying or other eradication methods until 
they know whether the infestation has spread, and how far. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of folks are asking us why we don't jump in now with a treatment 
program," said Doug Hendrix, a spokesman with the Cooperative Medfly Project in 
Los Angeles, which includes experts from the federal and state agriculture 
departments. "But we can make that decision much better once we have all the 
facts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Medfly project, which has overseen the efforts to eradicate the Medfly 
from the Los Angeles Basin and elsewhere in Southern California, will make 
recommendations for treating the infestation to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take an order from the governor to begin aerial spraying, said Sean 
Walsh, a Wilson spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Medfly project team are experts," he said. "And we expect that we are 
going to take their advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inspectors have sprayed a combination of malathion and bait on the 
ground within the half-mile core area of the Medfly finds. In addition, they 
have set more than 700 traps within the quarantine area to trap the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a declaration of emergency by Ventura County Sheriff Larry Carpenter on 
Tuesday, Ventura County agriculture officials estimated potential losses at up 
to $439 million, which represents the total value of all crops considered to be 
hosts to the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Office of Emergency Services recommended Wednesday that Wilson 
approve a state of emergency, which would clear the way for state disaster 
assistance, Ventura County disaster officials said.

GAS CHAMBER ISSUE ENTERS CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's reelection campaign Wednesday quickly moved to exploit a 
court decision outlawing California's gas chamber by linking the judge who made 
the ruling to Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown's brother, former Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, branded U.S. District Judge Marilyn 
Hall Patel, who issued the gas chamber ruling, "a dangerously lenient judge" 
and noted that former Gov. Brown named her to the Alameda County Municipal 
Court before her 1980 elevation to the federal bench by President Jimmy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Glazer, a senior campaign adviser to state Treasurer Brown, denounced 
the Wilson campaign effort, saying the Democratic candidate "has nothing to do 
with Judge Patel so it's another example of Pete Wilson's effort to smear 
Kathleen Brown with the actions of others and not hold her accountable" for her 
own platform. 
</P>
<P>
 But with less than five weeks before the election, the ruling issued in San 
Francisco couldn't have come at a more inopportune time for Brown. Wilson has 
repeatedly criticized Brown for her personal opposition to the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 At an emotional news conference in June, Brown, whose father Edmund G. (Pat) 
Brown also served as governor, said her opposition to capital punishment was 
rooted in her upbringing and her Catholic faith. Despite her heartfelt views, 
Brown said she would nonetheless enforce capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown seems unable to shake the issue. On Tuesday, Patel gave Wilson an 
opening to raise it again when she declared that the gas chamber "is inhumane 
and has no place in civilized society" and deemed it unconstitutional. If her 
decision is upheld, it would require the state to execute prisoners only by 
lethal injection, an option provided by a 1992 state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kathleen Brown had been governor in 1992 and vetoed that bill (lethal 
injection), the judge her brother appointed would have outlawed California's 
death penalty yesterday," Gorton maintained. "As long as a Brown appointee 
remains on the bench, California's death penalty is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer initially would not spell out Brown's position on the lethal injection 
law, saying only that Brown said "she will enforce the law on the death 
penalty. She will enforce the people's will on the method of execution." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, he said that if Brown had been governor in 1992, she would have signed 
the measure into law to provide Death Row inmates another option on how to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer also said that Brown, like incumbent Wilson, would support a decision 
to appeal Patel's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, speaking Wednesday to a television reporter before boarding a flight 
in Los Angeles, pointed out that Patel, the first woman appointed to the 
federal bench in San Francisco, awarded condemned murderer Robert Alton Harris 
an extraordinary reprieve in 1992 before he was finally put to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to have the death penalty to protect people in California, and I 
intend to do everything possible to see to it that we've retained that 
protection," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides criticizing Brown over the Patel ruling, Wilson's campaign showed 
reporters a new 30-second campaign commercial stressing the governor's support 
of tougher penalties for criminals. Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 33 days to go before Californians go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Gov. Pete Wilson traveled to Washington for 
fund-raising events. His campaign, meanwhile, sought to exploit a court 
decision outlawing California's gas chamber by linking the judge who made the 
ruling to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's brother. Brown returned from New 
York City and attended a Democratic Unity fund-raising dinner in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Today, Wilson travels to New York City for more fund raising. 
Brown has breakfast with voters in San Francisco and will attend a midday rally 
in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SENATE RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Wednesday: Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Mike Huffington 
remained in Washington, where Congress is in session. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: The candidates debate for the first time tonight, from 6 to 7 
on CNN's "Larry King Live." The debate will also be broadcast live on KNX 
radio, 1070 AM. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTABLE QUOTES 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kathleen Brown had been governor in 1992 and vetoed that bill (lethal 
injection), the judge her brother appointed would have outlawed California's 
death penalty yesterday. As long as a Brown appointee remains on the bench, 
California's death penalty is not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 -- George Gorton, Wilson's campaign manager, referring to U.S. District Judge 
Marilyn Hall Patel's ruling to outlaw the state's gas chamber. Patel was 
appointed by former Gov. Jerry Brown to a Municipal Court before being elevated 
to the federal bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown) has nothing to do with Judge Patel so it's another example of Pete 
Wilson's effort to smear Kathleen Brown with the actions of others. . . . She 
will enforce the law on the death penalty. She will enforce the people's will

CAPITOL JOURNAL: BROWN READIES PLAN FOR THE STRETCH RUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brown campaign gets it. The brain trust has seen the polls. Voters are 
saying something important: They don't understand the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 They're asking, just who is this latest Brown? What would she be like as 
governor? Like her father Pat, the builder? Or her brother Jerry, the rebel? 
Does she stand for anything? 
</P>
<P>
 With less than five weeks to go before the election, Treasurer Kathleen Brown 
-- proud member of California's most famous political family -- remains a 
mystery for millions of voters. And not a very compelling mystery at that, 
despite the personal charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "People know what they don't like about the status quo, but they don't know 
enough about her," concedes Brown spokesman Bill Rukeyser. "They're ready for 
clear, understandable information that makes her an attractive alternative to a 
man next to nobody likes." 
</P>
<P>
 The aide admits, "Polls show people are unhappy with Kathleen. They don't know 
what she stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, this is developing into a contest of Brown vs. Brown -- Kathleen 
vs. Jerry. That's clearly the contest Gov. Pete Wilson and his strategists are 
promoting with their attacks on Jerry's judicial appointments. It's as if he 
were running. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown needs to get the electorate focused on a fight between her and 
Wilson. She's behind in the polls -- by nine points in The Times' mid-September 
survey -- but voters still don't like the governor's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 So Brown and her advisers have a plan: a plan, they say, to win the election 
and govern afterward; Wilson only has a plan to get reelected. That's their new 
theme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You can read all about Brown's plan for "Building a New California" in a new 
62-page booklet that's to be the centerpiece of her comeback campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dusted off and updated version of various old speeches on the 
Democratic candidate's proposals for rebuilding the economy, fighting crime, 
improving schools and stopping illegal immigration. Reporters have had this 
stuff for months and basically have ignored it, Brown strategists contend. 
That's not entirely true, but it certainly hasn't gotten the attention the 
candidate wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 So today she'll begin distributing at least a million copies by mail, at 
rallies, on street corners and house to house. They'll be targeted at swing 
voters, especially educated young women who don't always cast ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's spinners already have begun to belittle the booklet. But nobody could 
leaf through it and still legitimately say that Brown doesn't stand for 
anything. She has enough proposals in there to satisfy the most tedious policy 
wonk. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a big campaign investment, costing well over a week's worth of TV ads. 
And it will be paired with new ads aimed at persuading voters that Brown isn't 
an empty suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key now is for Kathleen to break through with a strong positive image to 
counter Wilson's negative image," says campaign manager Clinton Reilly. "We 
don't need negative ads to win. Voters already dislike the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious question is, why did they wait until now? Why weren't there more 
positive ads in the summer, when Brown was attacking Wilson on crime -- his 
issue? This is a sore subject and you get mixed answers. 
</P>
<P>
 First, her aides say, occasional voters weren't paying attention. "There's no 
use in delivering a heart-rendering sermon if the congregation isn't in the 
church yet," says Rukeyser, while adding: "That's not to mean things weren't 
being rethought-out over the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly believes Brown had no choice but to talk about crime because voters are 
angry about it. The same with illegal immigration. In fact, Reilly isn't 
swearing off all negative ads. He'll likely be running spots attacking Wilson's 
"hypocrisy" on immigration, citing his record as a U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the projected Republican year nationally, Reilly insists Brown is in a 
good position to win. A Democratic field operation could boost her percentage 
of the vote by three points, he says, and Wilson will lose up to 7% because 
conservatives unhappy with him will opt for a third-party candidate. Also, he 
asserts, the governor has fired his best shots on crime and immigration, and 
voters will start seeking the candidates' positions on less emotional issues. 
</P>
<P>
 In that regard, several Democratic strategists think Brown/Reilly erred in not 
accepting Wilson's offer to debate on public TV. "Any port in a storm," one 
says. The candidate held out for commercial TV. 
</P>
<P>
 But there'll be time enough for more second guessing after Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the Brown campaign has a message -- for reporters, for contributors, 
for voters: The brain trust does know what it's doing. Brown does have ideas, 
goals and core beliefs. Don't give up on this candidacy. Nobody's voted yet.

N. KOREA SAYS KIM JONG IL HAS ASSUMED POWER

<P>
 Communist North Korea told the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday that Kim 
Jong Il, son of the late President Kim Il Sung, is the country's new supreme 
leader and supreme commander of its armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement by North Korea's deputy foreign minister, Choi Su Hon, in a 
speech to the U.N. body appeared to end any lingering doubts that Kim Jong Il, 
who has not yet been sworn in, had inherited his father's mantle.Kim Il Sung 
died July 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Choi's speech opened with a paean to the late North Korean leader as well as 
to his son. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-controlled press on Wednesday also told North Koreans in the 
most categorical terms yet that Kim Jong Il will assume the country's 
leadership.

MANDELA FETED, BUT BUSINESS IS WARY; INVESTMENT: THE SOUTH AFRICAN PRESIDENT IS 
EMBRACED AS A HERO IN WHITE HOUSE CEREMONIES. U.S. CORPORATE OFFICIALS WORRY 
ABOUT STABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South African President Nelson Mandela was embraced as friend and hero in 
White House ceremonies Wednesday but got a politely noncommittal reception from 
the audience that now counts even more for his government -- the American 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day of a five-day U.S. visit to solicit investment, Mandela met 
with President Clinton to discuss aid for economic development, housing, 
education and electrification in South Africa. The principal program they 
discussed was a $100-million fund for development of new businesses, half of 
which is earmarked for South Africa and the remainder for neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can be certain that the United States will do everything in our power to 
support the new nation," Clinton said in a ceremony on the White House's South 
Lawn that followed a one-on-one afternoon meeting with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet officials of some American corporations who talked to Mandela and his 
entourage earlier this week were saying that, despite their growing confidence 
in the 5-month-old regime, they need to see more before they can undertake the 
kind of expansion that the South African government so badly needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference, Mandela put off U.S. requests to supply police for Haiti 
when U.S. troops are replaced by U.N. peacekeepers, a move expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, while praising the "worthy" objective of the U.N. effort, said his 
government must first confer with other governments of southern Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are involved in an operation anywhere in the world, we would like this 
to be a collective decision from our region," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mandela arrived Monday, PepsiCo Inc. has announced that it will return 
to South Africa, after a nine-year absence, with a $20-million bottling 
venture. Duracell International Inc. said that, with $13 million in 
U.S.-government-financed political risk insurance, it plans to resume 
distribution of its batteries in South Africa. And the Subway Corp. said that 
with government financing it would begin a program to open 80 of its sandwich 
shops in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, 1993, when the South African government agreed to free 
elections, about 30 American companies have begun various expansion moves, from 
acquiring subsidiaries or affiliates to opening branch offices, according to 
the Investor Responsibility Research Council in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And such companies as Ford, General Motors, Heinz and Electronic Data Systems 
are believed to be contemplating such expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many other businesses are saying that they are hesitating because of 
concern about the volatility of South African politics and the potential for 
profits in the distant country of 40 million people. International companies 
and investors remain skittish about the daunting prospects of integrating a 
long-divided society. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't help but be impressed by Mandela," said an official of one company 
who met with the South African leader this week and who asked to remain 
unidentified. "But there has to be more than sympathy to this calculation." 
</P>
<P>
 Dan O'Flaherty, executive director of the U.S.-South African Business Council 
in Washington, said the move back into South Africa has so far been small. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call them hedged bets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While South Africa is especially eager for manufacturing businesses, the 
relatively high wages of unionized workers there make manufacturing for export 
less attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, South Africa has been a bastion of protectionism, with high tariffs and 
subsidies. Those tariffs are to be dismantled over a period of six to eight 
years if the pending global trade measure, the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade -- now to be called the World Trade Organization -- is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, outside firms would have to compete with huge South African companies 
carefully nurtured and protected by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been one of the most highly protected economies in the world," 
O'Flaherty said.

 Chicago moved to fight gangs Wednesday by hanging up the phones they use for 
drug deals. The City Council approved without discussion a measure to ban 
outdoor pay phones on vacant buildings and lots, outside liquor stores and bars 
and on residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will result in the immediate removal of about 500 phones, 
Revenue Director Judith Rice said.

AMERICAN ALBUM: DIRT-POOR TOWN GROWS BUMPER CROP OF CASINOS; THE MISSISSIPPI 
GAMBLING MECCA IS STILL POOR, JUST NOT AS MUCH, AS THE STATE PROVIDES FERTILE 
SOIL FOR A BOOMING GAMING INDUSTRY. 
</P>

<P>
 Only a short while ago, Tunica County was known as the poorest county in the 
poorest state in the Union. One part of the town of Tunica was called Sugar 
Ditch Alley because the poor folk there dumped raw sewage into a ditch that ran 
past their tumbledown shacks. This didn't change until the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunica still is poor -- it ranks fourth in poverty in the nation, according to 
the U.S. Census Bureau -- but you'd never know it from the glitzy casinos that 
seem to sprout overnight here like crawfish mounds from the black Delta mud. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1992, 12 casinos have opened in the sparsely populated county, making it 
one of the larger gambling meccas in the United States. In all, Mississippi now 
has 31 casinos and, with $1 billion in gambling revenues, ranks third in 
gambling proceeds behind Nevada and New Jersey. The casinos have created 35,000 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the 26 other states that have authorized casino gambling, Mississippi 
has placed few demands and restrictions on the companies that set up shop here. 
The state's calculated gamble has been criticized by those who say the state 
has frittered away an opportunity to link the fledgling casino industry with 
other kinds of development. The Mississippi Gaming Commission is now 
considering requiring new casinos to be linked to hotels or some other type of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 But in general, state gaming officials say that an unfettered market will help 
the state grow a healthier and more highly developed casino industry. "I think 
the growth of our market validates that approach," said Chuck Patton, deputy 
director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the state's casinos are on the Gulf Coast. Unlike the coast, which can 
boast of beaches, restaurants and motels, Tunica County has little to offer 
visitors except endless vistas of cotton fields. That means that the casinos 
have catered almost exclusively to day-trippers, many of them from nearby 
Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tunica County casinos are a sight to behold: gaudy, outrageous and huge. 
The state's initial idea was to restrict them to the Mississippi River, but the 
rules have been loosened. Although they all are on the river side of the levee 
and all were floated into place, the dredged-out channels were later filled in 
so that the newer casinos have no visible connection to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the riverboat casinos that plied the Mississippi a century ago, these 
hulking apparitions seem about as indigenous as boll weevils in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood casino is an Art Deco movie palace with plastic palms inside and 
out and a helicopter dangling from the ceiling. Circus Circus looks like a big 
tent, right down to cruising clowns. Sam's Town poses as a Wild West outpost. 
The one casino that has a water theme is the Treasure Bay, which is a gigantic 
pirate ship with a mermaid on its prow. 
</P>
<P>
 The casino that did draw on the South for its theme, ironically, was the first 
to go bankrupt. The Southern Belle casino shut at the end of August. Two other 
Tunica County casinos have closed recently, prompting concerns that the market 
may be saturated. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the stream of tourist dollars flowing south prompted Memphis city 
officials to try to get the Legislature to approve gambling in Tennessee and 
discuss recruiting a tribe of Native Americans, who are not as bound by state 
gambling laws, to open a casino in the city. Both efforts failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (Tunica County) casinos are the biggest thing that ever happened to 
Memphis," said a Circus Circus waitress who did not want her name used. 
"Memphis is not really that big a tourist town. There's Graceland and not much 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tunica casinos may face competition elsewhere, however. A casino in nearby 
West Memphis, Ark., is planned, if voters approve a gambling measure in 
November. Alabama and Florida also are set to consider gambling proposals, and 
what is being billed as the world's biggest casino is scheduled to open in New 
Orleans in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But Patton insists that Tunica County, along with the rest of the state, will 
emerge with a mature casino industry still capable of drawing tourists. He 
predicts that casinos eventually will begin more ambitious projects to stay 
competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for example, the 2,000-acre development in Tunica County that would 
include hotels, restaurants, golf and housing now being planned by a 
partnership of Gaming Corp. of America and Grand Casinos Inc. Mississippi 
officials are aware that bribery allegations resulted in Gaming Corp. losing a 
casino license in Wisconsin. Patton said that the development is moving more 
slowly than expected, and company officials have been asked to provide an 
update of their plans at the commission's next meeting, Oct. 13.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; FRUSTRATED U.S. MILITARY LEADERS ACCUSE PRESS OF 
FANNING FLAMES IN HAITI; MEDIA: REPORTS ARE UNFAIRLY FOCUSING ON VIOLENCE, 
OFFICIALS SAY. THEY ALLEGE DISTORTED IMAGES MAY BE AFFECTING MORALE AND THE 
MISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior U.S. military leaders are becoming increasingly frustrated over media 
coverage of the U.S. military operation in Haiti, contending that it has 
produced a distorted image that ignores the progress made by U.S. troops and in 
some cases has hurt morale. 
</P>
<P>
 While conceding that there have been some snags in the operation, the officers 
argue that in just 2 1/2 weeks in Haiti, U.S. troops have brought order to the 
island nation, blunted the local army and police and re-established basic 
services -- with hardly any casualties and few gun battles. 
</P>
<P>
 But they complain that the images and words sent back to American viewers and 
readers have concentrated on a handful of incidents, such as the looting of a 
warehouse in Port-au-Prince last week, that, taken alone, present a distorted 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contend that U.S. journalists have been mistakenly describing as 
"mission creep" the assignment of U.S. military police to help oversee some 
police-related activities such as crowd control. The officials say such 
assignments were always in the U.S. operations plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officers allege that focus on such incidents has made it more 
difficult for them to manage the operation, frustrating U.S. troops who often 
see or read the news reports and intensifying pressures in Congress for an 
early withdrawal date. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), a House leader on military issues, complained 
after a trip to Haiti last weekend that press distortions were beginning to 
"change the mission" by heightening pressure on U.S. troops to become involved 
in confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that focusing on the relatively few incidents of violence since U.S. 
troops arrived is "like looking at the country through a straw." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, officials insisted, overall violence levels in Haiti have decreased 
dramatically since U.S. troops arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 The military's chagrin over the press coverage was expressed in an interview 
with The Times on Wednesday by Navy Adm. William A. Owens, vice chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
 While insisting that he was speaking only for himself, Owens said it is 
frustrating to military people to see reports that omit "the successes we're 
having" in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our troops themselves are aware of this coverage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although newspapers have not escaped criticism, military officials leveled 
most complaints at television, which has often provided live coverage of the 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that these are important events that need to be reported," Owens 
said. "But if you don't see it in the context of the total, then you miss the 
big picture that is important for everyone who views" news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opinion of military officials: 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. forces took on a difficult and complex operation. They were hit at the 
start with a change in signals resulting from the accord hammered out with 
Haitian officials by the delegation led by former President Jimmy Carter. 
Still, they deftly changed plans to fulfill the operation without missing a 
beat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although U.S. troops hit some snags, officials said the venture so far has 
been a success -- going far more smoothly than they had hoped. Just 2 1/2 weeks 
into the operation, most of Haiti is secure, services have been restored and 
the population is under control. 
</P>
<P>
 * Opposition to the return of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide has been 
largely blunted. The army and military have been disarmed and are in check, 
paramilitary arsenals have been seized and the Port-au-Prince police chief, Lt. 
Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, has left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Democratic political institutions are gradually coming back. The Haitian 
Parliament has met. Evans Paul, the exiled mayor of Port-au-Prince and an 
Aristide backer, has returned. And the head of the paramilitary force that has 
terrorized the country has pledged to support Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the operation has progressed with only a handful of casualties. Two 
U.S. servicemen have been wounded -- one with only a flesh wound -- and there 
have been two American deaths, both of them apparent suicides. U.S. soldiers 
have killed 10 Haitians -- all, they said, in self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, military leaders grumble, U.S. viewers and readers have been 
peppered with footage and articles showing U.S. troops standing by while 
Haitians are beaten, Marines shooting Haitian police, crowds ransacking and 
looting and grenades killing bystanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunate as these incidents have been, they say, they have been relatively 
isolated and are to be expected in any operation of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The surprise is not that there's been some violence but that there hasn't 
been more," Defense Secretary William J. Perry told reporters Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen H. Hess, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution think tank, 
said that, while military leaders and the press almost always have been at 
odds, this time the military officers "do have a point." 
</P>
<P>
 Hess said that, although journalists generally try to do their jobs well, 
reporting from Haiti has seemed more one-sided. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perfect example of parachute journalism," he said. "American 
journalists are absolutely magnificent for the first 24 hours in a country but, 
the longer they stay, the more it becomes obvious that they don't have the 
training or background to cover this for long."

 A Marine apparently shot and killed himself aboard a ship that had been off 
Haiti, U.S. officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Lance Cpl. Maurice Williams, 21, of Detroit was found dead in a 
sleeping area on the U.S. landing ship Nashville while it was in port in Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nashville is one of a group of ships that landed about 1,800 Marines at 
Cap Haitien on Haiti's north coast when the U.S. military operation began Sept. 
19, and took them off this week.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; REQUIEM FOR A REGIME AT OFFICERS' FUNERAL; RITES: 
STARK CEREMONY FOR 10 SLAIN BY MARINES IS A TESTIMONIAL TO HOW EFFECTIVELY THE 
U.S. MILITARY HAS NEUTRALIZED HAITI'S DICTATORSHIP.

<P>
 A military dictator wept, a bugler played taps, and the sisters of dead 
soldiers wailed as Haiti's army commander in chief, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, led 
his soldiers Wednesday in a state funeral that also seemed a requiem for a 
dying regime. 
</P>
<P>
 As U.S. forces continued to isolate Cedras and his tattered command, the 
ceremony before 10 wooden coffins draped with Haitian flags was meant to 
glorify the military police officers shot dead 12 days ago at their Cap Haitien 
headquarters by U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 The men had already been buried once and exhumed; on Wednesday they were 
buried again in a fortified military compound, in the presence of Cedras' 
grim-faced, 58-member honor guard and a few hundred military supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The unannounced ceremony was a testimonial to how effectively the U.S. 
military has neutralized Haiti's brutal dictatorship two weeks after landing. 
It was the first time in three years that such a public appearance by Cedras 
and his command was neither broadcast on state radio and television -- now 
under the control of the U.S. forces -- nor attended by thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after a leading member of the general's ruling troika fled into 
exile, U.S. officials said they expect that Cedras and Brig. Gen. Philippe 
Biamby, who sat two chairs away from the commander in chief Wednesday, will 
step down even before Oct. 15, the date set for their departure from power 
under an agreement forged by former President Jimmy Carter last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby, a fierce nationalist who spent six months in a U.S. immigration prison 
and four years in exile in Venezuela until the 1991 coup, was the only member 
of the high command who publicly vowed to fight the U.S. troops in the event 
they invaded rather than intervened. That anger was clearly etched on Biamby's 
face as he fidgeted and scowled through Wednesday's rites. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cedras buried his face in his hands and sniffed back tears, Biamby clenched 
his hands together in his lap and held his chin high while occasionally joining 
in hymns that asked divine forgiveness. Not once during the hourlong ceremony 
did Cedras and Biamby speak to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the funeral, U.S. Military Police patrols rolled by outside the 
Military Hospital, where the 10 men were buried in a courtyard never before 
used as a cemetery. A U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter circled overhead as the 
service began. 
</P>
<P>
 From a small, makeshift pulpit set up under a plastic tarp near the grave 
sites that one Haitian officer said will become a nationalist shrine, Father 
Eugene Thales called for repentance, and army Col. Carl Dorelien called for 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedras said nothing. His eyes were wet, his face was drawn as he sat silent 
beside his fellow generals, listening above the wail of relatives to the army's 
personnel chief, Dorelien, declare: "By the blood these men have spilled they 
have given us a message. It is: 'Unity, reconciliation and love.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The hymns and the sermon read to a military audience with the Caribbean's 
worst record of brutality and human rights abuse carried the same tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are standing in front of God and daring to receive his judgment," the 
priest declared. "Are you ready to face death? Or are you ready to face life? 
In order to face life, you must first respect life." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forgive us Father," sang a handful of the soldiers as the priest led one 
Creole hymn. "When will we be able to stand? Every day, we are trying to live, 
to go one step at a time, not to be left behind. . . . Deliver us, God, from 
everlasting death on our Judgment Day." 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the ceremony was Dorelien's speech. He echoed Cedras' line 
that all 10 men were shot in cold blood as they played dominoes on the night of 
Sept. 24, when a Marine assault on the Cap Haitien police headquarters in 
northern Haiti destroyed the region's entire police and military structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the colonel said, it is a time for reconciliation and peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in discord will only bring evil," he said. "This trauma we feel is 
proof that division will only defeat us. This is our crisis. We must resolve it 
ourselves. We want peace, and peace means justice and charity." 
</P>
<P>
 That, Dorelien concluded, "is our impossible mission." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seemed, judging by scenes elsewhere in the Haitian capital Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. military intelligence officers and military police were 
intensifying efforts to dismantle the regime from the top -- raiding homes of 
its key civilian agents, continuing to detain Cedras' top bodyguards and aides, 
and hunting hidden arms caches -- the Haitians were dismantling the regime from 
the ground up. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the funeral ended, dozens of impoverished Haitians tore into the 
headquarters of a political party created from the remnants of former dictator 
Jean-Claude (Baby Doc) Duvalier's party. The looters, who identified themselves 
as supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, tore the building 
apart, even carting off the plumbing and wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 Several in the crowd said they were preparing the way for Aristide's return. 
But one looter, who identified himself as Bobby Beauvier, said he planned to 
sell what he could carry away. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs that the regime was preparing for its own collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The military's puppet president, Emile Jonassaint, ordered license plates on 
all government vehicles changed to civilian plates, apparently to help his 
government dissolve into the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Cedras ended the funeral with a personal and symbolic show of strength: 
He stood tall as he moved from grave to grave, forcefully throwing dirt into 
each.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITI'S RULING GENERALS ARE GIVEN A HINT: LEAVE; 
CARIBBEAN: U.S. HAS BEEN USING CARROTS AND STICKS -- OFFERS OF COMFORTABLE 
EXILE AND THREATS OF ARREST -- TO PUSH CEDRAS AND BIAMBY OUT. THEY HAVE UNTIL 
OCT. 15.

 U.S. officials said Wednesday that they expect Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras to step 
down before the deadline of Oct. 15, but they have warned the Haitian strongman 
-- just in case -- that he will be arrested by American troops if he tries to 
stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he's still behind his desk, we'll arrest him," one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they have seen increasing signs that Cedras will retire and 
leave Haiti entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "His interest in staying is declining," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby, Cedras' chief of staff, is another story. 
</P>
<P>
 Biamby is "a tough nut to crack," one official said. "We just don't know what 
he is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement negotiated by former President Jimmy Carter on Sept. 18 requires 
both military commanders to step down by Oct. 15, but does not explicitly call 
on them to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has been using a combination of carrots and sticks -- offers 
of comfortable exile and threats of arrest and trial -- to push the generals 
toward the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have ways to make it uncomfortable for them, if they stay," one official 
said, noting that the generals will probably be vulnerable to arrest and trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the U.S. military has been arresting many of the generals' close 
aides to make it more difficult for the military leaders to maintain a 
political machine. 
</P>
<P>
 If the generals decide to leave, he noted, the United States is willing to 
provide both protection and transportation to Panama or any other country where 
they would be welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they want the generals out of Haiti to prevent them from 
attempting to organize military or political resistance to the government of 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, whom the United States is restoring to power. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials were pleased that Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, chief of 
police in Haiti's capital, fled the country this week for the neighboring 
Dominican Republic. But they were embarrassed that Francois was held up at the 
border overnight by a bureaucratic foul-up -- a humiliation that might stiffen 
Cedras and Biamby's reluctance to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also said they are trying to persuade Aristide, who is still living 
in exile in Washington, to support a broad amnesty that would absolve most 
military and police officers for their actions under the Cedras regime. The 
Administration's theory is that such an amnesty will make it easier to win 
cooperation from the remaining officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aristide has said he seeks only a narrow amnesty that would allow his 
government to prosecute officers for human rights abuses against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual stratagem, President Clinton recruited visiting South African 
President Nelson Mandela to lobby Aristide for a softer line. At a news 
conference with Mandela, Clinton said the meeting would be "the most important 
thing South Africa can do for Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 By looking at South Africa, where Mandela allowed most military officers to 
remain, "the Haitian people will see that you can bring a country where there 
have been deep, even bloody, divisions together and work together in a spirit 
of freedom, reconciliation, democracy and mutual respect," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Carter is also in frequent telephone contact with both Cedras 
and Aristide and talked with both leaders Wednesday, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Wednesday that they look 
forward to bringing home some of the U.S. troops in Haiti but admitted that 
they cannot say when. 
</P>
<P>
 "An issue that has come up frequently on Haiti is, 'How many (troops) and how 
long?' " Perry said at a news conference. "I cannot give a crisp, clear answer 
to that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the number of U.S. troops in Haiti, now more than 17,000, should drop 
to 15,000 by the end of this month and to 6,000 by March. After that, officials 
said, other U.N. forces will join the Americans, allowing U.S. forces to drop 
to 2,000 by the end of 1995.

U.N. BEGINS TRIAL LIFTING OF YUGOSLAVIA SANCTIONS; BALKANS: MOVE COMES IN 
RESPONSE TO SERBIAN PRESIDENT'S PROMISE TO STOP SUPPLYING REBELS IN BOSNIA. 
DOUBTS ABOUT PLEDGE LINGER.

<P>
 As Yugoslavia gained its first symbolic readmission into the circle of 
civilized nations Wednesday, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic was casting 
himself as the victor in a long, painful standoff with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The influential Politika newspaper, controlled by Milosevic supporters, 
trumpeted the reopening of the Belgrade airport as "the beginning of the end" 
of Yugoslavia's isolation, with nary a word about the war still raging on its 
western border. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions linger about the sincerity of Milosevic's vow that he is cutting off 
war supplies to Bosnian Serb rebels -- a promise that won him partial relief 
from U.N. sanctions imposed in May, 1992, in punishment for his having 
instigated the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry told North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization allies in Spain last week that he had seen reports suggesting some 
leakage of war supplies despite the proclaimed cutoff. And German Foreign 
Minister Klaus Kinkel warned European Union states Tuesday that his government 
felt the Yugoslav border "could be more effectively sealed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the U.N. Protection Force has conceded it has hundreds of reports from 
its troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina of nighttime Yugoslav army helicopter sorties 
into battle areas held by the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, retired Swedish Gen. Bo Pellnas, head of a 135-man border 
monitoring unit that is not yet fully deployed along the 300-mile frontier, 
informed the U.N. Security Council that he had seen no evidence Serbia was 
shipping war materiel to Bosnian Serb allies -- a report that automatically 
triggered a 100-day trial lifting of sanctions prohibiting international air 
traffic in and out of Yugoslav airports and a ban that prevented cultural and 
sports contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Within hours, a Russian Aeroflot jet landed in Belgrade in a ceremonial 
reopening of the airport that had been in diplomatic mothballs for 28 months. 
The Yugoslav national carrier, JAT, planned to resume international flights 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aeroflot Ilyushin-62 carried fewer than two dozen passengers, but among 
them was Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly S. Churkin, Moscow's special 
envoy for the Balkan crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very significant day today," Churkin said upon arrival. "(Yugoslavia 
has) firmly chosen the path of peace and political settlement." 
</P>
<P>
 The restored links promise little real relief for an economy ravaged less by 
the U.N. blockade than by three years of bankrolling wars in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, easing sanctions against Milosevic appears to be part of a 
strategy by outside powers to draw him into efforts to force signing of a peace 
plan that will nullify the issue of whether the United Nations should lift its 
arms embargo against the Bosnian government. A harsh dispute over the issue has 
driven a wedge between the United States and its allies in NATO. Countries with 
troops on the ground in Bosnia are against arming the Bosnians, while 
Washington favors correcting what it sees as an immoral imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 By intensifying pressure on the Bosnian Serbs, the five-nation Contact Group 
trying to force acceptance of its peace plan is probably gambling that 
Milosevic will eventually be able to depose Radovan Karadzic, his former proxy 
in the Bosnian Serb leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has also reportedly drawn the Muslim-led Bosnian 
government into the plan to wait out the expected Serbian infighting. An Oct. 
15 deadline Clinton set for the Bosnian Serbs to sign the proposed peace plan 
or face a rearmed government faction has been effectively put off until spring, 
apparently because both Washington and the Sarajevo leadership doubt Karadzic 
can survive that long without support from Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 But like all previous efforts to buy time in hopes the Bosnian war will 
somehow burn itself out, a delay in lifting the arms embargo may only allow the 
plight of civilians to worsen while a cohesive strategy for ending the war 
continues to elude the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into the third winter of Europe's worst bloodshed since World War II, 
both warring Bosnian factions are better armed and more determined to hold 
their ground than they were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, 22,000 troops of the U.N. mission are now focused more on 
protecting their own ranks than on assisting the beleaguered populations in 
U.N. "safe areas" they were dispatched to protect.

CRIME RAMPAGE IN PARIS LEAVES 4 DEAD, 6 HURT

 Three police officers and a taxi driver were killed and six people wounded in 
a bloody rampage late Tuesday that stunned the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected killers, a teen-age girl who recently ran away from home and her 
22-year-old boyfriend, a student, were captured after a wild car chase and a 
shootout in a park. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampage began at 9:25 p.m. Tuesday when a masked couple scaled a fence at 
a police car pound, sprayed tear gas at two police officers and made off with 
their pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 They then hijacked a taxi, taking the driver and his passenger hostage. As 
they sped through the city center, the driver rammed a police car on the Place 
de la Nation. 
</P>
<P>
 When two police officers got out of the car, they were gunned down, as was the 
taxi driver. A third officer still in the car and two passersby were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple then hijacked a second car and drove toward the Bois de Vincennes, 
a park in eastern Paris. In a second clash with police on motorcycles there, 
another police officer was killed and two other officers and the gunman were 
wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Audry Maupin, was hospitalized with gunshot wounds to the head 
and stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that the girl, 19-year-old Florence Rey, did most of the 
shooting.PEOPLE RU

FATAL ATTRACTIONS: EXPERTS SEE LINK IN HOW SOME CULTS CAN TURN KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 The scenes of 48 dead in picturesque Swiss villages Wednesday bore striking 
resemblances to those on a Texas plain and in a steamy jungle in Guyana -- 
previous sites of a fatal conjunction of religion, violence and communal 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, 913 followers of the Rev. Jim Jones died in Jonestown, Guyana. Most 
appeared to have taken their own lives by ingesting grape drink laced with 
potassium cyanide. Others were shot. And last year in Waco, Tex., about 80 
members of David Koresh's Branch Davidians died in a hail of gunfire and a 
blaze that followed a standoff with federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 What can drive groups like these to such acts? 
</P>
<P>
 From Jonestown to Waco, and perhaps now to the Swiss towns, cult members 
appear to be drawn to a charismatic leader and to anticipate a cataclysmic 
upheaval or feel a threat from outsiders, according to experts interviewed 
Wednesday. The members see no life for themselves outside the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am always correcting the term 'mass suicide,' " said Margaret Thaler 
Singer, a San Francisco clinical psychologist best known for her study of the 
1978 Jonestown massacre. ". . . It's done at the direction of a powerful leader 
who so controls information and information sources that he's the only one 
talking to them and urging them on. Often, they're at his mercy because there 
are armed guards." 
</P>
<P>
 Most cults are peaceful. Indeed, some become respected in their communities 
and even major denominations. Methodists and Mormons, for example, were once 
considered cult groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a minority of cases, the mixture of doomsday thinking and a charismatic 
leader can be a mutual fatal attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said that cult leaders "bind" and gain control over followers by 
depicting the outside world as a threat. Koresh, for example, had predicted 
that his followers would all die by fire, and Jones had apparently convinced 
his followers to participate in what he called "revolutionary suicide" as the 
answer to outside threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about the Swiss group, known as the Cross and Rose, discovered 
Wednesday, and experts cautioned against drawing conclusions based upon the 
information initially available. 
</P>
<P>
 However, early accounts said that the Cross and Rose seemed to isolate itself. 
Residents of nearby villages said they had no idea the group was involved in 
cult behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's apparent founder, Luc Jouret -- a practitioner of homeopathic 
medicine -- fled to Switzerland in 1993 when authorities in Canada, where he 
lived, issued a nationwide arrest warrant for him after he was charged with 
weapons possession and conspiracy. It was unknown if Jouret was among the 
victims Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also reported that both the Cross and Rose and another group Jouret 
founded in Canada, the Order of the Solar Temple, held apocalyptic views. 
</P>
<P>
 Religion experts said Wednesday that if the Canadian and Swiss groups held 
such views, their members would probably have other traits in common with the 
followers of Jones and Koresh. 
</P>
<P>
 Factors such as isolation can make members of cults particularly susceptible 
to group wishes, according to Robert Ellwood, a professor of religion at USC 
and author of several books on religion, including "Alternative Altars." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an implosion. They are pulled back from the world and get so much 
into their own ideology and own human relationships within the group that . . . 
they can't think of themselves being a person with a life apart from the 
group," Ellwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 When something happens that appears to threaten the existence of the group, 
Ellwood said, there comes a point when suicide seems the only way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, I don't quite get it," Ellwood added. "If it were a mass suicide, 
then you would say (a leader) had tremendous power. But if he and his henchmen 
just went out and shot them, that's maybe mass murder but it doesn't mean he 
had any mental power over them. He's just the one that has the guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Another expert joined Ellwood in pointing out that such traits as social 
isolation, constant focus on the group and an intense relationship with a 
leader do not necessarily lead to violence or death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be too quick to draw analogies," said J. Gordon Melton, author of The 
Encyclopedia of American Religions and head of the Institute for the Study of 
American Religion in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Melton noted that there are hundreds of groups with such traits whose 
activities do not culminate in mass murder or suicide.

HILL FOUND GUILTY IN ABORTION SHOOTINGS; VIOLENCE: THE FORMER MINISTER IS THE 
FIRST PERSON CONVICTED OF VIOLATING THE NATION'S NEW CLINIC ACCESS LAW. HE ALSO 
FACES MURDER CHARGES IN FLORIDA CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the first prosecution of its kind, a former minister was found guilty 
Wednesday of killing an abortion clinic doctor and his volunteer escort in 
violation of a new law that makes it a federal crime to harm or interfere with 
those who provide legal abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 As he had throughout the three-day trial in a Pensacola, Fla., courtroom, 
defendant Paul Hill, 40, showed little emotion when the verdict of the 
12-member jury was read. Later, he smiled benignly. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted of violating three counts of the federal law, Hill could face life 
in prison when he is sentenced Dec. 9. He was also found guilty of a federal 
firearms violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Hill is to be tried on state murder charges and could get the 
death penalty in the July 29 shotgun slayings of Dr. John B. Britton, 69, and 
the escort, James H. Barrett, 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as his own lawyer, Hill called no witnesses, nor did he cross-examine 
any of the dozen or so prosecution witnesses who placed him at the 
early-morning scene of the killings outside The Ladies Center in Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill's terse closing statement was nearly a carbon copy of his opening 
statement: "This government is unjust because it does not protect human life. 
To the extent we take part in this evil, we must answer to God. May God help us 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 A former Presbyterian minister well-known for advocating violence to stop 
abortions, Hill was the first person to be charged and tried under the Freedom 
of Access to Clinic Entrances Act passed four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of abortion charge that the law will do nothing to stop fanatics 
such as Hill, but will make it harder for anti-abortion demonstrators to make 
their case outside abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 But abortion-rights advocates welcomed the statute as evidence that the 
Justice Department under the Clinton Administration would take a more 
aggressive approach to halting anti-abortion violence than did the 
administrations of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 "This verdict sends a signal that anti-abortion violence will be stopped," 
said Patricia Ireland, president of the National Organization for Women. "We 
know that murder will not be tolerated at clinics. Now we need to know that 
other forms of violence, including bombings and inciting violence by those 
behind the scenes will not be tolerated either." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill had said he wanted to present a "necessity defense," arguing that his 
actions were justified to prevent a greater harm -- the killing of fetuses. But 
U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson denied a motion to permit that defense, saying 
that Hill had offered no evidence that abortion was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 After that ruling Tuesday, Hill dismissed his court-appointed lawyers and, 
representing himself, offered no defense at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the case went to the jury Wednesday, June Barrett, 68, the slain 
escort's widow who was also injured in the assault, said she saw Hill standing 
in the clinic parking lot as she, Britton and her husband arrived in the 
couple's pickup truck. She said she saw Hill approach, holding something in his 
hands. He was a familiar figure who often showed up at the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't identify it as a gun," she testified. "I said: 'Paul is pretending 
he is going to shoot us like little kids do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, she said, Hill opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 When he paused to reload, Britton asked: "Does Jim have his gun today?" she 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband sometimes carried a .38-caliber pistol locked in a box in 
the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'No, Jim didn't bring the gun today,' " she said. "Then there were 
more shots." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she dived to the floor of the truck as her husband stepped out. She 
remained there, closing her eyes until the shooting was over. When she opened 
her eyes, she saw blood dripping between the seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'Doc, are you OK?' " she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly losing her composure for the only time in her testimony, she then 
added that the doctor did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrett and her husband volunteered as clinic escorts once a month, shielding 
patients from protesters. They would also pick up Britton at the Pensacola 
airport and take him to the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Pensacola, a resort city on the Florida Panhandle's Gulf Coast, has been a 
hotbed of anti-abortion activity since a rash of clinic fire-bombings in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993 Dr. David Gunn, a doctor working in the city's other abortion clinic, 
was slain. His death helped prompt the new federal law.

SHUTTLE RADAR SURVEYING HALTED BECAUSE OF STEERING JET PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six tiny steering jets needed to precisely aim the radar instruments aboard 
space shuttle Endeavour shut down Wednesday because of a bad sensor and halted 
practically all observations. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA scrambled to put together a computer program to bypass the sensor, a task 
expected to take less than 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few hours, the radar continued to survey mountains, oceans and other 
sites using larger, clumsier jets to tilt the shuttle and radar in the proper 
direction. These jets used so much fuel, however, that flight controllers 
decided it wasn't worth it and suspended all but the most important radar 
observations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground controllers still hoped to survey today's intentional oil spill. German 
oceanographers planned to dump oil into the North Sea to see whether Endeavour 
could track the mess with its radar. 
</P>
<P>
 Two oil-recovery ships stood by to collect the 106 gallons of spilled diesel 
oil as soon as Endeavour passes overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner Alpers, a University of Hamburg oceanographer in charge of the 
experiment, wants to see whether Endeavour's powerful radar can distinguish 
between an oil spill and the film naturally produced by fish and plankton. 
</P>
<P>
 Space radar operating in one frequency, or wavelength, cannot tell the 
difference; Endeavour's radar has three frequencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists say permanently orbiting, advanced radar could allow spills to be 
detected and cleaned up more quickly.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Vince Gill made country music history Wednesday by becoming the first person 
to win top male vocalist four straight times. He also was voted entertainer of 
the year at the 28th annual Country Music Assn. awards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so thankful to be a part of it. I won't take it lightly. I'll treat you 
with class," the 37-year-old said in accepting the award at the Grand Ole Opry 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 He shared another award as part of the all-star compilation "Common Thread: 
The Songs of the Eagles," which won best album. 
</P>
<P>
 Other performers on the project included John Anderson, Clint Black, Suzy 
Bogguss, Brooks & Dunn, Billy Dean, Diamond Rio, Alan Jackson, Little Texas, 
Lorrie Morgan, Travis Tritt, Tanya Tucker and Trisha Yearwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Tillis won female vocalist of the year, denying Mary Chapin Carpenter a 
third straight honor in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 John Michael Montgomery exclaimed, "I love this country," as he accepted the 
single of the year award for "I Swear." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Jim McBride won song of the year, a songwriter's award, for 
Jackson's rollicking hit "Chattahoochee." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks & Dunn won their third straight vocal duo award. Also winning for the 
third straight time was Diamond Rio for top vocal group, equaling the awards in 
the category earned in the 1980s by The Judds and Alabama.

DASH, NOTABLE DEMOCRAT, JOINS WHITEWATER PROBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, apparently in an effort to deflect 
criticism that he is a partisan Republican, Wednesday added prominent 
Democratic lawyer Samuel Dash to a top position on the legal staff 
investigating Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash, 69, was chief counsel of the Senate Watergate Committee during its 
investigation and televised hearings into the 1970s scandal that forced 
President Richard Nixon from office. Starr said that he will furnish "ethical 
and professional advice" and will hold the title of ethics counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor of law at the Georgetown University Law Center, Dash is "a 
recognized scholar in the administration of criminal justice and professional 
responsibility," Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash's face became known to millions of television viewers because he was 
active in questioning many of Nixon's White House aides during the Watergate 
hearings. He developed many other questions asked by Committee Chairman Sen. 
Sam J. Ervin Jr. (D-N.C.) and other Democratic panel members. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Tuohey, an aide to Starr, said that Dash would help ensure the staff's 
commitment "to the highest standards of professional conduct and prosecution" 
as the office pursues its inquiry into a series of financial transactions 
involving the President and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the failure of an 
Arkansas savings and loan owned by a partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater 
real estate venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Dash's books are "The Eavesdroppers," published in 1959, which reports 
on a study he conducted of wiretapping and electronic surveillance, and the 
1975 book "Chief Counsel," his first-person account of the Senate's Watergate 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a special three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals named 
Starr, a conservative lawyer who was a Justice Department official in the last 
two Republican administrations, to take over the politically sensitive 
Whitewater investigation. Starr previously co-chaired a Virginia Republican's 
congressional campaign, helped raise funds for GOP candidates and opposed 
Clinton's claim that he was immune from a sexual harassment lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In rejecting demands that he step down, Starr noted that he also had been a 
federal appeals court judge and pledged that he would be "fair, just, thorough 
and prompt" in completing his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dash's appointment occurred on the same day that a key member from the staff 
of Starr's predecessor, Robert B. Fiske Jr., announced his departure. The 
lawyer, Rusty Hardin, said that he was returning to his law practice in 
Houston. Earlier, he had indicated that he would remain on the staff.

CITADEL'S PLAN FOR ASPIRING WOMEN CADETS: GO ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawyers for The Citadel on Wednesday presented the state-funded all-male 
military college's alternative plan for women hoping to become cadets: Go 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was a response to a July federal court order that also called for the 
admission of Shannon Faulkner, who has sued to join the school's prestigious 
Cadet Corps.Her hopes to become The Citadel's first female cadet were put on 
hold, however, until the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., 
can hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the alternative plan, called the South Carolina Women's Leadership 
Institute Program, The Citadel would pay for women seeking a single-gender 
military education to attend either of two schools in the state -- Columbia or 
Converse. The two are private colleges and the women would have to join the 
ROTC program at the University of South Carolina in Wofford. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are also expected to be provided for those who want military training on 
a coeducational campus. The alternative plan has to be approved by the federal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiming to hold on to its 152-year-old tradition, The Citadel has vigorously 
fought co-education for more than a year. Its all-male status was threatened 
when Faulkner, who had her sex deleted from her high school transcript, sued 
the school for rescinding her offer of admission upon learning that she was a 
woman. Instead of becoming a cadet, she became the first woman to take "day" 
classes at The Citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 Day students are civilians and cannot participate in any cadet activities such 
as eating in mess halls, sleeping in the barracks and playing in the school 
band.

TUNNEL TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First portion of the subway, Segment 1, is open. The recent problems have 
occurred in Segment 2; federal funding for Segment 3 is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 A chronology of mounting problems with construction and management of the 
multibillion-dollar Los Angeles subway project: 
</P>
<P>
 1993 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 29: The Times reports that numerous areas of the subway between Union 
Station and Pershing Square were built with concrete walls thinner than 
specified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 30: The federal Transportation Department begins its study of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 2: Transit officials discover that fewer than half of the ordered 
repairs of tunnel's construction defects have been done. They also fire from 
the project a top construction management official. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 3: U.S. expands a yearlong FBI investigation, naming U.S. attorney's 
office to oversee probe of construction deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 15: MTA officials delay awarding of $45-million contract to build 
Vermont-Beverly station until tunnel's structural soundness is verified. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 22: MTA appoints panel of three specialists to assess the safety and 
durability of tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 16: Water leakage caused millions of dollars in damage to the subway 
because a costly protective liner was poorly designed, installed and inspected, 
according to an MTA consultant's report obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 15: Mistakes and problems add about $200 million to subway costs, Times 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 16: Auditors say Tutor-Saliba, the biggest subway contractor in Los 
Angeles, has inflated expenses, according to a Times article. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nov. 17: Transit commissioners award two major contracts for $28.2 million 
and $44.9 million to contractor, Tutor-Saliba, pending a review of the 
contractor's work on twin tunnels already completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dec. 21: Transit officials announce that 11% of subway tunnels have concrete 
that is thinner than the design specifications of 12 inches, but are confident 
that tunnels are structurally sound because of extra rods of reinforcing steel. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 23: Independent tunnel panel reports that it found lax enforcement of 
construction requirements, along with previously undiscovered areas of thin 
concrete, air pockets and missing reinforcing steel in the tunnel wall. But it 
says tunnels are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * March 15: MTA halts tunnel work after a locomotive accident injures three 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 13: Transit officials acknowledge that nearly one-third of the subway 
tunnels under construction Downtown are misaligned and that some segments will 
need to be re-excavated. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 23: Methane and hydrogen sulfide gases are regularly entering the 
subway, The Times reports. The subway was built with the sensors inside the 
exhaust ducts, instead of inside the stations at the passenger platform level, 
as a committee of safety experts recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 18: State launches safety probe after three workers are injured in a 
welding-related explosion beneath Vermont Avenue and 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 11: State and federal occupational safety officials issue citations for 
80 alleged workplace hazards during Metro Rail construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 18: Tunneling beneath Hollywood Boulevard is shut down after street 
buckles and sinks along nine blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 11: The Times reports that transit officials waited six months before 
ordering the contractor to stabilize the ground with grout, in order to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 21: MTA chief hires a Caltrans executive to review troubled Rail 
Construction Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 26: Inferior materials -- wood wedges instead of steel struts -- were 
used for the bracing of subway tunnels, The Times reports. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 3: An outside analysis commissioned by the Los Angeles City Council 
criticizes construction and says tunneling contractor used inadequate tunneling 
procedures, including the failure to grout properly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 4: MTA executives issue a scathing condemnation of tunnel work from 
Hollywood to the Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 5: The Federal Transportation Administration announces that federal 
funding for the Los Angeles subway will be withheld until all questions 
regarding the mounting problems with construction and management project are 
resolved. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

1 SUSPECT HELD IN SLAYINGS, OTHER MISTAKENLY RELEASED

<TEXT>
<P>
 One suspect in a string of murders in Missouri, Arizona and Nevada was 
arrested Wednesday but a second suspect was inadvertently released. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Nicklasson, 22, an ex-convict from Missouri, was arrested without 
incident after being spotted hitchhiking along Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion, now thought by authorities to be Dennis J. Skillicorn, 34, was 
detained but released when a computer check showed no warrants under the name 
he gave officers. A third man was also detained and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklasson and Skillicorn, who is also an ex-convict and convicted murderer, 
are suspects in four murders in three states, as well as a shooting incident in 
a Huntington Beach shopping mall that began as an attempted purse snatching. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders began soon after Skillicorn was released from a four-month program 
at the Salvation Army rehabilitation center in Kansas City on Aug. 23 and left 
with Nicklasson. The two had met at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklasson and Skillicorn had not been positively spotted since Aug. 27. "We 
have an active manhunt going on right now," said FBI spokesman Ron Orrantia.

PANEL URGES EMPHASIS ON YOUTH CRIME PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The watchdog Little Hoover Commission has urged Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
Legislature to make crime prevention their top strategy in seeking to turn the 
tide of violent juvenile crime in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 158-page report issued Tuesday at the conclusion of a seven-month study, 
the bipartisan commission recommended the creation of an agency that would 
consolidate the state's juvenile crime-fighting programs and increase the 
coordination at the state and local levels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state must establish a high-profile, powerful organization that can 
provide the leadership needed to put prevention at the top of the list of 
crime-fighting strategies," said commission Chairman Richard Terzian. The 
commission is charged with recommending ways to make government more efficient 
and economical. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said that juvenile crime rates appear to have flattened during the 
past few years but that they remain unacceptably high. Arrests for violent 
crimes continue to increase, driven by climbing assault and homicide rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said local government funds for juvenile crime prevention have 
been "systematically undercut" for 20 years by a shift in emphasis to locking 
up young criminals in California Youth Authority facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet all research indicates the earlier an at-risk juvenile receives services, 
the more likely a successful outcome," Terzian said. "Prevention needs to be a 
top priority." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Wilson and legislative leaders, Terzian said an emphasis on 
prevention that involves schools, religious organizations, the family and 
government is needed to stop violent juvenile crime.

PEROT ADVISES VOTING FOR GOP TO GIVE PARTY ITS 'TURN AT BAT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Perot says Americans should let Republicans "have a turn at bat" by 
giving near-blanket support to GOP candidates for Congress and handing 
Republicans control of both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saying give these guys a chance," the Texas billionaire and 1992 
independent presidential candidate advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Perot vowed that if Republicans win control of the House and Senate and don't 
deliver, then he would form a third party that would. He sidestepped whether he 
would run for President again. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, his advice was loudly denounced Wednesday by the White House 
and Democratic leaders. They don't expect Perot's words to turn many votes but 
are too nervous about the midterm elections to risk letting them go unanswered. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were gleeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "We welcome it. I was pleased by what he said," said Haley Barbour, chairman 
of the Republican National Committee. "When Perot called for the election of a 
Republican Congress, he was accurately reflecting the views of the 20 million 
people who voted for him in 1992." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a favorite forum, CNN's "Larry King Live," Perot suggested Tuesday night 
that voters support Republican candidates for the House and Senate across the 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and Democratic leaders were quick to accuse him of trying to 
create mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that people will vote their self-interest, vote on the issues 
(and) not take Ross Perot's advice on this," said Democratic National Committee 
Chairman David Wilhelm. "I think people are smart, and they are not going to 
vote blindly for anybody. They are not going to do it because Ross Perot 
suggests it." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts questioned whether Perot's comments would have much practical effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the number of people who would be swayed by the statement is smaller 
than many people think. Many of the 1992 Perot voters are already inclined to 
vote for Republicans," said Stuart Rothenberg, an analyst and political 
newsletter publisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats control both chambers but are bracing for midterm losses, 
particularly in light of President Clinton's sagging approval ratings.

MOVES TO REFORM SUPERFUND LAW KILLED BY SQUABBLES; LEGISLATION: TALKS PRODUCE 
UNIQUE COALITION OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS, INDUSTRY AND INSURANCE INTERESTS. BUT 
DISPUTES PROVE FATAL TO MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Efforts to reform the 14-year-old Superfund law, one of the most widely used 
anti-pollution laws on the books, died in Congress Wednesday, one of a welter 
of environmental initiatives that have fallen by the wayside during the 
tumultuous 103rd Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise came after months of grueling negotiations had forged an 
extraordinary coalition among environmentalists, industrial interests and the 
insurance industry. However, the law became a victim of eleventh-hour disputes 
among lawmakers, labor unions and some electronic industry opponents of the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the real tragedy," said Marthena Cowart, spokeswoman for the 
Superfund Improvement Project, an insurance industry group that had backed the 
legislation. "It's a tragedy that well-intended efforts by literally hundreds 
of people in the most democratic process ever couldn't make this happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way it's all supposed to work, right?" she continued. "Of the 
people, by the people, for the people. And it didn't work out that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The end came when House Republicans balked at Democratic efforts to rush the 
bill to the House floor without amendments or debate and those involved in 
crafting the legislation declared simply that time had run out. Congress is to 
adjourn at the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "The epitaph of this effort would be, 'Here lies Superfund Reform; it died 
from too many people wanting just a little bit more,' " said retiring Rep. Al 
Swift (D-Wash.), an architect of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Superfund now joins a virtual junkyard of dead and dying environmental 
initiatives on Capitol Hill. Last week, lawmakers halted an effort to reform an 
1872 law governing mining on federal lands. Other environmental bills blocked 
in Congress this session would have elevated the Environmental Protection 
Agency to Cabinet status, established new guidelines to curb pollution of the 
nation's waterways, set new directions for federal flood policy and protected 
fisheries from over-exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, efforts to pass a law setting new standards for drinking 
water purity and another designating a huge tract of California as national 
park land clung precariously to life as the congressional clock ticked down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has not been a very good year for environmental legislation," said Sen. 
Max Baucus (D-Mont.), chairman of the Senate committee that marked up the 
Superfund reform measure. "The Superfund bill got caught up in the 
partisanship. It wasn't the substance of the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the bill had been passed by the House, observers had said it was 
unclear whether the Senate's Republican leadership would have allowed such a 
high-profile piece of legislation that had White House backing to come to a 
vote this year. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) in recent weeks had 
suggested that he would not support bringing the bill to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the success of other environmental legislation has been in question 
from the start, until recently few believed that the Superfund reform bill, 
with its broad array of backers, would fall victim to the centrifugal forces in 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition backing Superfund legislation included virtually all major 
parties to past disputes over the sweeping law, including corporate giants that 
have been nabbed for major pollution spills, environmental and community 
groups, small business and major insurance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If groups as contrary as those in this coalition can put aside their 
differences for the sake of the economy and the environment, surely Congress 
should be able to do as much," Baucus said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday, lawmakers and EPA Administrator Carol Browner conceded that 
Congress could not put aside its differences and discontinued efforts to get 
the bill passed. 
</P>
<P>
 House Republicans, joined by a minority of Democrats, had pressed for the 
right to vote on amendments that would have relaxed the bill's groundwater 
protection standards further, strengthened a requirement to conduct 
cost-benefit analyses in support of Superfund cleanups and dictated that 
laborers working at cleanup sites be paid prevailing regional wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift called those provisions "killer amendments" that were unacceptable to 
managers of the bill and the House's Democratic leadership. "The fact was, we 
couldn't get there from here," Swift said. 
</P>
<P>
 Swift retires at the end of the current term but he and others involved in the 
reform effort predicted that many members of the coalition will stick together 
to try to pass a bill next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the death of the bill brought expressions of anger and 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Roberts, legislative director for the Environmental Defense Fund, 
said that, by failing to enact the legislation, "Congress is likely to cause an 
already slow program to slow further, allow runaway litigation to continue and 
betray yet again the hundreds of communities waiting for relief." 
</P>
<P>
 One in four Americans lives within four miles of a toxic waste site scheduled 
for cleanup under the Superfund program. But after government expenditures of 
roughly $1.5 billion yearly -- and far more on the part of private industry -- 
only 237 of the 1,344 toxic waste sites deemed in need of emergency cleanup 
have been declared clean. California, with 96 sites on the Superfund list, has 
one of the largest shares in the country of such polluted sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In crafting the compromise that was set aside on Wednesday, lawmakers and 
Administration officials had focused mainly on the unintended costs of a 
program that has set off a decade-long frenzy of litigation among the federal 
government, corporate polluters, insurance companies, and, occasionally, 
unsuspecting bystanders.

LAWMAKERS OK LEGISLATION TO FIX 'NANNY TAX' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congressional negotiators agreed late Wednesday to update and simplify the 
"nanny tax," the Social Security law that sank Zoe Baird's nomination for 
attorney general and turned thousands of household employers into tax cheats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have decriminalized baby-sitting," Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) 
said in announcing the compromise.The legislation now goes to the House and 
Senate for final votes and is expected to be signed into law by President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would require household employers to pay Social Security and 
Medicare taxes on any worker earning at least $1,000 a year, up from the 
current threshold of $50 a quarter, or $200 a year. Teen-age baby-sitters would 
be exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising the threshold and requiring employers to file taxes once a year, 
instead of quarterly, lawmakers believe more people will pay taxes for their 
employees, allowing them to qualify for benefits from Social Security when they 
retire or become disabled.

PRESIDENT SIGNS $263.8-BILLION DEFENSE MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton signed a $263.8-billion defense spending bill Wednesday that 
authorizes another aircraft carrier, three guided-missile destroyers and six 
C-17 airlifters. 
</P>
<P>
 It also authorizes development funds for a new attack submarine, the F-22 
fighter, a Marine V-22 tilt-rotor troop carrier and a new Army reconnaissance 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which Clinton said will provide for a strong national defense, 
represents a $2.8 billion increase over the 1994 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 
30. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjusted for inflation, however, that translates into a defense spending cut 
of slightly less than 1%, marking the 10th consecutive real decline in the 
defense budget. In all, 18% of the total federal budget would go for defense 
under the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure encourages but does not order Clinton to lift the international 
arms embargo over Bosnia. In a statement issued after the signing, Clinton said 
he interprets the legislation as leaving "flexibility to calibrate our actions 
as events develop."

FASHION / INSIDE OUT: BROWN-BASED LIPSTICKS KISS OFF THE RED MENACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York fashion magazine editors may splash their pages with fuchsia disco 
makeup applied by the darlings of the avant-garde. But when their royal 
highnesses head out for a night on the town, they book an appointment with 
makeup artist Bobbi Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's take on fall's color-saturated palette is simple: "If you look great 
in red lipstick, great. But if you look silly, forget it." Blondes, in her 
opinion, fall into the latter category -- yellow hair plus ruby lips equals 
color overkill. Amazingly enough, though, thin-lipped women needn't rule red 
out completely. "I know a lot of women who have thin lips who look good in red 
lipstick." 
</P>
<P>
 The reddest hue in her brown-based product line -- Essentials -- is No. 10. 
"I've replaced a lot of my friends' YSL red lipstick with it. It's bright, but 
not glaring." But before spilling for a tube, Brown -- who will visit Neiman 
Marcus in Beverly Hills on Wednesday -- suggests experimenting with degrees of 
red. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a red lipstick pencil. Draw it over whatever lipstick you have 
and you'll get a reddish tint." And relax. "It's not brain surgery," she says. 
</P>

 The Natural World: We're not an outdoor person, particularly. But we were 
utterly mesmerized by a photo journey into that parallel universe, courtesy of 
Evelyn Lauder's new book, "The Seasons Observed." Published by Abrams to 
coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness month, the book is a fund-raising 
vehicle. Its proceeds will go to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. Lauder, 
senior corporate vice president of Estee Lauder, shot the book's 76 photographs 
over the past dozen years while traveling around the world for business and 
pleasure. "When you're in the country, what you see and smell has a 
tranquilizing effect," she said. "That's what I try to convey." 
</P>
<P>
 Lauder herself is a combination of tranquillity and accomplishment: During the 
course of a phone conversation, the former teacher simultaneously juggled the 
seating arrangements for an impending dinner party. "That was easy!" she said 
with a laugh. Asked if the disease had touched her friends or relatives, Lauder 
answered: "Is there anybody you don't know who hasn't been touched by it in 
some way?"  
</P>
<P>
 Lauder will sign her book Wednesday at 3 p.m. at Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills 
and Oct. 13 at noon at Bullock's South Coast Plaza, then at 4 p.m. at Bullock's 
Sherman Oaks.

 Born to Be Styled: The chunky sterling silver jewelry was exquisite and the 
superbly made jackets were spectacular. OK, so it wasn't Chanel and everything 
did smell slightly of exhaust fumes. The Los Angeles Harley-Davidson dealership 
fashion show Friday night in South Gate featured volunteer models on a 
makeshift runway in the parts department -- all of them upstaged by the 
introduction of the newest Harley, the 1995 all-black Bad Boy. But like Chanel, 
this invitation-only audience of best customers (bikers who'd spent $1,000 or 
more in the last year in sales, service or parts) were polite as they watched 
the show and feasted on champagne and gourmet cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealership co-owner Tom Elsaesser says clothing has become an important part 
of his business. "Ten years ago, there were just two jackets hanging in the 
back. Now, we sell more clothing than replacement parts by a ratio of 3 to 1."  
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense. Bikes and parts are expensive (an average bike is $14,000 to 
$18,000) but cool leather jackets that can stand up to encounters with asphalt 
are around $400. Try that in a pantywaist Chanel jacket.

this week to raise money for breast cancer research. Produced under the 
auspices of the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA), the shirt's 
message reads: "Fashion Targets Breast Cancer" and carries a target.  
</P>
<P>
 The shirts sell for $15, with $5 from every sale designated for the Nina Hyde 
Center for Breast Cancer Research at Georgetown University Medical Center in 
Washington, D.C. Lauren, chairman of the target effort, established the center 
in 1989 to honor the Washington Post fashion editor, who died of breast cancer 
in 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 "We figure the T-shirt will raise $2.5 million," Lauren said. "To get the word 
out, magazine publishers gave us about $3 million worth of space to run the 
double-page ads."

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: NOT JUST A T-SHIRT KIND OF CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BETTY GOODWIN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Series: "Friends" (NBC, Thursdays, 8:30 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Six buddies, all in their 20s, discuss life or whatever else comes 
up, mostly in Monica's (Courtney Cox, pictured) New York apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: A former New York-based fashion, hat and jewelry 
designer, Debra McGuire has also outfitted the series "Family Album," several 
movies of the week and the upcoming feature "S.F.W." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: There's an agreeable, comfortable hipness about this bunch who 
blessedly own more than jeans and T-shirts, the mainstay of most television 
boomer and slacker wardrobes. Obvious effort has been made to give each 
character a well-developed fashion ego in a struggling, Lower East Side, New 
York vein. The result is that you can admire them and their eccentricities, but 
none is so picture-perfect that you want to set a torch to your own closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hit and Miss: Most wonderful are the coltish Monica (of the shiny, black, 
long-layered hair -- just crying out for a shampoo sponsor) and everyday-guy 
Chandler (Matthew Perry). They both know all about putting together vintage 
flea market finds with new store-bought treasures that suit their shapes and 
personalities. Monica favors full-cut trousers and loose, ankle-length dresses 
that skim her reedy body. Chandler opts for old, quirky, patterned shirts, 
vests and ties. But already tiresome is Joey (Matt LeBlanc) in his James 
Dean-Marlon Brando rebel get-ups -- black leather jackets, black T-shirts and 
all-important greasy hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Body Watch: More and more, women's arms have become to the '90s what their 
legs were to the '60s. It's striking that while Monica favors skirts that 
virtually graze the sidewalk, and Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) and Rachel (Jennifer 
Aniston) alternate between short and long hemlines, all three women noticeably 
expose the entirety of their perfectly toned little arms. Sleeveless vests, 
sleeveless dresses and shirts with cut-off sleeves are the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "For any actor or actress, the hardest thing is to dress outside of 
who you are," McGuire says. "I went through it with the boys, but more with the 
girls. At first they wanted to look the way they always look and wear jeans and 
T-shirts. They'd say, 'Oh I can't wear that.' 'I never wear that color.' But 
now there's a lot of trust. I've convinced them I have no ego involved. I have 
no other agenda beyond how they look. That's my only focus."

 No one is happier about returning to the drag boat races at Puddingstone Lake 
this year than Clinton Anderson. Almost a year ago, he was being pulled out of 
the water in Phoenix after crashing a Top Fueler in a test drive -- and he 
wasn't breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 But not only did he fully recover from the accident, he was back in his boat 
by March, and has won four of the five IHBA (International Hot Boat Assn.) 
races this year. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, Anderson will compete against other Top Fueler racers, including 
record-holder Ron Braaksma of San Bernardino, in the IHBA Mission Foods 
Fallnationals. 
</P>
<P>
 The grassy hillsides of Bonelli Park offer great views of the lake, so bring a 
blanket or lawn chair and prepare to watch 14 classes of drag boats going 220 
to 235 m.p.h. in qualifying matches Saturday and the finals Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event -- which offers food concessions and vendor booths -- is 
family-oriented, says promoter Jeff Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission also includes pit passes, where you can watch pit crews at work. 
"The boats like the ones in Clinton's class get their engines torn down after 
each race," Wolf says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're rebuilt in less than an hour and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Gates open at 7 a.m. each day; racing is from 9 a.m. to about 4:30 p.m. 
Puddingstone Lake, Frank G. Bonelli Park, 120 E. Via Verde, San Dimas. 
Saturday, $18; Sunday, $22; children under 12 get in free. (800) DRAG-INFO.

R S V P / INTO THE NIGHT: NO PLACE FOR CRIMINAL TYPES

 The Scene: The Los Angeles Police Department's 125th anniversary gala Tuesday 
at the Century Plaza. The evening was also a tribute to "Dragnet" star Jack 
Webb, whose minimalist acting style was best described by Ron Glass as 
"straightforward." 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: With a strong law enforcement community turnout, this certainly 
was one of the safer black-tie dinners of the season. Also among the 800 guests 
joining Chief Willie L. Williams and organizers Richard Kalk, Quint Villanueva 
and Arthur Kassel were two-dozen actors who have played police roles. They 
included Ed Marinaro, James B. Sikking, Kent McCord, Max Gail, Dennis Franz, Ed 
Holliman, Angie Dickinson, Robert Stack and Erik Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniquely LAPD: One of the more eye-catching silent auction items was a .38 
Colt Detective Special. It's not often one sees a gun laid out on a table at a 
benefit gala. One officer wrote a note on a bar napkin saying: "Please do not 
remove pistol from display case." This would seem like a good idea. With about 
a zillion cops standing close by, this was no place to be waving a .38 around. 
It sold for $500. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: With tickets from $250 to $1,000, more than $200,000 was netted 
for the Los Angeles Police History and Community Education Center in Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got real enthused about this when I found out they were going to use it as 
an educational center for young people and a meeting place for seniors," 
Williams said. "It brings together two of our most important groups: Our young 
people, who we're trying to save, and our seniors, who in a sense have saved 
the world for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Advice: Bruce Weitz of "Hill Street Blues" on the secret of a successful 
TV cop show: "It's like the secret of any other show," he said. "Follow 
'Roseanne.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Most Left-Handed Compliment: While speaking about "Dragnet," the narration of 
the Webb video tribute said: "And he would shoot an entire episode in one day 
with no rehearsal." Perhaps it's even scarier to consider that Webb might have 
rehearsed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Program: Emceed by John Beard, it included performances by Jay Leno, Linda 
Eder and Scott Record. The Jack Webb Award was presented to philanthropist 
Robert Ahmanson (son William accepted) and law enforcement consultant Donald 
Santarelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the Facts, Ma'am: Of Santarelli's long-winded acceptance speech, one 
woman said wryly, "He was certainly more verbose than Jack Webb."

CHARGES DROPPED IN LAGUNA ARSON WHEN 'CONFESSION' IS PROVED BOGUS; COURTS: O.C. 
PROSECUTORS ADMIT THEY WERE DUPED, VERIFY SUSPECT WAS IN MEXICAN JAIL DURING 
LAST YEAR'S FIRESTORM. 
</P>

<P>
 Admitting they were duped by a bogus confession, Orange County prosecutors on 
Wednesday dropped an arson charge against the man accused of sparking last 
year's Laguna Beach firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 The stunning dismissal of the most serious of four arson charges against Jose 
Soto Martinez, 26, came after investigators belatedly discovered that he was 
locked up in a Mexican prison when the fire was set last Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of faith that (a conviction) couldn't happen because of all the 
proof we had," said Teresa Campos, Martinez's mother, who told investigators 
her son had an ironclad alibi. "I knew he was innocent. And now I feel very 
contented, happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime after he was arrested Sept. 16 in connection with starting three 
small fires in Fullerton, Martinez told investigators that he also had set the 
Laguna blaze. In what prosecutors said was surprisingly accurate detail, he 
described where and how the fire was lit, and explained that he started the 
blaze to conjure up a demon god named Gotam. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on his confession, Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi 
announced at a press conference last Friday that he had filed charges against 
the man "responsible" for "willfully and maliciously" starting the devastating 
fire, which damaged or destroyed 441 homes and caused $528 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district attorney's case started to unravel less than a day later when 
Martinez's mother, who had reported her son missing and was unaware that he had 
been arrested, was quoted in a newspaper saying her son was serving time in a 
Mexican prison 1,200 miles away when the firestorm occurred. She said her son 
confessed only because he is delusional and believes mobsters want to kill him. 
She said he thought he would be safe in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the first time prosecutors had heard of a possible alibi. Martinez, 
whose true name is Jaime Saille Higuera, never even told investigators that he 
had family in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Following that published report, investigators interviewed the mother and flew 
to Mexico to verify Martinez's record at the prison in Mazatlan. After 
reviewing the information, which included fingerprints, medical records and 
interviews with the prison warden and inmates, the investigators determined 
that Martinez had been incarcerated from May 15, 1993 -- five months before the 
Laguna fire -- until July 8, 1994 -- eight months after the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, 50, said she did not feel any anger at the Orange County district 
attorney's office for filing the arson charges against her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. No, I don't feel anger," said Campos, who attended the court hearing with 
other family members. "I knew that he had a problem. He has this (mental) 
problem. But I knew that the system here, given proof that he was somewhere 
else, that said he was in jail at the time, that he would be found not guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez is still being held without bail in Orange County Jail for the three 
other arson charges stemming from the Fullerton fires, and Riverside County 
authorities have not ruled him out as a suspect in an Aug. 5 brush fire at 
Green River. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of last year's horrifying Laguna fire, who were elated last week when 
they heard that the arsonist responsible for the blaze had been arrested and 
charged, said Wednesday that their hopes have been dashed. The residents of the 
upscale beach community, however, said they would rather have the charge 
dropped than convict an innocent man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're disappointed," said Kathleen Blackburn, a Laguna Beach 
councilwoman. "Thank heaven they recognized he was wasn't the one. I hope they 
do find the person responsible. It would give our residents a sense of closure 
to a rather unattractive incident. . . . (But) it would have been nice if he 
was the one." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County fire officials, who had stopped actively investigating the case 
about three months ago and reopened it only when Martinez confessed to starting 
the blaze, said Wednesday they were also disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating that the person who did this is still out there, although 
nobody wants to see someone in jail who is wrongly accused," said Orange County 
Fire Capt. Dan Young. "We had more than a thousand leads and nothing. This came 
along and we reopened the case. But now we have no other leads." 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms said the investigation "is still open" and he 
did not fault the district attorney's decision to charge Martinez with setting 
the Laguna blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, we are disappointed that at this point in time we don't have the 
specific answer as to who started the fire," he said. "Based on information 
available to the D.A. and investigators, they proceeded in the appropriate 
manner on what appeared to be a solid case. I would have done the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the charge was dismissed, law enforcement officials said they were 
perplexed as to how Martinez might have had such intimate knowledge about the 
Laguna fire, especially since he was in prison at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's attorneys from the public defender's office have openly criticized 
the way the district attorney has handled the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler has said he thinks the district attorney 
didn't thoroughly investigate the case or exercise enough caution in filing the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Butler said he was surprised that investigators never contacted 
Martinez's mother, who lives in Fullerton and had even filed a missing persons 
report on her son days before Capizzi's press conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That report referred to Martinez as Jaime Saille Higuera, but Fullerton police 
acknowledge that they were aware of both names at the time of Martinez's 
arrest. Officials said Wednesday that they are looking into why a connection 
was never made between the missing person report and the man they had in 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler also contended that prosecutors violated Martinez's constitutional 
rights by interviewing him even after Martinez had obtained a court-appointed 
lawyer to represent him on the Fullerton arson charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Some law enforcement officials have also suggested that Capizzi may have 
hastily filed the case when news leaked that a suspect, who had made a 
confession, was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office, however, stood by its investigation and its 
decision to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We acted in good faith on an individual, who, as best as we could verify, was 
telling the truth," said Capizzi, noting Martinez had been arrested while 
allegedly starting a fire in Fullerton and had made a confession that contained 
accurate information about the Laguna blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the information that was available to investigators, Capizzi said, "we 
would have been remiss if we delayed filing." 
</P>
<P>
 A six-page document presented in court Wednesday further explained the 
prosecution's move, and defended the decision to charge Martinez with the 
Laguna fire. The document states that "although Martinez admitted setting this 
(Laguna Beach) blaze several times, he did so with some hesitancy, leading 
investigators to believe he was telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael L. Fell, who handled the case and made the motion 
in court Wednesday to drop the Laguna arson charge, said, "The information 
given to investigators was very concise. The information, drawings, statements, 
tenor and repeated consistency of his stories led us to believe that we 
actually had the suspect who started the Laguna Beach fires." 
</P>
<P>
 Fell said that on Sept. 19, Martinez guided Fullerton investigators -- "who 
did not know where the (Laguna) fire started" -- to within 10 feet of its point 
of origin. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the document filed in court, Martinez then proceeded to re-enact 
how he had set the fire, and in addition, "correctly indicated the device (used 
to start the fire), weather conditions and direction of the fire, once set." 
</P>
<P>
 Peering into the television cameras that lined the courtroom's jury box, Fell 
stressed that "at no time from Sept. 16 until (his Monday arraignment) did the 
defendant ever deny that . . . he started that fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "At no time did the defendant ever say he had an alibi or that he was in a 
Mexican prison. The defendant never said that he had family in the states; his 
contention was that his family was all in Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Laguna charge was dismissed, Martinez faced a maximum of 30 years 
in prison because he faced four felony charges and had a previous conviction 
for a residential burglary in San Diego, which counts as a strike under the 
state's new three-strikes law. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Martinez now faces a prison term of 19 years and eight months, 
although the overwhelming majority of defendants convicted over the past five 
years on the charges Martinez now faces have been punished with less than a 
year in jail and three years or less on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's court hearing, Fell defended the district attorney's 
office's handling of the case, saying it was "not at all" embarrassed by the 
turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you frankly," Fell said, "that's what we're here for. It is just as 
much our responsibility to dismiss charges against an innocent person as it is 
to prosecute a guilty person. That's exactly what we did here." 
</P>
<P>
 Fell declined to answer questions about the other, unexplained evidence 
prosecutors cited in defending their decision to charge Martinez. "We don't 
want to get into specifics at this time. Our policy is that there still is 
someone out there who did this." 
</P>
<P>
 South Court Municipal Judge Arthur G. Koelle granted Fell's motions, and also 
teased him for launching into an explanation why the motion should be granted 
after the action had been taken.

LEAKS TO PRESS PROMPTED D.A.'S RUSH TO FILE CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Orange County prosecutors rushed to file criminal charges against Jose Soto 
Martinez for the Laguna Beach firestorm because details about their prime 
suspect began surfacing in the press. But at least one investigator cautioned 
against acting prematurely, saying that more information could be gathered with 
an appeal to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the suddenness of the inquiry and questions from you guys (in the 
media) put some pressure on the D.A. to file," said Fullerton Fire Chief Marc 
Martin, who was among those flanking Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi when the 
charges were announced last Friday. Martin described the press conference as 
"put together hastily." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Fullerton Fire Marshal John Clark, whose firefighters captured Martinez 
at the scene of a Fullerton fire: "There was lots of pressure to put the story 
out, because of the rumors that he was involved in the Laguna fire." Clark said 
he was informed of the Friday press conference about three hours before it 
began. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Capizzi acknowledged that the media played a part in the 
timing of the charges, but said the decision was not made in haste. "It had 
been a matter that had been investigated for two weeks. The fact that on 
Thursday members of the media became aware of it meant that it was no longer 
possible to do any confidential investigating. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the evidence was "quite strong, and there was no reason to 
delay." He said the decision to proceed with charges immediately after the 
first newspaper reports was a "consensus" decision of the agencies involved, 
and he was unaware of suggestions that a public appeal for information might 
help the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler, whose office is representing Martinez, said 
that the wrong person occasionally gets accused of crime when prosecutors "rush 
to judgment" and don't do their homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens every day that innocent people are arrested," Butler noted, "but 
it never rises to the level of a press conference being called to announce that 
someone is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 One investigator involved in the case said that prosecutors brushed aside a 
suggestion that authorities simply announce Martinez had been jailed for three 
small Fullerton fires and had confessed to the Laguna fire. That way, 
authorities could have asked the public's help in verifying Martinez's claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Had that scenario been followed, prosecutors might have been spared the 
embarrassment of having to drop the charges against Martinez only five days 
after they were announced with much fanfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after he was accused of the Laguna fire and Martinez's booking 
photograph appeared in newspapers and on television, information surfaced that 
the 26-year-old transient was five months into a 14-month stint in a Mexican 
prison when the October, 1993, firestorm occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Having confirmed his alibi with Mexican authorities, the district attorney's 
office filed a motion in South County Municipal Court on Wednesday to dismiss 
the charges involving the Laguna Beach fire, and to transfer the remaining 
charges on the three small Fullerton fires back to North County court. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion also included an extraordinary, five-page declaration explaining 
the prosecution's move, and defending its original decision to charge Martinez 
with the Laguna fire, which destroyed or damaged 441 homes or businesses, 
causing $528 million in damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The document filed in court stated that "although Martinez admitted setting 
this (Laguna Beach) blaze several times, he did so with some hesitancy, leading 
investigators to believe he was telling the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez still faces three felony counts in connection with the Fullerton 
fires, the same charges that would have kept him behind bars while his claims 
to be the Laguna Beach arsonist were investigated further. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no hurry to file because we had this guy on a no-bail hold" for the 
Fullerton fires, said one source who asked not to be identified. "I think this 
was a political decision because of all the anti-illegal immigrant sentiment 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's immigration status is in dispute. On the day of the press 
conference, he was said to be an illegal immigrant, but that has been denied by 
the family. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials familiar with the investigation, there was no talk of 
filing charges against Martinez even the day before Capizzi made his 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling was, we didn't have to hurry the filing and we were still trying 
to investigate, even though we thought we had a strong case. Then on Friday 
morning, we found out there was going to be a press conference," one official 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county fire officials wanted the information about Martinez kept 
quiet for as long as possible, Orange County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms said he 
fully supported Capizzi's decision to file charges when he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never have too much information and your facts can never be too solid 
when you get into a case," Holms said. "Our desire with the D.A. and the 
investigation team was to corroborate information that Mr. Martinez had given." 
</P>
<P>
 When local newspapers on Friday reported that Martinez was being questioned as 
a suspect, and had even confessed to the Laguna fire, Holms said, it made sense 
for charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information in the press appeared to corroborate what had already been 
put together by investigators," he said. "At that point, the filing was made 
for the public good and to get information out to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Holms said the investigation will be reopened, although the Martinez 
confession was by far the most promising of the nearly 1,000 leads arson 
investigators have reviewed over the past year. Information was so scarce three 
months ago that the investigation was halted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most law enforcement officials said they would have made the same decision as 
Capizzi, and said that he ultimately made the right call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It speaks highly of the D.A. that he didn't wait and sit on this 
information," said Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil J. Purcell. "With any 
information about this fire, the sooner the better. There are people trying to 
put their lives together. Unfortunately, a couple of days later, they are 
hearing that the suspect in custody may not be a solid suspect."

SUSPECT IN 4 MURDERS HELD IN SAN DIEGO; 2ND IS DETAINED BUT MISTAKENLY RELEASED 
</P>

<P>
 One suspect in a string of murders in Missouri, Arizona and Nevada, as well as 
an abortive purse snatching in Huntington Beach, was arrested Wednesday but a 
second was inadvertently released. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Nicklasson, 22, an ex-convict from Missouri, was arrested without 
incident after being seen hitchhiking on Interstate 805. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion, now thought by authorities to be Dennis J. Skillicorn, 34, was 
detained but released when a computer check showed no warrants under the name 
he gave officers. A third man was also detained and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklasson and Skillicorn, who is also an ex-convict and convicted murderer, 
are suspects in four murders in three states, as well as a shooting incident in 
a Huntington Beach shopping mall that began as an attempted purse snatching. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders began soon after Skillicorn was released from a four-month program 
at the Salvation Army rehabilitation center in Kansas City on Aug. 23 and left 
with Nicklasson. The two had met at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have an active manhunt going on right now," said FBI spokesman Ron 
Orrantia. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklasson and Skillicorn had not been positively spotted since Aug. 27, when 
a a 30-year-old Huntington Beach woman told police that a man wearing a red 
baseball cap grabbed her purse from her shopping cart at Hughes' Market on 
Algonquin Street and ran from the store. Another shopper chased the man, who 
dropped the purse and fired three shots at his pursuer, who was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
 A dark blue Dodge Ram Charger with Arizona plates was spotted near the market, 
and police traced it to Nicklasson and Skillicorn.

 Wet driving conditions and fuel leaking from a big rig apparently spurred a 
21-vehicle pileup on the San Diego Freeway in Irvine, causing minor injuries 
and clogging traffic for two hours Wednesday morning, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The chain-reaction crash came during a morning of sporadic downpours that 
flooded a library at Cal State Fullerton and contributed to scattered traffic 
mishaps, including the loosening of a boulder that crashed into a truck on 
Ortega Highway and left the driver shaken but unhurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said a big rig leaking diesel fuel had passed on the freeway in 
Irvine shortly before the cars slid out of control and slammed into each other 
about 10:30 a.m. along a half-mile northbound stretch south of the Jamboree 
Road exit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no stopping. It was like a hockey puck on ice," said California 
Highway Patrol Officer Dan Lyons, one of five officers sorting out the string 
of seven separate collisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons, who was pulling over the truck about three miles farther north when he 
was called to the crash, said it was unclear how much diesel fuel leaked onto 
the freeway. Lyons said a motorist had alerted him to the leaking truck. Some 
motorists reported smelling diesel fuel immediately after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said wet driving conditions shortly after a downpour and dense 
traffic also contributed to the string of crashes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A small amount of diesel fuel on the roadway mixed with water -- it was just 
like ice," said CHP Officer Angel Johnson. She said the crash was under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists said their brakes were useless as cars began skidding into each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, cars started spinning out in front of me and they jumped on 
the brakes. I got rear-ended and sideswiped and then I spun out," said an 
uninjured motorist from San Clemente whose van was badly dented. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the crash began near the Jamboree Road off-ramp.  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine resident David Tokaji sat in a tow truck that was about to haul off his 
damaged Volkswagen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car in front of me started weaving and I just lost control," Tokaji said. 
"I tried to apply my brakes but it was futile." 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of many accidents on slick roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Recorded rainfall in the county ranged from .04 of an inch in San Juan 
Capistrano to .31 in Newport Beach. Anaheim had .06 of an inch; El Toro .16; 
and Santa Ana .10 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The storm system is rolling out," said meteorologist Curtis Brack of 
WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. Brack said it will be 
sunny and warmer into the weekend, as a weak Santa Ana wind pattern sets in. 
The forecast calls for highs ranging from the upper 60s to the upper 70s, with 
a few high clouds and patchy low clouds in the mornings, with sunny skies in 
the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A heavy rain just after 6 a.m. Wednesday contributed to a crash that injured 
two people and snarled traffic for an hour on North Coast Highway in Laguna 
Beach, police said. A Jeep Wagoneer driven by Joseph Barbot, 52, of Newport 
Beach, slid out of control on a pool of water near Emerald Bay and crashed into 
a car going in the opposite direction, said Sgt. Jim White. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbot and the other driver, Linda Kocisak, 48, of Laguna Beach, were listed 
in fair condition Wednesday afternoon at Mission Hospital Regional Medical 
Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain accumulating on the flat roof of the Cal State Fullerton Library leaked 
into the facility's busy reference section, causing staff to unplug and move 
computers and remove thousands of books from shelves, after more than a dozen 
were damaged irreparably by the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had every wastebasket in the building under the leaks," said Patricia L. 
Bril, associate university librarian. "We're hoping the shelves won't rust."

FEELING THE PINCH; ANGLERS SPRING TRAPS ON OPENING DAY OF LOBSTER SEASON; '

 Excited by the start of lobster fishing season, seafood connoisseurs Robert 
and Genevieve Noyes drove from Ontario to Dana Point on Wednesday to buy $80 
worth of lobsters that had just been hauled into port. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had tried to get them by phone, but I couldn't get through," Robert Noyes 
said. "We're getting the lobsters now because it's such a short season." 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial lobster fishing season began at midnight Tuesday, the moment at 
which the state Department of Fish and Game allowed fishermen to begin hauling 
their traps from the water. The fishermen were allowed to set traps for the 
California spiny lobsters last Thursday and to bait them earlier Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm that accompanied the start of the season was both good news and bad. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The choppy ocean stirred up the sea floor and made waters murky, which causes 
lobsters to crawl, often to traps. But the choppiness also tossed the small 
boats around, making trap salvaging difficult, said many of the dozen or so 
commercial fishermen at Dana Point.  
</P>
<P>
 Conditions were so bad that some couldn't check their traps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went out yesterday to bait the traps and we had to turn around before we 
could bait them all," said Pat McDonald, a Dana Point fisherman. "Right now, 
it's too rough out there, but I'm willing to bet it's going to be a good 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Some were a little less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the lobsters go, it's hard to say how good of a year it's going to 
be," said Rodger Healy, a fisherman from Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the lobsters caught Wednesday were fetching $6.25 to $7.25 a pound 
from buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of response, but it looks like the weather is not permitting," 
said Loi Diep, a buyer for Wellco Trading Corp. in Los Angeles. "Our company 
expected 3,000 coming in today, but it looks more like 500." 
</P>
<P>
 Although there was no official tally, the haul was not as high as expected. 
But fishermen said they expect the next few days to be better. 
</P>
<P>
 They advised consumers to buy lobsters now, because with the number of 
commercial lobster fishing boats along the California coasts, the lobsters 
probably will be fished out a month into the season, which officially ends 
March 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your lobster now, before the end of December, or you'll be paying $30 a 
lobster," warned John Mushnick, a Dana Point fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Noyes won't be. At the end of December, he will be enjoying Wednesday's 
catch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have them boiled, split and cleaned. We'll have some for 
dinner tonight, and then we'll freeze the rest." Lobster Tale Each year, 
commercial fishemen in the waters off Orange and Los Angeles counties catch 
more than $1.3 million worth of California spiny lobster. A six-year trend: *

REACHING A 'FORGOTTEN GROUP': WOMEN WITH AIDS; MEETING WILL BRING THEM TOGETHER 
WITH EXPERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The college-educated woman, just 30 years old and already drawing a $40,000 
annual salary as an insurance underwriter, had modest dreams: finding a good 
husband, settling down, starting a family. She'd just met a great guy -- the 
first one, in fact, that she had ever really cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 All she had to do was take a test for HIV. No big deal. Just to be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Though nine months have passed, she's still trying to shake off the shock. Not 
only did the test come back positive, she learned she already has full-blown 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was . . . on a career path," said the Irvine woman, who figures she 
contracted the disease in college, from one of six sexual partners in her life. 
"I have a great family, good friends. Then all of a sudden -- bam! It basically 
destroyed my life. I don't even feel I have a life." 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to know intellectually that AIDS is not just a disease of gay 
men and drug abusers, but quite another, as this woman discovered, to live with 
the day-to-day reality of a diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a woman with AIDS in Orange County -- where females account for 6% of 
the more than 3,400 cases reported -- can be an isolating experience. Many 
women with AIDS and the human immunodeficiency virus that leads to it crave not 
just practical information but some kind of connection to others like them, 
doctors and AIDS service providers say. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main purposes of the third annual "Women and HIV" conference set 
for Saturday at UC Irvine is to put women in touch with AIDS experts, and with 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-day conference was organized by the South Coast Medical Center 
Foundation and the UCI Health Education Program because women and men often 
have very different experiences, both medically and socially, with the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women have been the forgotten group," said conference moderator Pearl 
Jemison-Smith, a former UCI nurse who heads the Orange County HIV Planning 
Advisory Council. "There haven't been the services, the attention to details" 
that have characterized the response to AIDS in gay men, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though gay men have battled the stigma of AIDS with some success, women still 
"are seen as whores and 'those awful IV drug users,' " said Laguna Beach 
psychologist Valerie Gold-Neil, who helped start the annual conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 200 Orange County women who have reported cases of AIDS 
since the early 1980s, the most common risk factor is heterosexual contact with 
an infected partner, according to statistics from the Orange County Health Care 
Agency. Intravenous drug use is a close second. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials say the percentage of total cases among women in Orange 
County is only about half the national proportion of 12%. But they caution that 
women's share of the caseload has slowly climbed from 6% of reported cases in 
1991 to more than 8% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 As of March, 1993 -- the latest date for which projections were available -- 
700 women in Orange County were believed to be HIV-infected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HIV is often the farthest thing from physicians' minds when they are treating 
working, middle-class women, one UCI gynecologist said. But it shouldn't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "It always surprises me how women will . . . be exposed, go to their doctors 
and have them say, 'No, you're not that kind of girl,' " said Dr. Beverly 
Sansone, who is scheduled to run a conference workshop on treatment of 
HIV-positive women. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, for women in particular, is that the early symptoms of 
HIV infection can have many other explanations. Unless a doctor has been 
trained to suspect HIV, a test might not be ordered until a patient is well 
into the disease process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine woman with AIDS, who asked not to be identified because she fears 
discrimination, said she had been treated by doctors for recurrent yeast 
infections, an abnormal pap smear and shingles -- a virus that causes painful 
blisters along nerves. But "it never entered my mind that I could be at risk" 
for HIV infection and it apparently did not occur to her doctors either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless you fall into some type of category, they don't even think" of HIV, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman said she would still be in the dark if it hadn't been for her new 
boyfriend's request that she be tested before becoming sexually involved with 
him. "I would have kept going, got an opportunistic infection and died," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to educating doctors about women's symptoms and needs, the 
conference is also designed to help women get what they want from physicians. 
Many women want more information about, and control over, their treatments, but 
find themselves tongue-tied in the doctor's office, physicians and conference 
organizers said. Others wonder whether they should risk having children who 
could be infected with the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One timely topic that will be discussed at the conference is the promise and 
potential pitfalls of using the drug AZT during pregnancy to prevent 
transmission of the virus to newborns. Results of a study released in February 
of 364 babies found that the rate of transmission dropped from 25.5% to 8.3% 
when women took AZT during pregnancy and labor and the child received it for 
six weeks after birth. 
</P>
<P>
 But doctors say women should be aware that many questions about the treatment 
remain unanswered, including whether the drug causes birth defects. The 
Bethesda, Md.-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, 
which sponsored the trial, made no recommendations about the treatment because 
its long-term effects are still unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 It also isn't known whether women must take the drug for as long as the study 
subjects did, from the fourteenth week of pregnancy on, said Dr. Carol Major, a 
UCI perinatologist. Nor are researchers sure whether transmission was reduced 
because the mother took AZT before birth or during birth, or because the child 
received it afterward, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the uncertainties in the scientific realm, women need to know that 
having a child is still an option for them, said Tamara Lindley-Brown of Costa 
Mesa, who has had HIV for 13 years but gave birth 3 1/2 years ago to an 
uninfected son. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people want to have children," she said. "What about that woman 
who's always had a maternal instinct?" 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the medical and scientific realm, Saturday's conference also will 
address the legal, ethical, the spiritual and the emotional. Comedienne Suzanne 
Wilson, who has HIV, will do a closing presentation entitled "Laughing in the 
Face of AIDS." 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said this year's conference will be especially attentive to the 
needs of minorities, including Latinas, who account for more than a quarter of 
all cases of AIDS reported among Orange County women. One address and two 
workshops will be in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very much trying to be more inclusive than ever," Jemison-Smith said. 
Women With AIDS Women makeup about 6% of the nearly 3,400 cases of AIDS 
reported in Orange County since the epidemic began. Half of the women who have 
contracted AIDS have died. A portrait of women and AIDS in Orange County as of

CANDIDATES FOR ATTORNEY GENERAL TRADE CHARGES AT DEBATE TAPING; POLITICS: DAN 
LUNGREN AND TOM UMBERG CRITICIZE EACH OTHER ON SUCH ISSUES AS IMMIGRATION 
INITIATIVE AND 'THREE STRIKES' LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a spirited 30-minute debate for public television, Assemblyman Tom Umberg 
on Wednesday criticized state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren for not taking a position 
on the immigration initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot, while the incumbent accused 
his Democratic rival of belatedly supporting the politically popular "three 
strikes" sentencing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, a two-term assemblyman from Garden Grove, also accused Lungren of 
allowing the attorney general's office to be influenced by campaign 
contributions. Lungren did not respond to the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates, however, said they support the death penalty and oppose a San 
Francisco federal judge's ruling this week that use of the state's gas chamber 
is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate -- taped at the KOCE-TV studio for broadcast the last week of 
October -- also featured Peace and Freedom candidate Robert J. Evans, a 
criminal defense attorney from Oakland, and Libertarian candidate Richard N. 
Burns, an attorney from Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the attention was focused on Lungren and Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent statewide poll showed Umberg trailing Lungren by 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 During one exchange, Umberg said he opposes Proposition 187, the immigration 
initiative, because it is unconstitutional. He said that if approved by voters, 
it would cause children to be taken out of schools and left on the streets to 
create mischief and possibly crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's up to the chief law enforcement officer of the state to say that 
this is bad for public safety," Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lungren said he remains undecided on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not fully resolved it," he said. "It's a close question because 
there's some good things in there; there's some objectionable things in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the initiative's constitutionality is being questioned, the attorney 
general said he is obligated to study the measure fully to see if his office 
can "fashion a reasonable defense" before the courts, should the measure win 
voters' approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren also said his office has been involved in the three lawsuits filed by 
the state seeking to recover from the federal government the costs of providing 
education and other services to illegal immigrants, as well as increased prison 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed by the moderator on whether he would take a position on Proposition 
187 before the election, Lungren said: "I probably will." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg quickly countered: "Right now, I suspect he's holding his finger to the 
wind to see which way it blows." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren fired back, criticizing an Umberg bill that would allow the seizure of 
assets of major employers who knowingly and repeatedly hire illegal immigrants. 
Lungren raised the fear that while the bill targets major employers, "small 
businesses and housewives" would also be at risk of losing their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Evans and Burns said they oppose Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren and Umberg also clashed over who was the first to back the "three 
strikes" legislation and ballot initiative that became a popular cause this 
year in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said he voted for it in April, 1993, as a member of the Assembly's 
Public Safety Committee, and "Mr. Lungren was not there. . . . Mr. Lungren 
appeared (later), but not until the TV cameras were present." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren gave Umberg the telephone number for Mike Reynolds, the Fresno 
photographer who took up the cause for the "three strikes" law after his 
daughter was slain by a repeat felon. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds "said you were absolutely wrong on your repetition of erroneous facts 
on 'three strikes,' " Lungren charged. "I was there long before you were, I 
helped him write 'three strikes.' Quit telling these lies on television." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Reynolds, a Republican, credited Umberg with voting for the "three 
strikes" law but said it was Lungren who first worked with them 
behind-the-scenes to write the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 As the underdog in the campaign, Umberg opened the debate on the attack, 
claiming that Lungren's office has backed away from cases that involve major 
campaign donors. 
</P>
<P>
 He specifically referred to a recent San Francisco Examiner article, which 
reported that a top aide to Lungren "soft-pedaled" a consumer protection case 
involving computer companies. The companies were represented by the head of the 
California Manufacturers' Assn., a group that has contributed to Lungren in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice should not be up for sale in California," Umberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren's spokesman, Steve Telliano, later said office miscommunication was 
the cause of the mishandling of the computer firms' case and that Lungren 
stepped in to get the probe back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Telliano also accused Umberg of taking money from gambling interests. "Tom 
Umberg is explicitly soliciting donations from people he will have to regulate 
if he is elected," he said. "That is putting the attorney general's office up 
for sale."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; 3 SCHOOLS TO GET ON-LINE SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three schools will soon be chosen to lead the way in the Irvine Unified School 
District's $10-million plan to link all schools to the information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 In this unusual competition, the winning schools will be selected for their 
failings in the area of high technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor Daniel and Data General Corp., the two Irvine companies designing a 
computer network for the school district, are expected to select an elementary, 
middle and high school by the end of the month. The companies will be seeking 
out the most low-tech schools for the honor, as a test of what it will take to 
put an entire district on-line in the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're looking to do is find schools that have been a graveyard of 
computer hardware," said Yvonne Miller, head of new business development for 
Data General in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools will be equipped with a "network infrastructure" that includes 
electronic mail and connections to the Internet and computer databases at 
universities and libraries, Miller said. The demonstration projects are 
expected to be up and running by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of the district's ambitious Foundations for the Future project, 
which has attracted large contributions from the Irvine Co., Pacific Bell, 
Dimension Cable and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation campaign director Bob Lazzarini told school board members Tuesday 
night that the Massachusetts Institute of Technology considers the project a 
national model for the integration of technology into schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students will be using technology as an information tool, rather than using 
technology as just an end in itself," Lazzarini said.RUSS LOAR

 Painting Taken From

<P>
 Exhibit Still Missing 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Piece stolen from Festival of Arts 
</P>
<P>
 Background: In July, a 3-by-4-foot painting of the Madonna and Child 
mysteriously disappeared overnight from the open air art exhibit. It was the 
first time such a large piece had vanished from the grounds. Artist Paige Oden 
said the uninsured painting, priced at $1,600, had sentimental value because it 
was part of a body of work created in response to the death of her father last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: Oden has received many calls of sympathy from those familiar with 
her work but still has no clue as to what happened to her painting. But she 
remains hopeful. "Never any word or anything," she said. "So I just keep 
thinking someday I'll just walk by it somewhere. And the police told me I have 
the right to lift it right off the wall and take it home." Oden said she has 
since purchased art insurance.

 Low-Mounted Lights at Park Approved 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Development of Northwood Village park 
</P>
<P>
 Background: After 10 years of discussion and debate, the City Council last 
month reviewed plans to create a park on a 1 1/2-mile-long strip of land. 
Called "the narrows," the land is a former railroad right of way donated to the 
city by the Irvine Co. after the railroad stopped using the route. Cost 
estimates for construction ranged from $2.2 million to $2.8 million, depending 
on the kind of lighting used. Nearby residents wanted low-mounted lighting to 
keep park lights out of their homes, but city officials said the lower lights 
would increase the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The City Council approved the park plan with lights that will be 
about three feet high instead of the 12- to 14-foot-tall lights recommended by 
city staff. The lower lights will cost an estimated $30,000 more than the 
taller lights. The council has not voted on funding for the park.

 Later Deadline for Solicitors OKd 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Ordinance to extend hours of residential solicitation to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Council members were asked by City Manager Jerry L. Bankston to 
approve an ordinance that would extend the hours permitted for residential 
solicitation to 10 p.m. from the city's original 8 p.m. cutoff. Bankston said a 
private organization hired to solicit funds for the Sierra Club had complained 
about the 8 p.m. deadline, citing a U.S. Supreme Court ruling establishing 10 
p.m. as a "reasonable" deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The City Council on Sept. 12 reluctantly approved a second 
reading of the ordinance after City Atty. Quinn Barrow warned that the city 
could be sued by groups objecting to the earlier deadline. City officials said 
residents who post "no solicitors" signs are protected by law from 
solicitations.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BUENA PARK; CITY ADMITS ERROR IN SIGN REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council candidate Jerry Sigler won an admission of error from city 
officials after his political signs were taken down by a city employee.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin O'Rourke admitted that his office "screwed up" when it 
attempted to enforce the city's posting rules for political signs by having an 
employee remove the posters. 
</P>
<P>
 City law requires candidates to wait until 30 days before the election to put 
signs on public property, but it has no authority over signs on private 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The worker who removed the posters failed to make that distinction, O'Rourke 
said. The employee -- whose name was not released -- then was told to put the 
signs back after O'Rourke realized the error but apparently did an 
unsatisfactory job. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigler confronted the council at Monday's meeting and told members that each 
of his 200 signs were on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 He not only lost about 40 signs, but the replacement job was sloppy, he said. 
In one case, 11 signs were put on the same corner. "I don't need 11 signs on 
one corner," Sigler said, adding that the signs cost about $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigler, who brought a broken sign with him, demanded that the damaged ones be 
replaced. The blue-and-pink signs were put up two weeks early because the 
contractor he hired had scheduling problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing I did was illegal, everything was aboveboard and I really think I got 
it stuck to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Rourke apologized and said his office has issued a new edict in wake of the 
brouhaha: "Thou shalt not touch a sign without going through code enforcement," 
he said. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FULLERTON; RECALLS LEADER CITED IN CAMPAIGN SIGN THEFTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Wednesday served W. Snow Hume, a Fullerton Recalls Committee leader, 
with an order to appear in court later this month on charges of vandalism in 
the disappearance of campaign signs belonging to three City Council candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Don Bankhead, who is running in the November general election, 
Peter Godfrey, who is running in the October special election, and Jan Flory, 
who is running in both, told police Monday that their campaign signs had been 
repeatedly stolen, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey said about 600 of his signs have vanished, and Flory and Bankhead said 
they have lost more than 100 signs each. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume, reached at his home Wednesday, admitted removing some signs, saying he 
had permission from property owners where the signs were posted. He said police 
are trying to discredit the recalls committee, which has endorsed Jacob 
Spaargaron, Jack Dean and Conrad DeWitte.  
</P>
<P>
 The recalls committee championed a successful campaign to oust three council 
members from office, including Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
 Hume said he tried to file a police report against Bankhead, Flory and Godfrey 
for allegedly placing signs illegally in such places as freeway on-ramps but 
was not allowed to. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a politically motivated prosecution. Police are being political over 
who they choose to prosecute," Hume said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Patrick McKinley said of the charge: "That's silliness. . . . We 
proceed according to law and facts and that's what we've done in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The punishment for vandalism, a misdemeanor, is up to six months in jail and a 
$1,000 fine, police said.MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY OKS 3RD CARWASH, HEARS CRITICISMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city continues to be divided over the number of carwashes a city of 15,700 
residents should allow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest fray, the City Council on Tuesday night upheld its earlier 
decision to permit a third carwash.And at the same time, the council took aim 
at an existing carwash operator who had criticized council members and appealed 
their action granting the third carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 4-1 vote, the council accused carwash owner Dr. Gordon Cook of improper 
water drainage and other code violations. The council's action gave Cook, a 
retired dentist, until Nov. 1 to correct the alleged violations or lose his 
city permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents in an overflow audience of about 200 Tuesday night accused 
the council majority of attacking Cook to try to silence him. Cook bitterly had 
fought the new carwash granted by the council.  
</P>
<P>
 "I want assurance that we still have our constitutional rights to speak out in 
our city," one resident, Kathy Miller, told the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, Bill Sexton, told the council its action against Cook had a 
chilling effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost afraid to get up here. . . . " Sexton said. "You've got people 
intimidated here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Wally D. Linn repeatedly told the audience that the council and city 
staff had not singled out Cook.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have no personal vendetta against Dr. Cook," Linn said. "These violations 
simply came to our attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Eva G. Miner was the only one voting in opposition to the 
council's action against Cook. She praised Cook and said she was "embarrassed" 
that the city had threatened to suspend his business operation. Miner also cast 
the only opposing vote when the City Council later Tuesday night upheld its 
Aug. 16 decision approving a third carwash. BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; USE OF CITY SEAL IN RACES TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an issue that has come up time and again among council members but has 
yet to be resolved: Can political candidates vying for city seats use the city 
seal in campaign literature? The subject will be brought up once again at a 
City Council study session scheduled for Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 At this week's council meeting, Costa Mesa resident Ernie Feeney objected to 
incumbent Peter F. Buffa's use of the city seal on invitations to a 
fund-raiser. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney said she didn't know if the invitation was printed at taxpayers' 
expense since there was no disclaimer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had no way of knowing whether it was stationary from the city," Feeney 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Buffa said the mailer was paid for by his reelection committee.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue has been around since 1984, when a candidate for the City Council 
had her picture taken under the city seal, raising the ire of other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the city has discussed the dos and don'ts of using the city seal during 
a number of study sessions, a policy has never been drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's a policy, I would follow it," Buffa said. "But right now, there is 
no policy, and I'm not doing anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffa, who is seeking his third term, said the city seal was placed on the 
invitation itself, and not on the outside of the envelope. If it were on the 
envelope, he said, he would understand Feeney's concern. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Fair Political Practices Commission in Sacramento, the city 
has authority to determine how the city seal may or may not be used in campaign 
literature.TOM RAGANPOLITICAL LITERAT

 The city's Redevelopment Agency has unanimously approved a developer's plan to 
build 22 single-family homes on land at the southeast corner of Alta Vista 
Drive and Central Avenue, next to the Alta Vista Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Development Director Joyce Rosenthal said homes in the project, to be built by 
Huennekens, Quinn & Talcott, are larger than those originally proposed for 
another site. It will feature Mediterranean-style homes, half of which will 
have views of the Alta Vista golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 The new homes will complete a neighborhood that will include another 44 homes 
under construction by another developer. The completed neighborhood will extend 
south from Alta Vista Street to Chapman Avenue. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; ORDINANCE REGULATING MOBILE VENDORS 
TOUGHENED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has toughened its vending ordinance by requiring mobile 
merchants to move their vehicles every half hour, pick up trash left behind by 
customers and sell nothing on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance also restricts hours during which vendors can operate and 
provides progressively harsher penalties to those who violate it repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Tuesday voted 4 to 0 to approve the changes. Councilman Jeff 
Vasquez was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendor ordinance was revised in response to complaints about produce 
trucks and other peddlers in two large condominium complexes, Capistrano Villas 
and Casa Capistrano.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite taking a stronger position on regulating vendors, the council softened 
the city's stance in one minor way by asking the city staff to revise the part 
of the city code that forbids ice cream trucks from playing music over 
loudspeakers. Council members said the tunes -- at a reasonable volume -- 
should be allowed as a traditional slice of community life. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will revisit that matter in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann de Guevara had complained to the council that ice cream truck music is 
sometimes loud enough on her Capistrano Villas street to drown out the 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new vending ordinance, street vending hours of operation are limited 
to 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday through Saturday. Vendors are required to move at 
least 100 feet every 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-time offender receives a notice of violation. A second offense brings 
a 30-day suspension of a city vending permit, and a third violation can result 
in a one-year vending permit suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Richard K. Denhalter told the council that the amended ordinance 
was crafted to withstand potential legal challenge.JEFF BEAN

 It took going totally blind to get Robyn Vanlerberghe on the dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Too shy for that before losing her sight to diabetes 14 years ago, 
Vanlerberghe now has the nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see if people are watching me," she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are pluses to being blind," adds fellow blind dancer Sharon Soderman, 
only half-joking. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women on Wednesday line-danced with eight other visually impaired or 
totally blind country-Western fans during lunch at Tustin Rehabilitation 
Hospital. All take classes in the popular honky-tonk art form at the Braille 
Institute's branch in Orange and perform around Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five, six, ready, go!" called their sighted teacher Patty Tebo, launching the 
smiling group into four choreographed routines. Tebo gives detailed, explicit 
verbal instructions to teach the Tush Push, the Copperhead, the Fireman and 
other favorite line dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique works. The boot- and bolo-clad dancers stomped heels, swiveled 
hips and executed quarter turns with near perfect synchronicity and few 
missteps. Their audience whooped and clapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Vanlerberghe, 39, relies upon the music, usually coming from a nearby boom 
box, to make sure she faces the right direction with each turn. Knowing what 
step comes next is a simple matter of memorization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I'd like it so much," said the Murrieta resident, who began 
boot scootin' four years ago, "and I didn't know I'd like country music so 
much." 
</P>
<P>
 Tebo's students performed at the rehabilitation hospital because their friend 
and Tebo's teaching partner Brad Grabill, 47, is being treated there. Grabill, 
who lost his sight 14 years ago because of diabetes, had a stroke a month ago, 
but expects to leave the hospital Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the music and enjoying the show, Grabill said, gave him even more 
incentive to mend quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives me goose bumps up and down my arm," he said, "because I really want 
to be out there. In a couple more months I will be." ZAN DUBIN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; NUDE DANCE CLUB'S SUIT ASKS END TO POLICE 
RAIDS 
</P>

<P>
 A series of raids on a local business offering nude dancing violates the First 
Amendment, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Orange County Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Paddy Murphy's contends in the lawsuit that his business is a 
theater where dancing is protected by the U.S. Constitution.The lawsuits 
requests a restraining order barring the Santa Ana Police Department from 
conducting further raids. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night raids in June and September resulted in the arrests of a dozen 
female dancers on misdemeanor charges of lewd conduct, according to the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit adds that the raids are keeping away clients on Friday nights, the 
busiest night of the week, and are affecting the dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unlawful arrests . . . have resulted in a chilling effect in that the 
dangers are afraid they will be arrested every time they take the stage . . . 
as such, the dancers are afraid to come to work and when they do work, their 
fear of arrest negatively affects the nature and quality of the entertainment 
provided," the lawsuit states. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddy Murphy's has been the main target of a group of residents, headed by 
City Council candidate Alberta Christy, that hopes to shut down nude dancing 
businesses in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The group persuaded the City Council to pass an ordinance making it more 
difficult for nude bars to open in Santa Ana, and Christy has spearheaded a 
campaign aimed at revoking Paddy Murphy's liquor license. LEE ROMNEY

<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency's Children's Mental Health Services 
division will have an open house today for its new clinic in Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Mental Health Clinic, at 377 E. Chapman Ave., serves youths 
from 3 to 18 years old in Placentia, Brea, Yorba Linda, Fullerton, Anaheim, 
Buena Park, La Habra and La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis intervention services, individual, family and group psychotherapy, 
medications and assessment services are available. Counselors are prepared to 
handle child abuse, parenting and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 long-term care cases moved with the clinic from Anaheim, but Robles 
said he expects demand to increase once more people are aware of the new 
office. In most cases involving long-term treatment, both the child and the 
family are counseled, Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic moved from an office at 125 Ball Road, Anaheim, as part of a 
program to expand services in North County, north region service chief Manuel 
Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the center's clients are referred by school districts, social service 
agencies and individuals, Robles said, but children or their parents may also 
make the initial contact. State law requires that a child seeking services 
without parental knowledge be at least 12 years old, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles said most of the center's ongoing clients are elementary and junior 
high school age children with behavioral problems, such as fighting or other 
aggressive behavior, inability to pay attention or disruptive behavior in 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The open house will take place from 10:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. HOLLY J. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CRIMINAL JUSTICE PANEL PLAN RECEIVES SUPPORT

 Youth crimes and jail and courtroom overcrowding are some of the pressing law 
enforcement issues that county officials propose to tackle with a new 
countywide criminal justice council. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed Orange County Criminal Justice Coordination Council could improve 
communications between heads of the county's criminal justice system, social 
service agencies and other county departments. It had its first public airing 
Wednesday and received the go-ahead from about 30 county judges and other 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 County Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley said he is supporting the 
plan partly because of his concern about youth violence. Riley said he hopes 
that school and county Social Services Agency representatives will work with 
law enforcement to come up with new ideas on how to curb youth crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no secret the problems and concerns that youngsters in our community are 
causing," Riley said. "Locking these people up is not helping. . . . I want to 
make sure something positive is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 The council would be modeled after a similar 13-year-old program in Los 
Angeles County and the proposal is expected to go before the Board of 
Supervisors later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges and county officials gave their support Wednesday after hearing 
from Los Angeles County Supervisor Edmund D. Edelman, who urged Orange County 
leaders to move ahead with the proposed council.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles council had helped that county to cut costs and come up with 
innovative ways to handle problems by uniting all the heads of key departments 
to work on common goals, said Edelman, who spearheaded efforts to form the Los 
Angeles council in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County council could help coordinate efforts against illegal 
immigration, domestic violence and youth crime, said Ron Coley, public safety 
manager for the county administrative office.  
</P>
<P>
 Coley said he began working on the proposal for a new council 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he could not estimate how much the council will cost, and expects 
the county administrative office to begin exploring the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Coley estimated that the county would need to hire two or three more staffers 
to run the council. SUSAN MARQUEZ OWEN

BAR

<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld the city's refusal to let the owner of an 
adult bookstore operate a juice bar that features nude dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decision released Monday, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana 
said that the proposed juice bar in the 8100 block of Garden Grove Boulevard 
would violate city zoning laws and create parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court allowed Waldon Randall Welty to operate A-Z Bookstore and a 
"peep show" arcade at longer hours than currently allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookstore and the arcade now may open from 8:30 a.m. to midnight on 
weekdays and from 8:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. on weekends, instead of closing at 10 
p.m. on weekdays and at midnight on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have applauded the court ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very pleased," Mayor Frank Kessler said. "We had attempted to follow 
the law," and this proves that what we have done was exactly that." 
</P>
<P>
 Welty applied for a permit to convert his one-story building into a two-story 
juice bar with nude, female dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council rejected the proposal two years ago, and a Superior Court 
upheld the action. The court also imposed the limited business hours for the 
arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court ruled Monday that it was an "abuse of discretion" for the 
Superior Court to impose lesser business hours than the city had allowed under 
a "late-night" permit granted in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Welty's lawyer, Roger Jon Diamond of Upland, was not available Tuesday.BERT

<P>
 A newly organized crime-prevention program that teams local businesses with 
police won praise from the City Council this week as an important tool for 
making the city safer. 
</P>
<P>
 The council Monday issued a proclamation hailing the formation of the South 
Garnsey Business Community Watch Program, which will monitor the area bounded 
by Flower Street on the west, Main Street on the east, Warner Avenue on the 
north and Dyer Road on the south. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the 98 businesses in the area are members of the organization and 
that percentage is expected to grow significantly, Santa Ana Police Lt. Michael 
Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to Neighborhood Watch programs, in which a network of neighbors look 
out for each other and maintain close ties with police, the Business Community 
Watch program will encourage members to report crimes, improve security and 
also offer employees personal safety training classes, Foote said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Patricia McGuigan said the program will help reduce those 
crimes and provide a crucial link among businesses and with the police, and 
provide an improved sense of security for employees who work within the area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials expect the area's crime rate will drop significantly once the 
program is fully developed over the next few months. Soon after, the program 
might be expanded to other business communities citywide, McGuigan said.JON

RESOLUTION

<P>
 The City Council has approved a resolution opposing a ballot initiative that 
calls for converting the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a commercial 
airport. 
</P>
<P>
 With no discussion, the council voted 4 to 0 Tuesday for the 
resolution.Councilman Jeff Vasquez was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city resolution contends that the Nov. 8 ballot initiative, Measure A, 
"circumvents the normal public planning and disclosure process" by mandating a 
commercial airport at El Toro without first revealing the environmental impacts 
or considering other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The resolution states that county residents would be best served by a full 
study and disclosure before any decisions are made. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, a county agency studying how the base 
should be developed once the Marines depart in 1999, is considering several 
alternatives, including a commercial airport. But the study won't be finished 
until June, several months after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 South County cities have formed a group and contributed to a separate study on 
alternative uses for the 4,700-acre property, which is being vacated by the 
Marines because of military cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of converting the base to a commercial airport say that the plan 
would stimulate economic growth and create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents counter that the conversion would crowd the skies with airplanes and 
create noise problems in neighboring cities.JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; HEADLANDS MEASURES TO BE LUNCHEON TOPIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce is holding a "Hike to the Headlands" luncheon Monday 
to inform residents about two key local initiatives on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, Measure C and Measure D would allow a $500-million hotel and 
residential development on the Dana Point Headlands, 121 acres of coastal land. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted in April to approve the development, saying it was a 
worthy project that would generate much-needed revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, contend that the development is too extensive for one of 
the last major undeveloped coastal properties in the county. They circulated a 
petition and gathered enough signatures to force a citywide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff from one of the landowners, the Newport Beach-based M.H. Sherman Co., 
will be available to answer questions. The other landowner is the 
Pasadena-based Chandis Securities Co., a partnership that has owned the 
property since the 1940s. (Chandis Securities, a firm that oversees the 
financial holdings of the Chandler family, is a major stockholder in Times 
Mirror Co., publisher of the Los Angeles Times.) 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are necessary for the hourlong walk. The charge is $12 charge per 
person. The luncheon starts at noon. For reservations, call (714) 496-1555.

MOST OF CITY'S TREASURE ISLAND PLAN UPHELD; DEVELOPMENT: OWNERS MAY CLOSE 
LAGUNA MOBILE HOME PARK IF THEY PAY MILLIONS IN RELOCATION COSTS TO DISPLACED 
RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A judge has upheld most of a city plan that allows owners of the Treasure 
Island Mobile Home Park to close it if they pay millions in reimbursement to 
displaced residents, but the ruling met with a mixed response Wednesday from 
all involved. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of bitter dispute over the sprawling oceanfront mobile home park, 
Orange County Superior Court Judge Donald E. Smallwood on Tuesday upheld a city 
resolution that requires the park owners, who want to shut it down, to make 
substantial relocation payments to residents who would be displaced.  
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said the resolution should not apply to people who aren't 
permanent residents at the mobile home park, a Laguna Beach fixture since 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased for the people who are well treated and we're grieving for our 
neighbors who are, in our mind, equally deprived," said K.P. Rice, president of 
the Treasure Island Resident Owners Assn. "It's not as if every one of these 
people had a villa in France and a villa in the Mediterranean." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice said his neighbor is a perfect example of someone who has another 
residence but still would suffer a great loss if the park closes and she is not 
compensated.  
</P>
<P>
 The neighbor is a schoolteacher who is making mortgage payments on a home in 
Whittier and had planned to sell it and retire at the park because of the lower 
cost of living there. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not being displaced, but she is being displaced. Her whole future 
scheme is being destroyed. And money is being taken out of her pocket," Rice 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision closes one chapter in a lengthy and controversial battle 
over property rights in Laguna Beach, but the fight is not over. Both the 
property owners, who hope to develop the land, and attorneys for the residents 
said the issue is almost certain to end up in court again. They also said the 
ruling could be interpreted in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 A park co-owner said excluding residents who own homes elsewhere would cut his 
relocation costs at least in half, but he vowed to continue to fight the city 
for requiring him to pay amounts he says are too high -- an average of about 
$130,000 per mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the whole appraisal was done wrong, and we think the judge, when he 
gets done reviewing the evidence, is going to decide for us," said Richard 
Hall, who along with Merrill Lynch Hubbard heads the partnership that bought 
the park for $43 million in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for residents and the city say they believe that Smallwood's ruling 
backs the constitutionality of the city's resolution -- approved by a 3-2 
council vote in February -- and supports the methods the city used to assess 
the value of the mobile homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only part of the owners' arguments that Smallwood favored had to do with 
whether residents who have other homes should be included in the scope of the 
city's resolution, said Richard Spix, one of the attorneys for Rice's group. 
</P>
<P>
 Spix also said he might challenge the definition of who is a resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue is residency, and residency is a state of mind by the case law," he 
said. "A residence is a place where you expect to return. The fact that a 
resident has two homes does not necessarily preclude residency." 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-acre park is home to about 180 mobile home owners. About 100 other 
residents have been bought out by the new owners, doing business as Treasure 
Island Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The city required Treasure Island Associates to get a special permit when it 
announced in 1992 that it intended to buy more than 25% of the units in the 
park. A year later, the owners announced they intended to close the park in 
order to develop it, and the city worked out a plan to protect residents who 
might be displaced, many of them senior citizens with limited incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council measure passed in February would force the owners to maintain 
the site as a mobile home park for 10 years or pay residents relocation costs 
of about $23 million, or about $130,000 per owner on average. 
</P>
<P>
 If residents who own another home are excluded, Hall estimated that his 
partnership would have to pay relocation benefits to about 70 people, or half 
the people that the $23 million would have covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach City Atty. Philip D. Kohn said that he would advise the City 
Council to change its resolution as soon as possible so that it applies only to 
permanent residents but that he expected it would otherwise remain the same.  
</P>
<P>
 Rice called the ruling a "milestone" but said he fears the battle is far from 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like climbing a cliff. Every once in a while you can get to a spot where 
you can sit down for a minute without hanging from a rope," Rice said. "It 
feels like that."

SAN ONOFRE ADMINISTERS DISASTER PREPAREDNESS DRILL; EMERGENCIES: AGENCY 
OFFICIALS GATHER AT IRVINE OFFICE TO COORDINATE EVACUATION PLANS DURING MOCK 
NUCLEAR MELTDOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Southern California Edison spends $1.5 million each year to simulate nuclear 
emergencies, and it was catastrophe time again Wednesday as 550 employees from 
at least 10 public agencies reacted to a mock incident at the San Onofre 
nuclear power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation: a partial meltdown that released a radioactive gas cloud into 
the atmosphere, causing a mass evacuation of San Clemente, Dana Point and San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 "We take this very seriously," said Bill Bromley, a San Onofre electrical 
engineer. "If anyone was laughing in there, they'd probably be tossed out." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's Irvine office was turned into a bustling command center where city 
and company officials were grilled by reporters at hourly news conferences. At 
San Onofre, operated by Edison and situated just south of San Clemente, 
technical personnel searched for reasons why the meltdown happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "This drill is very important," said Kathleen Cha, a spokeswoman for the 
Orange County Fire Department. "Everyone has (an emergency) plan, but the plan 
isn't good unless it works. This is badly needed practice in case a real 
emergency occurs." 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, the exercise is designed to get information out to the public. The 
major task is for several agencies -- from the Marine Corps to local cities -- 
to share information and make joint decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 During the drill, agency representatives gathered around a large table to 
coordinate evacuation plans and the closing of Interstate 5 near the nuclear 
plant. Present were officials from the California Highway Patrol, Marine Corps, 
the governor's office, American Red Cross, the cities of San Clemente, Dana 
Point and San Juan Capistrano, and other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in an adjoining room, a phone bank staffed by Edison workers served 
as an information conduit, passing along updates to the emergency team.  
</P>
<P>
 Every hour, representatives from cities and other public agencies filed into a 
warehouse to face the news media -- actually, Edison employees, who nonetheless 
hit them with hard questions. 
</P>
<P>
 In one exchange, Edison spokesman David Baron was grilled about the worst 
scenario possible for the partial meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't speculate on things that haven't happened yet," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't plan for a worst-case scenario?" the reporter shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say that," Baron said, with a hint of real irritation in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Every other year, the emergency team's performance is graded by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A bad grade 
could result in the San Onofre plant being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 The inability to coordinate public agencies in case of a disaster was directly 
responsible for the 1989 closure of the Shoreham nuclear plant in Long Island, 
said Edison spokeswoman Sherry Foulson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real wake-up call for the nuclear industry came after the Three Mile 
Island incident in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no center where all information could be verified and passed along 
to the public," she said. "It resulted in all kinds of anxiety and concern. We 
have a responsibility to make sure that people don't panic."

ROBBERS TAKE CASH, JEWELRY FROM HOME

 Five residents of a house in the 19300 block of Pitcairn Lane were robbed at 
gunpoint Wednesday by two men who had said they wanted to rent a room, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the victims, who range in age from 20 to 33, were injured in the 
robbery, according to Lt. Luis Ochoa. 
</P>
<P>
 The two robbers, both in their 20s, fled with an undetermined amount of cash 
and jewelry in a 1988 Acura Legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims told police they advertised to rent a room in the house, and that they 
received a telephone call early Wednesday from someone asking to see it. About 
11 a.m., two men arrived, one of whom identified himself as having made the 
earlier call. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men showed a chrome, semiautomatic handgun as the pair forced their 
way in, police said.MARK I. PINSKY

STORM DRAIN SPILL CLEARS UP IN LAGUNA BEACH

<P>
 A mysterious spill from a storm drain at Fisherman's Cove stopped Wednesday as 
inexplicably as it had begun on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the spill appears to have been ground water that leaked into the 
joints of the 72-inch storm drain, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that somehow some sewage got into it, but not to a heavy degree," 
he said.

 Frank said that city geologists walked through the storm drain and found 
ground water leaking from a blocked, six-inch pipe beneath the larger drain. 
Within hours of cleaning out the smaller pipe, Frank said, the flow onto the 
beach stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's our best guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small amounts of coliform that investigators found in the water may have 
come from an old residential septic tank used before the city put in sewer 
lines, or a blocked city sewer line, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no indications of leaks in any of our sewer lines," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile-long stretch of beach that was closed by the Orange County Health Care 
Agency on Monday probably will be open by the weekend, Frank said.

QUAYLE HAMMERS PRESIDENT'S POLICY ON HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Vice President Dan Quayle criticized President Clinton's Haiti policy 
Wednesday, calling it a "terrible precedent" to send American troops to the 
Caribbean nation to restore exiled President Jean Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aristide was duly elected, I admit that," Quayle said at a speech sponsored 
by CARE, one of the largest private relief programs in the world."But you have 
to recognize that some people who come through the democratic process do not 
necessarily subscribe to democratic values." 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle was the featured speaker at a reception sponsored by CARE at the Robert 
Mondavi Center. About 70 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle praised the organization for its relief efforts worldwide. But most of 
his comments were reserved for a critique of President Clinton's Haiti policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This situation is on the verge of being insane," he said. "We almost invaded 
Haiti to return Aristide. For what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle said that after meeting Aristide twice, he determined that the United 
States should not be promoting the return of the exiled Haitian president.  
</P>
<P>
 "With his quasi-endorsement of necklacing (draping gas-filled tires around 
enemies' necks and setting them ablaze), I came away with the impression that 
this was a person who did not believe in democratic values," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quayle said he would not have sent U.S. troops into Haiti because it was not 
in the United States' vital interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haiti was not a threat to us," Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former vice president said he would have tried to work with "democratic" 
institutions in the country like the Parliament. Until the recent arrival of 
U.S. troops, however, most members of Parliament were in hiding because they 
feared for their lives.

RAIN-LOOSENED BOULDER CRASHES INTO CAR; ACCIDENT: IT ROLLS OFF A HILLSIDE AND 
STRIKES A PICKUP TRUCK ON ORTEGA HIGHWAY, LEAVING THE DRIVER SHAKEN BUT UNHURT.

 Heavy-equipment operator David Munoz thought he could relax Wednesday 
afternoon when he was sent home early from a Coto de Caza job site because of 
the rain. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rain created a life-threatening surprise for Munoz on his way home to 
Perris.A 500-pound boulder dislodged from a hillside off Ortega Highway and 
crashed into his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 The boulder rolled down about 12:30 p.m. and smashed into the right side of 
Munoz's pickup truck, sending the vehicle toward a ravine on the opposite side 
of the winding two-lane highway. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old Munoz, who was shaken but unhurt, said he steered hard to the 
right to keep from going over the edge. His truck overturned on the pavement, 
landing on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz was wearing a seat belt, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Groves, a California Highway Patrol officer, said Munoz was traveling 
east at about 30 m.p.h. about half a mile past the Riverside County line when 
the boulder suddenly dislodged from about 20 feet above. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rain just loosened it, and that's all it takes," Groves said. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz, who sat on the side of the highway as emergency personnel directed 
traffic, said he didn't know what had struck his truck when he felt the hefty 
jolt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just saw a big shadow from the side," he said. "It hit the truck and it 
kicked like it was going to go over the hill. I feel real lucky. I'd rather be 
up here than down there." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident slowed traffic on the remote portion of the highway for about an 
hour as crews waited for a tow truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Forestry workers rolled the boulder to the side of the roadway.

CHAMBER HEAD DISAVOWS QUOTE IN VIETNAN; MEDIA: CO PHAM SAYS HE NEVER PRAISED 
COMMUNISTS FOR PRACTICING DEMOCRACY. ACCOUNT OF HIS SPEECH TRIGGERED LOCAL 
ANGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Co Pham, the leader of an Orange County trade delegation traveling in Vietnam, 
stressed Wednesday that he believes "there is no real democracy in Vietnam" and 
said he is telling that to government leaders there. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham's comments followed a local newspaper report of a speech Pham made in 
Hanoi. The newspaper quoted Pham as suggesting he represents the Vietnamese 
community in praising communist leaders for practicing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never did I say that," Pham told The Times. "The day after, I even told the 
vice president that there is no real democracy in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not stupid. I know they're paying attention back there" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper report triggered an angry reaction from some Vietnamese 
anti-communists who oppose the trade mission by Pham and 23 other delegates. It 
is the first such trip by a delegation since a trade embargo was lifted by 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham's opponents in Orange County's Vietnamese community have denounced the 
trip as misrepresenting the views of most Vietnamese Americans, and they fear 
that any effort to promote economic progress in that country will extend the 
tenure of communist leaders and perpetuate human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham said he has demanded a correction from the Orange County Register. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Register story published Tuesday, Pham told Vietnam leaders 
that Vietnamese overseas support "your revolutionary ways, so Vietnam can be as 
prosperous as other countries." The Register also quoted Pham as saying: "You 
are practicing democracy in Vietnam in a wise way." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the story, Pham's statements were made during a meeting between 
U.S. delegates and a member of the Vietnam National Assembly, the main 
legislative body in the country. The meeting was simulcast in English and 
Vietnamese, with Pham speaking in Vietnamese, translated by a government 
liaison. 
</P>
<P>
 The liaison, Hoang Cong Thuy, told The Times that the Register's account of 
the translation was inaccurate. Two Times correspondents at the meeting, one 
recording the talk in Vietnamese and the other in English, could find no record 
of Pham making such statements about democracy in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people who witnessed what was said," Thuy said. "I am 
trying to be as careful as possible with my translation. I'm very frustrated 
about the quote; it has made me uncomfortable. This has never happened before, 
never ever."  
</P>
<P>
 Phone calls to the Register were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese Community of Southern California, an anti-communist group, 
Tuesday reported dozens of calls demanding Pham's resignation from the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "We referred them to the Chamber of Commerce," said Ban Bui, president of the 
Vietnamese Community of Southern California. "Here, we are already against the 
communists and against Mr. Co. It doesn't make a difference if people call and 
tell us that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bui said he plans to create a second chamber of commerce if Pham doesn't 
resign or hold another election this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham responded: "It's a free country and he can do what he wants to do. I 
can't control that." He added that he was elected to a two-year term in May and 
doesn't plan to resign or hold another election until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Lai, project coordinator for the chamber, said nobody called this week 
demanding Pham's resignation. Lai refused to comment on Pham's quotes in the 
Register. 
</P>

 Times staff writer Lily Dizon and correspondent Thuan Le contributed to this 
report from Vietnam.

FREEWAY CLOSED FOR CHECK OF POWER LINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Authorities closed a short stretch of the Garden Grove Freeway on Wednesday to 
check overhead power lines that reportedly produced sparks when a truck passed 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said an inspection found no problems with the wires, and the freeway 
was reopened 40 minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Southern California Edison said two overhead wires may have 
touched and sparked when a power pole near the freeway was accidentally jostled 
by a heavy truck. The resulting short circuit briefly knocked out power to 
about 2,500 customers, said area manager Brad Martin. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no injuries. A motorist reported seeing sparks along the 
overhanging line when the truck passed beneath. Traffic was diverted onto 
surface streets at Harbor Boulevard until 1:20 p.m., said California Highway 
Patrol officer Joan Rivas.

MOULTON PATTERSON UPSET AT PROP. 187 MAILER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hard-fought race for a seat on the County Board of Supervisors turned even 
more contentious Wednesday when candidate Linda Moulton Patterson accused 
opponent Jim Silva of falsely claiming in a campaign mailer that she opposes 
Proposition 187, the immigration initiative on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big lie," said Moulton Patterson, who has stated at several public 
forums over the past 10 days that she will vote for Proposition 187, even 
though she holds misgivings about some of its elements. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailer, sent to voters last weekend in the 2nd Supervisorial District, 
contends that Silva is "the only candidate for county supervisor" who supports 
the proposition, which seeks to deny public school education and social 
services to illegal immigrants. The advertisement also states that Moulton 
Patterson "opposes Prop. 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Silva acknowledged Wednesday that Moulton Patterson backs the measure. But he 
defended the mailer, saying it was printed before she made her support public. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized Moulton Patterson for "flip-flopping" on the issue by 
backing Proposition 187 now after telling the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in 
April that illegal immigrants should receive free public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "She changed her mind. . . . We can't know what she's feeling from one day to 
the next," Silva said.  
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he became aware of Moulton Patterson's position Sept. 28 at a 
debate in Irvine. By then, the mailers were printed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson, however, said she announced her support for Proposition 187 
during a cable television appearance on Sept. 25 -- a week before the mailers 
were received by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 She denied ever opposing the ballot measure. Rather, she said, her position 
has "evolved" over the months as she studied the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see this as a flip-flop at all," Moulton Patterson said. "I've said 
I'm concerned about certain parts of it. . . . I don't like to see children 
suffer."  
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, she said she will vote for the measure because "the federal 
government has to know how much Southern California is suffering" because of 
illegal immigration. "It will give the government a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 The heated tone of the campaign was evident at the KOCE-TV forum taped 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a Huntington Beach councilman, and Moulton Patterson, Huntington 
Beach's mayor, clashed on several issues, including taxes, jail construction 
and their records on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance statements filed Wednesday indicate that Silva has raised 
more money than Moulton Patterson during the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva reported contributions totaling $81,142.77 between July 1 and Sept. 30, 
compared to $59,614.52 for Moulton Patterson. For the entire campaign, Silva 
has collected $194,677.64 to Moulton Patterson's $174,641.52. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates are vying for the 2nd District seat held by Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder, who is retiring. The district covers northwest county cities, 
including Huntington Beach, Seal Beach, Costa Mesa and Cypress.

BEHIND THE SCENES: MODEL BENEFIT FOR CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Organizers of Sunday night's Kathy Ireland & Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Harper's 
Bazaar Celebrity Fashion Gala to benefit Athletes & Entertainers for Kids 
couldn't have fit in another party feature if they had tried. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-tie event at the festively decorated Taco Bell headquarters in 
Irvine entertained 400 guests with live jazz, big band, blues, reggae and 
disco; a casino; a gourmet buffet from a half-dozen of O.C.'s finest kitchens; 
award presentations, and a show of haute couture. Unfortunately, none of the 
guests got into the Roaring '20s theme the invitations touted -- unless you 
count all the silky silver and copper slip dresses, most too short for even a 
flapper. No surprise, black was everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of (yawn) corporate thank-yous presented by Ireland and 
Abdul-Jabbar, the most touching moment of the evening came when Jeanne White 
presented Olympic gold medal diver Greg Louganis with the Ryan White HIV/AIDS 
Humanitarian Award, an honor inspired by White's son, who died of complications 
of the disease in 1990. In return, Louganis gave White, who has become a 
tireless AIDS-awareness activist, one of his gold medals from the 1988 
Olympics.  
</P>
<P>
 The fashion show, produced by Nordstrom, followed with both professional 
models and well-known athletes cruising the catwalk in duds by Donna Karan, 
Richard Tyler, Missoni, Calvin Klein, Thierry Mugler and others. Clothes for 
almost every occasion were represented. Classic business suits looked entirely 
modern in deep browns (including pin stripe), smoky grays and checks. For him, 
shoulders were cut clean and close and, for her, trousers looked new in slim 
silhouettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend wear was thoroughly active: plaid, flannel-like coats, corduroy 
separates, tweed five-button vests and Alpine print sweaters. There were even 
some signs of glamour with velveteen corsets over ribbed Tees and down coats 
lined with faux fur. The hottest pieces, however, happened to be anything lined 
or trimmed with shearling. 
</P>
<P>
 For fun, a pop series unfolded with leather corsets and berets, brightly 
colored suits and metallic-swirled velvet. Evening took a more subtle, graceful 
approach with beautiful black column dresses exposing a back here, a 
decolletage there. And for him, tuxedos made individual statements with 
personal touches such as a silver and black checked vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Footnote: You can ignore everything else as long as you get into a pair of 
boots this season. Low and high chunky heels were shown with suits, casual wear 
and some evening wear. ROSE APODACA JONES

DESIGNER SPOTLIGHT: JEWELRY DESIGNER HAS GOT ALL THE WORLD ON A STRING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What do American cut crystal from the '40s, sterling beads from Nepal, shards 
of 500-year-old Chinese ceramic vases, painted wooden beads from Guatemala and 
metal charms from Afghanistan and India have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 They are among the materials North Tustin jewelry designer Ilene Sirota draws 
from to string her signature necklaces, pins, bracelets and earrings. Her 
wearable collectibles are a United Nations of beads that connect the past with 
the present in adornments that are timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 To Sirota, 48, jewelry-making is "like cooking. I throw a few of these in and 
a pinch of this and a couple of those." She begins with major pieces, such as a 
disc covered in the silk of an antique kimono, and builds from there. Her 
method is part instinct and part life experience sprinkled with a dash of 
confidence and the sort of expertise guided by formal art training. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese charms fit comfortably next to Chinese coins and between American 
semiprecious stones. Components joined from Turkey, Ecuador and Egypt create an 
eclectic combination that few would consider pairing. But that is the intrinsic 
charm of Sirota's work: Fans are inspired to wear it with everything from jeans 
to elegant dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind mixing cultures," she said. "They may not get along in real 
life, but they do on my necklaces." 
</P>
<P>
 Years spent traveling with her husband and children exposed the Brooklyn 
native to the carefully crafted beads, fabrics and other materials that she 
would eventually figure out what to do with. 
</P>
<P>
 The day she graduated from Brooklyn College in 1968 with degrees in art and 
art history and a teaching credential, Sirota and her husband, Ed, a civil 
engineer, moved to San Francisco. Within months, they were off to Hawaii and 
spent intervals in Singapore and Indonesia. In Honolulu, she taught fine art at 
private junior high and high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple zigzagged through four cities in the United States and Canada in 
1973 and ended up in Los Angeles. In the following four years, their growing 
family bounced from L.A. to Iran and Indonesia. The Sirotas moved to North 
Tustin in 1978 with three children and loads of folk art, prints, indigenous 
clothes, toys and craft tools and supplies from their travels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while directing the artist-cooperative Galleria at the Bowers Museum of 
Cultural Art in Santa Ana a decade ago that she discovered her knack for making 
jewelry. She and other regional artists fashioned pins for a gallery 
fund-raiser and, Sirota said, "I made 36 pins and sold them within two weeks. 
That started it." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Sirota created a name for herself with colorful pins made of 
unusual leathers. In 1988, she expanded her material selections to glass, 
ceramic, metal and just about anything available, and with it her time 
dedicated to the burgeoning business. Even traveling has turned into casual 
expeditions for eclectic materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever I go I try to expose myself to whatever is indigenous to the area," 
Sirota said. "If something amuses me, I buy it and figure out what to do with 
it later. I know eventually I'll use it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit I'm getting good at it," she said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 To supply the 48 art and craft shows she now does annually -- including 24 
this fall -- she spends up to 12 hours a day putting together about 4,000 
pieces.  
</P>
<P>
 Coming shows include this weekend's Red Barn Bazaar at Bixby Ranch in Long 
Beach and "All About Christmas" at Peter's Landing in Huntington Harbor, as 
well as the Artistic License ethnic show at Estancia Park in Costa Mesa on Oct. 
28 and 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Her signature Christmas necklaces attract the greatest attention every year. 
They feature components from Guatemala, Peru, Ecuador and the United States and 
sell for $38 to $58. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the collection is as affordable: spiral bracelets, $42 to $75; 
necklaces, $32 to $85; earrings, $6 to $35, and pins, $25 to $40. Sirota also 
takes special orders and creates pieces with the customer's own items. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as beautiful pieces shouldn't get stuck in a drawer, Sirota believes "art 
should be worn and enjoyed rather than static on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I stopped painting to make jewelry, people kept asking me when am I 
going back to my art -- as if that's a real art form and this is not. But I 
feel like I'm going full circle. This is an extension of my fine art."

OFF THE CUFF; BEING IN CLOTHES QUARTERS; FITTING ROOMS ENABLE CUSTOMERS TO TRY 
ON -- AND EXPERIMENT WITH -- OUTFITS IN STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fitting room is more than just a place to try something on for size, says 
Laurie Trejo, district manager for 11 Clothestime stores in south Orange 
County. It's an opportunity to experiment. "Maybe a customer sees a full outfit 
we have on display and wants to see if it works for her. It's a chance to try 
something completely different."  
</P>
<P>
 Trejo confesses that she's been a fashion nut ever since childhood. "My 
grandmother was a terrific seamstress who made clothes for me and my dolls. I 
learned to appreciate clothes at an early age," says the 35-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 Trejo was a part-time saleswoman in a clothing store when she started college. 
When she graduated with a degree in art, Trejo decided to keep selling, because 
"I love clothes first. I love the atmosphere and interacting with customers."  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A fitting room should be aesthetically nice and have a cozy feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not as well-lighted as the rest of the store because people are 
undressing and feeling vulnerable, and bright lights may intimidate them. We 
want them to feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't have any security or monitors in our fitting rooms. We don't believe 
in that. Instead we believe in customer service. If you're an honest customer, 
we will be there to help you, and if you're dishonest, we'll be there too.

<P>
 My personal experience is that the No. 1 way to deter loss is having an alert 
sales associate, and honest customers benefit from the attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Our goal is to provide service for the customer once she's in the fitting 
room. We ask her how everything's fitting and what she doesn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 We also give her information on the item, such as if it will shrink, if the 
fit and length are right, and if it flatters her. About half of what a customer 
tries on she keeps. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of items brought into the fitting room is five or six. On a 
typical Saturday at one of our high-volume stores, we have about 300 people 
come into the store and about 150 try things on, so there are about 750 to 900 
pieces of apparel brought into the fitting rooms.

ANN CONWAY: R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; STOMP OF APPROVAL; GUESTS' FEET GET A 
WORKOUT AT PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The fun was nonstop at Sunday's Festa Della Vendemmia held at Prego Ristorante 
on behalf of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 guests feasted on an Italian country buffet, stomped on grapes, 
watched a Lucille Ball look-alike contest (remember the "I Love Lucy" episode 
where Lucy, flame locks tied in a kerchief, stomped grapes until her toes 
turned purple?) and danced the tarantella.  
</P>
<P>
 Nobody had smiles brighter than event chairman John Weiner, his wife, Kim, and 
their daughter Samantha, 3 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks ago Samantha completed her treatment for leukemia, a disease that 
engulfed her when she was a 15-month-old toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is stable, doing well, finished treatment," said Kim Weiner, who also 
brought the couple's 9-month-old daughter, Casey, to the fest. "The doctors 
give her a 50% to 60% chance for a total cure, which in this business is OK. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just waiting for the next two or three years to see how she does. If we 
make it through that cancer-free, she is cured." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Kim were stunned that day in 1992 when doctors at Children's Hospital 
of Orange County site of the Pediatric Cancer Research Foundation -- told them 
their little girl was so sick she would have to spend the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "There you are, holding this precious baby in your arms and suddenly they are 
taking her out of your arms," said Kim. "Little did we know that she would be 
there for the majority of the next 2 1/2 years. They didn't know if she would 
make it through the weekend. We were in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Up until those horrible days when she became pale and lethargic, Samantha had 
been a happy, healthy little girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, almost overnight, she became ill and broke out with a rash (which the 
Weiners would later learn was due to broken blood vessels, a sign that her 
blood platelets were low). 
</P>
<P>
 "I took her in (to a pediatrician) and they gave me ear medication," Kim said. 
"And then I took her back -- she had begun to bruise easily -- and they gave 
her a blood test." 
</P>
<P>
 John and Kim were told to take their sick baby to CHOC. And thus began the 
ordeal that Kim calls "a horrendous two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Weiners became involved with the Pediatric Cancer Foundation because they 
wanted so much to do something, Kim said. "Cancer makes you really feel 
helpless. It's out of your hands. Helping the foundation has been a way to make 
us feel empowered." 
</P>
<P>
 John Weiner has chaired the Festa event for two years now. And while he is 
happy to do it, he finds the job frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his calls for help -- to major corporations and potential donors -- 
went unheeded. The event at Prego on Sunday raised $28,000. "And that's 
wonderful, " John said. "But it seems like a relatively small amount 
considering all of the work that was done." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent issue of People magazine, Kim noticed that a single event for baby 
AIDS victims made a whopping $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one event!" Kim said. "Babies with cancer may not be the most popular 
disease right now, but AIDS does not kill nearly as many children as cancer 
does." (More children under the age of 18 die of cancer than any other disease, 
according to the foundation.) 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Weiners will continue to help raise funds for oncologist 
Mitchell Cairo's research foundation at CHOC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want other kids or parents to have to go through this," Kim said. 
"Our goal for the foundation is for it to not even exist."

BEHIND THE SCENES: OPERA TAKES A BOW TO YOUNGSTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The outfits ranged from T-shirts to tuxes, but what else would you expect from 
kids attending the opera? Friday was Youth Night at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, where 1,600 students saw a dress rehearsal of Opera 
Pacific's "Aida" before it premiered Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Crysler, who organized the event, said there is no dress code on Youth 
Night."The children enjoy it and have fun socializing and they dress up, but 
they don't need fine clothes to attend. We want to overcome opera's elitist 
attitude, and we want them to feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, now in its sixth season, allows sixth through 12th graders and 
their chaperons to see a performance for as little as $8 per ticket. It 
continues in January with "La Traviata," and in March with "Madama Butterfly" 
and "The Magic Flute." For more information, call (714) 474-4488 Ext. 318.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; A WHODUNIT THAT ALSO OFFERS A MORAL MYSTERY; SNOW FALLING 
ON CEDARS BY DAVID GUTERSON ; HARCOURT BRACE $21.95, 368 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Guterson's haunting first novel works on at least two levels. It gives 
us a puzzle to solve -- a whodunit complete with courtroom maneuvering and 
surprising turns of evidence -- and at the same time it offers us a mystery, 
something altogether richer and deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, off the island of San Piedro in Puget Sound, salmon fisherman Carl 
Heine is found drowned and entangled in his boat's gill net. It seems to be an 
accident. Soon, however, darker suspicions bubble to the surface, and a 
fisherman of Japanese descent, Kabuo Miyomoto, is put on trial for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Heine, the coroner discovers, has a fractured skull; before drowning, he hit 
his head on something, or was hit. Evidence confirms that Miyomoto boarded 
Heine's boat on the foggy night when he died -- a rare occurrence among these 
solitary and self-reliant men. Yet Miyomoto's initial statements to 
investigators failed to mention such a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Miyomoto had a motive for foul play. When San Piedro's Japanese 
population was interned in 1942, his parents had nearly paid off their mortgage 
on a seven-acre strawberry farm bought from Heine's parents. Heine's mother, 
Etta, promptly sold the land to another farmer. Stoic in the face of legalized 
injustice, Miyomoto and his wife, Hatsue, waited patiently to repurchase the 
farm when its owner grew old, but instead Heine bought it just before his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the puzzle: We are led to believe that Miyomoto, who fought with the 
legendary 442nd Regimental Combat Team in Europe, is an honorable man, although 
his stern bearing revives anti-Japanese prejudices that nine postwar years have 
only lightly buried. We are led to believe that distrust of whites -- his 
family and Hatsue's were shipped to the Manzanar camp in California's Owens 
Valley -- and guilt over the German soldiers he has killed make him accept his 
arrest as fate. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Miyomoto is innocent, why does a net of circumstantial evidence bind 
him as tightly as any struggling fish? 
</P>
<P>
 Ishmael Chambers covers the trial for San Piedro's newspaper, which he 
inherited from his father. A former Marine who lost an arm fighting the 
Japanese at Tarawa, Chambers was Hatsue's high school sweetheart; before her 
crowning as Strawberry Festival Princess in 1941, they secretly met and necked 
in a hollow cedar tree. From Manzanar, however, Hatsue wrote denying that she 
loved him, and in the Pacific he felt his love turn into hate. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, love and hate alike have faded. "You went numb, Ishmael," his mother 
tells him. "And you've stayed numb all these years."  
</P>
<P>
 Just as Miyomoto is obsessed with getting back the exact acreage that his 
family lost, so Chambers sleepwalks through life in the vague hope of 
reclaiming Hatsue. The contrast between these two obsessions -- one conscious 
and potentially fruitful, the other unconscious and debilitating -- is 
Guterson's main device for leading us into the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is: How can people in a small, tightly knit community be neighbors for 
generations, even love one another, yet be torn apart by racism? 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-day trial, an epochal snowstorm intensifies San Piedro's 
isolation. Island people, Chambers' father once told him, can't afford to make 
enemies.  
</P>
<P>
 "No one trod easily upon the emotions of another. . . . This was excellent and 
poor at the same time -- excellent because most people took care, poor because 
it meant an inbreeding of the spirit, too much held in, regret and silent 
brooding . . . fear of opening up." The ordeal of the storm, coupled with the 
shock of Heine's death, forces them to confront the past and cracks the ice of 
their reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Guterson (whose previous work includes a story collection, "The Country Ahead 
of Us, the Country Behind") convinces us that he knows or has researched 
everything essential here -- details of fishing, farming and lawyering; of 
Coast Guard and coroner's procedures; of Japanese American culture. 
</P>
<P>
 With a stately pace and an old-fashioned omniscient voice, he describes the 
beauty of the Puget Sound islands, the bloody chaos of Tarawa, the desolation 
of Manzanar and the inner life of every major character. 
</P>
<P>
 What he finds there is usually nobility. The only semi-villains are Etta 
Heine, a couple of FBI men and the anonymous callers who curse Chambers' father 
for his editorials defending the island's Japanese residents after Pearl 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else -- Hatsue, Heine's widow, the judge, the sheriff, the aged 
defense attorney, tough and silent Heine himself -- is human and often 
admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 How can so many good people coexist with a major historical evil? The mystery 
remains even after the puzzle is satisfyingly solved.

FLANAGAN A LEADER AT UCLA; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: CENTER, AFTER HIS FATHER'S SUICIDE 
LAST MAY, HAS TO DO SOME FAST GROWING UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has become a leader, sort of by default, which is the way he became the 
starting center at UCLA. There simply wasn't anybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody had to do it. Mike Flanagan didn't volunteer. He was drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sr. would have been proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something he wanted to do, but it's something that he's had to do," 
said Mike Sherman, the Bruins' line coach. "We have no seniors in the offensive 
line since (tackle) Paul Kennedy went out (because of an injury), and he's 
really stepped his game up the last couple of weeks. He realizes our back's 
against the wall, and Mike's a fighter." 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than a year ago, he was a foul-up, using Thursday beer-keg 
parties as a substitute for brooding about playing time he wasn't getting and 
coaches he was convinced didn't like him. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of things led to the transition. He got to play after being certain he 
never would at UCLA. He grew up some. 
</P>
<P>
 And he got an early phone call May 18, from a neighbor in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father committed suicide," Flanagan says simply. "He was a 
manic-depressive and had a rough time. He hadn't worked in a couple of years, 
and he wasn't doing too hot and took a bunch of pills." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Flanagan Sr., 54, had been a journalist, working in the Midwest, then in 
Washington, then as assistant managing editor of the Sacramento Bee. A divorce 
five years ago had taken its toll, and Mike Jr. stayed with him afterward until 
it was time to go to college. 
</P>
<P>
 Never enthusiastic about sports, Mike Sr. became a fan while watching his son 
play football and basketball for Rio Americano High in Sacramento. He listened 
to Mike Jr.'s problems, which were mainly trying to persuade coaches at UCLA he 
should play. When that playing time came, Mike Sr. became a one-man fan club. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time he was kind of gung-ho," Mike Jr. said. "He would call Thursday 
and wish me good luck, call Saturday after the game to see how things had gone 
and call Monday to see how films worked. It was kind of, you knew when the 
phone rang that it was Dad and you'd answer, 'Hey, Dad, what's up?' " 
</P>
<P>
 What was up was a struggle with medication and his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went through about every kind of prescription drug there was, and 
everything had some kind of drastic side effect," Flanagan said. "He couldn't 
eat, couldn't sleep. Whatever, it wasn't working." 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing harder for a young man than arranging his father's funeral. 
It ages him quickly. When spring became summer, and when a funeral was followed 
by selling a house and settling an estate, there was no time to be a boy. 
</P>
<P>
 There was time only for the weight room and contemplation. Flanagan had never 
been a dedicated weightlifter, and his football progress was slowed by a lack 
of strength. 
</P>
<P>
 He had come to UCLA as a 220-pound freshman with speed and athletic ability, 
but able to bench press his weight and little more. Now he's a 275-pound center 
who benches 385. A little treatment from a line coach who is no longer at UCLA 
had started the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd never play," Flanagan said. "That was especially true with 
coach (Bob) Palcic. He rode me and rode me and rode me, and I was convinced he 
hated me and I was never going to play. He was a screamer, something I'd never 
been used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan had played under Mike Smith at Rio Americano, and Smith's motivation 
took different forms -- from everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do some weird things here," Smith acknowledged. "We're not yellers and 
hollerers. Instead, we eat a worm for every point we win by -- an earthworm." 
</P>
<P>
 But college coaches don't eat worms. Palcic yelled -- a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't that I had that many problems with Mike," said Palcic, now the 
offensive line coach with the Atlanta Falcons. "I just felt he hadn't been 
playing to his potential. He had extremely high scores on his (Scholastic 
Aptitude Test), but he wasn't getting good grades. I sat down with him and 
said, 'I see you had an 1,100 or something on your SAT and you're not 
performing in the classroom. You're 6-5, 275, and you're not playing very well 
on the football field. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're not using the talent God gave you. You're underachieving.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The grades picked up. Last winter, he was on UCLA's Director's Honor Roll with 
a 3.23 grade-point average. Part of that was because he got to play football, 
but it took a while. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the second-string center as the season opened, and he played the final 
17 snaps when James Christensen injured his knee in the second game, against 
Nebraska. The next week, Craig Novitsky moved from guard to center, which 
angered Flanagan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Novitsky is a great player, a great guard or tackle, but I thought I 
was a better center," Flanagan said. "It was really eating me up inside that 
they didn't have confidence enough in me to think I could play." 
</P>
<P>
 Left tackle Jonathan Ogden was injured at Stanford, and Novitsky -- who was 
chosen in the fifth round of the NFL draft by the New Orleans Saints -- 
replaced him. Flanagan moved back in at center and he has been there since. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Sr. even began watching other Pacific 10 games, scouting them to let his 
son know about the opponent ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of funny at the time," Flanagan said. "It was him showing that he 
cared." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was a conference championship and the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 And then his longest spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Flanagan and Ogden are back as the only returning starters on the offensive 
line, and the Bruins are 2-3. They have lost three games in a row, and among 
the reasons is a line that is battered and bruised. 
</P>
<P>
 Ogden continues to stand out at tackle, a target for NFL scouts. At center, 
Flanagan is flanked by freshman Chad Sauter and junior Mike Rohme. Suddenly, he 
is the veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls the blocking signals. Because of his speed, the Bruins occasionally 
pull him out of the line to lead sweeps, unusual for a center. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a guy who could play left tackle," said Sherman, who replaced Palcic. 
"He's big enough. He could play guard. He's fast enough. He's smart too. He's 
become a leader in practice, particularly in the last two weeks, and he's a 
much better practice player today than he was the day before or last week or 
last spring." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursdays and Saturdays and Mondays still bring memories, but Mike Sr. is 
no longer there to call. Teammates and coaches and friends try to fill the 
gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hits me at strange times," Flanagan said. "I start thinking about my dad 
in pregames and stuff like that. I just wish I didn't have to think about it, 
wish it hadn't happened. I wish, I wish, I wish, you know?"

KINGS' RANSOM: FANS HELP PAY TAB; HOCKEY: NEW COURT DOCUMENTS SHOW TEAM USED 
ADVANCE PLAYOFF TICKET MONEY TO MEET PAYROLL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES and LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On June 1, 1993, the Kings wrote a new chapter in franchise history, skating 
triumphantly for the first time into Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals to face 
the Montreal Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 Not known then was how precarious the team's financial shape was off the ice. 
Only one day earlier, then-owner Bruce McNall's main company had defaulted on 
an interest payment due to Bank of America. Five weeks earlier, an emergency 
$2.8-million loan -- approved personally by one of Bank of America's top 
executives -- was needed to meet the team's payroll and to pay suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 New court documents filed in McNall's personal bankruptcy case and obtained 
this week by The Times show that, while the Kings were becoming the toast of 
Los Angeles in 1993, the team also was struggling to meet its most basic 
financial needs. Later in the year, the threat of bankruptcy court loomed so 
seriously for the team that a contingency plan was drawn up to put the club 
there. Only patience by some of McNall's bankers -- along with emergency funds 
made available at critical points -- avoided that. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents stand in stark contrast to the public position taken by King 
officials -- seeking to ease concerns of fans and the team's high-paid players 
such as Wayne Gretzky -- that the business of hockey went on as usual despite 
McNall's deteriorating financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the documents portray the Kings as a high-wire act from early 1993 
until this past May, when McNall sold 72% of the team to Jeffrey Sudikoff and 
Joseph Cohen. One bank lawyer says in the documents that the club faced a 
"nuclear meltdown" had McNall failed to complete that sale. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the documents contain embarrassing information likely to irk some 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 This past spring, the team, strapped for cash and performing nowhere near its 
Stanley Cup final level of the previous year, met its $1.5-million, bimonthly 
payroll partly by tapping into some of the millions of dollars from fans' 
advance playoff ticket money. Fans had to meet a February deadline to pay for 
playoff tickets, even though it wasn't a certain thing the Kings would, indeed, 
make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Kings failed to make the playoffs, and fans who had purchased 
the nonexistent playoff tickets ended up effectively loaning the Kings their 
payroll money interest free. Refunds to those fans were not received until six 
weeks after the team's final game. The decision to use the money to cover 
payroll came despite strong objections from a Bank of America lawyer. One of 
the bank lawyers said the lender was "very, very concerned" about using the 
money for that purpose.  
</P>
<P>
 The information on the playoff money is contained in sworn testimony from 
Robert Morrison, a lawyer with Pillsbury, Madison & Sutro, who represented Bank 
of America in dealing with McNall. The bank had extended some $125 million in 
business and personal loans to McNall before he sold a majority stake in the 
team in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, now chairman of the Kings, confirmed in an interview that fans' playoff 
ticket money was used to fund the payroll, but defended its use as "a cash-flow 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no allegations that using the playoff ticket money for payroll 
was illegal. And discussions about using the money occurred while the team was 
still in contention in March, although by that time the team's chances of 
making the playoffs were minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morrison said in his statement that the bank conveyed to Sudikoff and 
Cohen "the fact that the bank did not consent to that use and that it was an 
improper use of those funds. . . . " At the time, Sudikoff and Cohen were 
working to close the purchase of a majority stake from McNall. Morrison says in 
his statement that "the bank became very, very concerned that Sudikoff and 
Cohen, who were essentially running the Kings, were going to use the playoff 
money to fund the payroll." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that he found out -- not from Cohen and Sudikoff directly but 
from two bankruptcy attorneys, Kenneth Klee and Michael Tuchin, that the 
playoff funds were used for payroll. Klee and Tuchin had been retained to work 
with McNall and the Kings. A separate bank memo on file in court says that the 
bank had been assured that the funds were to be kept at a separate account at 
City National Bank and "will not be used without the banks' consent." 
</P>
<P>
 The lengthy delay in postseason refunds for playoff tickets was a major sore 
spot this year for King fans, some of whom deposited thousands of dollars to 
reserve tickets before the playoff hopes evaporated. Some were especially irked 
because they had been asked to pay a 75% down payment in a letter from the 
Kings in January, before the February payment deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen defended the use of the funds, adding that he and Sudikoff always 
intended to provide money for refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are the lifeblood of our business and the money belongs to the 
fans," Cohen said. "We know that and it was our intention to refund the money 
to the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he and Sudikoff had put a lot of money into the team at that point, 
and that Bank of America never stopped the Kings from using playoff money to 
cover payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The practice in sports is to use the funds as they come in and if refunds are 
necessary, the ownership stands behind the refunds," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff and Cohen were known to have been funding payroll just before they 
closed the deal to buy a majority stake in the team -- up to $4.1 million at 
one point -- but the disclosure that playoff money was used is new, as is the 
fact Bank of America objected so strongly. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cohen: "Jeffrey and I had put in a lot of cash. We were committed to 
putting cash in. This is money the team billed. There is a practice of holding 
the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told us this was normal procedure. Kings management told us. I think 
(the decision) was probably made by Kings management and potential new 
ownership. It was clear the money would be returned and, in fact, it was." 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, McNall's finances currently are being reorganized in 
bankruptcy court. In addition, sources have said that McNall has agreed to 
plead guilty to four criminal counts stemming from a federal investigation into 
his banking practices. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents on file also include an examination of James Bailey, a former 
senior financial executive in McNall's operation, who claims he raised 
questions about possible irregularities in McNall's operation as far back as 
August, 1992. A bankruptcy trustee's report released last week also said that 
Bailey found "various financial improprieties in January, 1994, including a 
bank account of the Kings that was not kept on its accounting books and into 
which millions of dollars were transferred during 1993-94." 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement, Bailey claims he expressed concern to McNall then about 
rumors that the company was being seriously mismanaged and that company assets 
were being used for personal expenses. According to Bailey's account of the 
meeting, McNall told him that some of his executives "had been involved in 
systematically creating false financial statements." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bailey in his statement: " . . . I said to him, 'These people are grossly 
incompetent.' He (McNall) said to me, 'I need to keep them around. This is what 
they've done for me in the past.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey declined to comment about his statement. A former McNall general 
counsel, Mark Eastman, has testified that he recalled Bailey telling McNall 
some of his executives were incompetent, but did not recall McNall's response. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall lawyer Tom Pollack said that Bailey's testimony "included numerous 
inaccurate statements and was contradicted in several instances by the 
testimony of several other employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Richard Wynne, McNall's bankruptcy lawyer: "Jim Bailey is still trying 
to figure out 'Who shot J.F.K.' and his testimony is based on unsupported 
guesses and is contradicted by other testimony and other evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey also testified that he found evidence that "substantial amounts of 
money had been taken out of the Kings and put into a bank account at First Los 
Angeles Bank." Bailey said he suspected that Bank of America was unaware that 
this money had been taken away from their collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon his examination of the Kings' financial records, he estimated $7.5 
million was moved out of the Kings into First Los Angeles between June 1, 1993 
and Dec. 31, 1993 and that anywhere from two to three million was taken out of 
the Kings between March, 1993, and May 31, 1993. Additionally, Bailey said that 
he was told by Marty Greenspun, former King executive director of finance, that 
in December, 1993, a $309,000 check intended to go to the Kings was intercepted 
by a McNall employee and put in First Los Angeles Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after Christmas, Bailey was asked to serve as executive vice 
president and controller of the Kings. He said McNall and a lawyer asked him to 
"go down there and protect the Kings' financial integrity and give comfort to 
Bank of America and give comfort to Sudikoff."

FLIPPER GETS A BREAK HE DIDN'T NEED; FOR GOOD OF THE TEAM, RAM RECEIVER PLAYS 
DESPITE BROKEN BONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flipper Anderson, a scared but committed Flipper Anderson, played against the 
Atlanta Falcons last week despite having broken a bone in his back a week 
earlier in the victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials, concerned that Anderson might become a marked man for the 
opposition, kept his injury a secret. When he missed practice a week ago 
Wednesday, it was announced he had flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team needed me," Anderson said, discussing the injury for the first time 
Wednesday. "I didn't do much Sunday, but just by being out there I think I 
helped open things up for Jerome Bettis." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who thinks he suffered the injury in the first quarter against the 
Chiefs, played the entire game against the Falcons, wore a flak jacket and 
caught three passes for 32 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared the first time I got hit, but it didn't hurt, so I just went on 
with it," he said. "It was a tough decision to play; I saw X-rays to get a 
feeling of what it was all about, and after warm-ups Sunday I decided to go. 
It's a scary thing, but I figured I'd be all right as long as I didn't get hit 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar injury to his back in 1991 forced Anderson to sit out four games, 
but he said the pain this time was not as pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very courageous guy; he just sucked it up," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. 
"He toldme early in the week he was going to be ready to play, and he put a 
flak jacket on and went in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the transverse process, a fracture of a small bone coming out of (his 
vertebrae); it's more painful than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson leads the league with 28.5 yards a catch. In addition to his 11 
receptions for 313 yards, including two catches for touchdowns, he has drawn 
three pass interference penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Flipper has really been misunderstood the last couple of years around 
here because he hasn't been catching many balls and scoring a lot of 
touchdowns," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. "Playing last Sunday like 
he did is just another example of how committed he is to getting this thing 
turned around." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's dedication has never been questioned -- simply overlooked. He 
doesn't miss practice, runs pattern after pattern while seemingly never needing 
a rest, and given the chance to go deep and chase a well-thrown ball, he will 
catch it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had forgotten how fast he is," said first-year Ram wide receiver coach 
Steve Moore, who had coached Anderson in the Senior Bowl seven years ago. "The 
other thing I was impressed with was his work ethic and how consistently he 
caught the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always there for you, and even though he's not getting as many balls 
thrown his way as he would probably like, there's no pouting. He just goes out 
and plays like a pro." 
</P>
<P>
 And now two words for the Rams to consider as they ponder the question of 
whether to re-sign Anderson after this season: Henry Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ellard's contract ran out a year ago, the Rams concluded they could do 
better, prompting Ellard to sign with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard was the dependable possession receiver the Rams now lack. He had 61 
receptions in 1993 -- 24 more than any other player on the roster -- and 593 
career catches -- 193 more than any other player in team history. Ancient 
history, the Rams decided, and so in his place they signed Nate Lewis, Greg 
McMurtry and Jessie Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and McMurtry were cut before the season began, Hester has a dozen 
catches for 159 yards. Ellard, meanwhile, leads the NFL with 587 yards in 29 
catches, including four for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited for Henry," Anderson said. "So much for the people who said 
Henry lost a step. I knew all along letting him go was probably going to be a 
mistake for us, but life must go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of good young receivers now and if they want to call me old at 
age 29-30 and let me go, it's something I can't control. All I'm going to do is 
my damnedest to let them see what they have here and give me an opportunity to 
stay here. I want to stay here -- especially if they stay in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson might be one of the game's top deep threats, but his lack of 
production in recent years and $1-million-plus price tag in 1995 has given the 
Rams pause to consider alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams talked about an extension this past summer, but based on the offer, 
Flipper decided to play this year out," said Ted Marchibroda, Anderson's 
representative and the son of the Indianapolis Colts' coach. "I think there 
will be a pretty good market for Flipper at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look back and the tandem of Henry Ellard and Flipper Anderson was pretty 
good, and even when they had so-so years, it wasn't all their fault. It had 
more to do with the quarterback (Jim Everett) situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Miller was signed in part this year because he throws one of the best 
deep balls in the game. Chris Chandler also has the knack to throw deep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this season, we had a great receiver in Henry Ellard and he was kind 
of the main guy and I was kind of the secondary guy," Anderson said. "I was 
just the guy off to the side. It was, 'Where's Flipper Anderson?' while Jerome 
ran for 1,000 yards and Henry caught balls for almost 1,000 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now when the team needs the big play they look to me. I go out on the 
field now and I'm hearing from a lot of defensive backs about the good job I'm 
doing. That's made a big difference, too, getting that respect from my peers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' struggling offense, which has been rendered weaker by injuries to 
Miller and Chandler, has once again played havoc with Anderson's opportunity to 
become one of the game's dominant receivers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I read a lot of things during the off-season about how Nate Lewis and Haywood 
Jeffires were going to be the starters, and how Anderson had lost a step," 
Anderson said. "It was like they had pushed me to the side in their plans, but 
here I am and where are those guys? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I can help the Rams win a lot of games. One of my individual goals is 
to get to the Pro Bowl, but we have to win games and get to the playoffs. 
That's what I want -- to be part of a team that wins lots of games, and that's 
why I played Sunday even though my back hurt. Teams are going to be bearing 
down on Jerome as it is, but if I can be out there, that helps him and that 
gives us a better chance to win."

BEAUREGARD SIDELINED BY INJURY; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NORTHRIDGE TO TAKE NO ACTION 
AGAINST OFFENSIVE LINEMAN ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The curious case of Cal State Northridge football player Jonathan Beauregard 
took another bizarre turn Wednesday when school officials announced that they 
would take no action against the senior lineman, who stands accused of two 
counts of attempted murder in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, though, already had managed to sideline himself. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said Beauregard suffered a broken ring finger on his right 
hand at practice Tuesday night and will be sidelined from two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he not been injured, Beauregard would have been allowed to play while his 
case worked its way through the courts, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested on the first day of the fall semester, Aug. 29, and 
was charged with shooting his ex-girlfriend and her male acquaintance outside a 
San Bernardino bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a criminology major who was senior class president at San 
Bernardino's Cajon High in 1989-90, did not tell his teammates or coaches of 
the arrest and started at offensive right guard in each of the Matadors' four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 After waiting two days to make a formal decision on Beauregard's status with 
the team, the school reasserted its initial stance that students accused of 
criminal behavior will be presumed innocent until proven otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said that no matter what 
institutional course of action was plotted, appeasing everyone was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will have their opinions on this," he said. "But a fair trial is a 
basic right in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 The school first was tipped to the charges Friday night. After playing in 
Saturday's 47-17 victory over Cal State Chico, Beauregard was granted 
permission to skip practice Monday to tend to personal matters. He rejoined the 
team Tuesday and was injured during a full-contact blocking drill, Coach Bob 
Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard did not attend practice Wednesday and could not be reached for 
comment. Burt supported the school's ruling and said Beauregard's fate should 
be decided in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a policeman, a judge or a district attorney," Burt said. "I'm a 
football coach and he's a football player and a student. He deserves the same 
rights everybody else has." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said he could not remember a case of this kind in his tenure as 
athletic director, which began in 1978. Hiegert, Burt and Ron Kopita, the dean 
of students, were among a handful of administrators who met at length Wednesday 
to decide Beauregard's playing status. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said the group disregarded disciplinary measures often taken at other 
universities. UCLA, for example, routinely has suspended athletes accused of 
serious offenses while the legal process runs its course. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policies of those institutions and the policies of those departments are 
theirs alone," Hiegert said. "I don't think it was a tough decision." 
</P>
<P>
 The injury likely will sideline Beauregard until after his arraignment, 
scheduled for Oct. 19. His status with the team beyond that point has not been 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't speculate on what happens then," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said Beauregard will not travel with the team to its next two games, 
Saturday at Sonoma State and Oct. 15 at St. Mary's. The team does not take 
injured players on road trips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said he was taping an interview with a television station inquiring about 
Beauregard's status when the player broke the finger. The coach learned of the 
injury when he walked back onto the practice field moments after the cameraman 
left the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt said senior Eric Thomas will replace Beauregard in the starting lineup. 
As a bystander, Thomas was shot in the back during the holdup of a fast-food 
restaurant in South-Central Los Angeles in 1989.

SEASON NOW IN JEOPARDY; HOCKEY: PLAYERS REJECT TWO PROPOSALS FOR COMPROMISE. 
ONE OWNER SAYS, 'IT'S OVER.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pessimism about saving the full NHL season set in among negotiators Wednesday 
after the players' association, fighting the imposition of a payroll levy that 
would subsidize weak clubs, rejected two contract proposals from the league 
containing significant compromises. 
</P>
<P>
 It was learned that the NHL, bowing to players' claims that a payroll levy 
unfairly burdened them with supporting small-market clubs, offered to impose a 
levy on gate receipts. That proposal would spread the economic load among 
players and owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The second proposal made Wednesday stipulated the levy would be assessed on 
all payroll dollars, not only on the amount clubs exceeded a negotiated limit. 
That was meant to address players' objections that a levy would function as a 
salary cap because clubs would try to keep salaries low to avoid paying fines 
triggered by excess spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're going to be able to reach an agreement," said John 
McMullen, owner of the New Jersey Devils and a participant in the last two 
bargaining sessions. "It's over." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tony Tavares, president of the Mighty Ducks: "This is a joke. I cannot 
believe there is absolutely no movement on the part of the NHLPA. They're 
clearly sending a message they have no intention of making a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Players continue to object to any form of salary restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "At what point does a tax become a salary cap?" said Mike Gartner, president 
of the NHL Players Assn. "Until we come up with a solution to our philosophical 
differences, we'll be negotiating for a long time, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, the union's executive director, said he would assemble a 
counterproposal "within the next couple of days." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, when he delayed the start of the season until Oct. 15 and created 
a two-week negotiating period, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said he would 
cancel games if he didn't see a deal or substantial progress by the new 
deadline. He said Wednesday he is not ready to declare an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, because I want to be in a position to have hockey games being played and 
I am going to do everything in my power so that can happen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I'm frustrated, and I guess that's how I'll leave it." 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL has tinkered with the levy several times, reducing the rate from a 
maximum of 200% and changing it to a gradual increase before revising it again 
to a maximum of 125% on Tuesday. Those moves led McMullen to say Tuesday he 
believed a compromise was possible and a complete season could be played. The 
players' double rejection Wednesday doused that optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lines are hardening. I'm very disappointed, very frustrated," said Howard 
Baldwin, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins. "(A deal) can get done, I think, 
if you have two sides that are willing to compromise and negotiate. All we have 
done is extend two offers, offers that keep getting better, and we get nothing 
back but no, no, no. You can't make a deal unless two people are willing to 
negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen claimed that Gartner conceded the NHL's proposal "technically" was 
not a salary cap. Gartner could not be reached for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow and the union have proposed a flat tax of 5.5% on the payrolls and 
gate receipts of the 16 top-revenue clubs. The proceeds would be distributed to 
small-market clubs. The NHL contends that would not produce enough money to 
help needy clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, the most important thing in the world when you deal with a union is 
to have an intelligent union leader," McMullen said, "and we didn't have one 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman later apologized for that remark. Other management representatives, 
however, were unapologetic in their biting criticism of Goodenow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never capitulate because of the tactics he is using on the league," 
said Harry Sinden, president and general manager of the Boston Bruins. "All my 
fears are realized. I had hoped we would be able to work out a deal. He has no 
intention of doing anything to help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares suggested Goodenow had not fully informed players about the issues. 
Although Goodenow has said the NHL never gave him complete financial data, 
Tavares said such information had been made available to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's shocking to me is the perception by the NHLPA that the league is 
inflexible and the league is not trying to make a deal," Tavares said. "I don't 
think anyone is working harder to make a deal than Gary Bettman. I think the 
players are basically disinterested. I think the players have received a great 
deal of disinformation, which has caused them to be inflexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck forward Stu Grimson disputed Tavares' characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think to this point, the players have been extremely flexible in terms of 
coming around to the position of assuming some of the responsibility for the 
problems (of the small-market clubs)," he said. "Is it the employee's 
responsibility to fix any other industry?"

ANOTHER FOOTBALL COACHING CHANGE IS MADE AT MUIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena Muir High, annually one of the Southland's top schools for football 
talent, made an abrupt coaching change on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Allen, in his second year as head coach, was relieved of his duties and 
replaced by former assistant Mike Harrison.Harrison, who has never been a high 
school head football coach, will serve on an interim basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir, rated high in several preseason polls, is 2-2. It was 8-3 under Allen 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Talbert, Muir's principal, said he met Monday with between 15 and 20 
varsity players who expressed varying concerns about the team. Many of those 
players suggested Jim Brownfield, who coached the school to a pair of Southern 
Section championships in the 1980s, be brought back. Brownfield coaches girls' 
track at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison is Muir's eighth coach since 1987. ERIC SHEPARD

 So many leagues have already gone out, no one might notice another, but NBA 
Commissioner David Stern says he'd like to buck the trend, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Board of Governors meeting Wednesday in New York, Stern said the NBA has 
no intention of locking its players out when the season starts Nov. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Grantham, director of the players' association, replied, "No one wants 
a strike," and pronounced himself "cautiously optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 NBA players are thought to be dovish on the whole thing. The Chicago Bulls 
haven't even had a player representative for two seasons, and there have been 
reports that several other stars want no part of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, an agent identified two of them to The Times as Orlando's Shaquille 
O'Neal and Charlotte's Alonzo Mourning. O'Neal's Century City-based agent, 
Leonard Armato, said he'd hate to see his multimillionaire client wearing one 
of those "Unfair to the Working Man" sandwich boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me to see why a strike would be better than continuing to 
negotiate or utilizing the court system," Armato said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the union has refused to negotiate, pressing its case in court first. 
An attempt to strike down the existing structure, complete with the draft and 
salary cap, was denied by a federal district judge last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The union then appealed. A verdict is expected in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA owners convened their meeting Wednesday in a crisis atmosphere verging 
on hysteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, union president Buck Williams, reacting to the lockout talk, said 
if the owners didn't bar the doors, the players might strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, the New York Times ran a story headlined "Labor Problems Galore. 
Collaboration or Coincidence?" In it, baseball union leader Donald Fehr was 
quoted as saying: "I don't know if it's a grand conspiracy, but my information 
is they (Stern, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman and baseball owners' negotiator 
Richard Ravitch) have been in regular contact. They've had some meetings in 
Bettman and Stern's offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the New York Daily News reported the NBA had set a Nov. 15 deadline 
for a lockout, before players received their first paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Stern denied everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never had a strike and never had a lockout," he said. "We know what a 
strike is. We know what a lockout is. But those particular weapons have never 
been called into action. We haven't and we don't plan to." 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA is insisting on the salary cap and the draft and has additionally 
asked for a "rookie cap" to limit the contracts of first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 However Stern insists there is only one real issue -- how to divide the more 
than $1 billion in revenues the NBA makes annually -- and has directed NBA 
owners to disclose financial data to the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham, in his first negotiation as head of the union, has taken a hard line 
-- perhaps in retaliation. The NBA had a chummy relationship with his 
predecessor, Larry Fleisher, but soon after Grantham took over, the league was 
caught hiding luxury-box money from the players. 
</P>
<P>
 NBA players, however, are thought to be fat and happy. Agents, who normally 
reflect the mood of their clients, think the present structure is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Armato notes that the NBA's "soft cap," which lets teams sign their own free 
agents for any amount, is less restrictive than the NFL's "hard cap," and still 
represents sport's most generous system. Most agents for NBA players even 
espouse "give-backs" in the form of a rookie cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, with the lockout scenario gone for the immediate future, Grantham 
struck his own conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, nobody wants a strike," he said from New York. "You have to 
start with that assumption. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We had rumors floating they (NBA owners) were going to lock us out. They 
decided that clearly that's not what they want to do here -- at least 
initially. Our players are reporting to work on time. We have no intention of 
having them strike at the start of the season. The issue, however, if it ever 
comes up, is not a strike that I call. It's a strike that all the players vote 
on. To find players right now saying they don't want to strike -- they have 
nothing to strike for." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, owners ratified offense-boosting rule changes adopted by the 
competition committee, shortening the three-point line and toughening rules 
against hand-checking.

UNION SKEPTICAL OF A PROPOSED SIGNING FREEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for the baseball players' union reacted skeptically Wednesday to the 
owners' request for a 45-day freeze on contract signings and a postponement in 
the start of free-agent filing from Oct. 15 to Nov. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Management attorney Chuck O'Connor, in a meeting with union officials in New 
York, said owners are concerned about players signing before new rules are 
established -- either via a bargaining agreement or unilateral implementation 
of the owners' salary-cap proposal -- and the freeze would give both sides a 
chance to focus on bargaining negotiations, which are likely to resume next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Union attorney Lauren Rich said the union would weigh the request over the 
next few days but expressed reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know why the owners want the 45 days," Rich said. "They want the 45 days 
to decide exactly what they're going to implement. Our question is, what 
advantage is it to the players? They haven't answered that yet, and the way I 
figure it, they're saying to the players, 'Stand still for 45 days while we 
focus you in our gun sights.' I mean, why do we need a freeze to get on with 
negotiations?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said the union also fears that owners might unilaterally impose the 
freeze even if the players reject it, which would raise the specter of 
collusion. O'Connor acknowledged that the owners are thinking about imposing 
the freeze no matter what the union decides and said the anti-collusion clause 
in the current bargaining agreement can be unilaterally eliminated, a view the 
union would challenge, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milwaukee, meanwhile, acting Commissioner Bud Selig had what he called "a 
pleasant exchange of ideas" with one of his chief antagonists, Baltimore Oriole 
owner Peter Angelos, ostensibly, sources said, for Angelos to lobby for a tax 
concept that he recently proposed to union leader Donald Fehr and which Selig 
has agreed to present to the other owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the union would apply a 3% tax to player salaries, which would 
add $30 million, based on $1 billion in compensation, to the $70 million that 
the big-market clubs have offered to share with small-market clubs in their 
current proposal. However, the Angelos plan is devoid of the salary cap that a 
majority of owners still think is necessary. ROSS NEWHAN

ANGELS FINALLY RELEASE REYNOLDS; 5 POTENTIAL FREE AGENTS PROTECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It took three months longer than second baseman Harold Reynolds hoped, but he 
finally got his wish Wednesday when he was released by the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, exasperated by his lack of playing time during the season, 
repeatedly asked to be traded or released midway through the schedule.Reynolds, 
33, batted .232 in 74 games and had 11 runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't see him coming back next year," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels protected their five remaining potential free agents and put them 
on their 40-man roster, but sources say the Angels have interest in retaining 
only outfielder Bo Jackson, reliever Bob Patterson and infielder/outfielder Rex 
Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news, Rod Carew officially notified the Angels that he will return as 
their batting instructor, completing their coaching staff.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, minor league pitcher Paul Swingle, who was on the disabled list all 
season, was designated for assignment and removed from the 40-man roster. BOB

A SEASON WITHOUT TITLES; BASEBALL: PLAYERS WILL BE HONORED, BUT THERE WILL BE 
NO DIVISIONAL CHAMPIONS BECAUSE OF THE SHORTENED SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers led the National League West with a 58-56 record when the players 
strike ended the season on Aug. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 What does that mean? 
</P>
<P>
 It means the Dodgers led the division on Aug. 12, and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the Dodgers nor any other division leader will be recognized as a 
division champion, National League Vice President Katy Feeney said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 And since there were no playoffs, Feeney said, there will be no league 
champions, which means the 1995 season will start, providing the labor dispute 
is resolved, with the Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays, the 1993 
pennant winners, as defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody took their place," Feeney said of the teams that finished fourth and 
third, respectively, this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The league constitutions authorize the respective league presidents to declare 
the champions, according to Feeney, who said the recommendation to go without 
champions at any level was reached in a recent meeting that she attended with 
American League Vice President Phyllis Merhige, baseball's executive director 
of operations, William A. Murray, and Seymour Siwoff, general manager of the 
Elias Sports Bureau, baseball's official statistical house. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, Feeney said, it was decided that the individual 
statistical leaders would be recognized as champions in their respective 
categories. Thus, Tony Gwynn and Paul O'Neill won the National and American 
league batting crowns; Matt Williams and Ken Griffey Jr. were the home run 
kings, and Greg Maddux and Steve Ontiveros won the earned-run average titles. 
</P>
<P>
 While neither Gwynn nor O'Neill had the 502 plate appearances required of a 
batting champion, based on 3.1 appearances for each of the 162 games in a 
normal schedule, the rule in this case was changed to require 3.1 plate 
appearances per games played, which permitted Gwynn and O'Neill to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' union has yet to approve the change but is expected to, having 
approved a similar change in 1981, when the schedule was shortened by a 50-day 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeney said she saw no contradiction in deciding there could be individual 
championships but not team championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statistics are what they are," she said of the individual titles, "but 
the season was never completed. The races were unfinished. There were no 
division or league playoffs to determine the champions." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dodger Vice President Fred Claire: "To some degree that's a little 
inconsistent."

ANGELOS, SHAW TO DISCUSS RAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' chief executive officer, arrived in Los 
Angeles on Wednesday for discussions with John Shaw, Ram president, in regards 
to moving the team to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw and Angelos have met before and Shaw said recently a deal with Baltimore 
could be completed "within 24 hours." 
</P>
<P>
 However, such a deal has not been completed because of the Rams' concern about 
possible legal problems with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke, who is expected to fight a Rams' 
move to Baltimore, won approval from the league last week to move his team to 
Laurel, Md., as soon as a new stadium is constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams decide to move to Baltimore, Angelos is expected to purchase a 
minority interest in the team and lead the legal fight against Cooke and the 
NFL. T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CHANDLER HOPEFUL DESPITE SPRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Chandler's sprained left ankle showed improvement Wednesday, 
but not enough for him to return to practice and unseat Chris Miller, who's 
expected to start Sunday at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler threw in a light workout for the first time after spraining the ankle 
in the second quarter of an 8-5 loss to Atlanta on Sunday. But he's listed as 
doubtful for the Green Bay game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's optimistic about it," Ram Coach Chuck Knox said. "But I don't think 
we'll know anything until Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox plans to start Miller, still bothered by a pinched nerve and slight 
shoulder separation, over a healthy but ineffective Tommy Maddox. Miller got a 
little more than half the work in practice Wednesday to prepare him against a 
Packer pass rush that features Sean Jones and Reggie White. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who started the first three games until sidelined with injuries, threw 
on Tuesday and Wednesday, but most of the practice snaps went to Maddox, who 
needs more work to learn the offensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously not 100%," Miller said after practice. "It's still weak and 
not as strong as it should be. It's pretty sore. I'll ice it and rest it and 
get ready for Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Is the shoulder healthy enough for Miller to play? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not now, but it will be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Miller, tailback Jerome Bettis and fullback Tim Lester, the Rams will 
start a beat-up backfield Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis sat out practice because he was still sore from a deep bruise in his 
low back. Lester limped off the practice field after mildly spraining his left 
ankle in a collision with linebacker Roman Phifer. Bettis and Lester said they 
expect to play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis voiced concern for his health and durability after a heavy workload the 
past two games. He carried a combined 64 times for 264 yards in those games, 
and his 130 carries this season are 12 more than any other NFL back. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (coaches) have to remember," Bettis said, "is that (Bettis) is an 
ironman but he's not made of steel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams placed wide receiver Richard Buchanan on waivers to make room on the 
roster for third-string quarterback Jamie Martin, whom they re-signed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury report: Cornerback Steve Israel, who missed the last three games with 
tendinitis in his left knee, practiced Wednesday but his game status is still 
uncertain. "He had his knee drained and no fluid has come back," Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive tackle Darryl Ashmore (knee) is out, tailback David Lang (deep thigh 
bruise) is questionable and center Bern Brostek (sprained ankles) is probable.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; UCLA; MCELROY SHOWS HE IS NO LIGHTWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As one of several freshmen getting playing time at UCLA, wide receiver Jim 
McElroy is more than pulling his weight. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of his problems.He weighs only 147 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't seem to put any on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy, who played at Washington High, impressed UCLA coaches with his speed 
in preseason practice, not his ability to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 He dropped them all for a week, then caught a touchdown pass from reserve 
quarterback Rob Walker in a scrimmage and has caught most of the balls thrown 
to him since. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a whole different world," he said of playing college football. "I 
couldn't wait to catch the football and put some moves on somebody, so I wasn't 
concentrating. Then Bryan Adams and Kevin Jordan talked to me about catching it 
first, and it made a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 McElroy has three receptions for 33 yards and ran a flanker reverse against 
Washington as the Bruins seek to find a way to use his speed. When a block was 
blown, McElroy was caught for a loss of 11 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has begun returning kickoffs, subbing for Adams and pairing with Derek 
Ayers. Ayers caught all the kickoffs against Washington, which made McElroy a 
blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those big guys think that us little guys won't hit," he said. "I'll hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But he would rather return the kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just waiting for one to be kicked to me," he said. "I can see a seam 
already." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Skip Hicks to get more playing time this week as the Bruins work him 
back into the running back rotation. Hicks carried twice for minus one yard 
against Washington in his first game of the season after recovering from knee 
surgery. JIM HODGES

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MOSS ENCOURAGES A MEAN STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's wrong with the 1-3 Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the running game could be better. True, the pass rush hasn't been as 
effective as it has been in the past. No question the penalties have hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 But linebacker Winston Moss has a quick prescription for what ails his club: 
nasty and mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would definitely say there's not enough meanness, there's not enough 
toughness," Moss said. "You don't want to leave the ballgame without knowing 
you did everything you could to help the team win." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss has been criticized for sometimes being too nasty and mean. He was fined 
$7,500 for sticking his fist into the helmet of Seattle Seahawk quarterback 
Rick Mirer earlier this season, setting off a confrontation that resulted in 
three ejections. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moss is not about to point fingers at teammates who, he feels, might not 
be showing their emotions enough on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot make somebody do something they are not comfortable doing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is clear he feels his club should be doing more with the talent it has. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say, (we're) flat," he told reporters. "I don't want to say 
underachievers. But there's something there that is missing. Intensity is the 
key word. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to play with a certain fear. You've got to play as if someone is 
out to hurt you. You've got to make sure you're the one that's dishing out most 
of the punishment and not taking it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all men. Each one of us has to answer to himself if he doesn't show up 
on Sunday. I respect that you only have a job week to week. Nap (fullback 
Napoleon McCallum, who suffered a season-ending injury in the opener) gets into 
that Monday night game and one play he's playing and the next play he's not. 
You have to play as if you don't know if you'll ever step on that field again." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an emotional message, but it was delivered to the wrong audience. STEVE

 Rob Johnson's status remained uncertain Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The USC senior quarterback worked out in shorts, throwing passes on the 
sideline. Johnson sprained his right ankle Saturday against Oregon and on 
Monday said he will be ready to play Saturday at Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach John Robinson said Johnson will not play "if he isn't close to 
100%."

 Portland Oregonian columnist Dwight Jaynes says the dump-Rich Brooks crowd at 
Oregon still isn't happy, even after the Ducks' 22-7 upset of USC on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, in his 18th Oregon season, has a 85-107-4 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaynes said an Oregon fan, while enjoying the victory over USC, commented to 
him: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we'll never get rid of Brooks!"

 USC's longest winning streak against Pac-10 schools is against Oregon State -- 
20 in a row. Oregon State's last victory in the series was at Corvallis in 
1967, 3-0 in the mud, in a year USC won the national championship. . . . Of 
USC's 11 possessions Saturday against Oregon, three penetrated the Oregon 40. 
In addition, the Trojans converted only four of 16 third downs. EARL GUSTKEY

 Quarterback Chris Chandler's sprained left ankle showed improvement, but not 
enough for him to return to practice and unseat Chris Miller, who is expected 
to start Sunday at Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler threw in a light workout for the first time after spraining the ankle 
in the second quarter of an 8-5 loss to Atlanta on Sunday.But he's listed as 
doubtful for the Green Bay game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's optimistic about it," Coach Chuck Knox said. "But I don't think we'll 
know anything until Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox plans to start Miller, still bothered by a pinched nerve and slight 
shoulder separation, over a sound but ineffective Tommy Maddox. Miller got a 
little more than half the work in practice Wednesday to prepare him against a 
Packer pass rush that features Sean Jones and Reggie White. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the practice snaps went to Maddox, who needs more work to learn the 
offensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Miller, tailback Jerome Bettis and fullback Tim Lester, the Rams will 
start a beat-up backfield Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis sat out practice because of soreness from a deep bruise in his lower 
back. Lester limped off the practice field after mildly spraining his left 
ankle in a collision with linebacker Roman Phifer. Both said they expect to 
play Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis voiced concern over a heavy workload the last two games. He carried a 
combined 64 times for 264 yards in those games, and his 130 carries this season 
are 12 more than any other NFL back. MIKE REILLEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; DOWN GOES FRAZIER, PUTTING NEBRASKA'S 
HOPES ON ROPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had everything gone as planned--and it hasn't for poor Nebraska quarterback 
Tommie Frazier--the Cornhusker star would have sat out Saturday's game against 
Oklahoma State, maybe would have played the next week against Kansas State and 
most definitely would have started against Missouri Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing unusual develops," Nebraska Coach Tom Osborne had said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came the news Tuesday that Frazier had developed a second blood clot 
in his right leg, once again requiring hospitalization. On Wednesday, a doctor 
recommended surgery and said Frazier should have no physical contact for three 
to six months, meaning he is lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 A full recovery, of course, is what matters most. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact remains that Nebraska is a significantly less dangerous team 
without Frazier in the lineup. Nothing against backup Brook Berringer, who is 
recovering from a partially collapsed left lung (he's fine now; no rib damage 
was discovered), but Nebraska can't beat Colorado Oct. 29 in Lincoln without 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer, who was hurt despite wearing a football flak jacket, scored three 
touchdowns in a 10-point victory against Wyoming last Saturday, but that's the 
problem--it was against Wyoming , now 2-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, don't tell Osborne that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was one of the most brutal games I've been around in a long time," he said 
of the hard hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Berringer, who spent last Saturday night and then Sunday in the hospital, is 
back at practice and is expected to start against Oklahoma State . . . and 
Kansas State . . . and every other game remaining on the schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 And pity the Cornhuskers if Berringer goes down. Two of Nebraska's best 
prospects, scholarship quarterbacks Ben Rutz and Jon Elder, transferred to 
other schools in the last year because they didn't want to wait for playing 
time. That leaves Osborne with the following choices: 1) Berringer; 2) 
non-scholarship player Matt Turman, a sophomore; 3) safety Tony Veland, a 
former quarterback switched to defense early in the 1993 season; 4) walk-on 
Monte Christo, who is recovering from hand surgery; 5) Adam Kucera, a former 
team trainer; 6) Ryan Held, a converted wide receiver; 7) retirement. LET'S GET 
READY TO RUMBBBBLLLLLEEEEEE! 
</P>
<P>
 On its way to an NCAA-record 58-game home victory streak, Miami was an 
underdog a grand total of two times, according to the best guess of the 
Hurricane sports information department. The games: Against No. 1 Florida State 
in 1988, against No. 2 Florida State in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? They're dogs again, this time three points . . . at home . . . 
against No. 3 Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a slap in the face," Miami defensive lineman Dwayne Johnson said. 
"Those oddsmakers are funny people. It really doesn't matter though. The Orange 
Bowl is our home." 
</P>
<P>
 True to form, the 13th-ranked Hurricanes are doing all the necessary pregame 
woofing, but facts are facts: Miami is 3-1, doesn't even lead the Big East 
Conference, got whipped by Washington at the Orange Bowl and is one loss away 
from being totally eliminated from the national championship race. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is the one for us to make it or break it," linebacker Rohan Marley 
said. "This will decide whether we're a great team or a mediocre team--and we 
know we're not mediocre." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Hurricane guard Tirrell Greene: "The streak is over. It's time 
to start our own streak. We have to put (the Washington loss) behind us. We 
can't lose two in a row in the Orange Bowl. We won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Star defensive tackle Warren Sapp said he became a believer in Miami mystique 
in 1984, the year he bet $20 on the Hurricanes to lose to Nebraska in the 
Orange Bowl. Miami won; he lost. "And I said then I'd never go against the 
Hurricanes in a big game again in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sapp, there is no bigger game than the one against Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a day I go without thinking of this game," he said. "It's what 
you live for. It's what men are made of. You've got to be a real man to step 
out on that field and go four quarters with Florida State." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami has won seven of the last nine games against Florida State, but lost 
last year at Tallahassee. The Hurricanes, though, are 4-1 against the Seminoles 
when Florida State is ranked higher. WILL YOU BE MY FRIEND? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody like Lou? 
</P>
<P>
 Last week it was Stanford Coach Bill Walsh who nearly backpedaled his way into 
San Francisco Bay after someone asked him about calling Notre Dame Coach Lou 
Holtz "a spoiled brat" in a recently published book. Now the intrigue 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 During his weekly Sunday news conference, Holtz was asked about first-year 
Boston College Coach Dan Henning, whose Eagles play the Irish Saturday at 
B.C.'s Alumni Stadium. That's when Holtz, after calling Henning "an intelligent 
individual," mentioned their relationship years ago at William & Mary. Holtz 
was an assistant coach, Henning was a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I read a comment the other day where he said we didn't get along 
then," Holtz said. "I didn't realize that. But I have tried to help him every 
way possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz then listed the favors, including a job offer and job recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dan was out of coaching and working as a night watchman at the World Trade 
Center and he called me and I hired him," Holtz said of the offer that brought 
Henning to the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 When told of Holtz's remarks a day later, Henning said he recalled making no 
such derogatory statements, praised the Notre Dame coach, but also never 
exactly called Holtz one of his favorite pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of the most clever people I've ever met, one of the most committed 
coaches I've ever met," said Henning, whose career included a so-so stay with 
the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed later about the relationship, a testy Henning added: "As I said, he's 
one of the cleverest individuals I've ever met. Self made. When I first knew 
him he didn't do all that magic. Then when I went to work for him with the 
Jets, he'd escalated to the point where he could fool anybody with the magic 
tricks. Tremendous speaker. I don't think he was a great speaker when I first 
met him. He is motivated. He has a way with words. He's very clever as a 
football coach, as an individual and a very difficult opponent to figure out 
and I wouldn't even begin to (try)." 
</P>
<P>
 Memo to Holtz: Walsh isn't making many friends himself these days. The guy 
spends half his time apologizing to other coaches (Jim Lambright at Washington, 
John Robinson at USC and now Holtz) for things he insists he didn't say or were 
taken out of context. And trust us, Henning is no prize, either. His 
personality is as sour as three-month-old milk. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam insists he isn't a Heisman Trophy 
candidate, but his statistics and his coach say otherwise. Salaam is third in 
total rushing yards (727), third in yards per carry (6.8) and first in yards 
per game (181.7). Against Texas last week he gained 317 yards in 35 carries and 
also caught five passes. All this from someone who played eight-man football at 
La Jolla Country Day. "With Salaam, when I first saw him in person," Colorado 
Coach Bill McCartney said, "I just said, ' That is a good-looking child."' . . 
. It's official: You now can take Syracuse's Paul Pasqualoni off the endangered 
coaches list. The Orangemen are 4-1, just beat then-14th-ranked Virginia Tech 
and will enter their next two games--Pittsburgh and Temple--as considerable 
favorites. Syracuse could have been undefeated but blew a late lead in the 
season opener against Oklahoma. Pasqualoni isn't complaining. After some 
experts chose the Orangemen 1993 preseason No. 1s, Syracuse finished 6-4-1, 
which prompted rumors of Pasqualoni's firing and the return of popular former 
coach Dick MacPherson. "We wanted to show, 'Hey, this is Syracuse and we can 
still play football around here,' " Pasqualoni said. . . . When Notre Dame 
plays Boston College Saturday at 44,000-seat Alumni Stadium, it will mark the 
smallest crowd the Irish have played in front of since 1982, when they traveled 
to Oregon in 1982--announced attendance, 40,381. It could have been worse, 
Alumni Stadium was recently expanded by 12,000 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With conference games remaining against the likes of Ohio State and Wisconsin 
on the road and Penn State and Michigan at home, go ahead and kiss Illinois' 
Rose Bowl chances goodby. "No one is going to the Rose Bowl with two losses," 
Illini Coach Lou Tepper told reporters after last week's upset defeat to 
Purdue. "We've wasted one already." Illinois, one of our preseason longshots 
for stardom, has the nation's best defense, but has an offense from the Dark 
Ages. . . . Taking advantage of an invitation by Stanford's Walsh, director, 
actor and New York Knick nut Spike Lee, who can't stand Notre Dame, spent last 
week with the Cardinal, going so far as to eat meals with the team and walking 
the sideline during Saturday's loss to the Irish. Notre Dame players weren't 
amused and afterward started shouting, "This is where it's at! This is where 
it's at!" . . . No. 1-ranked Florida continues to astound and amaze. The Gators 
have yet to give up a second-half point. Against Mississippi last Saturday, 
they didn't allow the Rebels past the 50-yard line in the last two quarters. 
Ole Miss offensive tackle James Holcombe, a fifth-year senior, said Florida 
defensive end Kevin Carter was the best player he had ever seen and ever played 
against. And Ole Miss defensive back Derek Jones said Jack Jackson, who caught 
six passes for 120 yards and two scores for the Gators, was the best receiver 
he had ever defended. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jackson: The junior wide receiver played at Moss Point High in 
Mississippi, but never once considered signing with the Rebels. The reason: the 
sight of Confederate flags on campus and at games. "How can they say the school 
has banned the flag when you see them everywhere?" Jackson told Rick Cleveland 
of the Jackson (Miss.) Clarion-Ledger. "If it were up to me, they would be 0 
and 11 every year and they'd never get a black player." . . . After three 
consecutive victories against ranked opponents-- Wisconsin, at Michigan and at 
Texas--Colorado gets a one-game reprieve against miserable Missouri on Saturday 
and then faces three more teams currently ranked in the Associated Press top 
25--Oklahoma (12), Kansas State (19), at Nebraska (2). Top 10

EX-SUNNY HILLS STAR PIZULA PLAYING BIG AGAIN ALONG RIO GRANDE; FOOTBALL: NEW 
MEXICO STATE HAS IMPROVED, THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF THIS RUNNING BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Pizula had an outstanding high school football career at Sunny Hills in 
Fullerton, but his chances for success as a college running back were open to 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably are 2,000 backs coming out of high school every year with 
Brian's physical attributes," said his high school coach, Tim Devaney. "He was 
5-11 and around 190 pounds, and could run 4.7 in the 40. But you know how 
college recruiters are. They're always looking for running backs who are 
bigger, stronger and can run a 4.6 instead of a 4.7." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he ran for more than 1,000 yards two consecutive years at Sunny 
Hills, Pizula was an "everyman" as a college running back prospect. But that 
didn't dim his hopes for the future, even if recruiters weren't beating down 
the doors to sign him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some interest in him," said Devaney. "Nevada recruited him along 
with New Mexico State, but I think one of our former players who played at New 
Mexico State, David Chisum, had something to do with New Mexico State getting 
involved too. And I told them that there was a lot more to Brian than just 
being 5-11 and 190." 
</P>
<P>
 That support has turned out to be justified, based on Pizula's performance for 
New Mexico State his senior season. He has had two consecutive strong 
performances, rushing for 300 yards in the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Pizula was honored as Big West Conference back of the week for 
his play in a 24-17 victory over Arkansas State. He rushed for 183 yards, 
caught two passes for 14 and had a 16-yard kickoff return for a total of 213 
yards. In a program known more for passing than the running game, it was the 
best one-game rushing effort at the school in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Pizula had another good game, even though the Aggies were beaten 
by Nevada Las Vegas, 31-27. Pizula ran for 117 yards in 23 carries and caught 
six passes for 70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He now ranks fourth in the conference in rushing with an average of 71.4 yards 
per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel as though I've been improving every game and I feel good about that," 
Pizula said. "I was just disappointed that we didn't win last weekend. That was 
a tough loss for us. But I feel good about the way I've played, especially 
lately." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, Pizula also had a game-winning touchdown catch with 
slightly more than a minute left in a 23-22 victory over Texas El Paso. "We had 
a third and six on the 10-yard line, and they were looking for a run, so it 
really worked," Pizula said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess calls Pizula "a throwback to another era" 
because of his ability to run, catch and block well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been going to him a lot more lately, too, because he's been the one 
with the hot hand," Hess said. "He's had a tremendous number of big plays in 
the last three games. And we've probably been running the ball a little more 
because of him, too. Even though he's not real fast, he has a good eye for 
finding the opening." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies are 2-3 for the season, but two of those losses came against top 10 
teams, Florida and Arizona. Those were "money games" for the New Mexico State 
program, although they resulted in one-sided losses. Florida won, 70-21, and 
Arizona, 44-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked playing that kind of competition, even if it turned out the way it 
did," Pizula said. "I think I had some good moments, especially blocking, in 
both those games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies have six Big West games left, and Pizula is optimistic about his 
team's chances despite the loss to UNLV. "We should be in good shape in the Big 
West," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Pizula's second season as a starter. He was the team's second-leading 
ball carrier as a junior with 334 yards in 70 carries, an average of 4.8 yards. 
He also accounted for 200 more yards as a receiver for a team that finished 
6-5.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were 1-10 my first year and 2-9 the second, so the program is improving 
each year, and I feel good about being a part of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Devaney also is pleased about Pizula's success this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian's strength always has been his versatility," Devaney said. In high 
school, Pizula was part of a backfield that also included two other strong 
runners, Kenny Overby and Mike Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken was a tough power runner, and Mike a slasher, but Brian had the assets of 
both and could run equally as well inside and outside," Devaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian has seemed to get better every year. And I think he's really showed 
what he's capable of this season. When I talked to their coaches when they were 
recruiting him, I told them then that he was the kind of player every school 
needs in its program. He's really unselfish, and what he cares about is 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Pizula's recent success has given him a flicker of hope that he might even be 
able to play the game on a higher level again as a pro, even though his 
physical stature still is not what pro scouts look for when they rate 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just taking it one step at a time right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Devaney says, don't count him out.

IHL HAS DISCOURAGING WORD FOR NHL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Locked-out NHL players who want to pass the time by playing in the minor 
leagues might find doors closed to them again. 
</P>
<P>
 International Hockey League officials are cautioning their clubs against 
signing NHL players, fearing those contracts would inflate the league's modest 
salary scale and damage its relationship with the NHL.Tim Bryant, the IHL's 
vice president for communications, said there's probably no legal barrier to 
keep NHL players out, but he doesn't foresee an influx if the lockout drags on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not counting on it, and we're not necessarily encouraging it," Bryant 
said. "We have an average payroll of $1.1 million for our teams and an NHL 
player would not come particularly cheap. Also, it sends a bad message to 
full-time IHL players and messes up our competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in benefiting from (the NHL's) misfortune. We're 
certainly getting some additional attention now, but we're not interested in 
getting it by default." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the IHL's 17 members, 10 are affiliated with NHL organizations. The 
50-year-old league is enjoying a boom, having added teams in Denver and St. 
Paul this season. It also added teams in Chicago and Detroit, competing head to 
head with the NHL. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Georgetown, Notre Dame . . . and Cal State Northridge?

<P>
 It's a stretch -- a big stretch -- but school athletic officials hope that if 
a fee referendum is passed by student vote Oct. 18-19, the Northridge name 
might someday be linked with NCAA powers.

 But first, there are pressing money matters to address. And that means 
student-athletes are spending time pressing palms with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Milling about under a tent on campus Wednesday were several Matador athletes, 
distributing literature and campaigning for the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely hope it passes," said Trenton Cross, a member of the men's 
basketball team. "I'm only a freshman and I'm going to be here a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum, if approved, would raise semester fees from $4 to $49 per 
student, those monies earmarked for athletics. Monday, the department kicked 
off its campaign in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross was one of at least two-dozen athletes who took an afternoon turn in the 
tent, pitched just outside athletic department headquarters. The tent was 
erected Monday and different promotional handbills are being distributed daily. 
</P>
<P>
 The information contained in the literature isn't exactly news to the 
athletes. Last month, the worst-case scenario associated with the referendum's 
defeat was mapped out during a meeting with Athletic Director Bob Hiegert. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said the program, with a budget of $3.6 million, stands to lose as 
much as $700,000 next year. The fee referendum would generate approximately 
$2.25 million annually and much of the revenue would be used for scholarships. 
Hiegert said each team -- except the football team -- would carry the maximum 
allowable number of scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 If the referendum fails, Northridge could be forced to slash programs, 
including football, and might drop from NCAA Division I to II. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it passes, the program is in good shape," Cross said. "If it doesn't, 
uh-oh." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics officials have emphasized the payoff for students in the campaign, 
citing free admission to games and association with a school with a national 
athletics identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who listened to the athletes' pitch Wednesday seemed receptive -- 
though there will be a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm voting yes," said Nathan Miller, 21, of Granada Hills. "I've got a couple 
of more years left, but I think it's important to have a football team." 
</P>
<P>
 In Miller's case, mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to impart that athletics is a recognition thing that is 
important to everyone," said Brian Swanson, an associate athletic director 
charged with running the promotional campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you say 'Notre Dame,' you think of football. You say 'Georgetown,' you 
think basketball. Those are solid academic schools, but people generally 
associate them with their sports programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics officials are trying to learn from last semester when a similar 
referendum was voted down. A lopsided vote from a satellite campus in Ventura 
doomed the proposition to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the first time the Ventura campus voted in a school election, 
Swanson said. Northridge, which plans to campaign in Ventura, also might offer 
Ventura students a shuttle service to selected on-campus games as an incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes are handling most of the stumping and several already have appeared 
before campus clubs. Quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin spoke to the Surf Club on 
Tuesday and receiver Duc Ngo is scheduled to speak with the Vietnamese Students 
Club. Others have been instructed to give informational speeches in their 
academic classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Those making speaking appearances are given a handout outlining the details of 
the referendum and its possible impact. Included in the "script" is a breakdown 
of what $49 buys these days: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A Saturday night date; 
</P>
<P>
 -- Four compact discs; 
</P>
<P>
 -- A new outfit; 
</P>
<P>
 -- A big milkshake (per week). 
</P>
<P>
 The punch line follows in the form of a question -- Is Northridge athletics 
worth essentially one milkshake per week to maintain? 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the school's approximately 325 athletes has been asked to recruit 10 
students to vote in favor of the plan. The request is not exactly voluntary. 
Each was given a sheet on which to list those students' names and phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Swanson said, approximately 2,000 of the school's 26,000 students 
cast ballots and the referendum lost by fewer than 100 votes. The athletic 
department is making considerably more noise about the issue this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the people who stopped by (the tent) said they will vote for it this 
time because they know where the money's going," Swanson said. "I'm not sure 
that was the case last time." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, student apathy being what it is, the campaign is something of a 
calculated risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration each semester already runs $958 for state residents enrolled full 
time. If enough students are aware of the issue and its cost, they might just 
vote it down.  
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about that," Swanson said. "It comes down to the fact that it's a 
student program. . . . They need to make the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 If the proposal passes, it could be a boon for athletics, which would then use 
private donations to upgrade facilities. More teams also would be established, 
Hiegert said.

PROPOSED LEAGUE ATTRACTS TWO MORE CITIES; BASEBALL: VALLEY-BASED CIRCUIT 
INTERESTS INDIO AND PASO ROBLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Valley-based Golden State Baseball League moved two steps closer to 
fruition when Indio and Paso Robles began detailed negotiations with the 
proposed minor league. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State, the brainchild of Chatsworth investment banker Bob 
Weinstein, is tentatively scheduled to begin play next summer in six cities 
throughout California. 
</P>
<P>
 The league previously signed letters of intent with Palmdale and Brawley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another step in the right direction," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein said he also is courting Vista and Merced. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent league, which will operate without funding from major-league 
affiliates, could join another new league that is expected to begin play in the 
Southland in 1995. The independent Western League, which includes teams in Palm 
Springs and Long Beach, plans to begin play next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The only minor league operating in the state is the venerable California 
League, a 10-team Class-A alignment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State requires host cities to donate 25 acres of land plus 
infrastructure, such as utility hookups. In return, the league plans to erect 
$5 million stadiums in each city. 
</P>
<P>
 Paso Robles City Attorney Iris Yang has asked Weinstein to supply additional 
information regarding the league's funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a number of issues to discuss, but we're proceeding," Yang said. "We 
need more specifics." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible stadium sites are being discussed, which is also the case in Indio. 
</P>
<P>
 Allyn Waggle, the interim city manager of Indio, characterized negotiations 
with the league as "preliminary," but said the city is earnest about landing a 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bona fide effort to get a team here," Waggle said. "We're 
researching sites and discussing potentialities. We need to get all of our I's 
dotted and T's crossed." 
</P>
<P>
 Waggle said two potential stadium sites in the Indio area already have been 
identified.

GLENDALE COOKED BY SURPRISE; WATER POLO: DOUBLE-TEAMING MANEUVER PAYS OFF FOR 
CRESCENTA VALLEY, WHICH BREEZES, 16-5, IN PACIFIC LEAGUE MATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a specialty out of the Crescenta Valley High water polo team's 
cookbook: the two-meter man sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparation is simple. Place a defender in front of the opponent's two-meter 
man, and another behind him. Enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons did just that to Glendale's Gilbert Abramyan on Wednesday and 
cruised to a 16-5 victory in a key Pacific League matchup at Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, Abramyan scored two routine-looking goals from the hole, 
giving the underdog Dynamiters a 2-1 lead. The match was tied, 3-3, after one 
quarter, when the Falcons made the defensive switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley pulled one of its drivers back into the hole to play in front 
of Abramyan, with the two-meter man playing behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 Abramyan did not score again, and Glendale was held scoreless until late in 
the third quarter. Meanwhile, the Falcons put the game away with nine 
consecutive goals, the first three by Chad Celi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we started playing better defense, we had a lot of good counterattacks, 
and then we got pumped," Celi said. "And once we got pumped, we just took it 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Celi, a senior driver, scored five goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real player," Glendale Coach Pat Lancaster said. "We didn't expect him 
to be so active. He was everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Falcons kept lighting up the scoreboard, the Dynamiters struggled. 
Unable to get the ball inside to Abramyan, Glendale players were left to fire 
long-range shots, most of which wound up on the chest of Falcon goalie Ryan 
Linnemeyer, who had 12 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Bennett and Mike Ostash each had three goals for Crescenta Valley (12-4, 
2-0 in league play), which is ranked fourth in the Southern Section's Division 
III. Glendale (10-7, 1-1) is ranked seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Glendale) is a good-quality team," Falcon Coach Pete Loporchio said. "We 
knew after the first quarter we were going to be in for a battle. They key for 
us was to keep it up."

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: CAL'S UWAEZUOKE A DEEP THINKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke is making the big catches. Now it's 
time for a little notoriety, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year is definitely my year to make some big plays," said the 6-foot-2, 
195-pound junior from Harvard-Westlake High. Uwaezuoke said he is stronger 
after an intense off-season spent in the weight room. And now he is a seasoned, 
thinking-man's receiver who knows how to read and exploit defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 So he says -- and has proved. 
</P>
<P>
 After the first two weeks of the season, Uwaezuoke was the top-ranked receiver 
in the Pacific 10 Conference. However, a sprained foot and an aggravated 
hamstring sidelined him for Cal's game against Arizona State on Sept. 24 and 
limited him to one reception in the Bears' 55-0 victory over San Jose State 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he ranks third in the Pac-10 in receptions per game and fourth in 
receiving yardage per game. He has 16 receptions for 216 yards and one 
touchdown in three games. The leader in both categories is UCLA's Kevin Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins (2-3) visit Berkeley on Saturday without J.J. Stokes, who is still 
nursing a thigh injury. Stokes' absence won't detract from the thrill Uwaezuoke 
would experience if his Bears (2-2) beat UCLA. He can't wait to match his 
talents with those who play for a team that sold him short in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more a personal contest," Uwaezuoke said. "It's always a bigger deal 
when you play your hometown team. I look forward to getting deep on some of 
those guys. I'm ready to make some big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get excited about lining up against (UCLA defensive backs) Teddy Lawrence 
and Andy Colbert. That's a personal challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Uwaezuoke also would like to show Bruin Coach Terry Donahue and his staff that 
they made a mistake. Uwaezuoke, a native of Nigeria who moved to United States 
when he was 7, impressed Bruin coaches at a UCLA football camp the summer 
before his senior year at Harvard. UCLA started recruiting him, as did Cal, 
Duke and Pennsylvania. But no school offered a scholarship after Uwaezuoke 
caught only 24 passes for 324 yards and five touchdowns as a senior on a 
run-oriented team that went 9-2. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cal welcomed Uwaezuoke as a walk-on. He is no slouch in the classroom. 
Uwaezuoke, who was given a scholarship last year, carries a 3.5 grade-point 
average as a political science major. He plans to study law after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Don't tread on me: Brian Vellmure (Camarillo/Moorpark College) had high hopes 
when he accepted a scholarship at Texas El Paso. However, he soon realized he 
had to lower them. After all, UTEP long has had the reputation as one of 
college football's big-time losers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys here are numb to losing," said Vellmure, a 5-11, 191-pound strong 
safety. "It was hard for me to understand at first because I was used to 
winning. But it's only natural to let that get you down a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vellmure refuses to buy into the idea that the Miners (2-3) are fated to 
be losers. A senior who ranks third on the team in tackles, Vellmure is doing 
all he can to change the UTEP image. Thirty-four of his 42 tackles are 
unassisted. He also has two sacks and is tied for the team lead with two 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week might have been Vellmure's toughest at UTEP. Rumors were 
circulating that the Miner football program was about to fold because of an 
$800,000 deficit in the athletic department budget, but the school's athletic 
director met with the team and quelled the rumor. Then on Saturday, UTEP beat 
Hawaii, 34-28, after trailing, 21-3, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a huge win for us, and it was just a matter of doing what we can 
do," Vellmure said. "Some people might laugh, but a lot of seniors want to go 
to a bowl. Everyone who plays college football has that for a goal. We still 
think it's possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Better for the beating: Pacific linebacker Vince Bruno (Westlake) would like 
to thank Nebraska for its hospitality. The No. 2 Cornhuskers beat the Tigers, 
70-21, two weeks ago. Bruno thinks Pacific can win the Big West Conference 
championship, thanks in part to the drubbing in Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nebraska was so fast, everything was a blur," said Bruno, a 6-2, 226-pound 
sophomore linebacker. "Their linemen were running stride for stride with our 
defensive backs. After that, every other team we play is going to look slow, so 
we feel like we can take our conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno, who ranks third on the team with 26 tackles, said he had fun despite 
the rout. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first series when they lined up, I was yelling at them -- talking 
trash," he said. "I don't know why, but I was pumped. I was saying, 'Come on. 
Let's go. Bring it on.' Then I shoved one of their linemen and got him mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenden Stai, a 6-4, 300-pound guard for Nebraska, quieted Bruno. But Bruno 
recorded 10 tackles and was named Pacific's defensive player of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Arizona senior running back Ontiwaun Carter (Kennedy) 
ranks second to Washington's Napoleon Kaufman among Pac-10 rushers with an 
average of 120.5 yards a game. Carter, who has 482 yards in 95 carries (5.1 
yards per carry), has an injured left ankle but is listed as probable for 
Saturday's game against Colorado State. . . . Sophomore wide receiver Richard 
Dice (Alemany) had seven receptions for a career-high 136 yards in Arizona's 
30-10 victory over Oregon State last week. He averages 22.1 yards a reception, 
best among Pac-10 receivers.

BRADLEY SITS OUT AT SONOMA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Freddie Bradley's return to the football field has been stalled, at least for 
another year. 
</P>
<P>
 The record-setting running back from Hueneme High and Moorpark College did not 
meet NCAA academic eligibility requirements to play for Sonoma State this 
season, Coach Frank Scalercio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, 23, sat out last season while recovering from a knee injury he 
sustained during a pickup basketball game and aggravated during spring 
practice. He transferred to Sonoma State, a Division II school, when the 
University of Arkansas revoked his scholarship after he was arrested and 
accused of raping a 13-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley was cleared of the charge in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark College in 1990, Bradley led the state in rushing in and broke 
O.J. Simpson's state career scoring record. Nagged by injuries in 1991, his one 
season at Arkansas, Bradley rushed for 197 yards. MIKE HISERMAN

THE COLLEGES / FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ; WITH NO RESERVATIONS, SUBSECTION 7.032 DULLS 
VENTURA'S HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whoever said there are no free lunches -- or even snacks -- must have been a 
sports bureaucrat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura College football team discovered that recently. 
</P>
<P>
 What started harmlessly enough for the Pirates nearly turned into a costly 
faux pas because of a rule. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the basics: 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Pirates were 0-10 and scored only 36 points. They were shut 
out six times and only two teams failed to score at least 25 points against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have reversed their fortunes this season, and will go into Saturday 
night's nonconference home game against Fresno City with a 3-0 record. They 
have won two games by shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first shutout, a 38-0 victory over West L.A. in a Western State 
Conference game on Sept. 10, that almost got the Pirates in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Rosales, in his second season at the helm, and his assistants 
promised members of the defensive unit a dinner if they held an opponent 
scoreless this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Presto! 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff came the following Friday night at a Ventura barbecue restaurant 
owned by former Pirate defensive end Charles (Buster) Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 When Davis heard why the players were there, he offered to give the entire 
team a free dinner after every victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe those guys would eat him right out of a business, but Davis said he 
didn't care. He thought they could use a square meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess what? The Pirates won again -- twice. 
</P>
<P>
 But hold the steak sauce. Put those rolls back. The gesture by Davis, although 
noble, won't fly. There are flags all over the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the California Community College Commission on Athletics, the 
governing body of junior college sports in the state, has rules about that sort 
of thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is explained in the CCC's State Athletic Code under "Section 7.03, 
Subsidizing." 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, Subsection 7.031 states that subsidizing athletes is "strictly 
forbidden." Subsection 7.032 further mentions that "the giving of special 
privileges to athletes, such as free or reduced rate housing, free or reduced 
rate meals, or any financial assistance in the form of loans or grants . . . 
when it is not the policy of the college to give such services to every student 
in the college is classed as illegal subsidizing and is strictly forbidden." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a well-meaning rule. Its purpose is to keep coaches in line, to 
eliminate potential inequities between students and to prevent schools from 
favoring certain groups based on their presumed importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, at four-year colleges under NCAA scrutiny, the anti-subsidizing rules 
are meant to stop alumni and other outside sources with fat wallets from 
showering recruits with gifts and cash to play at their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Few junior college athletic programs have such sugar daddies. In California, 
at least, two-year schools walk a financial tightrope. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, those are the guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, however, won't be penalized. Walter Rilliet, the state's 
commissioner of athletics, said the apparent infraction did not call for more 
than a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would look at it at this point as a good-faith thing," Rilliet said. "But 
if it gets to be a long-term thing, our rules would have to apply." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. But the rule seems silly in this instance. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the college had nothing to do with the free meals. The idea came 
from Davis, who simply got caught in the excitement of the season and wanted to 
show his support. As a former player, he knows that incentives motivate 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 And what if the free meals were going to other groups on campus? Would the 
film department at a school be forced to forfeit a dinner party in their honor 
offered by, say, Steven Spielberg to celebrate an award-winning documentary? 
</P>
<P>
 What if Wolfgang Puck wanted to treat the home economics folks to free 
pastries and cappuccino to acknowledge their interest in cooking? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing would likely happen because those entities are not under the 
microscopic eye of an athletic association. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura football team and other junior college athletic programs have 
to watch their steps. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosales says he will make sure there are no more potential land mines in 
his path: no more free meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the rules and my job is to make sure we follow them," Rosales said.

NORTHRIDGE TAKES NO ACTION, INJURY SIDELINES BEAUREGARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The case of Cal State Northridge football player Jonathan Beauregard took 
another bizarre turn Wednesday when school officials announced that they would 
take no action against the senior lineman, who stands accused of two counts of 
attempted murder in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, though, already had managed to sideline himself. 
</P>

 Beauregard suffered a broken ring finger on his right hand at practice Tuesday 
night and will be sidelined from two to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he not been injured, however, he would have been allowed to continue 
playing while his case worked its way through the courts, the school said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard was arrested on the first day of the fall semester, Aug. 29, and 
charged with shooting his ex-girlfriend and her male acquaintance outside a San 
Bernardino bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Beauregard, a criminology major who was senior class president at San 
Bernardino's Cajon High in 1989-90, did not tell his teammates or coaches of 
the arrest and started at offensive right guard in each of the Matadors' four 
games.

BROCCO IS SOLD, WILL STAND AT STUD IN KENTUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brocco, the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and Santa Anita Derby winner, has been sold 
by Mr. and Mrs. Albert Broccoli and will be retired to stud at Will Farish's 
Lane's End Farm in Versailles, Ky. He is scheduled to depart within the next 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last in the Del Mar Budweiser Breeders' Cup in his final start, the first 
since he finished a troubled fourth in the Kentucky Derby, Brocco was sold for 
an undisclosed price, reported to be $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old son of Kris S., Brocco finished his career with four victories in 
eight starts and earnings of $1,003,550. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Farish) is having a vet come by to run fertility tests and see that all that 
passes," said trainer Randy Winick, who was promised a lifetime share in the 
horse by the Broccolis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to Lane's End, which I'm happy about. There were some people from 
California who were interested in buying him at one time, but I'd rather he go 
to Kentucky. That's where A.P. Indy stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what the Broccolis wanted to do. Financially, they got a good offer 
for the horse and they didn't want to take a chance after his race at Del Mar 
(Sept. 11). If he had come back and wasn't in the same form, then maybe he 
wouldn't be worth as much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Broccoli has been a little sick the last few months. He's had some 
surgery and it just kind of came to where they got a good offer and they wanted 
to take it while he was worth it. They discussed it with me, and I had them 
talked out of it for a while because I wanted to bring him back in training in 
about two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, there were also some personal tax considerations for Broccoli 
behind the sale. The only buyers who were considered were those who planned to 
retire Brocco immediately. Broccoli didn't wish to see anybody else race the 
colt. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Navarone, who won the Del Mar Handicap in his final start, has been retired. 
The Irish River horse finished with eight victories and earnings of more than 
$710,000. He was owned and bred by Robert Hibbert and trained by Rodney Rash. . 
. . Cardmania, who broke a cannon bone last February preparing for the San 
Antonio Handicap, might make his comeback in the Ancient Title Handicap on Oct. 
15. The 8-year-old gelding won the Breeders' Cup Sprint last year. . . . Three 
Breeders' Cup and Eclipse Award winners -- Eliza, Phone Chatter and Hollywood 
Wildcat -- will get together in the $100,000 Lady's Secret Handicap on Monday. 
The 1 1/16-mile race, which was won by Hollywood Wildcat last year, will also 
include Exchange.

VAN NUYS MAKING RIGHT MOVES; VOLLEYBALL: GIRLS' TEAM SWEEPS SYLMAR AFTER 
GAINING PERMISSION TO CHANGE DIVISIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fewer than 24 hours after Van Nuys High girls' volleyball Coach Dave Bessler 
won his personal crusade, his players helped him prove a point Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bessler petitioned the City Section in 1993 to allow Van Nuys, the defending 
3-A champion, to move to the 4-A division. The request was denied and the 
Wolves won their second consecutive 3-A title with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Bessler tried again this season, and at a City Section meeting Tuesday night, 
Van Nuys was given permission to compete in the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys celebrated by defeating Sylmar, 15-6, 15-1, 15-0, in a Valley Pac-8 
Conference match. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys must meet several conditions before being admitted to the 4-A 
playoffs. The Wolves must win the Mid-Valley League and the conference. And the 
playoff seeding committee must consider Van Nuys strong enough to play at the 
4-A level. 
</P>
<P>
 If Van Nuys does not meet the conditions, the Wolves will not be allowed to 
drop back into the 3-A playoffs. The move in divisions is for this season only 
and will be reviewed after the playoffs. Van Nuys was the only team to petition 
to move classifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided to go ahead and take the deal," Bessler said. "The only thing I was 
worried about was the girls missing the playoffs, but my team is good enough to 
win this conference." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (5-1, 2-1 in conference play) and Poly (5-0, 3-0), are considered the 
only serious threats to take even a game from the Wolves in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Bessler said he did not tell his players of the move until after Wednesday's 
match, because they hadn't asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew I was heading to the meeting last night and all they said was to 
'Be nice to them,' " Bessler said. "I think they're worried more game-to-game 
than about the playoffs right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys didn't need extra incentive against the Spartans. In the Venice 
Tournament last Saturday, Sylmar defeated the Wolves, 15-11, in the first round 
of the playoffs. But Van Nuys was missing three starters, including setter 
Connie Chae. 
</P>
<P>
 After trading points early in the first game, Van Nuys (6-0, 3-0) cruised 
behind the all-around effort of Chae, who finished with 29 assists, five kills, 
three aces and one block. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't worried about losing but we knew they would be one of our bigger 
rivals," Chae said. "They're supposed to be one of the tougher teams and I 
thought going in it would be a little closer." 
</P>
<P>
 Erika Alvarez led Van Nuys with 10 kills and outside hitter Ruby Tovar added 
eight.

LOS ALAMITOS; HARNESS GROUP MAKES ITS FIRST KEY PAYMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California harness interests submitted the first in a series of payments to 
Los Alamitos by the Oct. 1 deadline, effectively bringing harness racing a step 
closer to a winter meeting at the track. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Los Alamitos General Manager Dick Feinberg, the payment of 
$50,000 was the first of three non-refundable security deposits the harness 
group must pay to negotiate a lease for the 1994-95 season. The second $50,000 
payment is due Saturday, with the third due on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their intention is to run (at Los Alamitos)," Feinberg said. "They intend to 
run starting in late December through March 25." 
</P>
<P>
 The dates of Dec. 22 through March 25 were approved for harness racing at Los 
Alamitos by the California Horse Racing Board last month. Quarter horses were 
approved from April 14 through Dec. 31, pending the successful negotiation of a 
lease between Los Alamitos and the harness interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Alamitos lease is being negotiated by about 15 harness horse owners 
and horsemen called the Premier Group, which ran the harness meeting at Los 
Alamitos last year. One of the main driving forces behind the group is trainer 
Bobby Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at racing three days a week, Thursday, Friday and Saturday, 
unless we have an abundance of horse population," he said. "Then we would race 
Wednesday through Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting would be the first for harness horses in California since the 
1993-1994 Los Alamitos meeting, which ended in early April. It might also be 
the only one in California for 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than four months of racing in California might not seem appealing to 
trainers who have to travel across the country, but Gordon doesn't anticipate 
any problems drawing horsemen to California and is expecting 400-500 horses for 
the winter meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself a Californian now," he said. "I stay here because of the 
weather." 
</P>
<P>
 He and others figure the weather will draw many trainers who would rather race 
in California than fight the snow and cold in the northern states during the 
winter. But the shorter meeting in California also presents some problems for 
California-based trainers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part is that most of us from California have California owners," 
Gordon said. "That's our biggest problem, the lack of racing in the state and 
getting owners to stay involved. Too many times it's out of sight, out of 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, as do many trainers, also cited high worker's compensation costs as a 
reason many trainers steer clear of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the short Los Alamitos meeting, the outlook for harness racing in 
California is improved, with the possibility of other meetings later in '95. 
One such possibility is Riverside Downs, a proposed track in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we're going to get 3 1/2 months," Gordon said. "And if other 
things happen, we'll have more (harness racing in California)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most frustrating things for a trainer is having a good horse who, 
for some reason or another, doesn't reach its potential. Jumping Tac Flash 
seems to be such a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tolltac filly has a reputation as a bad gate horse, and on more than one 
occasion has been scratched after flipping in the gate before a race. Jumping 
Tac Flash won last year's Miss Kindergarten Futurity impressively but later in 
the year had to be scratched from the finals of the California Futurity. This 
year has been much the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Sept. 23 trials for Friday night's California Derby, Jumping Tac 
Flash minded her manners in the gate and won her trial heat with the fastest 
qualifying time, 19.93 seconds. Can she do it again in the final? 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Blane Schvaneveldt has faith in the filly and her abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a runner," he said. "She just needs to get everything her way. Maybe 
she will this time, again. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was good (in the gates) the other night, and she's as good in the morning 
as one can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Jumping Tac Flash has finished first or second in 10 of 13 starts and has 
earned nearly $125,000. But one horse she will have to watch out for in the 
final is Comes A Storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Trained by Charles Treece, Comes A Storm finished second by a head to Jumping 
Tac Flash in the trials, qualifying with the second-fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Jockey Oscar Monroy) didn't push him at all in the trials," Treece said. 
"This horse can really run. The trials didn't take anything out of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Comes A Storm, who won the Independence Day Handicap, will be seeking his 
second stakes victory of the meeting.

PROPOSED WASTE SITES DRAW SHARP CRITICISM; PUBLIC WORKS: HOMEOWNERS SPEAK OUT 
AGAINST NOMINATION OF THREE LOCATIONS, TWO OF WHICH ARE IN THE SAN FERNANDO 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Infuriating nearby homeowners, city officials have nominated three more places 
as potential collection sites for hundreds of gallons of septic tank waste each 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm incensed that they even have us on the list," said Jan Liptak, president 
of the Sun Valley Residents Assn., of the site on San Fernando Road. "Sun 
Valley has probably been selected because we have traditionally been the 
dumping ground for the city for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Another suggested location, in Chatsworth near Winnetka Avenue and Nordhoff 
Street, is too far from the homes that generate the waste, according to Don 
Worsham of PRIDE, a North Valley homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of sites, including a third one in East Los Angeles, was ordered by 
the City Council after the construction of a $2-million septic waste collection 
facility at the Tillman Water Reclamation plant in the Sepulveda Basin became 
the target for protests by residents and environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Ireland, president of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin, complained 
that the city has not allowed local residents to participate in its 
decision-making process as it winnowed the list of possible sites from 70 to 
19, and then to three. He said it appears that the department is bypassing 
residents because it is driving to a foregone conclusion: to name Tillman as 
the best location for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They're basically saying, 'We're going to justify what we were doing in the 
first place. We're going to open a facility in the Sepulveda Basin, but if 
people take us to court we'll be able to justify it because we will have an 
environmental document,' " Ireland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Road site is in Councilman Richard Alarcon's district, and 
Annette Castro, Alarcon's chief of staff, said she viewed the department's 
decision with concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned and that's why we're going to be monitoring it," she said. 
"The 7th District already takes in 80% of the city's trash with all the dumps 
we've got." 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to hold public meetings to receive comments from members of 
communities near each of the sites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillman plant was to collect septic tank waste from around the San 
Fernando Valley and nearby cities, then pipe it to the Hyperion Treatment Plant 
in Playa del Rey. The City Council belatedly required an environmental study to 
address those concerns, forcing the department to look for alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the factors considered in drawing up the list were accessibility by 
truck, traffic impacts and topography, according to Chris Harris, the city's 
public relations consultant for the project. Also considered were sensitive 
land uses such as parks, homes, schools and churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The three sites, which are all privately owned, will be analyzed extensively 
on the impacts they are likely to have on nearby traffic levels, the 
environment, neighboring land uses and other issues, Harris said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ireland said it appears the Department of Public Works is bypassing residents 
because it wants to justify naming Tillman as the best location for the 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said the opposite is true. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project has had plenty of (public) input," responded J. P. Ellman, 
president of the Board of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald A. Silver, president of the Homeowners of Encino, said the city finally 
appears to be on the right track after not listening to community concerns for 
over a year. He said he thinks the city should decide to have several sites to 
minimize the distances that trucks would have to travel to get to the 
collection facility.  
</P>
<P>
 Last November, the City Council decided to put off final approval of the 
project until the Public Works Department had completed an environmental study. 
The department began meeting with environmentalists and local residents in 
March to inform them of progress on the study, which included a search for 
alternative sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents staged a demonstration at Tillman on May 7, saying they had been 
excluded from participating in the department's decision to narrow 70 sites to 
19 sites. At a June 2 community meeting, they presented the department with an 
extensive list of criteria that they asked it to use on the original 70 sites, 
plus others that they wanted the city to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said the city had used the criteria to narrow down the list from 19 to 
the present three. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will hold three public hearings to get comments from the communities 
in which the alternative sites are located. The first will be held on Oct. 17 
at 7 p.m. at Northridge Recreation Center, 18300 Lemarsh St. The second is 
scheduled for Oct. 18 at 7 p.m. at the Lake View Terrace Recreation Center, 
11075 Foothill Blvd. The city will hold a third meeting on Oct. 24 at 5:30 p.m. 
at the Boyle Heights Senior Center, 2839 E. 3rd St. in Los Angeles.

 In Sun Valley, Liptak said she plans to mobilize her group's members to 
protest the Sun Valley site. They will phone and write their elected officials, 
and express their concerns at the Lake View Terrace meeting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have several landfills and we're very close to the Lopez Canyon landfill," 
Liptak said. "We are an area that has been neglected when it comes to services 
and remembered when it comes to projects like this." Possible Sites for a 
Septic Waste Collection Facility The city has announced three alternative sites 
for a septic waste collection facility located, but not opened, at the Tillman 
Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. Public hearings 
will be held this month in the communities where the alternative sites are 
located. Potential sites:

2 INMATES ESCAPE FROM HONOR RANCHO; JAILS: THEY CARJACK A TRUCK FROM TWO 
STUDENTS PARKED NEAR MAGIC MOUNTAIN. NO ONE IS HURT, BUT THE MEN REMAIN AT 
LARGE.

<P>
 Two inmates escaped from Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho Tuesday night, making 
their way to a Hilton hotel about five miles away and then carjacking a pickup 
truck from two college students in the parking lot, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the carjacking, which occurred near the Magic Mountain 
theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The escapees, who are still at large, have been identified by sheriff's 
deputies as Jesus Guerrero, 23, who was in prison on a narcotics charge, and 
Mario Garate, 19, who was serving time for spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are from Los Angeles and both were soon to be transferred to a 
higher-security facility because they had caused trouble among other inmates at 
Pitchess, according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department spokesman Gabe 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape occurred between 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. from a processing center in a 
minimum security area where about 200 other inmates were gathered, Sheriff's 
Lt. Steve Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the processing center and the outside of the prison is an open 
compound protected by a razor wire fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "How they got over the fence I don't know," Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Mabs, 20, said he and his girlfriend, Rachel Madon, 19, were sitting in 
the truck in the hotel parking lot when they saw two men wearing prison-issue 
orange pants come out of nearby bushes and approach them shortly after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabs and Madon are students at The Master's College, a Christian school in 
Newhall. They had parked in a quiet area of the lot near the Hilton Garden Inn 
so they could have a private, prayer devotional, Mabs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had just got done praying and everything, and these guys came up," he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mabs said the inmates greeted him and walked by the truck. "They looked really 
weird," he said. "I could tell there was something really different about 
them." Mabs said he rolled up the truck windows and locked the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The men came back a few minutes later and motioned Mabs to roll down his 
window. He refused and the inmates began gesturing to two pairs of dress pants 
hanging from a hook in the truck's window, Mabs said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mabs refused to give them the clothing, the two men began banging on the 
driver's side window, apparently trying to break it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would have thought about (driving away) when they were 10 feet away, I 
would have done it," Mabs said. "But I felt if I had done it while they were 
close it would have caused more problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might have broken the window or jumped in the back of the truck." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabs said he opened the door and got out of the truck, pulling Madon out of 
the driver's side door with him. He was able to grab a few personal possessions 
before the inmates climbed in and drove off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck is a white, 1986 Mazda pickup with California license plate number 
3D81629. Mabs said the clothes he left in the truck might be a bit tight on the 
inmates because he is thinner than the two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Both inmates are in their early 20s, about 5 feet 10 inches tall and between 
160 and 180 pounds, according to sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero was arrested June 25 by Los Angeles Police Department officers and 
was scheduled for release Feb. 8, Ramirez said. Garate was arrested by Los 
Angeles police Aug. 17 and was scheduled for release April 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were initially housed at the minimum-security facility, but were 
moved to the medium-security section of Pitchess because of problems with other 
inmates, Dolan said. The two men were scheduled to be transferred to the Men's 
Central Jail in Los Angeles. They would then be assigned to a high-security 
facility at Pitchess or another county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were 34 escapes from Pitchess, nearly all from the 
minimum-security section, according to sheriff's officials. Most of the 
escapees simply walked away unnoticed from supervised outdoor work assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the inmates were recaptured before they make it past the razor 
wire guarding Pitchess, and most of the others were recaptured soon afterward, 
Pitchess officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been no successful escapes from the jail's high-security 
facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 No local residents were harmed in the escapes. But earlier this year a 
29-year-old inmate awaiting trial for robbery escaped and broke into the house 
of a woman living nearby, taking her jewelry and car. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recaptured by deputies the next day at a Palmdale motel. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident prompted several calls from worried residents living near the 
jail in the unincorporated town of Castaic, said Greg Ferrier, a member of the 
Castaic Town Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some people very upset," he said, adding that he is expecting more 
reaction over the recent incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they find out these guys hijacked a vehicle from a couple of kids near 
Magic Mountain," Ferrier said, "I'm going to hear about it."

CREWS BEGIN DEMOLISHING APARTMENTS; QUAKE: AFTER MONTHS OF DELAYS, WORKERS 
START TEARING DOWN NORTHRIDGE MEADOWS, WHICH COLLAPSED IN THE TEMBLOR, KILLING 
16. 
</P>

 Workers set out Wednesday to finish the job nature started nearly nine months 
ago, as wrecking crews commenced demolition of the Northridge Meadows apartment 
complex, the most searing symbol of human loss in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:30 a.m., a steel-jawed excavator rumbled onto the north end of the Reseda 
Boulevard complex, chewing through stucco, wood and glass and laying bare 
hallways and rooms once inhabited by college students, young couples and the 
elderly. Light flooded into long-darkened rooms, revealing remnants of everyday 
life at the apartment complex where 16 tenants died when the top two stories of 
the building collapsed onto the ground floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Posters of rock groups were still tacked up on walls. A second-floor bathroom 
was ripped open, exposing the shower stall and toilet. Near a brown door marked 
Apt. 303, a single hanger swung inside what had been a hall closet before heavy 
equipment tore it down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," Northridge Meadows survivor Susan Pearson of Temecula said, when 
told of the demolition, which had been postponed for months. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere in evidence Wednesday were the stray cats reported by worried 
residents to be living in the collapsed structure. Concern over the safety of 
the cats was one cause of the delay in demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officials said that traps laid around the complex over the past 
few days produced a couple of opossums and fewer than 10 feral felines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were very few, substantially less than we had been led to believe," 
said George Weissman, district supervisor at the West Valley Animal Care and 
Control Center. If any cats remain inside, "as the vibrations (from demolition 
work) over the days get a little closer, they'll know to leave," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's morning downpour drenched the dilapidated remains of the complex, 
once a placid suburban haven with 164 units, a swimming pool, putting green and 
Jacuzzi. But wrecking company representatives said wet weather could be helpful 
during the monthlong demolition by suppressing dust that may contain traces of 
asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light rain would be perfect for this operation," said Lawrence E. Grauman 
of Cleveland Wrecking Co., which won the $282,000 contract from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether because of the drizzle, the early hour, or a sense of anticlimax, few 
on-lookers stopped to watch the first day of demolition, in contrast to the 
curious crowds that gathered outside the pancaked building for months after the 
quake to look, snap photos and buy T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 The bystanders often included survivors, who came to mourn and await a chance 
to retrieve personal belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were eventually allowed quick dashes inside for small items, but 
larger possessions -- furniture, appliances -- were left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wouldn't let us get our stuff out -- just clothes, photos and small 
things," said Pearson, 30. "And our cars were dug out a couple weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing will be salvaged from the demolition, Grauman said. Workers will cart 
the debris to landfills around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The tear-down was first postponed earlier this year by court order to give 
investigators time to sift through the rubble for evidence that building flaws 
may have been partially to blame for the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 relatives, heirs and neighbors of those who perished in first-floor 
units have joined in seven wrongful-death lawsuits alleging negligence by the 
apartment owners, Shashikant and Renuka Jogani. A handful of attorneys involved 
in the case were on hand Wednesday to observe the start of demolition. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial is scheduled for March.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; REPAIRED LIBRARY BRANCH TO REOPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills branch of the Los Angeles Public Library will reopen Friday 
after being closed since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills branch, which will reopen without fanfare at 12:30 p.m., is 
one of 22 libraries citywide that was closed because of earthquake damage, said 
David Haut, a spokesman for the Los Angeles library system. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two, the North Hollywood Regional Branch Library and the Los Feliz 
Branch, are still closed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very excited about having the library reopen," said Karen Constine, 
chief of staff for Councilwoman Laura Chick. While the library is outside 
Chick's district, many of her constituents use the Woodland Hills library, 
Constine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been getting all sorts of calls," she said. "People want books." 
</P>
<P>
 The system has spent $2.6 million on repairs to the damaged libraries, said 
Haut. The quake caused about $200,000 in damage at the Woodland Hills Branch, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills branch will be open Monday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 
5:30 p.m.; Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30 to 8 p.m., and Wednesday and Friday 
from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The repairs included asbestos removal and the anchoring of bookcases and light 
fixtures, Haut said. A new air-conditioning and heating system was also 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 New carpeting and flooring were added and the facility has increased its 
electrical capacity to accommodate modern library technology. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; PIERCE COLLEGE HOSTS TRANSFER SEMINAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pierce College is planning a seminar to help guide students through the often 
confusing process of transferring to four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from 65 colleges and universities will visit the school 
Wednesday from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. to offer advice, said Roger Brown, co-director 
of Pierce College's Career Transfer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is often a lot of anxiety on the part of the students because there are 
so many schools out there," he said. "There are so many choices, it can really 
get confusing at times." 
</P>
<P>
 College and University Day will be held on the mall outside the Campus Center 
of the Woodland Hills campus, 6201 Winnetka Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the schools also will send representatives who can answer questions 
about applying for financial aid, Brown said. For information about the seminar 
call (818) 719-6440. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that more schools are sending representatives this year, probably 
because they have increased their recruiting efforts to bring in more revenues 
to help ease budget constraints. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; LONGTIME CIVIC ACTIVIST HEADS FOR NEW TURF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY KWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the corner of Vanalden Avenue and Rosita Street is a tiny patch of grass 
and shrubbery planted with a lone pine that has come to be known affectionately 
as "Frankel Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the late '60s, Tarzana homeowner leader Louise Frankel led an effort 
to transform the traffic island from a weedy mud pit into a landscaped spot 
where neighbors would gather for the annual Christmas tree lighting. Frankel 
helped raised funds for the landscaping and sprinkler system, persuaded the 
city to maintain the plot and called the tree-maintenance department whenever 
the island began to look scruffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends say the campaign is just a small example of the big contributions 
Frankel has made to Tarzana. But, they say, it is indicative of the vision, 
energy and persistence that Frankel has brought to her work. Frankel is moving 
over the hill to Brentwood, 32 years after she and her husband, television 
producer Ernie Frankel, founded the Tarzana Property Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a doer," said Irma Dobbyn, her longtime friend and fellow homeowner 
advocate. "When she sets her mind to it, she really sticks to it and gets it 
done." 
</P>
<P>
 The blond, hazel-eyed Frankel looks years younger than 71. Articulate and 
engaging, she can also be blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has a personality that makes her a wonderful advocate for the community," 
Dobbyn said. "She's a good speaker, and she's not reluctant to voice her 
opinions."  
</P>
<P>
 Frankel played a significant part in saving two large tracts of open space 
from development -- Corbin Canyon, north of Mulholland Drive and east of 
Winnetka Avenue, and an area known as The Great Wild, at the end of Reseda 
Boulevard in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel was named by the city Commission on the Status of Women as one of 15 
Pioneer Women of the Year in 1992, and was honored by the Tarzana Chamber of 
Commerce as Tarzana Woman of the Year in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louise Frankel and Irma Dobbyn practically wrote the Tarzana Community Plan, 
which has guided development in the community since (the 1970s) and is 
responsible for the fact that Tarzana looks more like a village, as compared to 
Encino with its high rises," said Liz Tigar, secretary of the homeowners 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Tarzana has changed over the years, the rural community giving way to a 
bustling suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deer used to come up to our front yard," Frankel reminisced. "People had 
stables and horses. They used to ride up and down the street. We all knew each 
other . . . our kids used to go to the same schools."  
</P>
<P>
 Frankel is moving to Brentwood to be closer to her daughter, Elin Schwartz, 
who lives there. She and her husband, who will celebrate their 50th wedding 
anniversary Oct. 21, have another daughter and six grandchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 The activist does not intend to retire from public service just because she is 
moving over the hill. Currently a member of the Los Angeles County Economy and 
Efficiency Commission, she said she would like to serve on another commission, 
perhaps dealing with planning or zoning.  
</P>
<P>
 And it's not likely she'll stop caring about Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>
 Just recently, Tigar received a call from Frankel. She asked Tigar to make 
sure the city remembers to cut the grass at Frankel Park. KAY KWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CITY SEEKS VOLUNTEERS FOR DISASTER CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To be better ready the next time an earthquake or other civil disaster 
strikes, Glendale is looking for a few good volunteers -- or several hundred of 
them, to be more exact. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, city officials announced the formation of a "Volunteer Disaster 
Service Workers" network, whose members will help with an array of duties in 
the event of disasters -- such as coordinating care and shelter, setting up 
emergency communications, providing foreign-language translation and supporting 
the city's emergency services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Northridge earthquake was a moderate quake, and Glendale had its hands 
full," said Gerald Shamburg, the city's emergency services coordinator. "So the 
next time something happens, we want to have a pool of trained volunteers in 
place to provide an additional level of support." 
</P>
<P>
 Requirements for participating in the program are minimal, city officials 
said. After going through a brief orientation program, the registered 
volunteers will be sworn in as disaster service workers and issued ID cards. 
They also will be required to attend periodic workshops and training on 
earthquake preparedness, shelter operations, disaster communications and 
related topics. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, city officials are seeking people who can help in these areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shelter workers to assist city staff, the American Red Cross and Salvation 
Army in the event that disaster shelters are operated on a long-term basis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Licensed amateur radio operators to provide communications stations at 
schools, hospitals, shelters and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 * People fluent in Spanish, Armenian and other languages to work as 
translators. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Area leaders" to coordinate disaster preparedness meetings and activities 
in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Chief Richard Hinz said the city will be counting on the disaster service 
workers to actively go into their neighborhoods and help educate people about 
disaster readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus has to be on the community at large," Hinz said. "We hope to build 
a large cadre of people, not only to assist in an emergency, but also to get 
the message out about being prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief meeting Wednesday at City Hall, officials signed up the 
program's first two volunteers: Gale Dean, office manager of Store-It-All 
self-storage, and Jerry Bizaillion, leader of a local homeowners association.  
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said that about 20 people have already expressed interest in 
joining the program. They also said they hope the network will include not just 
residents, but merchants, nonprofit groups, Neighborhood Watch groups, churches 
and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens said the city has already begun soliciting volunteers via 
mailings to local community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a reactive type of service we're talking about," Givens said. 
"People throughout the city realize this is not pretend, this is for real and 
we need to be prepared at all times." 
</P>
<P>
 The first orientation meeting for disaster service workers is 7 p.m. Oct. 19 
at 141 N. Glendale Ave. For more information, call (818) 548-2121. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; PUBLIC WORKS HEAD LEAVES FOR COVINA JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vince Mastrosimone, Agoura Hills' public works director, is leaving to take a 
similar job in the city of Covina, where he once served as park superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 His last day is today.Mastrosimone, who has held his current job since 1987, 
said he enjoys his work in Agoura Hills, but is tired of the commute from his 
home in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's two hours, at least," said Mastrosimone, who also is the city's 
personnel director. "It gets old." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, he said, the Agoura Hills job has been "the best I've ever had, and 
I really mean that," Mastrosimone told the City Council. "I felt that I was 
respected and I felt I had a part in improving the good things about Agoura 
Hills." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a hole that will be difficult to plug," City Manager 
Terry Matz said. "Our loss is going to be Covina's gain." 
</P>
<P>
 Mastrosimone, 42, also filled in as Agoura Hills' city manager for about five 
months, beginning in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one respect, it was nice knowing the City Council had the confidence in 
me, but in the other respect, it just happened to be the rainiest winter in 
history, and we were plagued with landslides," he said. "It was quite a 
handful." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether the city would replace Mastrosimone, Mayor Joan Yacovone said 
Monday: "We are taking an inventory of what services are on line, what we need 
and then we'll go from there. (City Manager Terry Matz) is going to give (the 
City Council) some sort of information as to what he thinks he needs." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, meanwhile, may have to increase the number of hours it contracts out 
to Willdan Associates, a consulting firm that provides personnel to guide city 
operations, Yacovone said. FRANK MANNIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : SINGER'S 'PRAYER' MAKES A PLEA FOR CHILDHELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his flowing blond hair and cowboy boots, Mark Williamson looks like a 
typical L.A. rocker. But to the child-abuse prevention group he is helping, 
Williamson is far from ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Williamson, an English singer-songwriter, is donating net proceeds of one of 
his songs, which features a 70-member celebrity chorus, to Childhelp USA, a 
Woodland Hills-based international charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Chorus members on "Prayer for the Children," include actor Suzanne Somers, 
Justin Hayward of the Moody Blues, REO Speedwagon's Kevin Cronin and the Doobie 
Brothers' Jeff (Skunk) Baxter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebullient, witty and down-to-earth, the Woodland Hills transplant is no 
newcomer to working with children. Twelve years ago in England, Williamson sang 
and read stories to youngsters on a children's television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would definitely end my career if anyone were to see tapes of that 
show," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 David H. Watson Jr., a fund-raising consultant for Childhelp, said the 
organization appreciates the money and publicity that Williamson and his record 
company, Peak Records, is generating for the charity.  
</P>
<P>
 "His sincerity is genuine," Watson said. "Mark is one of those rare gems." 
</P>
<P>
 Childhelp is a national nonprofit organization dedicated to the prevention and 
treatment of child abuse and neglect. Watson said that as far as he knows, 
Williamson's fund-raising song is the biggest effort a musician has made to 
help the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The project evolved from a series of chance occurrences. In July of last year, 
Williamson was trying to write a song about a girlfriend who had just left him, 
when he got a major case of writer's block. Turning on the TV, the 33-year-old 
artist became engrossed in two talk shows, one dealing with child kidnaping and 
the other, child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see another family going through something so horrible, as a parent, 
that touches a spot," said Williamson, the father of a 12-year-old daughter he 
calls "the best thing that ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 So, the stymied song about love lost became "Prayer for the Children." Soon 
after, the singer signed a long-hoped-for record deal, with Peak Records, a 
subsidiary of GRP / MCA Records Inc. Williamson told Andi Howard, Peak's 
president, that he wanted the song to help a charity and Howard thought of 
Childhelp. 
</P>
<P>
 The song was co-written by Michael Thompson, who helped write four other 
singles on Williams' debut album, "Time Slipping By." "Prayer for the Children" 
received a favorable mention in Billboard, and is climbing the adult 
contemporary charts.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard said she doesn't know how much money the single has made, but hopes 
that it will eventually pull in $500,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Williamson said he would like the song to focus the public's attention on the 
problem of child abuse, particularly now, as National Children's Day, on Sunday 
approaches. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CHURCH BUYS LAND TO INCREASE PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Signaling its commitment to an area hit by urban decline, the large Church on 
the Way has purchased a nearby lot for $2.15 million to provide additional 
parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Pastor Jack Hayford, who leads a congregation of 8,250 members living 
in and around the San Fernando Valley, said Wednesday that the purchase of the 
2.4-acre lot on Sherman Way was mostly significant for the church's ministry to 
the Valley urban core. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are any number of places where (the church) could be located instead of 
an area that is not so desirable for our nighttime events," Hayford said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made a statement that we are committed to the urban center as well as 
to suburban areas," said Hayford, a nationally known pastor whose church 
projects a budget of $10.4 million for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the purchase completed this week from owner Henry Lyon, the church will 
eventually gain only 150 new parking spaces. The church had been renting the 
land for $2,000 a month to park a maximum of 150 vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 After demolishing an empty building on the property -- once occupied by the 
California Department of Human Resources -- Church on the Way will have a total 
of 300 parking spaces in a lighted, landscaped area more inviting to 
churchgoers, said Max Lile, the church's executive director of finance and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we've had a big event or a large service, some people have described 
our parking situation as a war zone," Lile said. Most of the money for the 
purchase came from the church's sale of a lot on the corner of Van Nuys 
Boulevard and Sherman Way earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Church on the Way, formally the First Foursquare Church of Van Nuys, is one of 
two non-Catholic "super-churches" in the East Valley. The other is Grace 
Community Church of Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, Hayford's congregation bought the Van Nuys First Baptist Church 
complex three-quarters of a mile to the west on Sherman Way. About 5,000 people 
attend Sunday morning services at the two facilities, both of which house 
classrooms and various church departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford, 60, is a much-sought speaker around the country to evangelical and 
Pentecostal Christians. Co-founder of a quarterly prayer gathering of Los 
Angeles pastors called "Love L.A.," the minister also was the principle figure 
behind the San Fernando Valley Crusade last June featuring evangelist Luis 
Palau. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our belief is that Los Angeles is coming back," Hayford said, referring to 
the city's setbacks from urban rioting, fires and the Northridge earthquake. 
"We suffered as much as anyone from the quake, about a quarter million dollars 
worth, but we are committed to not retreating, not just limiting ourselves to 
cautious moves." JOHN DART

 Over the next two months, gasoline purchased at most San Fernando Valley Mobil 
stations will help fuel an ongoing campaign to alleviate problems associated 
with hunger in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Valley Mobil dealers launched their third annual fund-raising 
drive, which promises a donation to the LIFE (Love Is Feeding Everyone) 
organization of 1/4 of each penny for every gallon of gas sold.A minimum of 
$200,000 is expected to be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 LIFE is an 11-year-old nonprofit agency responsible for food distribution to 
about 170 local social service agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Feeding more than 120,000 people a week, agencies benefiting from LIFE range 
from organizations for the homeless to teen-age runaway programs and inner-city 
food distribution sites for economically underprivileged families. 
</P>
<P>
 Money generated will go toward maintaining LIFE's food distribution warehouse, 
education outreach and job training / job placement programs and hunger 
awareness presentations conducted by Mobil dealers and members from LIFE.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CAP PROPOSED FOR CAMPAIGN DONATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando city councilman has proposed placing a cap on individual 
donations to political campaigns, and the council may form an ad-hoc committee 
to consider a comprehensive reform of the city's political fund-raising laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about perceptions," said Councilman Raul Godinez II, who recommended 
Monday night that a $250 cap be placed on individual contributions to council 
candidates. "It's about a loss of confidence by the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Godinez also recommended putting a $250 cap on "in kind" contributions of 
services. He also wants to limit combined donations of cash and "in kind" 
services to less than $400. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many people who can give more than $250 in San Fernando," 
said Godinez, who was elected to the council this year. "That leaves the 
question of who can give more than $250? People who live outside of the city? 
We don't want people who live outside of San Fernando to have a large 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Doude Wysbeek, while agreeing that the city's elections laws 
need to be changed, disagreed with Godinez's assertion that large campaign 
contributions can influence city government. A single contribution to Wysbeek's 
campaign of $15,000 drew criticism Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think I'm for sale for $15,000," Wysbeek said. "That's an insult to my 
income, my family and my heritage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek said that he can get such large donations because as a local 
businessman he has a wider network of contacts and supporters than most. 
</P>
<P>
 Wysbeek added that it is more important to change the laws so that winning 
candidates would have to give up their seats if caught cheating on 
campaign-spending reports. To merely put a cap on donations would drive 
campaign fund-raising underground, possibly prompting candidates to form phony 
organizations to run campaigns for them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that is going to make an honest person, per se," Wysbeek said 
about the cap on donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members decided not to take action on Godinez's proposal and opted 
instead to have Mayor Raymond Ojeda appoint an ad-hoc committee to consider a 
comprehensive change to campaign laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In other action Monday night, the council approved the installation of new 
electric circuits in downtown San Fernando. The circuits will be used to 
provide power to Christmas lights in the downtown area. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; QUAKE-HIT BULLOCK'S TO REOPEN TOP LEVEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a new star taking the place of the apostrophe in its logo and new walls 
replacing those shattered in the Northridge earthquake, the Bullock's store in 
Sherman Oaks Fashion Square mall will reopen its fourth floor with celebrations 
Oct. 18, 22 and 23. 
</P>
<P>
 From celebrities to fashion shows to a benefit shopping day for charity, the 
store is hoping three days of special events will help lure shoppers back to 
its top level -- shoppers who were turned away after the Jan. 17 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock's lower levels were less heavily damaged. The first two floors 
reopened in June and the third floor in July. With the reopening of the fourth 
floor, which will house such departments as lingerie and special-sized 
clothing, shoppers will be able to see the full extent of a massive 
refurbishing project, company spokeswoman Merle Goldstone said. The earthquake 
offered "an opportunity to give it a new look," Goldstone said of the store. 
"It's lighter and brighter." 
</P>
<P>
 That new look includes a beige stucco facade, new carpeting and that new 
star-cum-apostrophe on the sign. Long a trademark of parent company R. H. Macy, 
the star was recently added to the 21-store Bullock's logo. And since the 
Sherman Oaks store is the first to use it, company officials had a star in the 
Milky Way named "Bullock's Sherman Oaks." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 18, the store plans a benefit shopping day to raise funds for 25 
nonprofit health and social service groups. A $10 benefit ticket provides 
special discounts, cooking demonstrations and more, with the ticket proceeds 
going to the charities. Other events include live jazz, calypso and blues 
music, cooking demonstrations and a fashion show. Beginning at 10 a.m. Oct. 22, 
kids can leave their handprints in wet cement at the home store entrance on the 
lower level. A fortune teller, guest chef and television actors Teresa Hill and 
James Wilder of Fox TV's "Models Inc." will be among others on hand during the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 23, customers who spot one of several roaming celebrities will receive 
a gift from Universal Studios and the kids can prepare for Halloween by having 
their faces painted. ERIC SLATER

CITY WORKER CRUSHED AT LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city worker crushed by a trash truck at a landfill was identified Wednesday 
as Robert Thomas of Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old refuse driver died Tuesday afternoon at the Lost Hills 
Landfill at 5300 Lost Hills Road, said Deputy Rick Erickson, of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was "standing next to his truck when the load on a truck next to him 
shifted and that truck toppled onto him," Erickson said. Thomas died at the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA officials have launched an investigation, which could take as long as 
six weeks, spokesman Rick Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck that overturned at the county-owned landfill was from a private 
refuse company, Perez Disposal, Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our safety engineers are trying to determine if the truck was turned off when 
it overturned," Rice said. "Or if there were any violations of workplace safety 
and health regulations."

ELECTIONS / L.A. CITY COUNCIL 5TH DISTRICT; POLICE UNION BACKS OPPONENT OF 
YAROSLAVSKY'S WIFE IN RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police union leaders endorsed one Los Angeles City Council candidate and 
blasted another Wednesday, backing Deputy Dist. Atty. Lea Purwin D'Agostino 
while claiming that Barbara Yaroslavsky, if elected, would be a puppet of her 
husband, outgoing Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strings will still be pulled by him (Yaroslavsky)," said Danny Staggs, 
president of the Police Protective League, who characterized the councilman as 
antagonistic toward the police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs, who cited the councilman's vote last summer against settling a bitter 
wage dispute with police, made his remarks at a news conference at Parker 
Center even as he announced that the league had endorsed D'Agostino. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino, 57, often described as the tenacious Dragon Lady of the courts, 
caught the public's eye in 1987 when she prosecuted producer John Landis on 
involuntary manslaughter charges stemming from the deaths of actor Vic Morrow 
and two children during filming of "Twilight Zone -- The Movie." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the case, she was transferred out of the central courts by her 
boss, Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner. In 1988, she ran against Reiner and lost. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Agostino will be a strong friend of the police, said Staggs, who vowed to 
send union members onto the streets to work for her candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, Danny Staggs will not have any impact on the 5th District race," 
an angry Zev Yaroslavsky later replied. The league not only fails to represent 
rank-and-file cops but is also out of touch with 5th District voters, 
Yaroslavsky charged, noting that voters there supported the so-called 
Christopher Commission reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Barbara Yaroslavsky said that despite their differences, she hoped 
to work with the police union, if she is elected, to sharply beef up the LAPD, 
called the most understaffed big city police department in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But she dismissed Staggs' views that she would be controlled by her husband. 
"Anyone who says that hasn't awakened and smelled the roses of this 
generation," she said. "Zev himself has been driving car-pool for several days 
now for the kids going to school." The couple have two children. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Zev Yaroslavsky is leaving his Westside-Sherman Oaks-based 
council seat after 19 years to take on new duties as a member of the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors. His wife, after considerable agonizing, 
threw her hat into the ring in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, D'Agostino, whose candidacy was nearly lost in the exchange of 
barbs between Zev Yaroslavsky and the league, distanced herself somewhat from 
Staggs' prediction that Yaroslavsky's wife would be his puppet at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, D'Agostino, a Westwood resident, said she was concerned that having a 
husband in one branch of government and the wife in another would risk 
potential conflicts of interest. The two jurisdictions have been known to sue 
each other and squabble over public policies, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running for the 5th District seat are former Los Angeles school board 
member Roberta Weintraub and attorney Michael Feuer, head of Bet Tzedek, a 
nonprofit legal services agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs began slamming Zev Yaroslavsky at the outset of his remarks Wednesday. 
"After years of neglect by the outgoing councilman of the 5th District, it (the 
district) has become one of our toughest beats" to patrol, Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union president went on to predict that D'Agostino, a veteran member of 
the criminal justice system who now works out of the Van Nuys Courthouse, would 
be a strong friend of law enforcement. For her part, D'Agostino quickly agreed 
that she would support a bigger police department, with better paid employees 
who have access to the latest equipment and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't afford business as usual," D'Agostino said as she suggested freeing 
police to routinely frisk people for weapons. "If we can stop cars (at road 
checks) for drunk drivers, we can stop for weapons," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was later, during questioning by reporters, that Staggs claimed that 
Barbara Yaroslavsky would not only be unqualified to serve but that, if 
elected, she would virtually be her husband's puppet. Such a situation, Staggs 
suggested, would hurt the city's police services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zev has not been extremely supportive of the officers, including our last 
request for a pay raise," Staggs said. "He's been very critical." 
</P>
<P>
 Staggs also claimed that he had a "heated discussion" with the Yaroslavskys on 
Tuesday night at an event at the Century Plaza Hotel over the league's 
published views that Barbara Yaroslavsky was not qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said I'd insulted his wife," Staggs related. "I said it was not an insult; 
it was a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't become a council person by osmosis," Staggs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zev Yaroslavsky later said he did not recall the conversation that way. "I 
don't honestly know what he's talking about -- he should have his blood tested 
to see what he was drinking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Told of Staggs' allegation that he would control his wife if she were elected, 
Yaroslavsky said: "I would expect nothing less from Danny Staggs than this kind 
of typically sexist remark."

LOCKHEED NEIGHBORS OPPOSE CLEANUP PLAN; SAFETY: FEARING AIR POLLUTION AND 
HEALTH RISKS, RESIDENTS SAY THEY WILL CHALLENGE PROPOSED VAPOR EXTRACTION 
SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of residents appeared at a public meeting Wednesday to oppose the 
Lockheed Corp. effort to clean up contaminated soil on a 90-acre site, claiming 
it will pose grave health risks to neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Complying with federal orders to remove contaminants left behind after 63 
years of building military aircraft, Lockheed wants to build a so-called vapor 
extraction system of wells, pipes and charcoal filters that would release up to 
40 pounds a day of potentially cancer-causing substances from a 50-foot tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan -- which has been given preliminary approval by the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District -- is said to be the best means for Lockheed to 
prevent further contamination of underground water sources. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has raised the ire of residents who want to stop work through legal 
channels on the $13.7-million project proposed for the site of Lockheed's 
former B-1 plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides are prepared for a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed has hired two public relations firms to help ease public concerns. 
And a Tarzana-based law firm representing nearly 200 residents is seeking an 
injunction to halt the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you consider the prior experience these people have already had at the 
site for years?" asked David Casselman, one of the attorneys for the residents, 
during the hearing at the Airport Hilton in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD senior manager Ben Shaw responded, "There is a risk if we do nothing . . 
. a non-project is not a choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed officials say the chances of anyone developing cancer are 3 in 1 
million after a lifetime of exposure to the proposed system. That statistic, 
however, is of little comfort, say the people who live nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lockheed contaminated the water and contaminated the ground and now wants to 
contaminate the air. It's the only thing left. It's ridiculous," said neighbor 
Dan Fournier, 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle are officials with the AQMD, the regional agency that 
regulates air pollution. The city also has an interest because a cleanup plan 
must be in place before the property can be redeveloped. City officials are 
looking for an outside consultant to review Lockheed's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank Mayor Bill Wiggins had previously asked: "What authority does the city 
have to tell the AQMD to turn these permits down?" 
</P>
<P>
 Very little, according to Benjamin Kaufman, an attorney hired by the city to 
review Lockheed's cleanup effort. "The city's ability to second-guess the AQMD 
on matters the state of California has said are AQMD matters is limited," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only authority the city has, Kaufman added, is to approve or deny a 
permit to build the 50-foot tower. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD contends that the project uses the best available technology and 
meets the agency's regulations for treating chemicals in the soil, such as 
carbon tetrachloride, chloroform and methylene chloride. But the agency has not 
issued Lockheed a permit yet, citing the public concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Vapor extraction systems are typically used by oil companies. Volatile organic 
compounds are removed from contaminated soil by underground wells, then 
filtered and released into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 About 98% of the treated contaminants in this case will be captured, said 
Carol Yuge, a Lockheed spokeswoman. The remainder will be pumped into the air 
24 hours a day over the next seven to 10 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are anxious to clean up the 90-acre site, which they hope will 
become a center for retailers, post-production studios and light industry. 
However, Lockheed has been slow in selecting a developer, frustrating some at 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wiggins: "For every month or two months or three months it takes to pick 
a developer, the retail market that could go on that site is less and less 
because (retailers) locate somewhere else."

MAN SENTENCED TO PRISON IN FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former president of a fire protection company has been sentenced to 10 
years in federal prison for defrauding five banks of $1 million in loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Klinger, 33, of Woodland Hills was convicted by a federal jury in 
March of lying on a loan application, mail fraud and money laundering, 
according to Assistant U. S. Atty.David F. Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger was sentenced Tuesday in Los Angeles by U. S. District Court Judge 
Laughlin E. Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said evidence from an FBI investigation showed that Klinger, 
president and majority owner of Best Fire Protection in the San Fernando 
Valley, lied about his finances on applications to five banks to get a mortgage 
loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger provided the banks with fake income tax returns and exaggerated his 
personal income, Taylor said, adding that Klinger also lied about the gross 
sales of his fire protection business. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Klinger also laundered "hundreds of thousands of dollars" from 
the illegal schemes, using money from one loan to persuade banks to make 
additional loans, according to the U. S. Attorney's Office in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Klinger was also ordered to pay $790,000 in restitution to the banks.

MAN ORDERED TO JAIL OVER HAIR-DRYER SPAT; COURTS: THE TARZANA RESIDENT IS 
SENTENCED AFTER BEING CONVICTED OF ATTACKING NEIGHBOR OVER THE BORROWED 
APPLIANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Talk about a bad hair day. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Patrick Cunningham, 28, of Tarzana was sentenced to six months in jail 
Wednesday and ordered to undergo another six months of anger counseling for 
pummeling a neighbor during a dispute over a borrowed hair dryer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea of a good headline would be, 'Hair Dryer Leads to Blow Out,' " Deputy 
City Atty. George Schell said, adding that "from now on, I'm going to towel-dry 
my hair." 
</P>
<P>
 While the dispute was undeniably petty, Schell said, the injuries Cunningham 
inflicted were serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Conaway, 29, received a fractured nose, jaw and eye socket. X-rays showed 
that bone fragments had pierced his brain, Schell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conaway remembers little about the May 17 punch-out, except for waking up and 
seeing paramedics standing over him in the courtyard of Cunningham's apartment 
house in the 18500 block of Burbank Boulevard, Schell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But testimony from other witnesses during a four-day jury trial before 
Municipal Judge Alice Altoon provided this scenario: 
</P>
<P>
 Conaway's girlfriend, Cheryl Jones, had used Cunningham's name to borrow the 
grooming appliance from yet another neighbor. Somewhere along the way, she came 
to believe that she didn't have to give it back. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham confronted Jones over what he believed to be unauthorized use of 
his name and then, Schell said, the pair began a shoving match that wound in a 
"chest-bumping contest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our primary victim is a rather meek-looking guy, while the girlfriend and our 
defendant are on the large side," the prosecutor said. Nonetheless, Conaway 
came to the rescue of his girlfriend, who'd been called some unsavory names by 
Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Schell, Cunningham grabbed Conaway by his hair, punched him twice 
in the face, then slammed his head down on a sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham maintained that Conaway attacked him and that Conaway received some 
of his injuries by falling on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 After 10 hours of deliberation, a jury decided that Cunningham had used 
excessive force and convicted him of misdemeanor battery. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the hair dryer was unclear Wednesday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY PLANS TO CULL LIST OF PROJECTS FROM 
BRAINSTORMING SESSION; MEETING: SANTA CLARITA LEADERS WILL GATHER SATURDAY TO 
CREATE THE SECOND COMMUNITY STRATEGIC PLAN, AN AGENDA OF ITEMS TO TACKLE IN THE 
FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A broad plan outlining future Santa Clarita projects will be developed 
Saturday in a daylong brainstorming session featuring elected officials, 
business leaders, property owners and other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Part wish list and part planning guide for city officials, this Community 
Strategic Plan identifies Santa Clarita issues to be tackled during the next 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at CalArts, marks the second time Santa 
Clarita has created such a document, with the first completed in April, 1991. 
The earlier planning session drew 125 participants and identified 24 items on 
topics ranging from land use to transportation to shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city follows it pretty well," said City Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy, who 
took part in the 1991 planning session and will participate Saturday. "The 
purpose, of course, is to get community input." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how successful you feel city leaders were in implementing the first plan 
depends on whether you want to take a bus, safeguard local hills or shop at a 
Nordstrom department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the varied projects identified in the first plan have been at least 
partially addressed in the past three years, but some are incomplete and appear 
to have little chance of being accomplished in the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting around town received considerable attention in the first plan, with a 
call for road improvements, an expanded transit system and a web of walking 
trails. Significant progress has been made on this front. 
</P>
<P>
 The main thoroughfares of Soledad Canyon and San Fernando roads are being 
widened in several places. Santa Clarita's bus system grew from six buses in 
1990 to a fleet of 22 local buses, 23 commuter buses and 10 door-to-door vans. 
Also the South Fork Trail opened in May, 1993, as the first four-mile leg of a 
25-mile network to connect Santa Clarita's four main communities with paths for 
walking, bicycling and horse riding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wheels grind slowly," said Vera Johnson, a longtime advocate for an 
improved city road system. "I'm thrilled in a three-year period that we've been 
able to have this much progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, 67, participated three years ago and said she will take part Saturday 
to once again stress the importance of a well-planned transportation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Development was also mentioned throughout the 1991 strategic plan, with 
requests to safeguard open space areas, create a growth management plan and 
ensure public services don't suffer because of additional construction and 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Cameron, a Santa Clarita resident who watchdogs city actions on nearly 
all new development here, said city officials have accomplished all of the 
strategic plan's realistic goals. 
</P>
<P>
 A strict ordinance to preserve city hillsides and ridgelines was adopted in 
March, 1992, and city planners consistently placed restrictions on new 
development to provide road improvements and money for schools. Council members 
also vocally opposed large construction projects just outside city limits, 
citing a strain on Santa Clarita roads, schools, libraries and police services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the (projects) are extremely desirable and unbelievably difficult," 
said Cameron. "Given that requirement, I think the city has done 
extraordinarily well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron said his only complaint about the city's strategic planning is that it 
isn't done annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite progress on these issues, Santa Clarita has yet to establish a 
university, a conference center or lure a Nordstrom store -- each of which 
residents requested be included in the first plan. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials haven't drawn much interest from the California State 
University system or from conference center developers. In 1993, Santa Clarita 
mailed out more than 50 letters asking for proposals to construct such a 
center. There were no responses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (we) found out is that the conference center business is a loss leader," 
said Mike Haviland, city economic development coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoppers, at least, have hope. The Newhall Land & Farming Co. is "vigorously 
pursuing" the addition of Nordstrom to the Valencia Town Center as part of 
future expansion plans, according to spokeswoman Marlee Lauffer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the upcoming planning session say they expect different issues 
to be raised in the next meeting. At the time of the first, Santa Clarita had 
been a city for only four years. While the earlier meeting focused on amenities 
overlooked when the area was still part of Los Angeles County, residents are 
now more likely to be concerned about earthquake recovery and redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be interesting because times change and interests change," 
Councilwoman Darcy said.

A 'MONSTER' HIT BY R.E.M. KICKS OFF PROMISING QUARTER; POP MUSIC: THE BAND'S 
ALBUM DEBUTS AT NO. 1; STREISAND'S 'THE CONCERT' ENTERS AT NO. 10. RETAILERS 
EXPECT BIG YEAR-END SALES.

<P>
 R.E.M.'s new "Monster" sold a whopping 344,000 copies during its first week in 
the stores -- kicking off what retailers anticipate will be the most profitable 
fourth quarter of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "R.E.M. came in miles ahead of everybody at our stores -- hands down," said 
Lew Garrett, vice president of purchasing at the 410-outlet, North Canton, 
Ohio-based Camelot Music chain. "It really was no contest. Their fans just came 
out en masse." 
</P>
<P>
 "Monster" is the band's best first-week sales performance and dwarfed the 
competition in a week where total album sales totaled an estimated $133 
million. Boyz II Men's "II" sold 161,000 copies last week to capture the No. 2 
position, while Eric Clapton's "From the Cradle" finished third with 128,000 
units. Next in line: Anita Baker's "Rhythm of Love" at 109,000 copies and 
Luther Vandross' "Songs" at 108,000 units. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-profile release, Barbra Streisand's "The Concert," sold 89,000 
copies, entering the charts at No. 10. Recorded live at Madison Square Garden, 
the double CD captures Streisand singing classics with a 64-piece orchestra at 
the peak of her triumphant summer tour. Her last album, "Back to Broadway," has 
sold more than 2 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Record retailers -- who have sold an estimated $5.1-billion worth of albums 
since January -- are expecting shoppers to spend an additional $1.7 billion 
before New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very optimistic about a strong sales finish this year," said Russ 
Solomon, president of the 87-outlet, Sacramento-based Tower Records, whose 
sales are already up 7% over last year. "It's not like it was a few years ago. 
Business is buoyant." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the albums that retailers are counting on to beef up profits 
during the last quarter: 
</P>
<P>
 * Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy": Due in November, this is the Seattle quintet's 
highly anticipated follow-up to last year's "Vs." album, which sold 950,000 
copies during its first week out. "Vs." and the 1992 debut album, "Ten," have 
sold more than 12 million copies in the United States and are still in the Top 
50. 
</P>
<P>
 * Madonna's "Bedtime Stories": This collection, due Oct. 25, will test the 
singer's popularity. Her last album, "Erotica," did not sell as well as 
expected, but retailers are not counting out the drawing power of pop's most 
controversial vamp. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Eagles' "Hell Freezes Over": This live collection, due next month, is 
the Southern California band's first album in 15 years. Sales could be affected 
by this week's postponement of the remaining dates on the group's much-touted 
reunion tour because of a gastrointestinal disorder that has struck member 
Glenn Frey. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Jackson's "His Story": Expected to be released in December, this 
30-track, double-CD collection will feature Jackson's greatest hits plus eight 
new songs. Despite Jackson's recent settlement of a civil suit over charges of 
sexual molestation, retailers expect the album to do at least as well as his 
1991 "Dangerous" album, which sold 6 million copies in the United States, plus 
an additional 14 million copies overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 These albums will face competition from a variety of strong contenders: 
Slayer's "Divine Intervention" (which sold 93,000 copies last week and entered 
the charts at No. 8; Megadeth's "Youthanasia"; Tom Petty's "Wildflowers"; 
Gloria Estefan's "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me"; Smashing Pumpkins' 
just-released "Pisces Iscariot"; Clint Black's "One Emotion," and Christmas 
collections from Kenny G, Neil Diamond and Donna Summer. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, retailers are optimistic about the continued sales punch of 
newcomers Counting Crows, Offspring (after 18 weeks on the chart, No. 7 with 
97,000 copies sold last week), Green Day (sold 92,000 units in its 33rd week, 
good for No. 9), Stone Temple Pilots, Sheryl Crow and Candlebox, as well as 
such soundtrack smashes as "Forrest Gump," "The Lion King" (at No. 6, with 
107,000 units sold in its 17th week) and "Natural Born Killers."

TWENTY YEARS LATER, THEY'RE STILL RIDING HOLLYWOOD'S RAPIDS; MOVIES: PRODUCERS 
LAWRENCE TURMAN AND DAVID FOSTER HAVE HAD A LONG, FRUITFUL PARTNERSHIP. 'WE'RE 
TOTAL OPPOSITES. THAT'S WHY IT WORKS,' SAYS FOSTER. THEIR LATEST HIT: 'THE 
RIVER WILD.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a miracle that producing partners Lawrence Turman and David Foster have 
stayed together over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie-making duo is celebrating their 20-year partnership -- one of the 
longest in Hollywood today -- with the release of Universal's action-adventure 
picture "The River Wild," starring Meryl Streep, which was the No. 1 movie at 
the box office last weekend with an impressive $10.2-million opening. But what 
is at least as impressive as their product is their longevity -- considering 
how diametrically different they are. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on an overstuffed floral sofa in the sunlit living room of Foster's 
Century City condominium, the partners of Turman Foster Co. constantly step on 
each other's lines and interrupt one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're total opposites," says Foster, 61, "That's why it works." Turman, 67, 
chimes in: "One of the beauties of our partnership is we don't have to agree." 
</P>
<P>
 Even physically, the two are strikingly dissimilar. Foster, a short, 
wisecracking New Yorker with a prickly beard who accurately describes himself 
as "a little more grizzly" than his more refined partner, sports dark shades, a 
black baseball cap, jeans and loafers. He's unabashedly outspoken and swears 
without restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 The softer-spoken, California-born Turman, who is more pragmatic and cerebral 
than his shoot-from-the-hip partner, is conservatively dressed in a tie, blue 
pin-striped shirt and dark slacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry is the opera and the symphony," Foster says. "I like to go to the 
football game and scream and carry on." 
</P>
<P>
 The two first met when Turman hired Foster, then a publicist, to help promote 
his 1967 movie, "The Graduate." Since joining forces in 1974 on "The Drowning 
Pool," a whodunit starring Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, they have 
collaborated on more than a dozen productions, including "Heroes," starring 
Henry Winkler; John Carpenter's "The Thing"; "Mass Appeal," starring Jack 
Lemmon; "The Mean Season"; "Running Scared," with Billy Crystal and Gregory 
Hines; and "Short Circuit" and its sequel. They've also produced four TV movies 
for CBS and have one in development at HBO, "The Life of Walt Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, whose three sons -- Gary, Greg and Tim -- are all in the movie 
business, says he is more "Hollywood" than Turman is. "I still go to Mortons on 
Monday night to see who's there -- it's fun," notes the producer, who's been 
married to the same woman, Jackie, for 35 years. "I drive a Jaguar convertible; 
he has a (5-year-old) Peugeot. To him the car doesn't mean anything. I like to 
put my top down and be smooth." 
</P>
<P>
 Turman is the first to agree that he and his wife, Lauree, would much rather 
go to a quiet neighborhood restaurant than dine at one of Hollywood's 
hot-spots. "I haven't been to Mortons in six years, except twice when we were 
invited as guests to the new one," Turman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when it comes to dividing production chores, Turman and Foster find their 
individual styles help their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ski, so I like to take off in the winter and spring," Foster says, "and 
(Turman) bikes and hikes, so he goes away in the summer. It works out great." 
</P>
<P>
 Turman says "one of the advantages of having a partnership is we believe in 
having a life." Typically, one of them will take the lead role on a given 
project based either on availability or a particular passion for a piece of 
material, though both will pitch in as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of "The River Wild," a suspense story directed by Curtis Hanson 
about a troubled married couple who take their son on a white-water rafting 
trip, Foster -- an avid white-water rafter himself -- had kick-started the 
project three years ago and convinced Universal to option Denis O'Neill's 
script for $400,000. But it was Turman who oversaw the pre-production and went 
on location to supervise the production because Foster had several weeks of 
filming still left on Fox's remake of "The Getaway." Foster later joined Turman 
on location in the Northwest halfway through the shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all evens out," says Foster, recalling a visit to Mexico 14 years ago to 
supervise "Caveman," starring Ringo Starr, which Turman had conceived and 
developed but couldn't oversee because he was busy working on "Tribute," 
starring Jack Lemmon. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Foster readily admits he and Turman are fiercely competitive with each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll say to Larry, 'How did you get that script or that book?' I'm being very 
candid here, but whoever gets the material is in first position in the (screen) 
billing." 
</P>
<P>
 Both producers broke into the movie business by answering ads in the Hollywood 
trade papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, who earned a bachelor's degree in journalism from USC, had ambitions 
of being a sports columnist. But after getting out of the Army, he couldn't 
find a reporting job. "I saw an ad in the trades for (the public relations 
firm) Rogers & Cowan for young trainees," he says. He worked there for about 
three years, then quit when he realized he'd never become a partner and opened 
his own PR firm with three partners, representing such clients as Steve 
McQueen, Robert Redford, Peter Sellers and Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, McQueen convinced Foster to go make movies himself. He partnered with 
Mitchell Brower (now manager of the New York State Theater) and produced Robert 
Altman's "McCabe and Mrs. Miller," and two years later, the original "The 
Getaway," with McQueen and Ali McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Turman, a UCLA liberal arts graduate who had worked in his father's textile 
business before realizing "it wasn't for me," broke into Hollywood in 1955 by 
answering a blind ad in Variety for a talent agency that represented such 
clients as Elizabeth Taylor and Audrey Hepburn. After five years as an agent, 
he left to produce movies with partner Stuart Millar, with whom he made "The 
Young Doctors," Gore Vidal's political satire "The Best Man," "Stolen Hours" 
and Judy Garland's last film, 1963's "I Could Go On Singing." 
</P>
<P>
 On his own, in 1966, Turman discovered Charles Webb's novel "The Graduate," 
and hired newcomer Mike Nichols to direct. Turman went on to produce "The Flim 
Flam Man," "Pretty Poison" and "The Great White Hope" and to direct "The 
Marriage of a Young Stockbroker" and "Second Thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 Turman muses that "what may separate our partnership from others is that we 
cannot and do not veto each other." He claims that he and Foster "never really 
have fights -- we have disagreements about petty things." 
</P>
<P>
 While they clearly share a passion to make movies, the partners hardly share 
the same taste. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm drawn to strong, intimate material -- more emotional character pieces," 
says Turman, before he's interrupted by Foster: " I enjoy working on the big 
movies and I'm always saying we need big event pictures. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, recalling the days of going it alone, Turman says he sees much 
value in having a partner.

 Quoting from a poem he loves, though it was written about a romantic liaison, 
Turman says of the partnership: "All pleasures are doubled and all the pain is 
cut in half.";

STEELING THEMSELVES; THREE AREA ATHLETES, EACH WITH CHANCE TO WIN, GIRD FOR 
IRONMAN TRIATHLON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In baseball an ironman is Cal Ripken playing in 2,009 consecutive games. In 
football an ironman is someone who plays both offense and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ripken rarely must run more than 30 yards at a time. A two-way football 
player works hard, but after two or three hours he is peeling off his pads. 
</P>
<P>
 Try this for an ironclad ironman definition: Someone who swims 2.4 miles in 
the ocean, dries off and immediately races a bicycle 112 miles, hops off and 
immediately runs a 26.2-mile marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight to 16 hours straight of grueling, solitary physical activity. No one to 
talk to, no one to lean on. 
</P>
<P>
 And many ironmen aren't men at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Three area ironfolk will compete Oct. 15 in the Ironman Triathlon world 
championship on the Kona Coast of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Two are women with everyday jobs who spend their, ahem, leisure time swimming, 
running and cycling distances greater than many people drive. The other is a 
man who worked all his life so he could spend his, ahem, retirement . . . you 
guessed it, swimming, running and cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Sproule, 23, has been self-reliant since leaving home during high 
school. She is a customer service administrator at a semiconductor firm in 
Ventura. Her fellow employees are so impressed by her dedication as a 
triathlete they donated more than $1,000 to help pay her expenses to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Ilagan, 51, of Thousand Oaks, is an indefatigable paralegal taking 
classes toward a law degree. She is competing in the Ironman world championship 
for the second time after spending her adult life running marathons and racing 
bicycles in an obsessive search to revisit a sweat-induced nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Perrodin, 65, is a retired dentist from Chatsworth who won the age-55 
world championship in 1984 and finished second in the age-60 division in 1989. 
Once an overweight smoker and drinker, Perrodin takes breaks from triathlons by 
competing in ultramarathons, running 100 miles in about 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 How do they do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have the will," Ilagan said. "The physical discipline is a 
given, but the mental discipline must go far beyond what you could expect from 
your body." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do they do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "It started for me as a substitute for drinking, but it has gone far beyond 
that," Perrodin said. "I'll be running or biking and just get overwhelmed with 
positive feelings. I think, God, this is wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 When do they do it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I take a 100-mile bike ride Saturdays and run for an hour directly after 
that," Sproule said. "On Sundays I do a 20-mile run and a one-mile ocean swim. 
I work out during my lunch hour and nearly every day after work." 
</P>
<P>
 For triathletes, the Ironman world championship is the pinnacle. An event that 
began 16 years ago by 15 people on a dare has grown into a prestigious race 
that will be televised by NBC Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen qualifying races throughout the country whittle down 25,000 athletes 
to the 1,500 who compete in Hawaii. There are 24 age classifications, including 
Ironkids for youths 14 and under who cover a shortened course. 
</P>
<P>
 The world triathlon record for men is 8 hours 1 minute 32 seconds, set by Dave 
Scott. The course record at the world championship is 8:07:45 set by Mark 
Allen, 35, who has won five titles in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The world record for women is 8:50:00 by Paula Newby-Fraser, 30. She also 
holds the course record in Kona of 8:56:23. 
</P>
<P>
 The local trio won't be setting any world records. But the goal of winning 
their age classification is very real. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrodin is making his third trip to the Ironman. He was age-55 champion 10 
years ago with a time of 12:45 and was second at age 60 in 1989 with a time of 
12:41. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is unbelievable," said Todd Lieman, a spokesman for the Ironman world 
championship. "He stands a good chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Ilagan has qualified two years in a row. Last year she finished in about 16 
hours after making "rookie mistakes" such as not wearing socks while cycling. 
But Hawaii already is Ilagan's island: She won the U.S. Cycling Federation 
state championship there in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she runs smart and sticks to her race plan, she should do quite well," 
said Robb Fukutomi, president of the Ventura-based Fleet Feet running club of 
which Ilagan and Sproule both belong. 
</P>
<P>
 A more-competitive age classification awaits Sproule, who qualified for the 
Ironman for the first time. For a novice, she could do surprisingly well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tracy is a talented triathlete," Fukutomi said. "The day of the race will be 
like a giant science project for her. She has done her homework." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ironman doubles the distances Sproule has previously raced. Her qualifying 
race, Mike and Robb's Most Excellent Triathlon Aug. 14 in Ventura, was a 
half-triathlon, consisting of a 1.2-mile swim, 56 miles of cycling and 13.1 
miles of running. 
</P>
<P>
 Sproule is more concerned with the increased mental challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have cried many times during training runs," she said. "The mental highs 
and lows of triathlons are very frustrating. You can be singing to yourself, 
feeling great, then 10 seconds later drop into a low and actually break down." 
</P>
<P>
 Proper nutrition during the race is crucial to staying off an emotional roller 
coaster, Ilagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The secret is making sure you replace all the minerals," she said, crediting 
her nutritionist, Dr. Al Garbutt of Burbank. "I take so many supplements I 
couldn't tell you them all. At last year's Ironman I saw athletes needing three 
and four IVs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My nutritionist had me so dialed in all I needed when I finished was a glass 
of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Perrodin also enjoys a glass of water after training, which is a far cry from 
his lifestyle 20 years ago. By his own admission, he drank every night and on 
weekends, smoked three packs a day and had 195 soft pounds on his 5-foot-9 
frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty pudgy, pretty round," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of a neighbor, Stan Block, Perrodin began jogging and changed 
his eating habits. He and Block still run together nearly every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are negative addictions and positive addictions," said Perrodin, who 
weighs 153 pounds. "You might even say that overdoing it with exercise can be 
negative. I've learned to back off. I'll take two to three months of rest after 
(the Ironman)." 
</P>
<P>
 As a 16-year-old Oxnard High student, Sproule set off on her own after her 
parents divorced in 1987. She earned her degree while holding three jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "My paychecks totaled about $25 more than my rent," she said. "I grew up fast. 
And I guess it made me mentally tough. I constantly battle controlling my mind 
during training, and I think my background probably helps me with that." 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer number of private thoughts a triathlete has during eight to 15 hours 
of intense exertion must be astronomical. Focusing those thoughts is a 
challenge as great as preparing the body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think in positive terms," Perrodin said. "I tell myself, 'I'm going 
to win. I will do it.' It's always, I will . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the word 'tough' written on my handlebar. When I'm feeling wimpy I say 
'I'm tough' over and over, like a mantra." 
</P>
<P>
 In pushing her body to its limit, Ilagan knows her mind will be pushed 
somewhere it has been only once: during last year's Ironman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to reaching that mental state, that power point we forget 
about or are not even aware of until we have no choice and must go there to 
find strength," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've been there, darn right you want to go back, as painful as it's 
going to be."

UNION PACIFIC MAKES HOSTILE $3.4-BILLION BID FOR SANTA FE; RAILROADS: TAKEOVER 
TARGET HAD AGREED TO BE BOUGHT BY BURLINGTON NORTHERN, WHICH SAYS THE DEAL IS 
STILL ON TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Union Pacific Corp., jumping into the merger frenzy sweeping the railroad 
industry, launched a hostile $3.4-billion takeover bid Wednesday for Santa Fe 
Pacific Corp., which agreed in July to be bought by Burlington Northern in a 
deal then valued at $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's offer, which would affect railroad competition in California, 
was unveiled late in the day after Santa Fe Pacific's chairman, Robert D. 
Krebs, rebuffed a merger proposal during a meeting earlier Wednesday with Union 
Pacific Chairman Drew Lewis, a former U.S. transportation secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed by your unwillingness to consider our proposal," Lewis 
said in a letter to Krebs attached to Union Pacific's unsolicited bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern Chairman and Chief Executive Gerald Grinstein said in a 
statement that Union Pacific's takeover proposal "is nothing more than an 
attempt to stifle healthy competition in the Western United States" and would 
probably be rejected by government regulators. He said Burlington Northern 
still plans to merge with Santa Fe Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives for Santa Fe Pacific could not immediately be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific offered to buy Santa Fe Pacific by exchanging 0.344 share of its 
stock -- valued at $17.85 a share as of Wednesday -- for each of Santa Fe 
Pacific's shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlington Northern, based in Ft. Worth, likewise had agreed to an exchange of 
stock to buy Schaumburg, Ill.-based Santa Fe Pacific. But the value of 
Burlington Northern's offer, about $14.40 a share when it was announced three 
months ago, has since declined to about $13.30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 All railroad mergers must be approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific said its merger with Santa Fe Pacific would create a railroad 
with 26,371 miles of track, annual sales of $7.4 billion and 43,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burlington Northern-Santa Fe Pacific merger would create the nation's 
largest railroad, with a 33,000-mile system that would stretch from the West to 
the Great Lakes and from Canada to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But after their deal was announced in July, critics -- including the 
California Public Utilities Commission, some electric utilities and certain 
unions -- complained that the deal would reduce railroad competition and 
employment in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific, a Bethlehem, Pa.-based railroad that has a significant presence 
in California, the Pacific Northwest, the Midwest and Texas, asserted that its 
merger deal would alleviate those concerns by providing greater competition in 
the West. 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Fe Pacific accepts its offer, Union Pacific said it is also willing 
to grant certain conditions to Burlington and other railroads "to maintain rail 
competition in the California-Midwest corridor" and other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Union Pacific's bid is only the latest in a series of merger moves by the 
nation's railroads, which are consolidating to cut costs and therefore better 
compete against companies that ship by truck, rail and barge. Also in July, for 
instance, Illinois Central Corp. agreed to buy Kansas City Southern Industries 
Inc.'s rail operation for about $686 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Santa Fe Pacific's stock closed at $12.625 a share, down 
37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Union Pacific's stock 
closed at $51.875, down 37.5 cents, and Burlington Northern finished at 
$49.375, down 62.5 cents.

TREASURY BOND YIELD NEARS 8% IN BROAD SELLOFF; WALL STREET: REPORTS OF SURGING 
ECONOMY SEND INFLATION FEARS UP SHARPLY. SOME ANALYSTS NOW SEE FED RATE HIKE AS 
EARLY AS FRIDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term Treasury bond yields jumped Wednesday to just under 8% -- their 
highest level since May, 1992 -- raising grave new worries about the economy's 
strength and what the Federal Reserve Board might do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest sign that the economy remains on a roll, the government said 
Wednesday that factory orders rose in August at the fastest pace since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The news spurred yet another selloff in the bombed-out bond market, as traders 
immediately assumed that growth is strong enough either to fuel inflation or 
spur the Fed to tighten credit again -- or both. 
</P>
<P>
 The bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield leaped from 7.88% on Tuesday to a 
high of 7.97% during Wednesday's trading, before closing at 7.94%, a 28-month 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts now believe the Treasury bond yield is certain to top 8% soon, a 
level last seen on May 5, 1992. The 8% wall could be breached Friday if the 
government's report on September employment shows faster-than-expected job 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors were rife in the bond market Wednesday that the employment report will 
be robust enough to force another Fed interest rate hike, possibly Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months after the Fed began raising rates to brake consumer and business 
spending, "there is no assurance that the economy has lost any steam," said 
Louis Crandall, economist at bond research firm R.H. Wrightson in New York. 
"The question now is, what does it take to slow this economy down?" 
</P>
<P>
 After the Fed's fifth credit-tightening move, on Aug. 16, bond yields 
stabilized temporarily as Wall Street assumed that short-term rates had risen 
enough to guarantee a waning economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But since mid-September, economic data has increasingly suggested that growth 
remains healthy and that prices of raw materials are rising at a pace that 
could eventually translate into higher consumer inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns have sparked renewed dumping of bonds by loss-ridden investors 
who fear that interest rates, already up more than two percentage points across 
the board from a year ago, are destined to go much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual investors may just have been getting more comfortable with the bond 
market, until the latest selloff began two weeks ago. In a report issued 
Wednesday, mutual fund tracker Lipper Analytical Services noted that most bond 
fund categories eked out positive "total returns" in the third quarter, as 
interest earnings marginally offset the continuing decline in principal values. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the year to date, investors in long-term U.S. government bond mutual 
funds have lost 9% of their principal, on average, as rising market rates have 
devalued older bonds. Even after counting interest earned, investors in 
long-term U.S. government bond funds are out 4.8% of their investment since 
Jan. 1, on average. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian MacKinnon, fixed-income chief at fund giant Vanguard Group in Valley 
Forge, Pa., concedes that he and many of his peers on Wall Street were 
convinced that interest rates were near their top in August, when the 30-year 
T-bond yield was at 7.5%. "Now we don't know where the end is," he said. 
"There's no sign of a slowdown in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 But many experts believe the bond market's biggest problem is simply that 
impatient traders have panicked. Historically, there has been a six- to 
12-month lag between the first Fed credit-tightening moves and bona fide signs 
of slower growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time that interest rates have risen by as much as they have risen during 
1994, growth slowed significantly in the following year," said Donald 
Straszheim, economist at Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, despite the continuing carnage in the bond market as yields surge 
again, many bond pros believe a T-bond yield near 8% -- which translates into 
corporate bonds near 9% -- is a terrific return that will eventually attract a 
horde of new bond buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jack Utter, manager of the IDS Strategy Income bond fund in Minneapolis, 
acknowledges that most potential bond investors are still frozen in place as 
yields continue to rocket. "People are thinking about buying, but they're not 
acting yet," he said. Bonds: Rising Rates, Deepening Losses 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing surge in market interest rates this year has caused deep 
principal losses for bond fund owners. Here are average principal losses and 
total returns (principal loss adjusted for interest earnings) for key bond fund 
categories, Jan. 1 through Sept. 30. Also shown is the 30-year Treasury bond 
yield's monthly closes (except latest). 03,23,21,14 Category Avg. principal

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: CAA BETS ON KAVNER'S MULTIMEDIA MOXIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere out there -- maybe in Silicon Valley, or perhaps in Hollywood -- is 
the Ed Wood of interactive multimedia: an auteur whose digital destiny is to 
produce the CD-ROM equivalent of "Plan 9 From Outer Space." Part of Bob 
Kavner's job today is to make sure Creative Artists Agency doesn't do that 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the sort of creative challenge Kavner faced as AT&T Co.'s 
designated multimedia mogul, but what the heck! There's no business like show 
business. When CAA chief Michael Ovitz made Kavner the agency's multimedia 
maven in June, it was widely -- and rightly -- regarded as a very clever move, 
a strategic coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was a top executive of the world's largest telecommunications company -- 
who spearheaded AT&T's $7-billion acquisition of computer maker NCR and oversaw 
practically every multimedia investment the company made -- coming to a 
Hollywood talent agency that viewed digital technologies as creative media in 
their own right. So what if close scrutiny revealed a curious lack of success 
in AT&T's multimedia portfolio? CAA's high profile would buy instant 
credibility in technology. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a charismatic Michael Ovitz might eloquently articulate a vision of 
tomorrow's entertainment software to CAA's corporate clients, but what does he 
know of ATM and frame relay technologies compared to massively parallel 
multimedia servers? A Kavner type can credibly discuss new-media technology 
trade-offs with the Baby Bells, the TCIs, the Matsushitas and the Microsofts. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in light of where all these new media might be going, a Kavner could 
wield far more influence -- and make far more money -- being CAA's multimedia 
maven than AT&T's multimedia mogul. That's CAA's -- and Kavner's -- gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to this new world, there is no master script," Kavner says. "As 
we represent clients in traditional media, we need to see how we can grow 
existing business into new venues. . . . We are bringing our clients to the 
opportunities that are just beginning in interactive media, and we're bringing 
the interactive media companies in here to explore what we can do with them and 
for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoothly and precisely, Kavner details a few of the ways CAA is now trying to 
restructure the relationships between the technical and creative communities. 
Nothing on any pending deals with the Baby Bells, mind you, but for the 
comparatively tiny CD-ROM development business, Kavner says, 'let's break the 
economic model." Instead of creative talent negotiating for a chunk of the 
revenue, he observes, "let talent become an investor in the business. . . . 
Let's shift the focus from the revenue stream to equity participation." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, CAA will become a strategic media investor for its clients -- 
a radical departure for a talent agency. 
</P>
<P>
 And that loops back to the questions about Kavner's record in running AT&T's 
multimedia business. The answers aren't flattering. If, as the saying goes, 
success has a thousand fathers while failure is an orphan, then Bob Kavner 
could be sued for nonsupport. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in January, for example, Kavner gave the keynote address at the Winter 
Consumer Electronics Show and took that opportunity to demonstrate an AT&T 
venture-funded video game communications product called "The Edge." It was 
supposed to be an example of the phone company's commitment to the consumer 
market. AT&T killed it in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, AT&T announced that it would take somewhere between a $50-million 
to $80-million third-quarter charge for shutting down its Eo unit, a personal 
communicator company that Kavner played an integral role in championing and 
acquiring. Similarly, AT&T was a major supporter of 3DO, a much-hyped video 
game hardware company that has been struggling since its launch more than a 
year ago. AT&T has also had a tough time scaling up its ImagiNation Network, an 
investment it made in the tiny but innovative Sierra Online. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is equally fair to say that AT&T has proved far better at cutting 
checks than adding value to its multimedia investments. On an objective 
financial basis, there are few venture capitalists who envy AT&T's investment 
returns. On relationship terms, there are few multimedia entrepreneurs who are 
still enthusiastic about their AT&T partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Kavner bristles at the criticism. "Only if you believe in long shots would 
those investments have had an impact on AT&T," he fires back, correctly noting 
that he spent only a small portion of his management time on new-media firms. 
"It may have been strategic investments for them, but those were tactical deals 
for us." In other words, it was no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, much of AT&T's multimedia investment difficulties arise from the 
fact that the company was as much, in the words of AT&T Chairman Robert Allen, 
"placing bets" on a broad range of companies as hewing to any particular 
strategic vision. When you mix that with AT&T's massive bureaucracy and 
divisional infighting, you have an institutional recipe for trouble. More often 
than not, Kavner's multimedia shop proved incapable of overcoming those 
barriers.  
</P>
<P>
 But he politely dismisses any suggestion that those barriers played a role in 
his decision to leave AT&T for CAA. 
</P>
<P>
 The core issue here is not AT&T's undeniably spotty investment record in 
multimedia, but what that might imply about CAA's future multimedia 
relationships. It's one thing to get points on a movie; it's quite another to 
own 20% of a company that's worth nothing. No doubt acquiring Kavner gives CAA 
new opportunities to do new kinds of deals. But as Kavner well knows, doing the 
deal is far easier than doing the technology. Unless it cares to repeat AT&T's 
mistakes, CAA and Kavner are going be spending less time doing deals and more 
time implementing them.

TRADE-IT-YOURSELF BANK MACHINES MAKE A DEBUT; SECURITIES: CITIBANK IS FIRST TO 
OFFER FULL-SCALE BROKERAGE SERVICES AT ATM MACHINES. OPTION COMES TO CALIFORNIA 
NEXT MONTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Now there's another reason to stand in line at the automated teller machine: 
to buy and sell stocks without getting a broker's pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Marking a new level of competition in the securities industry, Citibank said 
Wednesday that its brokerage customers in New York, Chicago and Miami can now 
use its automated teller machines to buy and sell stocks, get market values for 
securities and trade shares of the bank's Landmark money market funds. 
California customers will be linked to the brokerage option by the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers will pay the same fees they do when buying stocks other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Citibank, a unit of the nation's largest banking company, Citicorp, said it is 
the first bank to offer full-scale brokerage services on automatic bank 
machines, although both Citicorp and San Francisco-based Wells Fargo have 
allowed customers to use ATMs to buy and sell proprietary mutual funds. Other 
banks have allowed customers to check balances in brokerage accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wells Fargo service isn't getting much use, according to Dudley Nigg, an 
executive vice president who oversees Wells Fargo's ATM system. Wells chose not 
to provide stock quotes and other trading options on the machines because the 
bank was concerned that ATM lines would be clogged with customers checking 
stock prices -- a concern parroted by some analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't want to get in a line behind someone with a large portfolio," Dean 
Witter Reynolds analyst Paul Mackey joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citibank is not concerned. Such problems did not materialize during the 
company's summer pilot program, says Citicorp spokeswoman Maria Rullo. And the 
bank limits customers to 10 stock quotes per day, she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citibank system pivots on specially designed automated teller machines 
that have separate "menus" for banking and brokerage services. Customers who 
want to access their stock account will select a button that says "brokerage 
services: Not FDIC insured." 
</P>
<P>
 The screen offers a choice between information or trading. If you choose to 
trade, the next screen is a full-page of disclosure about stock market risks. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who just want to check stock prices will pull up a picture of a 
typewriter keyboard. By touching the screen, they can type in the name of the 
company or its ticker symbol and get a real-time stock quote or the previous 
day's mutual fund closing price. There is no charge for getting quotes. 
However, customers who choose to trade through the system will pay the same 
brokerage fees that they'd pay if they were doing a transaction in person or 
over the phone.

NME NEEDS AN ICE PACK; HOSPITAL TALKS PUT PRESSURE ON IT TO FIND A MERGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The proposed merger of Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp. and HealthTrust Inc. 
would create a hospital industry behemoth and put more pressure on Santa 
Monica-based National Medical Enterprises to either merge or be acquired. 
</P>
<P>
 If completed, Columbia-HCA's deal would scuttle National Medical's plans for a 
three-way, multibillion-dollar merger with HealthTrust of Nashville, Tenn., and 
Dallas-based American Medical Holdings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a deal, which now appears to have little chance of materializing, would 
give National Medical a presence in some of the nation's best markets and would 
vault it into a near-tie with Columbia as the nation's largest for-profit 
hospital company. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a strategically brilliant acquisition for Columbia, in part because 
it prevents National Medical from completing its hoped-for" merger with 
HealthTrust and American Medical, Lehman Bros. analyst Mimi Willard said 
Wednesday in an investment advisory. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia, which has been gobbling up hospital companies at a furious pace, 
announced its $5.4-billion preliminary agreement with HealthTrust on Tuesday, 
just two weeks after reports of National Medical's merger talks with 
HealthTrust and American Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia-HealthTrust deal forces National Medical Chairman Jeffrey 
Barbakow to go back to the drawing board. Barbakow has said National Medical, 
which operates 33 acute-care hospitals in six states, needs to do something to 
respond to changes in the health care industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to be a fly on the wall at NME today," said Jeff Villwock, analyst 
at Johnson Rice & Co. in New Orleans. "I think Jeff Barbakow probably woke up 
in a surly mood today." 
</P>
<P>
 Villwock speculated that National Medical could become the next target of 
Columbia if that company seeks to become a bigger player in the important 
California market. If it completes the HealthTrust deal, Columbia will own just 
11 hospitals in the state. But other analysts said Columbia's offer for 
HealthTrust reduces the chances that Columbia would be willing to pay a price 
that would be acceptable to National Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 National Medical could still make a counteroffer for HealthTrust, but analysts 
say that scenario is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 More probable, they say, is that National Medical will go looking for another 
merger partner. Two possible partners are American Medical and Ornda 
HealthCorp., a Nashville-based hospital chain with a strong presence in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there another HealthTrust out there on the for-profit side? No," said 
Christi Sulzbach, National Medical's associate general counsel. "But you don't 
necessarily have to do one huge deal. There are other options." 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville, Ky.-based Columbia has engineered one substantial deal after 
another, placing it far ahead of competitors in the consolidation trend 
sweeping the nation's hospital industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia is led by Richard Scott, 41, a hard-driving former health care lawyer 
who co-founded the former Columbia Hospital Corp. for an initial investment of 
$125,000. Just over a year ago, it paid $7.5 billion to acquire HCA-Hospital 
Corp. It has since bought Galen Health Care Inc. for $3.5 billion and Medical 
Care America Inc. for $1.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring HealthTrust, its biggest rival, would increase Columbia-HCA's 
revenue to more than $15 billion and its number of hospitals to 311. The merged 
entity would own nearly 10 times as many hospital and have five times the 
revenue of National Medical. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger would also create competitive woes for scores of hospitals 
in Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, where Columbia-HCA would own a 
total of 169 hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's acquisition binge comes at a time when hospitals and doctors are 
trying to reorganize themselves in more efficient ways in order to drive down 
medical costs. By forming larger networks that provide a range of medical 
services, hospitals and doctors hope to gain leverage in negotiations with 
insurers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With us getting to this size, we can make demands on the people we buy 
supplies from and get the best possible prices and pass them on to the local 
communities we serve," said David Colby, Columbia's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital chain's rapid growth has created concerns among nonprofit 
hospitals that the powerful hospital chain will capture most well-insured 
patients and leave the nonprofits to provide most of the care for the indigent. 
The not-for-profit hospitals are a likely next acquisition target for Columbia, 
analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually it is likely that Columbia buys everyone else," said Todd Richter, 
an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds. "They will continue to build 
market-dominating, low-cost networks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Columbia-HealthTrust merger must receive shareholder approval and 
regulatory clearances. Gina Talamona, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said no 
determination had been made on whether the government will review the deal for 
antitrust issues. National Medical at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia-HCA Healthcare Corp.'s proposal to buy HealthTrust Inc. thwarts one 
proposal by National Medical to expand into more of the nation's markets 
through an acquisition of HealthTrust and puts pressure on the company to 
develop other merger strategies. National Medical has 33 general hospitals in 
California, Texas, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee and Florida. Nearly half of 
them are in California.

 American Express Announces Plans to Cut 6,000 Jobs: American Express Co. also 
said it will shut several operations centers over the next two years as part of 
a massive reorganization of its credit card division. American Express would 
not estimate how much it will save from the downsizing effort.The Wall Street 
Journal reported earlier this week that the cuts will shrink expenses by $500 
million over the next two years. The company will shut three of its six 
operating centers in Phoenix, eliminating 2,000 of the 7,000 jobs there. In 
Florida, the company will close an operations plant in Miami and greatly reduce 
the work processed at a center in Jacksonville. The moves will result in 1,500 
fewer jobs, mostly in Jacksonville.

 Packard Bell Confirms Move to Sacramento: Packard Bell Electronics for the 
first time confirmed publicly that it will move from Westlake Village to the 
Sacramento Army Depot, barring any last-minute complications.The announcement 
came after the Sacramento City Council on Tuesday night, as expected, approved 
a generous $26-million loan package for the computer maker. The move is one 
more in a series of blows to the San Fernando Valley's job base. A Packard Bell 
official said it will begin its search for new employees in Sacramento 
immediately. The firm is not likely to transfer many jobs from the Valley, 
because it gets a $5-million tax break for hiring disadvantaged workers from an 
enterprise zone established in Sacramento.

 Kazarian Says He's Working on Counteroffer for Borden: Investor Paul Kazarian 
said he is preparing a counteroffer to the $2-billion buyout pact Borden Inc. 
reached with the investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. He urged the 
food and consumer products company to quit selling assets.Kazarian told 
Borden's board it appears Borden is selling assets at liquidation prices. 
Continuing the sales could deprive the company of $700 million in revenue, he 
said, and make it harder to finance a rival proposal. In reply, Borden repeated 
earlier assertions that it wants the best deal for shareholders and is prepared 
to work with anyone with a substantive alternative to its buyout agreement. It 
said it is proceeding with a plan to sell small or non-strategic assets.

LEGAL COSTS OF A-12 LAWSUIT SKYROCKETING; COURTS: DEFENSE CONTRACTORS' LAWYERS 
ESTIMATE LITIGATION OVER CANCELED NAVY STEALTH JET COULD HIT $480 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The epic legal battle over the Pentagon's 1991 cancellation of the A-12 attack 
jet program reached a new milestone Wednesday when attorneys estimated that the 
suit's total legal costs have reached $240 million and could hit $480 million 
if the case goes to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimate came during a court hearing from lawyers for McDonnell Douglas 
and General Dynamics, the big defense contractors that filed suit in 1991, 
charging that the Navy illegally canceled the firms' contract to build the A-12 
Stealth attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent legal experts were stunned by the latest estimate, coming amid 
growing concern about the cost of complex business litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Oh my God' is all I can say," said David Weiner, chairman of the American 
Bar Assn.'s litigation section.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the expenses in the A-12 case is the large number of attorneys involved, 
including about 30 for the defense firms and a similar number for the 
government. Every night, dozens of clerks catalogue and file the huge number of 
documents being generated in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Navy earlier this year hired Arnold & Porter, one of the 
largest private law firms in Washington, to provide supplemental legal 
assistance to the Justice Department, including rendering a second opinion on 
whether the government should settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Each side is demanding payment of about $2 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The projected $480-million legal tab is based on the Justice Department's 
proposal that the trial not start until 1998. At the hearing Wednesday before 
Claims Court Judge Robert Hodges, department attorney Mary Mitchelson said her 
team will not be prepared for trial until four years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges did not make an immediate ruling on the trial date, but he indicated he 
was not likely to accept 1998. "My inclination is to speed things up here, go 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Herbert Fenster, the attorney representing General Dynamics, said the expense 
of conducting another four years of legal skirmishes would be "crushing," and 
he asked the judge to start the trial next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The $480-million estimate includes direct legal expenses but not fees for a 
variety of outside services. In addition to the legal expenses, the losing side 
would have to pay back interest on any damages, which thus far would total 
about $360 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Another four years of litigation would double that interest expense, and a 
one-year trial would add another $100 million to the legal tab, Fenster said. 
In total, the legal expenses and the interest costs would reach $1.3 billion, 
in addition to actual damages, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is in the government's interest to delay this case," Fenster said. "It is 
not in our interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Fenster cited the Justice Department's own reports to Congress that indicated 
it expected the trial to begin next year, and he said a trial next year would 
come as no surprise to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mitchelson said such a schedule would hobble the government's defense. She 
said the government has to conduct depositions and sift through 33 million 
documents for possible evidence.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; STOCKS RETREAT BROADLY ON ECONOMIC NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Stocks suffered another broad setback Wednesday as soaring interest rates 
continued to unnerve investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average fell 13.79 points to 3,787.34, though it recovered 
from an early plunge of 50 points that triggered the New York Stock Exchange's 
"collar" on computerized trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The final damage was much worse in the overall market. Losers overwhelmed 
gainers by 3 to 1 on the NYSE, and all broad indexes finished down -- though 
well above their lows for the day. Big Board trading was heavy, with 360 
million shares changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The market's tenor was poor from the start, after the Commerce Department said 
factory orders soared 4.4% in August, the biggest gain in nearly two years.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow, which slumped 45.76 points Tuesday, immediately nose-dived at the 
opening bell, as bond yields rocketed. 
</P>
<P>
 While strong economic reports would seem to be good news for corporate 
profits, the factory-orders report and other recent signs of U.S. economic 
expansion are causing fear and loathing on Wall Street, said James Solloway, 
research director at Argus Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are worried that the robust economy is raising inflation fears at 
the Federal Reserve Board and that the central bank will soon counter the 
threat by lifting interest rates for the sixth time this year to slow the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation is widespread that the Fed's next rate hike could come as early as 
Friday, when the government issues September employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, when asked about that prospect, declined to 
advise the independent Fed on what action to take. But he indicated that a key 
component of inflation -- workers' wage increases -- might give the central 
bank cause to re-evaluate the inflation threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said in a telephone interview that "wage increases have been extremely 
modest" this year and that because "labor costs comprise two-thirds of average 
business costs . . . this is not the environment in which I would expect 
accelerating inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the Dow industrial average has dropped 166 points, or 4.2%, since 
Sept. 15 as investors' concerns about higher interest rates have mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said it wasn't clear if some single event sparked bargain hunting at 
midday Wednesday. But some noted that many technology stocks rebounded as 
takeover rumors boosted Apple Computer's stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Anticipation of higher rates hurt many economically sensitive issues. 
Caterpillar fell 7/8 to 53 1/4, Alcoa dropped 1 3/4 to 82 3/4, Scott Paper 
slumped 1 5/8 to 59 7/8, CBI Industries plunged 3 7/8 to 23 1/4 and Quanex sank 
1 3/8 to 24 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 But auto stocks rallied. Chrysler gained 1 1/8 to 45 1/8, GM added 1/2 to 45 
5/8 and Ford gained 1/2 to 27 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airline and rail stocks were dumped. UAL, parent of United Airlines, fell 1 
1/2 to 84 1/2, Delta lost 7/8 to 44 and CSX sank 1 1/2 to 65 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, Apple surged 4 1/8 to 37 7/8 on takeover rumors. Other 
tech winners included Intel, up 3/4 to 58 3/4; Compaq, up 5/8 to 32 1/4; Dell 
Computer, up 2 1/2 to 38 7/8, and IBM, up 3/4 to 69 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index tumbled 45.5 points to 2,956.3, its lowest 
since early July. Frankfurt's DAX index dropped 26.23 points to 1,968.72. In 
Mexico City, the Bolsa index gave up 28.63 points to 2,641.39. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Tokyo the Nikkei average rose 182.94 points to 19,751.55.

 GE Says It Probably Won't Sell NBC: Jay Ireland, corporate investor 
communications director for General Electric Co., said options remain open but 
that the company is committed to its NBC broadcasting unit and a sale is 
unlikely. Asked about published reports that General Electric has been trying 
to sell NBC, Ireland, in Houston to give a speech to security analysts, said: 
"Is (a sale) a probable option with NBC? Probably not."Of the broadcast 
network, Ireland said: "We're committed to that business. We like it. It 
generates $300 to $400 million a year in cash (and) $200 to $300 million of 
operating earnings. There's no sense getting rid of it just to get rid of it, 
because we don't need the cash."

LAWMAKERS BACK FCC'S PLAN TO FAVOR 3 FIRMS IN AUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to choke off 11th-hour objections to a license auction plan that would 
help pay for global trade legislation, lawmakers met Wednesday to blast Pacific 
Bell and other critics for calling the proposal a "billion-dollar giveaway" in 
the telecommunications arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The bickering stems from a little-known provision in the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade that would give three media companies that developed a new 
mobile telephone technology a substantial discount on government licenses 
needed to offer the service. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, the Federal Communications Commission agreed to give the three 
"pioneer" firms free licenses to serve markets in Los Angeles, New York and 
Washington, but it backed down after several members of Congress objected. The 
FCC then proposed to give them discounts of about 10%, but the GATT provisions 
would sweeten that to as much as 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entrepreneurs, meanwhile, are expected to pay hundreds of millions of 
dollars for the mobile licenses when they are auctioned to the highest bidder 
by the FCC later this year. At least $400 million of the auction proceeds are 
earmarked to pay for implementation of the GATT treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, including Pacific Bell and Texas businessman Ross Perot, have 
launched a blistering attack on the discounts won by the three companies: 
American Personal Communications, which is 70%-owned by Washington Post Co.; 
Cox Enterprises Inc., and Omnipoint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In full-page newspaper ads this week, for example, Pacific Bell termed the 
discounts a "billion-dollar giveaway." 
</P>
<P>
 But the barrage of criticism apparently swayed few lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward J. Markey, the Massachusetts Democrat who chairs the House subcommittee 
on telecommunications and finance, said critics are simply "using this one 
provision as a means to derail the larger (GATT) legislation."

RUMOR OF A SUITOR RIPENS APPLE STOCK; COMPUTERS: SPECULATION THAT MOTOROLA MAY 
ATTEMPT TO TAKE OVER THE COMPANY SENDS SHARES SOARING 12%. BUT SOME SEE AN 
EQUITY INVESTMENT INSTEAD OF A BUYOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock of Apple Computer Inc. soared 12% on Wednesday on speculation that 
the company will be the subject of a takeover attempt by Motorola Inc., its 
partner in the PowerPC chip venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite official and somewhat surly "no comments" from both companies, 
investors bid up the price of Apple stock by $4.125 a share to $37.875 on 
Nasdaq, with 6.3 million shares changing hands. Motorola stock fell $1 to $50 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeover speculation boiled over after Motorola, based in the Chicago suburb 
of Schaumburg, disclosed plans to build a low-cost line of desktop computer 
systems, including personal computers, to boost demand for its flashy PowerPC 
microprocessor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Motorola supplies the chips for Apple's fledgling Power 
Macintosh computers -- and that it wants to become a PC manufacturer itself -- 
apparently led some stock traders to conclude that Motorola might buy Apple to 
gain an instant foothold. 
</P>
<P>
 Another scenario has Motorola making an equity investment in Apple and gaining 
a license to build "clones" of the Power Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 Several industry analysts said they doubt a takeover is likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make that much sense to me," said Bruce Lupatkin, research 
director at Hambrecht & Quist, a San Francisco investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Lupatkin said, Apple appears to have turned itself around after 
a couple of rocky years, and "I'm not sure they need a marriage partner." And 
for Motorola, he noted, there would be cheaper ways of getting into the PC 
manufacturing business, given that a strategic buyer would be forced to pay 
upward of $8 billion for Apple, by his estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupatkin expects Apple to report soon that earnings in its fourth quarter, 
which ended last month, reached 65 cents a share on $2.3 billion in sales. That 
would contrast with a profit of 2 cents a share on sales of $2.1 billion in the 
same period the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Pieter Hartsook, publisher of a Macintosh market newsletter in Alameda, agreed 
that Apple would frown on the idea of becoming another company's wholly owned 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he noted that Motorola would logically be one of a handful of 
companies to license Apple's computing technology and produce clones. Last 
month, Apple announced long-awaited plans to stop hoarding its technology and 
let others produce Macs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apple needs a large, U.S.-based multinational corporation to announce as a 
licensee," Hartsook said, adding that having a stronger strategic relationship 
"makes an awful lot of sense." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Motorola has become one of the nation's most successful 
technology companies, with a strong presence in the computer chip business and 
a dominant position in cellular telephone equipment and pagers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wall Street frothed last year with speculation about an Apple takeover, 
AT&T was the rumored buyer. But AT&T's announcement of a megamerger with McCaw 
Cellular served to squelch most of those rumors. Even so, in the trading frenzy 
Wednesday, AT&T's name resurfaced as a possible suitor, although few analysts 
took that prospect seriously.

AUGUST GAIN IN FACTORY ORDERS SPARKS INTEREST RATE WORRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Factory orders and shipments surged at the fastest rate in nearly two years 
during August, fanning fears that a booming economy will soon force interest 
rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said Wednesday that factory orders, which help measure 
future production, rose 4.4% in August, the biggest increase since they rose 
5.6% in December, 1992. Orders fell 2% in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipments, a measure of current production, did even better. They increased 
4.5%, their best showing in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a lot stronger than expected. It's more evidence that manufacturing 
is strong. We can't dismiss it as a fluke," said economist Carl Palash of MCM 
Moneywatch in New York City. "The Federal Reserve is going to have to tighten 
credit one or two more times this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Factory orders have risen 11 times in the past 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
 They were expected to improve in August as auto makers reopened plants after 
closing for two weeks in July to retool for 1995 models. 
</P>
<P>
 But the August surge was broad-based, with orders for non-durable goods such 
as food, fuel and clothing climbing 2.5%, the 10th straight gain and the 
largest since August, 1990. Orders increased in all major industries except 
leather goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Assn. of Manufacturers, insisted 
the gains were moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturing orders continue at a healthy pace that should yield growth of 
2.5% in the third quarter," he said. "These numbers are not too strong and not 
too weak. We have the capacity for 3% growth without inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 The gross domestic product, which measures the total value of goods and 
services produced in the United States, increased at an annual rate of 4.1% in 
the second quarter, after a 3.3% rise in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve Board is looking for slower acceleration, analysts say, 
and is now practically certain to increase short-term interest rates by another 
half percentage point no later than Nov. 15, when central bank policy-makers 
next meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has boosted rates five times since February, most recently on Aug. 16, 
when it pushed the rates that banks charge each other for overnight loans to 
4.75%. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the volatile transportation component, factory orders rose 2.4% in 
August, the biggest increase since they were up 3.2% in December, 1992. 
Excluding military equipment, orders rose 4.4%, matching the overall gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders for both durable and non-durable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted 
$286.5 billion, up from $274.3 billion in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlog of unfilled orders declined 0.3% in August. Factory Orders

 U.S. Moves Toward Resuming Phone Links With Cuba: The State Department has 
cleared the way for the move, spokesman Mike McCurry said, adding that the 
department has advised the Federal Communications Commission that it no longer 
objects to re-establishing telecommunications links that were suspended three 
decades ago as part of economic sanctions.The FCC is expected to grant 
permission for the links soon. McCurry said Cuba's state-owned telephone 
company had wanted to impose a surcharge of $4.85 for every collect call. The 
State Department had objected because surcharges in the rest of the Caribbean 
are about $1 a call. Cuba has since agreed to collect $1 a call.

 California Energy's Magma Offer Criticized: Magma Power Co.'s largest 
shareholder, Dow Chemical Co., said California Energy Co.'s tender offer to 
acquire 51% of Magma Power for $35 a share undervalues the developer of 
geothermal energy sources and isn't fair to all shareholders. Dow commented 
after California Energy of Omaha said it would commence a cash tender offer 
today for 51% of Magma Power's stock, at a price of $35 per share.California 
Energy said the offer is the first step toward implementing its proposal made 
Sept. 19 to acquire all of San Diego-based Magma Power for a combination $25 a 
share in cash and $10 in California Energy stock. On Monday, Magma Power 
adopted a "poison pill" rights plan and filed a lawsuit in a Nevada court in 
bids to thwart the takeover.

 Mobil Reorganizes International Units: The Fairfax, Va., oil company said the 
move will realign its worldwide refining, marketing and trade activities into 
three regional units: the Americas, the Pacific Rim, and Europe and Africa.Its 
existing Middle East and Marine Transportation unit, which oversees about a 
dozen joint ventures, will not be affected. The operations included in the 
three new regions currently are managed by Thomas C. DeLoach, executive vice 
president for international marketing and refining, who was named chief 
financial officer for Mobil Oil Corp. last month. DeLoach's post will be 
eliminated and his duties assumed by other three executives.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; THE FUTURE? HOTEL ROOM AS 
INTERACTIVE CONTROL CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Business travelers are increasingly being exposed to a fast-growing group of 
interactive video technologies designed for the hotel room, all usable without 
any need for a laptop. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, hotel television sets have been used to speed up checkouts or 
deliver scheduled pay-per-view movies. On-demand movie systems, which offer a 
much larger selection of films whenever the guest wants one, have become 
increasingly available in the last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Now companies have begun to test a new group of services, such as pay-per-hour 
video games, printouts of faxes, local maps and restaurant coupons -- all 
initiated from the room and accessed through the television set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hotels are leading the way in this because we have a greater opportunity to 
test-market the technology," said Kirk Posmantur, vice president of the 
Washington-based American Hotel & Motel Assn. Also driving innovation is the 
financial success of pay-per-view movies in hotels and motels. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the newest services, for example, is delivering video games to guests.  
</P>
<P>
 LodgeNet Entertainment Corp., a South Dakota-based provider of pay-per-view 
and other in-room television systems, has a system called On Demand that allows 
guests to play "Super Nintendo" -- even against people in other rooms -- using 
a hand-held controller hooked to the television. 
</P>
<P>
 On Demand provides two-way, high-speed digital communications that allow the 
TV set to act as a remote computer terminal hooked to a large mainframe system, 
said Tim Flynn, chief executive of LodgeNet. "Anything you can do on a 
multimedia computer at home you can do through interactive video in a hotel," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the company is first using the system to deliver video games, it can 
also be used to deliver a host of different information services, such as 
interactive yellow pages, infomercials or specialized conference information on 
demand, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company began testing the interactive games about a year ago and now has 
systems running in 40,000 rooms. It is adding from 3,000 to 5,000 rooms a month 
to its network, Flynn said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Business travelers don't use the video games as much as the younger market, 
but they use them far more than we thought they would," he said. It costs an 
average of $4.95 an hour to play video games, compared to the $7 to $9 for 
pay-per-view.  
</P>
<P>
 Other companies are using interactive video systems to introduce different 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Comsat Video Enterprises in Maryland, for example, is rolling out a new 
interactive visitors guide called CityKey developed by US West. The interactive 
service is delivered through Comsat's On Command Video system, already in about 
370,000 rooms. CityKey is now available in 12,000 rooms in Orlando and about 
5,000 rooms in San Francisco, Comsat spokesman Paul Jacobson said. In addition, 
at the Santa Clara, Calif., Marriott, Comsat is testing an interactive yellow 
pages program called InfoTravel that was developed by Bell Atlantic Directory 
Services. 
</P>
<P>
 CityKey and InfoTravel are interactive video directories that feature 
information on local attractions, restaurants, shopping and other services that 
allow guests to plan their itineraries, Jacobson said. Within a few months, 
guests will also be able to print maps and coupons and make restaurant 
reservations using a centralized printer at the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, LodgeNet is experimenting with putting printers directly in guest 
rooms at the Sheraton Hotel in New Orleans, Flynn said. The printers not only 
allow guests to print maps and coupons, they also let them print their room 
bills and check out without ever going to the front desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Comsat's Jacobson said his firm is using a printer at the front desk because 
if guests want to print maps or coupons from their room, it usually means they 
are on their way out and can swing by the front desk to pick them up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hotels now allow guests to view their bills on their television screens, 
but if you are a business traveler who needs to produce a receipt for your 
expense report, you still have to go to the front desk for a copy of the bill, 
Flynn said. Printing the bill in the room saves that extra step. 
</P>
<P>
 The interactive video industry is still so new that providers are trying to 
find out what services guests want most, Flynn said. In the future, for 
example, guests will be able to browse through a video mall and do a little 
cyber-shopping by ordering theater tickets or catalogue merchandise from their 
rooms. Other applications might include specialized training programs for 
guests attending conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for in-room entertainment providers will be to deliver these new 
interactive capabilities through systems already in place. The three main 
providers of in-room entertainment systems -- LodgeNet, Spectradyne Inc. and 
Comsat -- have millions of dollars invested in such systems, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While applications of interactive video in theory are limited only by the 
imagination, the application that has proven most popular so far is the 
on-demand movie, Jacobson said. Even five years ago, if you wanted to watch a 
movie in the room, you had to choose from only a handful, and you watch them at 
scheduled times. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed with the advent of on-demand movies about three years ago. 
Now, in rooms with interactive capability, you can choose from a menu of 
hundreds of movies and watch them whenever you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 300,000 and 400,000 guest rooms now offer on-demand movies. For hotels 
that offer the service, it has increased room revenue by about 35%, Flynn said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 With on-demand movies blazing the way, advertisers are just beginning to 
recognize the power of merchandising to the hotel guest marketplace through 
interactive television, he said. For every 100,000 rooms with an interactive 
video system, advertisers could potentially reach 14 million different 
consumers.

 Nigeria Raises Gasoline Prices More Than 300%: Buses and cars stayed off the 
roads and thousands of commuters walked miles to work in Nigeria to avoid 
paying the staggering increase. The nation's military government set gasoline 
prices at 11 naira, or 50 cents, a liter, down from 68 cents on Monday but 
still more than three times as much as last week's price of 14.5 cents.The fuel 
price increase, which critics say is a response to pressure from the 
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, pushed up prices for food and 
transport as much as 200%, confirming fears that the higher price will boost 
inflation that is already punishing Nigeria's 90 million people. Military ruler 
Gen. Sani Abacha said the government had to cut the fuel subsidy. Nigeria is 
"floundering in the throes of a situation whereby we spend 65% of our total 
revenue on recurrent government expenditure, while 30% goes to service our 
debts," said Abacha, who is also facing a political crisis over the military 
overriding election results.

BRIEFING BOOK / CHRIS KRAUL: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; RAIL PRIVATIZATION IN 
ARGENTINA HELPS FUEL ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ISSUE: Argentina provides an object lesson in the costs and rewards of 
privatization. Since President Carlos Saul Menem assumed power in 1990, the 
Argentine government has transferred many state-owned businesses to the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Though painful in causing thousands of layoffs, the privatizations -- and the 
elimination of huge government subsidies of the respective industries -- have 
been major contributors to Argentina's economic recovery. Inflation, for 
example, has dropped from an annual rate of 5,000% in 1989 to 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The privatization of Argentina's rail system provides a striking example of 
the sacrifices and rewards for the government. It also shows the opportunities 
for foreigners to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 BACKGROUND: When the Menem government took power, the railroad system -- 
nationalized in 1947 by dictator Juan Peron -- was a shambles. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Pia, Argentina's national railroad commission president, said recently 
that the system deteriorated steadily over the years because of a lack of 
maintenance and investment, and in 1989 only one of every two locomotives 
worked and more than half the track was deemed unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 With about 210,000 employees, the railroad had more than twice as many 
employees as it needed to operate efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The railroad had become a highly politicized make-work institution that was 
viewed more as a source of employment than a means of transportation," said 
John A. Kirchner, professor of geography and transportation at California State 
University, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing about $2 million a day in 1989, "the railroad system was on the point 
of collapse," Pia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came in 1989 when the Argentine legislature agreed to allow 
the government to grant concessions to private companies to operate various 
government-controlled operations, without selling them outright. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon thereafter, Argentina's powerful labor unions also agreed to give up 
power and jobs as industries were privatized, a sign of how the nation as a 
whole had become persuaded that the private sector could do a better job 
offering services than the state could, Pia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first there was resistance, but later the government convinced people that 
a phenomenal transformation was the only answer," Pia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government saves $1 billion a year on the rail system, Pia said, and the 
privatization process has accelerated since Menem assumed power. The state-run 
Aerolineas Argentinas airline and the railroads, ports, power companies and 
telephone utilities have all been, or are in the process, of being privatized. 
</P>
<P>
 OUTLOOK: Argentine officials say it may take 30 years for its railroads to 
achieve full modernization. But savings from huge payroll cuts could help 
finance improvements. The work force is down to 80,000, Pia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other immediate impacts of privatization was a reduction in service. 
About 70% of Argentina's passenger service has been eliminated since the 
federal government turned over responsibility for the financing of deficits of 
all passenger lines to the Argentine provinces.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Argentine privatization is looked on by many as a model process. 
Pia recently was invited to Egypt and Albania to consult those governments now 
considering similar divestitures. 
</P>
<P>
 STRATEGY: U.S. companies already participate in the railroad privatization. 
New private owners of the divided rail system hired operators such as U.S. 
railroads Conrail, Burlington Northern, Iowa Interstate and Anacostia & Pacific 
to manage their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nation needs massive foreign investment to modernize transportation at 
a pace equal to its growing economy, said Argentina's subsecretary for 
transportation, Raul Ercole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came here to admit we were on the wrong road before but that we have 
resolved many problems and that we are serious about restructuring our 
economy," Pia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing economic improvement, analysts say, will provide confidence to 
foreign investors interested in helping Argentina fulfill its transportation 
needs, including financing the improvement of seaports and airports.

 Russian Ruble Plummets to Record Low: The ruble fell to 2,808 to the dollar, 
from 2,668 on Tuesday, as dollar purchases grew and the Central Bank refused to 
prop up the ruble. In the past month, the ruble has dropped 26.8% in value 
against the dollar. A free fall of the ruble could endanger Russia's 
free-market reforms, scaring off foreign investors, further squeezing citizens 
who rely heavily on imported goods and increasing the risks of a recession. 
Wednesday's 140-point drop was the third steep one-day dive in the past two 
weeks.

 MEXICAN STOCKS

 * Mexico's Bolsa index plummeted for the third day, reaching its lowest level 
in seven weeks amid dual concerns that last week's assassination of a ruling 
party leader and higher interest rates will dampen economic growth and crimp 
company earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brakes on market growth might come from interest rate pressure in the United 
States and Mexico, analysts say.The Federal Reserve Board might raise rates 
when it meets in November in a bid to abate inflation. Some believe such a move 
would attract capital away from Mexico and squeeze stock prices. In Mexico, 
rates are expected to move laterally between 12% and 13.5% through the end of 
the year.

BRIEFCASE: FINANCE; SETTLEMENT HIKES TO $1.5 BILLION THE COST TO TAXPAYERS OF 
BEVERLY HILLS SAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The settlement of a government IOU last week brought the total taxpayer cost 
of covering the losses at Beverly Hills Savings & Loan to $1.5 billion, making 
it one of the more expensive thrift failures in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs included an $811.5-million note that the government paid off with 
interest last week to make up the difference between the thrift's debts at the 
time of the sale in 1988 and its loans and other assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the expense was attributed to the government's agreement to cover 
losses on the sales of bad loans, sour investments, property seized in 
foreclosure and other money-losing assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators had sold the S & L, which had moved its headquarters to Mission 
Viejo before its 1985 collapse, to Michigan National Corp. The Detroit-area 
banking company renamed it Independence One Bank of California and planned to 
convert it to a commercial bank. But the company said earlier this week that it 
will instead sell the now-healthy thrift within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's most expensive thrift failures are American Savings & Loan and 
Lincoln Savings & Loan, both defunct Irvine institutions that are expected to 
cost taxpayers $5.4 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Independence One has been one of the county's healthier thrifts with $645.7 
million in loans and other assets and $1.9 million in earnings for the first 
six months of this year.

JUDGE ORDERS NEWPORT IMPORTS TO BE LIQUIDATED; COURTS: THE LUXURY CAR 
DEALERSHIP CLOSES AFTER MISSING A PAYMENT DUE AS PART OF ITS REORGANIZATION 
PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A bankruptcy judge Wednesday ordered the liquidation of Newport Imports, once 
one of Orange County's most exclusive dealers of exotic luxury cars like 
Ferraris, Aston Martins and Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John J. Wilson ordered that parent company Lee West Enterprises, 
operator of Newport Imports, be liquidated under Chapter 7 of the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Code, said a lawyer involved in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership, nestled among the yacht brokers and swank restaurants of Coast 
Highway in Newport Beach, was closed late Monday after a receiver was named at 
the behest of the property's primary creditor, Tokai Credit Corp., said Lee 
West Enterprises' lawyer, Todd C. Ringstad. 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Leland West could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Newport Imports employees lost their jobs in the sudden closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringstad said he did not contest liquidation of the dealership, which had been 
operating since September, 1992, under bankruptcy court protection. Tokai moved 
to have a receiver appointed, he said, after Lee West Enterprises missed the 
deadline for a payment called for under terms of its Chapter 11 reorganization 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Tokai did not grant any additional time, it was clear we would not be 
able to reorganize," Ringstad said Wednesday. "Everyone was really pulling for 
Newport Imports. We really wanted to see this reorganization." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not know the amount of the payment that was missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents included with Lee West Enterprises' initial bankruptcy filing stated 
that Tokai was owed $8 million for land and the buildings that made up the car 
dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringstad said Tokai has taken all the cars that had been for sale at the 
dealership except for its collection of Jaguars. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real tragedy. It was a real landmark for Newport Beach," Ringstad 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Newport Imports had been badly shaken by the recession, a new line of 
Jaguars had revved up sales, he said. "The dealership had just had the best 
weekend in three years," he said. "Things were looking up." 
</P>
<P>
 The British-made luxury car sells for prices starting at $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Imports was one of the nation's largest Jaguar dealers, said Joseph W. 
Hernandez, a Jaguar district sales manager. In the boom years of the 1980s, he 
said, Newport Imports sold 500 or more Jaguars a year. 
</P>
<P>
 He, too, said the dealership's sales had been increasing recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was at Newport Imports on Wednesday afternoon to make sure that 
customers who had left their cars for service could pick them up. Some former 
employees also stopped by. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, dressed in a green Jaguar golf shirt, was June Armstrong, who 
said she had worked for the dealership as a clerk. The business, she said, "was 
very special. The people here all worked together."

 Doubling in Size: Frank Robitaille said he believes in controlled growth -- 
the kind that can double the size of a company in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 His insurance agency, Armstrong Robitaille Insurance Services in Tustin, has 
acquired its ninth Orange County firm since 1989 and is moving into the ranks 
of a regional organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The company acquired Perricone Insurance Agency in Newport Beach last month, 
picking up seven employees and a solid business writing various policies for 
companies in the food industry. 
</P>
<P>
 With up to 80 employees and $50 million in premiums expected this year, he 
said, Armstrong Robitaille has doubled its size in five years and plans to 
double its size again by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like controlled growth," said Robitaille, the agency's president. "All the 
acquisitions have been small operations that were easy to assimilate." 
</P>
<P>
 Future growth, though, is likely to be in other states. The agency recently 
opened an office in Ann Arbor, Mich., to serve the metal finishing and 
electroplating industry in the Midwest and East.

PRIVATE EYES KEEPING WATCH OVER BABY-SITTERS; CHILD CARE: INVESTIGATORS ARE 
RUNNING BACKGROUND CHECKS TO UNCOVER DEBTS, SHADY PASTS AND UNDESIRABLE 
QUALITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The young parents knew something was amiss: Since they hired a new baby-sitter 
two months earlier, their toddler suffered recurring diaper rash and their 
telephone bills were unusually high. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a tiny camera concealed in a kitchen light, their suspicions 
were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sitter was on the phone 95% of the day. She didn't even take a break when 
feeding the little girl," said New York private detective Joseph Cialone, who 
exposed the neglectful nanny on video. 
</P>
<P>
 Private investigator Nicholas Beltrante, of Alexandria, Va., got the goods on 
another sitter before his clients had a chance to hire her. A background check 
revealed two out-of-state theft convictions, including a break-in at the home 
of a past employer. 
</P>
<P>
 While most child-care providers are trustworthy, with clean records, some 
conceal undesirable qualities or shadier pasts that make them unsuitable for 
many lines of work, most of all watching children. A growing number of nervous 
parents are hiring professional investigators like Cialone and Beltrante to 
weed out potential Nannies from Hell from the Mary Poppinses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a building trend . . . (that) began about seven or eight years ago," 
said Ralph Thomas, executive director of the National Assn. of Investigative 
Specialists in Austin, Tex. "All you have to do is sit down and read the 
newspaper and see the horror stories. It makes people think." 
</P>
<P>
 A random sampling of private investigators shows that more have been devoting 
part of their practices to investigating child-care providers in recent years. 
At the same time, businesses have cropped up to help working parents make the 
right baby-sitting choices or to keep tabs on sitters after they are hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltrante said he's handling about 25% more child-care cases this year than 
last and expects even more next year. Many of his clients are working parents 
employed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing demographics are partly responsible for this growing business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, you were able to leave your children with your mother, or a sister 
or an aunt, but many people don't have extended families they can count on. 
There are also more working mothers," said Cialone, whose Flushing, N.Y. agency 
I on U Inc. gets several dozen child-care cases a year. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, 55% of women with children age 6 and under are in the work force 
today and most rely on outsiders to watch their kids. Only 20% use relatives, 
statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more people looking for nannies than there are nannies available," 
said Dana Friedman, co-president of the Families and Work Institute, a New 
York-based nonprofit research firm. "Most (nanny) agencies don't do a good job 
screening . . . because most of them are just looking for warm bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Sachs, president of the International Nanny Assn. in Norfolk, Neb., and 
owner of the placement agency Philadelphia Nanny Network Inc., said the 
professional group has a list of recommended practices for nanny agencies to 
follow, but it has no policing authority. She acknowledged that some agencies 
do a better job of screening applicants than others. 
</P>
<P>
 She advised parents, "One factor you should consider is the (agency's) fee. 
You have to realize you're going to get what you pay for." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean the better agency is the higher-priced agency . . . but it is 
a factor to consider." 
</P>
<P>
 Sachs said her nanny agency typically uncovers a criminal record in less than 
1% of the applicants it screens and a bad driving record in about 2%. 
</P>
<P>
 What most independent investigative services promise is a thorough screening 
of job applicants within a week, including a verification of their identity and 
checks of their criminal background, driving record and credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 Such information doesn't come cheap. Flat fees for most private investigators 
run between $250 and $500, according to Thomas. Expect to pay more, usually 
between $50 and $65 per hour, if results must be expedited or if other 
information needs to be checked out, like references or multi-state court 
records, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most require permission from the person being investigated, although some 
admit to having run checks without it. 
</P>
<P>
 The ChildCare Registry Inc., based in Danville, Calif., charges $140 for a 
pre-employment screening that uses a New Jersey private investigator to check a 
candidate's criminal, civil and driving records along with his or her 
educational background. 
</P>
<P>
 Many professional nannies also order checks of themselves and keep updated 
copies on file for future employment references, said Ellen Tauscher, a former 
Wall Street investment banker who founded ChildCare Registry two years ago. 
Tauscher said business is brisk, with an average 450 inquiries a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Another service, Detective Information Network in Annandale, Va., offers a 
telephone hot line that tells callers where they can get the same information 
that private investigators get. The cost is $3.99 per minute, with each call 
averaging six minutes; DIN also can do the investigating for you for around 
$100. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of this is public information anyway," with the exception of credit 
reports, and even those can be accessed with an individual's permission, said 
co-owner Frank Dillon, a former Air Force spy who started the company in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon noted that half the states have centralized police data bases that can 
be publicly accessed, while all states maintain computerized records of motor 
vehicle violations. County courthouses will also keep records of criminal and 
civil cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Department of Law Enforcement, for example, can say if someone has 
ever been convicted of a crime in that state. The Illinois Department of Motor 
Vehicles keeps records of moving violations for four years, license suspensions 
for seven and drunken driving convictions indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of privacy concerns, private citizens and most businesses don't have 
legal access to the most comprehensive criminal records, compiled by the U.S. 
Department of Justice and maintained by the National Crime Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other limits. While job applicants may come up clean in one county 
or state, their records might be overlooked elsewhere if they failed to mention 
they had moved. That includes arrests during vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, arrest records of their spouses or live-in companions would not be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a 50-state patchwork quilt and it's a mess," Tauscher said. "The sad 
thing is parents can't do all this checking. Many are financially strapped as 
well as time-strapped." 
</P>
<P>
 She noted, too, that many families make their baby-sitting arrangements off 
the books to avoid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since no single source of information is fail-safe, the best way to get an 
accurate picture of someone's background is by cross-checking information to 
ensure one source does not contradict another, said Bob Brown, an Orlando, 
Fla., private investigator who also runs a small chain of U Spy Stores, selling 
items like custom-made diaper bag cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 A credit report, for instance, will not only show if someone has mounting 
debts but also can point out omissions of former residences or employers, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also do a lot of independent checking," Brown said. "You give me a 
reference, I may go to that house or their neighbors' or relatives' house." 
</P>
<P>
 All the checking in the world, however, won't guarantee there won't be future 
problems between the sitter and employer-family. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, of the Families and Work Institute, remembers one unfortunate 
incident involving a friend and a young nanny she had hired. Despite extensive 
checks on the young woman, she was sent away within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (the employer) stumbled on her diary and discovered she was in love with 
her husband and wanted to kill her," Friedman said.

THE PRICE OF PEP; STRIPES, SEQUINS, FINE FABRICS. TODAY'S CHEERLEADER WARDROBES 
INSPIRE COPYING BY DESIGNERS -- AND COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Let's hear it for the T-E-A-M! 
</P>
<P>
 No, not the hunks on the field but those girls (and, occasionally, guys) who 
cheer, dance and drill-thrill the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The hours. The practicing. The splits. The yells. And those costumes. These 
days, uniforms have so much oomph and cost so much moola they are fuel for 
fashion designers -- and fodder for lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-piece wardrobe, totaling nearly $1,000, was required when Heather Delaney 
made the varsity cheer squad last year at Newport Harbor High School in Newport 
Beach. Delaney and her parents have sued the school district and several 
administrators, alleging illegal charges for uniforms, transportation and other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by televised competitions that have pushed the activity to new 
heights, pep squads are expensive fashion enclaves. Nothing, from their shoes 
(made with special grooves) to their perfect ponytails (think hairpieces), is 
left to chance or penny-ante expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Big on spirit this fall, fashion houses -- from funky Anna Sui to conservative 
Esprit -- are showing chic renditions of pleated skirts, striped cropped tops, 
football jerseys and varsity jackets. Sui even throws in pompon accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis, Tenn.-based Varsity Spirit Fashions, the nation's largest 
manufacturer of pep paraphernalia, is expected to gross $38 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cheered in high buckle shoes with leather soles and rubber heels," says 
Kline Boyd, Varsity Spirit general manager, who was a cheerleader 23 years ago. 
"Now you have companies like Nike designing shoes specifically for 
cheerleading." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovations include active-wear fabrics that are virtually weightless, 
stain-resistant and perspiration-friendly. "So we're not just trying to come up 
with what looks better," Boyd says, "but things that help these people perform 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 And cheering performances aren't limited to the big game. National 
cheerleading competitions are broadcast on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are ours," Boyd says. "We don't make any money on them, but we've set 
them up to spotlight the best cheerleaders and dancers, to give them a forum to 
show their wares." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the competitions, the parent company of Varsity Spirit Fashions 
operates summer training camps, for which participants (more than 135,000 this 
year) buy shorts, T-shirts, caps and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're kind of big in fashion," says Varsity Spirit designer Kraig 
Tallman, a former cheerleader and graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of 
Technology. "You look at name design firms like Calvin Klein, they're much 
smaller. You don't realize it because cheerleading is a special niche. But 
cheerleaders always need uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the rest of the country, West Coast high schools, Tallman says, 
have more competitions -- "every weekend it seems." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their routines are a little more developed too. They're looking for something 
a little bit flashy to catch the eye and they buy new uniforms every year," he 
marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing his usual research (fashion magazines, yearbooks, friends' photo 
albums), Tallman filled the company's catalogue this fall with "more of a 
streamlined, fitted look. It's not so bulky or oversized. It's more like 
fashion."  
</P>
<P>
 There are body-hugging shell tops, slimming mini pleats, new color blocking 
and V-shaped hemline treatments. Changes are necessarily subtle, and the color 
palette is limited to the 18 "athletic" colors used by high schools and 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Daniel, Varsity Spirit's sales representative in Huntington Beach, was so 
impressed by the business that she quit her job as a high school drill-team 
coach five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to purchase all the uniforms for my girls, and I realized I was at the 
wrong end of it," she says. Her L.A. to Southern Orange County territory is a 
mixed bag: "It's like night and day. The Orange County people are real picky, 
and they're pretty much up with the trends, where some of the L.A. schools are 
more traditional." 
</P>
<P>
 Not, however, East L.A.'s Garfield High School. The drill team's new night 
dresses ($100 each, partially paid for by candy apple sales) are slathered with 
sequins. And the dance team struts its stuff in corset-top unitards. 
</P>
<P>
 Drill team coach Rosa Velasquez says the new uniforms -- custom-made by 
Texas-based Cheerleader/Danzteam -- were necessary to help the girls perform 
better. "East L.A. is a low-income area. So when we went to the competitions, 
we didn't match up with the other kids at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, everything fits in -- from the girls' sequin-trimmed leggings to the 
sequin scrunchies in their hair, which is coiffed uniformly in ponytails, buns 
or French braids. Ricardo Hernandez, who choreographs the drill, dance and 
pompon teams, says the music he will use, "from Spanish to the 'Lion King,' " 
influenced the design of the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 So did shape. Unlike some schools, "we have shorter girls," Hernandez 
explains. "I like them to wear short skirts, a darker color around the waist 
and all the sequins on the shoulders and above the waist. That way the 
brightness will always be seen, and they will seem slimmer and have a tall 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez looks for attitude in the tryouts: "I look at their eyes more than 
their movements. If they have that little sparkle that says, 'I can do it and I 
want to learn,' they make it. I've had some girls who came in raw. They looked 
awful. Now they are the best, totally awesome." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Performance is one reason for yearly uniform updates. At Mater Dei High School 
in Santa Ana, cheerleader adviser John Merino explains the psychology: "We're 
very competition-oriented. We've won national championships, so having been in 
the limelight, we feel we like to change the image of the group every year." 
</P>
<P>
 But they eschew catalogue merchandise. Mater Dei designs its own rah-rah 
attire and has earned a reputation for innovative, classy striping -- of which 
there will be less this year. "It's more of a basic, clean look," Merino says. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains cheer coach Ross Dickie: "I want to make the kids look as small as 
possible. So the sweaters are closer to the body -- they come in at the waist. 
In my opinion, oversize makes them look overweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Skirts and sweaters for the Mater Dei cheerleaders run about $225 to $300 for 
the pair, depending on the amount of striping. And an entire wardrobe for the 
co-ed team, which includes a sweat suit, shorts, T-shirts and pants, totals 
about $400 to $500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's supplier is L.A.-based Broadway Cheerleading Sales. Company 
president George Ainslie, a former cheerleader, calls the Mater Dei designs 
"very visual." He says the school "is copied for their programs and their 
uniforms. They are one of the groups that from the beginning went after 
cheerleading more athletically and gave it credit that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic moves have brought changes, including less fabric: "It's a 
consideration. The uniforms can't be sloppy," Ainslie says. "If there is too 
much garment, especially if (the cheerleaders are) doing pyramids, the feet 
could get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Changes also are dictated "by how up on the fashion world the girls are. From 
body-huggers to incorporating peplums -- all things have been tried," Ainslie 
says. "And some things don't work, obviously, because of the athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Or adult disapproval. A halter top selected four years ago by pep squad 
members of Marina High School in Huntington Beach was nixed by the principal 
for showing too much skin. Yet skirts have risen without much comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Cid, 27, volunteer cheerleading coach at Roosevelt High School in 
East L.A., remembers when skirts were five to six inches above the knee and too 
heavy for today's athletic routines. "I like them no longer than three fingers 
below the buttocks," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, her girls will have three uniforms, including a new outfit to cheer 
the basketball team. They will pay about $500 for the works, which includes 
shoes and pompons. She plans to donate about $400 in total, much of it spent on 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a cheerleader myself at Roosevelt. I know being on the team really 
boosts their image, their self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics might not agree. But for such parents as Jesus Quezada, whose daughter 
Andie is captain of Garfield's drill and dance team, it is time and money well 
spent. Although he will pay about $300 this year for his daughter's uniforms, 
Quezada says, "I don't mind. She brings home better grades and shows more 
responsibility in school and in the house." Newport Harbor High School Varsity

CAN HE LEAVE THE PSYCHOS AND ZEROS BEHIND HIM?; AUTHORS: AT 30, BRET EASTON 
ELLIS HAS PUBLISHED HIS FOURTH BOOK. HE'S ENDURED A SKEWERING FOR THE VIOLENCE 
OF 'AMERICAN PSYCHO' AND THE SCRUTINY OF HIS OWN 'LESS THAN ZERO' LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When we last left Bret Easton Ellis, he was being publicly skewered for 
writing about a yuppie Wall Street serial killer with a penchant for Armani 
suits and torturing, mutilating and raping his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after "American Psycho," the author is on a book tour that is 
bringing him face to face with his audience for the first time. He surfaces on 
a recent warm night at Book Soup Bistro in West Hollywood, where a crowd has 
gathered to hear him read from his latest work, "The Informers" (Alfred A. 
Knopf). 
</P>
<P>
 Standing awkwardly throughout the restaurant are burly guys with tattoos and 
unruly hair, techie-nerd types in T-shirts stretched over love handles, young 
women with bright lipstick and backpacks thrown over their shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you like Bennington?" one dark-haired woman asks while he signs her copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um, yes," Ellis replies. "Are you thinking of going there?" 
</P>
<P>
 A young man thumps down a stack of books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do your characters, like, stay with you after you finish a book?" he asks. 
"Do you, like, think about them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Ellis says, "not really." 
</P>
<P>
 That it has taken almost a decade for Ellis to meet his readers may seem odd 
to anyone who has followed him through his four books, beginning with "Less 
Than Zero," then "The Rules of Attraction," "American Psycho" and now "The 
Informers." But pressing the flesh isn't exactly his forte. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange experience," he says the day after his Book Soup appearance. 
"But it was good." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis is sitting in an overstuffed chair in the Sherman Oaks home where he 
lived from age 3 until going off to Bennington College in Vermont. It's a hot 
day but he wears a dark suit, no tie, on his lanky 6-foot-plus frame. He is on 
the last leg of an exhaustive promotional tour for his collection of loosely 
woven vignettes about vampires, a rock star, a TV news reporter and some 
trademark zoned-out zombies, nearly all with an L.A. backdrop. The fatigue from 
this coming-out party is starting to show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's part of the job," he says. "I would rather stay in bed, I would rather 
be working alone, I would rather . . . just not be a part of the whole process. 
But who knows, it might not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting fans has been "scary," Ellis admits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked to see faces (at Book Soup) from the past, people I knew from 
high school, from New York -- it was weird," he says. "(This guy) showed up who 
was about five years older than me and when I was in junior high and he was in 
high school, he was with a group of guys who always used to torture seventh- 
and eighth-graders, and I was one of them. And seeing him come with his wife 
and child and remembering, 'Jesus, you were really a jerk.' I didn't say it, I 
was thinking it. It made me think, lives aren't set when you're a senior in 
high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the tour, he has discovered that people aren't expecting to meet 
Bret Easton Ellis, warm-fuzzy nice guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I come in, everyone hushes and looks at me like they're really afraid, 
really scared. Even before I make it up to the place where I'm supposed to 
read, everyone's like, 'Uhhhhh ! My God, is he going to pull out a knife, is he 
going to scream at us?' . . . And by the end, I get a lot of like, 'I thought 
you were, like, this sort of jerk' . . . 'and I almost didn't come because I 
didn't want to put myself through you being rude to me or something.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Any fear of being stabbed immediately evaporates upon meeting Ellis, who seems 
rather shy and vulnerable and often makes fun of himself. At 30, his face still 
has vestiges of baby fat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '80s, though, Ellis' fast-lane life generated copy for the New 
York gossip columns, which detailed his all-nighter Manhattan club rounds with 
a party-minded literary Brat Pack that included such pals as Jay McInerney. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was living like most of my friends," Ellis recalls, "but for some 
reason the media thought I was just being like a brat, or that I should have 
been in my apartment writing more." 
</P>
<P>
 To his chroniclers' delight, he was acting just like one of his "Less Than 
Zero" characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think maybe people who don't write novels assume that the writer is a huge 
part of what's going on in the books. I don't know, it was very strange to find 
myself going places and having my picture taken and reading about myself in the 
paper the next day. . . . But (the gossip) was also tinged with an intense 
negativity." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Ellis was also in the throes of writing "American Psycho" -- and 
doing a fair amount of drinking and drugging, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think," he explains, "that the drugs or drinking were in any way, 
shape or form a means of escaping writing 'American Psycho.' It was in a lot of 
ways incredibly stimulating to write and when it was going well, I was fairly, 
I don't want to say happy, but I was OK. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 But to compress those years into a sound bite would make it too "dramatic," 
too "heightened," he protests. It was simply New York City in the last years of 
the Reagan Era. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he merely partaking because everyone else was? 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way I was," he says. "I think if you go to a club and have a couple of 
drinks and someone comes up to you and says, 'Hey, Bret, I really liked your 
book,' and slips you a gram of coke, I mean, I think that's more incentive to 
do it. I would never scrounge the streets and say, 'Hey, man, coke? 'Ludes?' 
But it was by no means really an escape of the pain of writing 'American 
Psycho.' But maybe, who knows? Unconsciously, it might have been. It might have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 Age, he claims, brought him down from the high life: "You sort of get older 
and it's like, you can't deal with it anymore and it's not fun to hang out till 
3 in the morning and feel terrible the next day." 
</P>

<P>
 Ellis would be way too naive to believe that the media alone is to blame for 
this image, however distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was he, after all, who conjured up "American Psycho" killer Patrick 
Bateman, in all his horrifically graphic glory. When Ellis delivered his 
manuscript to Simon & Schuster in 1990, it prompted an outcry in the publishing 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 What started as in-house turmoil at Simon & Schuster about the over-the-top 
violence in the book soon became a cause celebre . Magazines printed excerpts, 
a public debate ensued, and in the end his publisher bailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another publisher, Vintage, finally printed "American Psycho" as written, 
prompting the National Organization for Women to call for a boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four years later, Patrick Bateman finds himself in good company, with 
"Natural Born Killers" grossing $44.7 million at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity about the book has not subsided. People continue to ask Ellis how he 
fared the criticism, why he created such a character, what's the status of the 
film version? 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, it's strange," Ellis says, smoking one in a series of Marlboros. "I 
mean, I don't feel any need to protect that book in any way or to tell anyone 
reading this that yeah, there are people who liked it or got it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm in this odd position where the terrible things people say about 
the books and also about me really, really don't matter. And, unfortunately, 
the good things don't matter, either. It's terrible to say that -- so what?  
</P>
<P>
 "Once you've been reviewed as much as I have been, you really get to a point 
where it really just does not matter. Someone asked me, what if I'd been 
reviewed well my entire career, would I feel different? Maybe I would have, but 
that's not what happened. So I have to deal with this situation. It's really 
fine. I'm very calm about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis thinks about moving back to Los Angeles permanently, or at least 
spending more time here. "I just cannot deal with Eastern winters," he says. "I 
think the older you get, the more difficult it is to live in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter where he is, Ellis finds himself continually confounded by writer's 
block. "The Informers," he explains, evolved from "many large notebooks" of 
character sketches. He'd go back to them whenever he got stuck on his 
novel-in-progress. It became an exercise, like working out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," he says, "it was a crutch." 
</P>
<P>
 The project that has been giving him trouble is about "supermodels and the 
fashion industry," he says. "I laugh when I say this because friends of mine 
say, 'Four years to write about models ? Can't you write this book in, like, a 
month ?' But it's just not coming together. So I limped over to 'The Informers' 
and I became more and more immersed in it. . . . I thought, I don't know if 
these are short stories or a novel, but I probably should present the publisher 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Book-tour exhaustion aside, is Ellis happy with his life? He pauses, hand by 
his mouth, staring at some fixed point for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ummmmm . . . no," he finally says. "But comparatively, in terms of what it 
could be, yes. I'm actually very lucky. No matter how well your life is going, 
no matter how happy you are with your job, there are always things lurking 
around the edges that you wish were better or smoothed out or you could deal 
with. But overall, I really cannot complain about it because I've been really 
lucky. Really lucky."

THE PRICE OF PEP; STRIPES, SEQUINS, FINE FABRICS. TODAY'S CHEERLEADER WARDROBES 
INSPIRE COPYING BY DESIGNERS -- AND COMPLAINTS FROM PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Let's hear it for the T-E-A-M! 
</P>
<P>
 No, not the hunks on the field but those girls (and, occasionally, guys) who 
cheer, dance and drill-thrill the fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The hours. The practicing. The splits. The yells. And those costumes. These 
days, uniforms have so much oomph and cost so much moola they are fuel for 
fashion designers -- and fodder for lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A 22-piece wardrobe, totaling nearly $1,000, was required when Heather Delaney 
made the varsity cheer squad last year at Newport Harbor High School in Newport 
Beach. Delaney and her parents have sued the school district and several 
administrators, alleging illegal charges for uniforms, transportation and other 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by televised competitions that have pushed the activity to new 
heights, pep squads are expensive fashion enclaves. Nothing, from their shoes 
(made with special grooves) to their perfect ponytails (think hairpieces), is 
left to chance or penny-ante expense accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Big on spirit this fall, fashion houses -- from funky Anna Sui to conservative 
Esprit -- are showing chic renditions of pleated skirts, striped cropped tops, 
football jerseys and varsity jackets. Sui even throws in pompon accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis, Tenn.-based Varsity Spirit Fashions, the nation's largest 
manufacturer of pep paraphernalia, is expected to gross $38 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cheered in high buckle shoes with leather soles and rubber heels," says 
Kline Boyd, Varsity Spirit general manager, who was a cheerleader 23 years ago. 
"Now you have companies like Nike designing shoes specifically for 
cheerleading." 
</P>
<P>
 Innovations include active-wear fabrics that are virtually weightless, 
stain-resistant and perspiration-friendly. "So we're not just trying to come up 
with what looks better," Boyd says, "but things that help these people perform 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 And cheering performances aren't limited to the big game. National 
cheerleading competitions are broadcast on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are ours," Boyd says. "We don't make any money on them, but we've set 
them up to spotlight the best cheerleaders and dancers, to give them a forum to 
show their wares." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the competitions, the parent company of Varsity Spirit Fashions 
operates summer training camps, for which participants (more than 135,000 this 
year) buy shorts, T-shirts, caps and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we're kind of big in fashion," says Varsity Spirit designer Kraig 
Tallman, a former cheerleader and graduate of New York's Fashion Institute of 
Technology. "You look at name design firms like Calvin Klein, they're much 
smaller. You don't realize it because cheerleading is a special niche. But 
cheerleaders always need uniforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the rest of the country, West Coast high schools, Tallman says, 
have more competitions -- "every weekend it seems." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their routines are a little more developed too. They're looking for something 
a little bit flashy to catch the eye and they buy new uniforms every year," he 
marvels. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing his usual research (fashion magazines, yearbooks, friends' photo 
albums), Tallman filled the company's catalogue this fall with "more of a 
streamlined, fitted look. It's not so bulky or oversized. It's more like 
fashion."  
</P>
<P>
 There are body-hugging shell tops, slimming mini pleats, new color blocking 
and V-shaped hemline treatments. Changes are necessarily subtle, and the color 
palette is limited to the 18 "athletic" colors used by high schools and 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Daniel, Varsity Spirit's sales representative in Huntington Beach, was so 
impressed by the business that she quit her job as a high school drill-team 
coach five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to purchase all the uniforms for my girls, and I realized I was at the 
wrong end of it," she says. Her L.A. to Southern Orange County territory is a 
mixed bag: "It's like night and day. The Orange County people are real picky, 
and they're pretty much up with the trends, where some of the L.A. schools are 
more traditional." 
</P>
<P>
 Not, however, East L.A.'s Garfield High School. The drill team's new night 
dresses ($100 each, partially paid for by candy apple sales) are slathered with 
sequins. And the dance team struts its stuff in corset-top unitards. 
</P>
<P>
 Drill team coach Rosa Velasquez says the new uniforms -- custom-made by 
Texas-based Cheerleader/Danzteam -- were necessary to help the girls perform 
better. "East L.A. is a low-income area. So when we went to the competitions, 
we didn't match up with the other kids at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, everything fits in -- from the girls' sequin-trimmed leggings to the 
sequin scrunchies in their hair, which is coiffed uniformly in ponytails, buns 
or French braids. Ricardo Hernandez, who choreographs the drill, dance and 
pompon teams, says the music he will use, "from Spanish to the 'Lion King,' " 
influenced the design of the uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 So did shape. Unlike some schools, "we have shorter girls," Hernandez 
explains. "I like them to wear short skirts, a darker color around the waist 
and all the sequins on the shoulders and above the waist. That way the 
brightness will always be seen, and they will seem slimmer and have a tall 
presence." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez looks for attitude in the tryouts: "I look at their eyes more than 
their movements. If they have that little sparkle that says, 'I can do it and I 
want to learn,' they make it. I've had some girls who came in raw. They looked 
awful. Now they are the best, totally awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Performance is one reason for yearly uniform updates. At Mater Dei High School 
in Santa Ana, cheerleader adviser John Merino explains the psychology: "We're 
very competition-oriented. We've won national championships, so having been in 
the limelight, we feel we like to change the image of the group every year." 
</P>
<P>
 But they eschew catalogue merchandise. Mater Dei designs its own rah-rah 
attire and has earned a reputation for innovative, classy striping -- of which 
there will be less this year. "It's more of a basic, clean look," Merino says. 
</P>
<P>
 Explains cheer coach Ross Dickie: "I want to make the kids look as small as 
possible. So the sweaters are closer to the body -- they come in at the waist. 
In my opinion, oversize makes them look overweight." 
</P>
<P>
 Skirts and sweaters for the Mater Dei cheerleaders run about $225 to $300 for 
the pair, depending on the amount of striping. And an entire wardrobe for the 
co-ed team, which includes a sweat suit, shorts, T-shirts and pants, totals 
about $400 to $500 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's supplier is L.A.-based Broadway Cheerleading Sales. Company 
president George Ainslie, a former cheerleader, calls the Mater Dei designs 
"very visual." He says the school "is copied for their programs and their 
uniforms. They are one of the groups that from the beginning went after 
cheerleading more athletically and gave it credit that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The athletic moves have brought changes, including less fabric: "It's a 
consideration. The uniforms can't be sloppy," Ainslie says. "If there is too 
much garment, especially if (the cheerleaders are) doing pyramids, the feet 
could get caught." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Changes also are dictated "by how up on the fashion world the girls are. From 
body-huggers to incorporating peplums -- all things have been tried," Ainslie 
says. "And some things don't work, obviously, because of the athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Or adult disapproval. A halter top selected four years ago by pep squad 
members of Marina High School in Huntington Beach was nixed by the principal 
for showing too much skin. Yet skirts have risen without much comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Cid, 27, volunteer cheerleading coach at Roosevelt High School in 
East L.A., remembers when skirts were five to six inches above the knee and too 
heavy for today's athletic routines. "I like them no longer than three fingers 
below the buttocks," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, her girls will have three uniforms, including a new outfit to cheer 
the basketball team. They will pay about $500 for the works, which includes 
shoes and pompons. She plans to donate about $400 in total, much of it spent on 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a cheerleader myself at Roosevelt. I know being on the team really 
boosts their image, their self-respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Cynics might not agree. But for such parents as Jesus Quezada, whose daughter 
Andie is captain of Garfield's drill and dance team, it is time and money well 
spent. Although he will pay about $300 this year for his daughter's uniforms, 
Quezada says, "I don't mind. She brings home better grades and shows more 
responsibility in school and in the house."

BY DESIGN; MILAN: TARTS AND TAXES; THE TROLLOP LOOK ISN'T THE ONLY NEWS. 
THERE'S ALSO THAT LITTLE MATTER OF CORRUPTION CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA GENDEL, TIMES FASHION EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gianni Versace's parade of bare buttocks on the opening day of Milan's spring 
and summer 1995 collections couldn't hold a candle to the scandalous doings off 
the runway. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of hemlines and silhouettes has been overshadowed by reports of kickbacks 
and bribes that Krizia (Mariuccia Mandelli), Giorgio Armani and Gianfranco 
Ferre, among others, reportedly paid to tax officials in exchange for 
preferential treatment. . 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal set the stage for Saturday's opening of the Milan shows, which 
haven't been talked about so much in years. It also prompted designers to do 
the unheard-of -- attend each other's shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In a gesture of solidarity, Armani and Donatella Girombelli, owner of the 
Genny label, turned up Sunday at the Dolce & Gabbana show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stick together," Girombelli told reporters. "We have to show that 
fashion is more than just a business. It's about creativity and image." Armani, 
who has admitted paying $65,000 to tax inspectors, said prosecutor Antonio Di 
Pietro was "only doing his job." 
</P>
<P>
 And Versace, we suppose, was only doing his. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true -- the collection was vulgar," said one observer of Versace's 
secondary line, "but it was a studied, purposeful vulgar." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolce & Gabbana also teetered on the edge of trollop-hood, showing bustier 
dresses in sheer body-clinging chiffon, buttocks-hugging hot pants in black 
stretch silk and baby-doll slip dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is what designers mean by the oft-repeated "return to femininity" this 
season, then it's a femininity American women will find anachronistic -- to put 
it mildly. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing for work in strappy stilettos (revealing perfectly pedicured toes), 
nude hose (sans runs) and a rib-crushingly tight jacket makes us think not of 
work but of an entirely different endeavor. . . . But, then, maybe that's the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "American women have a puritanical background," said fashion forecaster 
Marjorie Dean of the New York-based Tobe Report. "The look of femininity is 
what most women want. But don't make us look like tarts." 
</P>
<P>
 The French -- not the Italians -- deserve the credit (or blame?) for 
tightening our collective corset come spring. The summer's haute couture shows 
ran amok with shapely, sculpted suits and dresses -- copies of which turned up 
almost overnight in American stores. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is to Paris, beginning Monday, that the fashion world will turn to see 
how the "womanly" look plays out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much too early to say what we might see," Dean said. "Everybody waits to 
see what Yves Saint Laurent and Karl Lagerfeld do. Lagerfeld is a genius. The 
sheer dresses he did that everyone thought were overly theatrical at the time 
have been one of the major influences in fashion -- sheer backs, sheer pleats, 
sheer fronts. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 What no one seems to agree on in Paris or Milan is length. Some designers are 
embracing the below-the-knee look that a handful of designers experimented with 
last season, while others prefer the mini. Such confusion, Dean suspects, will 
send women rushing back to pants. "It's easier for women if you spell it out 
very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 But expecting a cohesive mandate from designers for spring is unrealistic. 
Deconstructing clothing may be passe -- deconstructing the status quo is not. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris-based designer Martin Margiela circumvented the conventional shows in 
March, 1993, and unveiled his fall-winter collection, radically enough, in the 
fall -- at nine stores around the world simultaneously. The idea, a spokesman 
said, was "to show the clothes in the season they are worn." 
</P>
<P>
 Myriam Schaefer -- former right-hand woman to the irreverent Jean Paul 
Gaultier and the first ready-to-wear designer for the 62-year-old house of Nina 
Ricci -- shares Margiela's disdain for the current fashion scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my thing," she told Reuters this week. "I just feel like telling 
some of these guys, 'Wake up to reality!' Behaving like a rock star, putting on 
shows with 90 models, appearing on TV -- it's just out of proportion to what we 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 And nipping at the well-shod heels of Paris' high-end ready-to-wear shows are 
young Parisian style-mongers, 10,000 of whom flocked last month to the first 
"Who's Next" fashion fair. Staged beneath a circus tent, it was packed with 
inexpensive streetwear, club gear and techno-tribal-inspired clothes. (A hot 
seller, according to Women's Wear Daily, was Oregon-based Prison Blues T-shirts 
that read: "Made on the Inside, to Be Worn on the Outside.") 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the French are said to be counting on American buyers to place 
larger orders than in recent years. In fact, the American economic picture 
appears so bright to the French that Thierry Mugler reportedly plans to open a 
Rodeo Drive franchise by the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "With times being what they are, people want to conserve," Dean said. "But at 
the same time, if people want to spend a lot of money, they are going to want 
something to show for it."

TOPICS / TEACHING; HEADMASTER KNOWS FIRST NAME OF ALL 320 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL CHASTANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One minute the teacher was pointing to a human skeleton, discussing anatomy 
with a group of eighth-graders. Seconds later, he segued into a talk about the 
brutality that often accompanies discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, it all fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time in India, where a group of people were known as the 
'Untouchables,' " explained Les Frost, headmaster of St. Matthew's Parish 
School in Pacific Palisades. "They were the lowest class, and in that society 
it was OK to beat these people." 
</P>
<P>
 The skeletons used in his human biology class, added Frost, were from India. 
"No one wanted to touch their bodies when they had died, so they were sold to 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of staying in his headmaster's office, Frost is out there in the 
trenches, teaching science classes. Frost says he knows all 320 students, 
kindergarten through eighth grade, by their first names. "He's like a third 
parent," said eighth-grader Sean Orr. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost was named a 1994 National Distinguished Principal by the U.S. Department 
of Education and the National Assn. of Elementary School Principals. He was one 
of five private school teachers in the country so honored, and one of two -- 
the other is in Chula Vista -- in California to receive the award. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost was formally presented with the award last Friday in Washington. Those 
who work with him say the prize was well-deserved, citing accomplishments 
ranging from the school's innovative approach to community service to its 
ambitious computer education program. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 10 years Les Frost has been at St. Matthew's, he has taken a 
respected, good school, and made it great," said the school's admission 
director, A. Lee Quiring, in his nomination letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first award I've ever received," said Frost, who lives on the St. 
Matthew's campus with his wife and daughter, 17. (His 22-year-old son, who 
attends Santa Monica Community College, does not live at home.) "I'm pleased." 
</P>
<P>
 Frost, 51, started teaching 23 years ago after working one year as a 
pharmacist. He said his wife, Marilyn, a teacher, "would tell me these 
wonderful stories about what happened at school that day. It intrigued me."  
</P>
<P>
 So he returned to school -- to UCLA, where he earned a teaching credential. 
His first assignment was at a Los Angeles Unified School District middle 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were wonderful, and there were plenty of dedicated teachers, but 
because of the bureaucracy and class sizes, it was difficult to try to make a 
difference in the lives of the kids you taught," Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972 he took a teaching position (as in the previous job, his subject was 
science) at what was then the Westlake School for Girls. He became the school's 
assistant headmaster before leaving in 1984 to take the headmaster's position 
at St. Matthew's. Although he says he regretted that he would no longer be a 
full-time teacher, he saw the headmaster's post as an opportunity to become 
involved with students in new ways -- not only as a teacher, but also as an 
adviser, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because of his encouragement, all of St. Matthew's teachers have 
become computer-literate, said Roberta McCuskey, who teaches seventh- and 
eighth-grade math and computer science. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Frost went a step further. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say he organized fund-raisers that financed the construction 
of five computer labs on campus. Now students receive weekly computer 
instruction and use a variety of educational software programs. Eighth-graders 
explore their family trees in history classes and use computer programs to 
write reports that include text, animation, artwork and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gives us the trust and confidence to create new ways of teaching," said 
McCuskey, who has taught 17 years at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although community service is a requirement at many private schools, Frost 
added a twist: He encouraged students to become philanthropists. Student 
leaders organize fund-raisers -- not for dances, but to make donations to 
community groups. Last year the students raised $5,000 for a Venice day-care 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating ways to raise money, and really making a difference in the 
community, has great meaning for the children," Frost said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, meanwhile, say Frost has also shown concern for their development. 
He created a summer grant program in which faculty are paid to attend workshops 
to improve their curriculum and teaching skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost was nominated by parents, administrators and the National Assn. of 
Episcopal Schools. A panel of educators representing the Washington-based 
Council of Private American Education reviewed the applications. It also sent a 
representative to the school to size up the campus and the nominee. Officials 
said 10 private school principals were nominated this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kealey, who sat on the selection panel, says Frost stood out. 
</P>
<P>
 "(He) has done an outstanding job in all areas, from encouraging parental 
involvement to his assistance with teachers in terms of staff development," 
said Kealey, an official with the National Catholic Education Assn., a grouping 
of administrators for Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Frost says the accomplishment he is most proud of is getting to know each 
student. That, he says, helps create an environment in which each child feels 
he or she counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The point was made eloquently in a letter he once received from a former St. 
Matthew's student as she was about to enter ninth grade at a private high 
school. Frost said she wrote: "I don't know if the headmaster will ever know my 
name."

 Community funds -- A story in Wednesday's Times erroneously stated that 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter had transferred $5,700 to a staff salary account 
from one designed to provide donations to community cleanup programs. Galanter 
said the money was diverted to pay for a mailer that notified residents about a 
special trash pickup program.

<P>
 The City Council has approved most of a $10-million plan to expand and 
renovate the city's vehicle-repair yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The yard, at 311 S. Greenwood Ave., will be extended across the street to 
Taylor and Colegrove avenues and expanded from 5.2 to 7.4 acres.A new 
administrative building, bus-washing facility, two-story parking structure and 
fueling area will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction for the expansion is scheduled to start by January and end by 
late 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The current yard was built in 1968 and is too small to service the fleet of 55 
city buses and some 200 city vehicles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The final phase of the project will be submitted to the council next year and 
will include plans to clean up some soil contaminated by leaking fuel lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have also approved a $50,000 three-dimensional cultural art display 
on the past, present and future of Montebello. JOHN D. WAGNER

CITY HALL JOURNAL: MONTEBELLO; STUDENT CLAIMS POLICE USED EXCESSIVE FORCE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old college student has accused Montebello police officers of using 
excessive force -- dousing him with pepper spray and clubbing him -- during an 
investigation of a vandalized car. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Diaz, a student at East Los Angeles Community College, made the 
allegations in a federal suit filed last week, one year after the incident.He 
said he still suffers pains in his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages for false arrest and 
injuries, names as defendants the city, Police Chief Steve Simonian and 
Officers John Montelongo, Ricardo Rojas, Brad Keller and Douglas Gorman. It 
also names three security guards who called police. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz said he was at the Quiet Cannon restaurant and nightclub on Sept. 26, 
1993, to celebrate a friend's birthday when police detained him for questioning 
about a broken car window. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Diaz denied damaging the car, the officers became verbally abusive, 
said his attorney, Robert Mann. The officers then threw Diaz against a police 
car, sprayed him and hit him 15 times with their batons, Mann said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his arrest, Diaz was taken to County-USC Medical Center, where he was 
treated for bruises on his arms and legs. He was released and then jailed for 
three days on suspicion of vandalism, resisting arrest and battery on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the officers' actions were justified. According to a 
police report of the incident, Diaz was verbally abusive and attacked the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Bill Scholl said Montelongo hit Diaz with his baton after Diaz 
struck the officer in the face two times and kicked Rojas in the knee, 
according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaz was charged with battery but a judge declared a mistrial after a jury 
failed to reach a verdict. PSYCHE PASCUAL

HIGH SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN; EDUCATION: AFTER A DECADE OF LEGAL WRANGLING 
AND DELAYS IN FUNDING, A GROUNDBREAKING WILL BE HELD FRIDAY FOR THE NEW LYNWOOD 
CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PSYCHE PASCUAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Armstrong has served on the Lynwood school board for 20 years, and it 
seems like much of the time the district has been trying to build a new high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a decade of planning, waging legal battles and waiting for 
state funds, the district has scheduled a groundbreaking ceremony at 10 a.m. 
Friday for the new $96-million Lynwood High School at 4050 Imperial Highway.  
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, the school will open in July, 1997, providing 
much-needed relief for the district's existing high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming," Armstrong said. "I'm happy it's finally here." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has already started to demolish buildings at the site, which has 
been occupied by a shopping center. Construction is scheduled to begin within 
three months, Supt. Audrey M. Clarke of the Lynwood Unified School District 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing high school on Bullis Road has been overcrowded for more years 
than many can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1940 to house about 1,500 students, the campus in recent years has 
been crammed with portable classrooms to accommodate 3,300 students. Students 
have no place to eat indoors, and lunch periods have be staggered to avoid 
crowding. 
</P>
<P>
 The school lacks other amenities, including a public-address system. When 
announcements need to be made, administrators have to distribute bulletins for 
teachers to read in class. In summer, students sweltered because many 
classrooms didn't have air-conditioning.  
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the school switched to a year-round class schedule so that 
one-third of the students are on vacation at a time, Clarke said. When the new 
high school opens, the officials will decide whether to continue a year-round 
schedule or return to a traditional school year, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the 33-acre site for the new high school is much smaller than many 
high school campuses being built around the state, the district's architects 
designed the buildings to make the most of the land, Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The main classroom buildings are three stories high. Eight tennis courts sit 
on top of a parking structure, while parking spaces set aside for staff will be 
underground. The school will have a new gymnasium as well as football, baseball 
and softball fields and basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The new campus will also have a performing arts center that can be used by the 
community. It will have air-conditioning as well as solar-powered heating. 
Classrooms will be wired to accommodate computers and cable television, 
although the district may not be able to purchase the equipment right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be sure we are ready for state-of-the-art technology," Clarke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The existing high school on Bullis Road will become a junior high school, and 
Hosler Junior High School may be converted to an elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays in building the new high school stem primarily from a lengthy legal 
battle over the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The district had looked for land since the early 1980s and finally settled on 
the Imperial Highway property. But the owner of the site, the Seventh-day 
Adventist Church, refused to sell and the district was forced to sue. In 1991, 
the school district won its legal fight to acquire the land.

SWIMWEAR COMPETITION DEEMED ILL-SUITED FOR MISS DOWNEY PAGEANT; EVENTS: 
ORGANIZERS DROP BATHING SUIT AND HIGH HEELS CONTEST, SAYING IT INTIMIDATED SOME 
QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Contestants in the Miss Downey Pageant no longer will have to strut across 
stage in swimsuits and high heels, organizers have decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sticking someone in a swimsuit should have nothing to do with being Miss 
Downey," said Lisa Weiss, the pageant's co-director. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time in the pageant's 41-year history that swimsuits have been 
eliminated. Contestants, instead, will be judged on sportswear and business 
clothing during this year's event, which will take place Nov. 12 at the Downey 
Civic Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Contestants between the ages of 16 and 22 will don blouses, skirts, dress 
shorts and sweaters. "It will be more like what they would wear to an afternoon 
at the theater," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey Rose Float Assn., which sponsors the event, uses pageant proceeds 
to build a float for the annual Rose Parade in Pasadena. Miss Downey and four 
runners-up ride on the float during the New Year's Day parade. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's 10-member board of directors agreed to do away with beachwear at 
the suggestion of Weiss and other coordinators. They contended that qualified 
Downey residents were not entering the contest because they felt uncomfortable 
wearing swimsuits in front of an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 But many women who have participated in previous Miss Downey Pageants said 
they oppose the decision to cancel the swimsuit competition. They argue that a 
woman's body and how she takes care of it is as important to the contest as her 
talent, poise, intelligence and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie M. Swender, the pageant's coordinator from 1983 to 1993, said the 
swimsuit contest boosted the self-confidence of many participants who were 
initially shy about getting up on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any girl who has the confidence to walk on stage in a swimsuit will have the 
confidence to go out and represent the city," Swender said. "We were not 
looking for a girl with a perfect body. We were looking for a girl with the 
poise and confidence to carry herself in any situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie L. Francisco, a 1991-92 Miss Downey runner-up, said the swimwear 
competition gave her confidence. "Once I conquered the fear of being in a 
swimsuit competition it built up my self-esteem," she said. A fit body also 
reflects discipline and a commitment to health, Francisco added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it should be left in since it is part of a beauty pageant," said 
Monica R. Vargas, the 1991-92 pageant's first runner-up. "What makes Miss 
Downey better than Miss America or any other pageant where they have do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Valencia, co-director of the pageant, said this year's contenders will 
be judged on academic achievement, community service and career advancement, as 
well as beauty, intelligence and personality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always the young lady who is a straight-A student who could win 
scholarships in the pageant but will not enter because of the swimsuit 
portion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Downey hopefuls will also participate in an evening gown competition, 
personal interviews, dance productions and an impromptu question-and-answer 
period with judges. Talent and essay writing contests are optional. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Southern California cities, including Lynwood, Moorpark and Ojai, have 
done away with beachwear competitions at their pageants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard H. Lake, executive director of the Lynwood Chamber of Commerce, said 
the Miss Lynwood Pageant replaced swimsuits with leotards about six years ago. 
Then, in 1992, the leotards were dropped, a competition for men was added and 
the name was changed to the Lynwood Scholarship Competition. The city now has 
both a Mr. Lynwood and Miss Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted more emphasis on scholarship rather than beauty," Lake said.

FENCING CONTEST; HOMEOWNER BATTLES NEIGHBOR, CITY OVER BARRIER THEY SAY IS TOO 
TALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patsy Barggren thought she had a pretty good argument for erecting the tall 
wood fence around part of her Long Beach home in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house had been burglarized several times, cars had been stolen, and she 
had been feuding with a neighbor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors OKd the fence in the early stages of construction. But they 
withdrew the approval after neighbors complained about its final height -- the 
structure is 8-feet tall and the city allows only 6 1/2-foot fences. 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren has continued to defy orders to lower the fence, arguing that many 
residents have fences exceeding the limit. But a jury recently convicted her of 
violating city codes. The actress, who says she has appeared in television soap 
operas, is to be sentenced today in Long Beach Municipal Court and could face 
up to six months in jail, a $500 fine or both. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I could have just taken the fence down, but I'm not a quitter," Barggren 
said. "I can't let it go. I believe I'm in the right and I've been treated 
wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren said she spent about $5,000 to build the fence -- and about $25,000 
in legal fees defending it. 
</P>
<P>
 She had it built about three years ago along the side and back of her 
property, which borders the Virginia Country Club in an upscale Bixby Knolls 
neighborhood. Her yard previously had been shielded by shrubbery and a 
chain-link fence. 
</P>
<P>
 George Boucher, a neighbor who often clashed with Barggren, complained to the 
city that the new fence, which is solid and topped with decorative latticework, 
was too high and obstructed his view. Boucher and Barggren, citing many 
instances of alleged harassment, have obtained Superior Court restraining 
orders against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice neighborhood, and (the fence) looks like a big barricade," 
said Boucher, a retired pediatrician. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, after city officials ordered her to remove or alter the fence to meet 
the height limit, Barggren asked city planners for a formal variance. The 
request was denied, and she appealed to the city's Planning Commission, which 
also turned her down. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report, Zoning Administrator Dennis Eschen noted that Barggren's home had 
been burglarized but said he found "nothing in the physical situation that 
creates any greater exposure for the site than any other property, or any other 
corner lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Barggren said she has continued to fight to keep her fence because she 
believes the city singled her out for prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always thought that America was equal for everybody," she said. "But 
they're determined to treat me differently." 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the Municipal Court trial last month, Judge Bradford L. 
Andrews denied a motion by Barggren's attorney to dismiss the case because of 
selective prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 City Prosecutor John Vander Lans, who handled the case in the recent trial, 
denied that Barggren was unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there are many other fences not in compliance," he said. "Just as there 
are many people who speed. Some get pulled over and some don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Lans said Barggren was treated the same as anyone who has been accused 
of violating a city ordinance. The difference, he said, is that Barggren 
refuses to comply.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've done everything we can to get her into compliance, but at some point 
the city has to say enough is enough," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason we have so few fence violations is that if we can settle the 
thing, that ends it," Vander Lans added. "But she refuses to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the jury's ruling, Barggren said she has no plans to remove or change 
her fence. She said she may take her case to federal court, charging that Long 
Beach officials have violated her civil rights to secure her property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's still justice in the system, or I'll prove there isn't 
justice in the system," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vander Lans said he is surprised by Barggren's tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "In three years, most people would have just taken it down, you'd think," he 
said.

WOMAN SENTENCED IN CREDIT CARD SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Downey woman was sentenced in Norwalk Superior Court this week to five years 
in state prison for stealing credit card numbers while working at mortgage 
companies and using the information to buy thousands of dollars' worth of 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
 However, whether Debra LaGrone will spend any time behind bars remains a 
question.LaGrone, 40, could serve all or part of her sentence at a state drug 
treatment program in Riverside County that houses first-time felony offenders 
with substance abuse problems. A hearing is scheduled later this month to 
determine whether she is eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's attorney, Charles E. Mullis, predicted that she will be accepted 
into the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, LaGrone pleaded guilty to charges of commercial burglary, making a 
false financial statement, fraudulent use of an access card, receiving stolen 
property and possession of methamphetamine. According to court documents, 
LaGrone obtained credit card numbers and other confidential information while 
working at mortgage companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties, then bought 
goods on those accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone also applied for loans, obtained cash advances in other people's names 
and ordered merchandise through department stores, jewelry boutiques and 
clothing catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities documented more than $50,000 in purchases and identified 
at least 15 victims across Southern California, in addition to numerous small 
merchants, department stores, credit card companies and banks. DUKE HELFAND

<P>
 City and county officials have opened a $117-million complex that houses a 
maximum-security jail, a sheriff's station, three courtrooms and a regional 
crime laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lynwood Regional Justice Center, on a 19-acre site at Alameda Street and 
Imperial Highway, has been under construction since 1991.The jail can 
accommodate 1,688 inmates. The sheriff's station is the new home for deputies 
from the old Firestone and Lynwood stations. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,500 people attended opening ceremonies last month, including Sheriff 
Sherman Block, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, former Supervisor Kenneth 
Hahn and Lynwood Mayor Paul H. Richards II. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is hopefully the future of law enforcement," said Sheriff's Lt. Robert 
Lindsey. "We're bringing the courts, the jail and law enforcement together to 
streamline the system." JOHN D. WAGNER

 A Long Beach charity's plan to turn an apartment building on the city's 
eastside into low-income family housing has sparked opposition by neighbors who 
say the project would burden an area that is already crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors of the building at 2844 E. 3rd St. say the project would increase 
crime, noise and parking problems because planned renovations would allow more 
tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have also expressed fears that an influx of low-income 
neighbors would lower property values. They also want the property's new owner, 
the nonprofit Gumbiner Family Foundation, to begin consulting with them about 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the charity organization, which is backed by Long Beach 
philanthropist Josephine Gumbiner, said that planned renovations will mitigate 
the project's impact on the neighborhood. The new owners plan to build noise 
barriers, a playground and indoor recreation facilities, said Alis Gumbiner, a 
member of the foundation's executive board. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation has not decided who will be living in the building but is aware 
of neighbors' concerns about accepting too many homeless people as tenants, 
Gumbiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want people moving into the building where the whole neighborhood 
hates them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 2nd District Neighborhood Assn. began organizing opposition to 
the project after the foundation sent eviction notices in late August to 48 
residents, seven of them senior citizens. Tenants were given $500 and one 
month's rent and were offered assistance in finding a new residence if they 
agree to leave by the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation ordered the evictions to allow contractors to begin combining 
some one-bedroom apartments into two-bedroom apartments to accommodate more 
families. The renovations will reduce the number of units from 30 to 26, 
Gumbiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal, whose district includes the neighborhood, said 
he hopes to call in a professional mediator to help resolve the conflict. He 
added that although he supports the Gumbiners' goal of affordable housing, the 
area's residential development is already too dense. JOHN COX

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CITY COLLEGE TO LOSE 270 CLASSES IN JANUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach City College trustees have passed a budget that will slash about 
270 classes in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes will be eliminated "across-the-board -- business, mathematics, art, 
history, you name it," said Kamiran Badrkhan, vice president of academic 
affairs.The college is offering about 3,000 classes this semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will reduce the number of part-time instructors next semester. About 
10 unfilled non-teaching positions, such as clerk-typists, a secretary and 
custodial supervisor, have also been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The $54.8-million budget, which is below last year's $55.7-million spending 
plan, includes money for six additional instructors, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The college will also have to delay plans to revamp the science building and 
buy new equipment for the art building because legislators rejected a proposed 
November ballot measure to sell bonds to pay for such improvements, officials 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Judith Powell criticized the drop in state funds for community 
colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "At virtually every meeting, we hear (from administrators) about how the 
revenue stream is not what we thought it was," she said. "We have to keep 
adjusting and readjusting, and it's hard to make promises to the community."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; BUS USAGE ON ROUTE TO DOWNTOWN MONITORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Transportation officials are monitoring a bus route that runs from East Long 
Beach to downtown Los Angeles to determine whether the route should be 
eliminated because of declining ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Service on Line 457 was recently cut from 10 to six trips a day because the 
number of passengers on the route has fallen from 400 riders a day in 1990, 
when the Blue Line began service, to below 100.The route runs along the Long 
Beach Freeway. The fare is $3.35 one way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been actually trying to cancel this line for a number of years because 
of the Blue Line," said Jon Hillmer, manager of operations for the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority. He added that Line 457 costs the MTA more money to 
operate than any other route because so few passengers patronize it. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials had proposed eliminating the route and two other express routes 
into Los Angeles from San Pedro and the South Bay, but instead decided to 
reduce the number of daily trips and monitor how many ride the buses until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 If the number of daily passengers on all three routes does not increase from 
about 300 people now to about 450 by the end of the year, the lines may yet be 
eliminated, Hillmer said. JOHN COX

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; NAVY REJECTS SHELTER PROJECT FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to turn part of an abandoned Navy housing development into shelter 
for the homeless has been rejected by the federal government, in part because 
project backers insisted on mandatory religious instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Outreach Appeal's proposal to turn 26 acres of the Cabrillo and 
Savannah projects into homeless housing had been approved by the federal 
Department of Health and Human Services last year. But the Los Angeles Mission, 
which had agreed to financially back the housing project, pulled out in July, 
saying it wouldn't participate unless it could make religious instruction 
mandatory for its homeless clients. The federal government prohibits mandatory 
religious participation in its projects. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Los Angeles Mission withdrew, Christian Outreach Appeal scrambled 
for a new backer, but couldn't get a firm commitment within the federal 
government's deadline. Last week, the 26 acres set aside for homeless 
transitional housing reverted to the Navy, and it is unclear if Christian 
Outreach Appeal will be allowed to reapply. 
</P>
<P>
 The 135 acres of former Navy housing on the city's west side had been split 
among several different agencies, besides the homeless group, with 62 acres set 
aside for middle schools and high schools, 30 acres for Cal State Long Beach 
research facilities and 17 acres for a federal job training center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what this means, as far as how the property will be divided 
now," said city spokeswoman Joan Caterino. "There's a whole lot of unknowns." 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which arranged much of the property split after acting as mediator 
between the groups, is waiting for guidance from the Navy, said Jerry Miller, 
manager of the city's economic development bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the local homeless services group is disappointed at the rejection of 
its application, leaders still hope the old Navy property will include shelter 
for the homeless, said the Rev. Cedric Hinson of Christian Outreach Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't an ego thing," Hinson said. "I don't personally have to be 
involved, nor does COA. We still want the idea to go forward." EMILY ADAMS

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; CIVIC LIGHT OPERA WILL RECEIVE $100,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The struggling Long Beach Civic Light Opera will receive $100,000 from the 
John S. and James L. Knight Foundation over three years, theater officials 
announced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knight Foundation grant will help theater officials match a $490,000 
funding package offered by the city last month. The city funding will be 
available, provided the Civic Light Opera can raise a matching amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater has struggled with low ticket sales and mounting costs. This 
year's opening production, "Can-Can," was postponed from this month to January 
after two top officials departed this summer.

COVER STORY; MOONLIGHT PATROL; CAREERS: TWO MOVIE INDUSTRY PROFESSIONALS SPEND 
OFF-HOURS FIGHTING CRIME AS RESERVE DEPUTIES. IN SOME WAYS, THE JOBS AREN'T ALL 
THAT DIFFERENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 By day, Jeff Zacha and Rob Kenneally carry cellular phones. In Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, they carry guns. In the Southeast area of Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 Every other weekend, these movie executives peel off their business suits for 
tan-and-green uniforms -- guns and badges in place -- and head out on patrol as 
Los Angeles County reserve sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever I've taken a friend (on) a ride," says Kenneally, a Brentwood 
resident, "they say, 'My God, you were having lunch with (ABC President) Ted 
Harbert today and now you're eating a Boys Burger in the 'hood in South-Central 
after responding to a homicide.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha, 39, a supervisor of post-production for Disney, and Kenneally, 35, 
executive vice president of Rysher Entertainment, met 11 years ago while 
training as reserves. They couldn't decide between law enforcement and show 
business, so they chose both. 
</P>
<P>
 Working part time with the Sheriff's Department they patrol West Compton, East 
Rancho Dominguez, Walnut Park, the Florence-Firestone District, Willowbrook and 
Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
 When on patrol, they are miles away in distance and demeanor from their 
full-time professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester resident Zacha is the liaison between filmmakers and Disney studio 
executives. He reviews budgets, hires editors and oversees technical standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally supervises production for several hours of programming, including 
"Robocop" and "Lonesome Dove," and seven feature films, including the upcoming 
Howard Stern movie, "Private Parts." 
</P>
<P>
 Going on patrol, they said, provides a counterbalance to the Hollywood glitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that we both work in a fantasy world, it's an incredibly strong 
balance," Kenneally says. "It's very therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha agrees. "It puts your problems into perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Both said they were attracted to law enforcement as young men. The interest 
has stayed with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started," Zacha says, "it was a little strange, the dichotomy, 
the two different worlds. Now it gels into one." 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha said film work and police duty both involve "the ability to act calmly 
under a tremendous amount of pressure and to come up with a way to resolve the 
problem. That's my job (at Disney), and that's my job (on patrol)." 
</P>
<P>
 Co-workers are impressed by their odd moonlighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always try and give back to the community in some way," said David McCann, 
a Disney senior vice president and Zacha's boss. "This is Jeff's way, and I 
think it's terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion their two worlds have merged. When Kenneally was a Fox TV network 
executive in the 1988, he helped develop the hit show "COPS." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the people who said we ought to do a cop show and put a video 
camera in the back seat" of patrol cars, he said. "If people at home had the 
same enthusiasm as (civilan ride-alongs), I knew it would be successful." 
</P>
<P>
 The duo are two of the Sheriff Department's 495 reserves in the Level I 
classification, the highest-trained part-time deputies, many of whom go on 
patrol. They go through most of the training of regular deputies and have the 
same authority as other sworn officers while on duty. In Los Angeles County, 
there are 900 reserve deputies. The program attracts doctors, lawyers, computer 
programmers and other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha and Kenneally may be the only movie executives who work Level I; they 
are certainly the only ones who work at the Century police station, said Lt. 
Gil Jurado, the second-in-command. 
</P>
<P>
 Century station ranks No. 1 per capita out of 21 Sheriff's Department stations 
in serious crimes such as murder, rape and robbery, Jurado said. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it even more attractive for Zacha and Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to know what it was to be a cop," Kenneally says. "The 
promise of Firestone-Lynwood was you would be involved in felony arrests and 
see police work as a real policeman would." 
</P>
<P>
 Their wives support their weekend work, though they worry about them getting 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha's wife of 16 months rode along with him one night before they married to 
better understand what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "She thinks it's great," he said. "She's very confident of my abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally's wife is less enthusiastic. "When she married me, she knew this 
came along with the territory. If she could, she would rather I didn't do it," 
said Kenneally, who has a 6-month-old daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the two have been in several dangerous situations in which they 
had to use their guns, though neither has shot anybody or been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In several instances, for example, suspects at the end of vehicle pursuits 
have fired on them, Zacha said. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent Friday night proved relatively calm for this area. Still, they 
experienced everything from the tragic to the lighthearted during the shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the evening, driving along Laurel Avenue between 94th and 95th 
streets, Zacha asks a group of men and women playing cards, "Is everything all 
right?" With a laugh, a woman responds: "Tell Johnny, happy birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 With that, Zacha turns on the lights. Kenneally shouts, "Happy birthday!" to 
one of the card players through the car's loudspeaker. When the deputies drive 
off, everyone smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood changes quickly as they pass a maze of metal fences surrounding a 
housing project. They both look around carefully. "There's a lot of crime here 
and a lot of dope here," Zacha says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody here is going to help the police," Kenneally says. 
</P>
<P>
 Built like a linebacker, the 6-foot, 2-inch Zacha can flick off his nice-guy 
smile and zap on a laser-like stare in a flash. Kenneally, an athletic 6-footer 
capable of intimidation when the need arises, projects a more genial persona. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally says the two "work as one. We've both got good gut instincts, 
knowing if something's wrong in a situation. Nine out of 10 times, we're 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're best friends," Zacha says. "We both know what our next move is going to 
be. That's important when it comes to officer safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Reserves are not assigned to units. Rather, they choose their own station. And 
Century is not for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurado, the second-in-command at the station, says a reserve deputy must be 
"somebody who is self-confident, who understands there is a lot of violence in 
this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurado says both men are outstanding cops. "To go ahead and accept another 
profession to the degree they have is phenomenal. . . . The full-time guys 
respect their skills and have confidence in their abilities, which is no easy 
feat in an area like this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the sun sets and night creeps in, they spot an old Monte Carlo on Compton 
Avenue driving erratically. They stop the car. The teen-age driver has no 
driver's license or registration. He says the car belongs to a relative. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I catch you driving this car later tonight, I'm going to arrest you," 
Zacha says, pointing him in the direction of home after ensuring the car hasn't 
been stolen. The deputies say that because the area has so much serious crime 
they can't afford to spend several hours arresting and booking everyone without 
a driver's license. Unfortunately, the teen-agers know this, so they save money 
by not registering their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 On 64th Street, they spot a teen-ager urinating outside a boarded-up eyesore 
with an old couch in front. The deputies call the teen-ager and two of his 
friends to the car. They wear baggy T-shirts, baggy pants and baseball caps 
turned backward. The deputies warn them not to create any disturbances. There 
have been several drive-by shootings on the street lately and the deputies are 
trying to break up gatherings to avoid the possibility of innocent bystanders 
getting injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm claiming this street tonight," Zacha says. "I'm coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied that the youths understand them, Kenneally and Zacha drive off. 
</P>
<P>
 They pass a junky lot with old, rusted-out cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Code 3" -- high alert -- crackles over the radio. The deputies flick on the 
lights and siren. They speed to the 8800 block of Fir Avenue in the Firestone 
district to investigate a hit-and-run. Once there, they discover to their 
horror that this is as bad as it gets. 
</P>
<P>
 A young girl, about 5 or 6 years old, lies in the middle of the street, the 
victim of an accident involving a dark-colored Camaro or Firebird that smacked 
into her and kept going. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Sheriff's Department squad cars are on the scene. As flashes of red 
and blue lights from the cars illuminate the scene, a resident huddles over the 
child. He tries to comfort her by staunching the blood from cuts on the child's 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 As Zacha and Kenneally help to disperse the crowd, paramedics arrive. Within 
seconds, six are attending to the child. In the background, Kenneally and Zacha 
are comforting the child's grandmother, whose cries of grief pierce the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene lasts only a few minutes. The paramedics quickly load the child onto 
a stretcher, wheel her into the ambulance and head for the hospital. When they 
are finished assisting the other deputies and clearing the scene, Zacha and 
Kenneally head off. A helicopter hovers overhead, helping in the search for the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to nail this guy," Kenneally says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, the deputies stop for a quick bite at the Boys Burger stand 
on Compton Avenue. Between bites of a monster-size hamburger, Kenneally 
explains what brings him to this part of town, at this time of night. "There's 
a camaraderie here, which is not always the case in Hollywood," Kenneally says. 
</P>
<P>
 He adds that there is another difference: "In this business, you can spot the 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Zacha says police work has helped his film work. "My fellow employees admire 
me for taking the time to do something that most people don't even want to know 
about. Most people spend their lives staying away from crime-ridden areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they've seen the worst, that doesn't stop them from seeing the best. 
"There's a lot of great people here," Zacha says. "Some of the nicest people 
I've met are from the inner city." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on patrol, they hand out a ticket to a woman who sped through a red 
light, break up a potential disturbance back on 64th Street and counsel a group 
of gang members on going straight. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing happens that is as serious as the hit-and-run. Before checking out 
around midnight, they learn the young girl has died. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I get home," says Kenneally, "I'm going to hug my little girl a little 
bit tighter."

 Before they hit the streets, Los Angeles County sheriff's reserves hit the 
books. Level I reserves such as Jeff Zacha and Robert Kenneally must go through 
409 hours of training at the sheriff's training academy in Whittier.They learn 
everything from how to handle domestic disturbances to proper handcuffing 
technique and firearms training. The academy training is followed by 200 hours 
of field training and an additional 200 hours of in-service work. 
</P>
<P>
 After completing their training, reserve deputies are issued a badge, 
identification card and a service revolver. Then the real work begins. They 
must volunteer a minimum of 20 hours per month -- 16 hours of shift duty plus 
four hours of meetings. While on duty, reserve deputies have the same authority 
as regular deputies. Off duty, they may not carry a concealed weapon without a 
state permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Police Department also relies on a corps of reserve officers. 
The department's 99 Level I reserves complete 320 hours of training and share 
the same duties as regular officers. The reserves are required to volunteer two 
shifts a month, a total of 20 hours. They also must attend six hours of 
additional training a month to learn about changes in laws and department 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Police Department hopes to double the number of Level I reserves in five 
years to help bolster the sworn police force, said Sgt. Richard Montoya, the 
reserve coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Frank Decker, who trains reserve deputies for the Sheriff's Department, 
says those who make it through the academy are a special breed. "The reserves 
are a great source of pride and a substantial asset," Decker said. "They bring 
in a lot of expertise from their civilian professions." ROBERT WYNNE

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: FRENCH DRESSING ADORNS JO JO'S

 "When someone walked into a bordello, they were always warmly welcomed. That's 
how I want to make people feel here." 
</P>
<P>
 So says Mario Nasab, owner of the House of Madame Jo Jo's, a five-month-old 
Mediterranean restaurant that has already attracted a loyal following. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasab, a big fan of the Roaring '20s, has modeled his Long Beach restaurant 
after a 1920s French bordello, complete with French postcards, slinky cocktail 
dresses and provocative oil paintings lining the walls. A large chandelier 
illuminates the room. Nasab named this small place after two of his former 
loves, his first wife, Joanne, who was called Jo, and his second love, also a 
Joanne known as Jo. 
</P>
<P>
 Watch for Jo Jo on the menu, too. The appetizer Madame Jo Jo ($8.95 for two) 
is a painter's palette of red and yellow peppers, bruschetta, marinated 
mushrooms, mozzarella with fresh basil and tomatoes, hummus, sliced carrots and 
a grilled lamb patty, with roasted cloves of garlic to smear on rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasab used to work at one of Long Beach's most prominent restaurants, L'Opera, 
and pastas are a specialty. The one to order is the Madame Jo Jo. This very 
accommodating dish can be two things: one pasta with whatever sauce you desire, 
or a sampling of four of the pasta-and-sauce combinations on the menu. It is a 
superb way to sample chef Jose Betancourt's fresh-made pastas. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the biggest sellers is the lobster ravioli ($8.95), filled with chunks 
of lobster and topped with a lobster cream sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the menu changes weekly, a few favorites are always available: a 
seven-chop rack of lamb with fresh mint ($13.95), filet mignon with 
brandy-mustard-green peppercorn sauce ($13.95) and paella BoBo ($9.50), the 
saffron-infused rice topped with shrimp, clams, crab, scallops and mussels. 
</P>
<P>
 The House of Madame Jo Jo's is at 2941 E. Broadway, Long Beach. (310) 
439-3672. Open Monday through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m., Sunday through 
Thursday 5 to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 5 to 11 p.m.

 St. Paul High beat Santa Fe, 28-0, Friday to remain unbeaten against its 
cross-town rival since the football teams' first meeting in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul quarterback Gerry Ceballos, however, took the first hit from Santa Fe 
nose guard Jorge Figueroa two days before the opening kickoff, police say. 
Ceballos and Figueroa reportedly became involved in a scuffle at a 
Jack-In-The-Box restaurant in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight apparently erupted after Ceballos, 16, and Figueroa, 17, exchanged 
words outside the fast-food restaurant on Telegraph Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa said he punched Ceballos, possibly once or twice in the face, after 
the St. Paul quarterback repeatedly insulted the Santa Fe football team, 
according to a report taken by Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the afternoon, Figueroa said Ceballos drove by Santa Fe High during 
practice and flashed a sarcastic smile, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos filed assault charges against Figueroa and St. Paul Athletic Director 
Robert Oviedo requested Figueroa be held out of Friday's game. Both players 
played in the nonleague game at Pioneer High. Ceballos completed five of 10 
passes for 69 yards and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation is pending, but Sheriff's Sgt. Tom Campbell, who plans to 
question Ceballos and Figueroa, said charges are unlikely to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of two guys jawing off at each other," Campbell said.
