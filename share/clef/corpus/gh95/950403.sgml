In Louisiana
FOR weeks now golf fans have been following Davis Love III and the
agonising saga of his attempts to win a tournament and thus gain entry
to the Masters. Yesterday was Love's last chance for a trip to Magnolia
Lane, and it was a battle before he got it.
Love, 30, one of the most talented and well-liked young players on
tour, did not win last year and missed by less than $1000 the chance to
finish in the top 30 on the 1994 money list and gain his invitation to
Augusta that way.
He started the day with the lead, was as many as three strokes behind,
had a two-stroke lead with two to play, and ended up winning on the
second hole of sudden-death with a birdie from four feet.
Mike Heinen, a local Louisiana boy from Lake Charles, nearly upset the
Love story to become the first native Louisianian to win the New Orleans
Classic.
Heinen was part of the pack hovering in and around the lead on the
front nine, but pitched in for eagle on the par-5 eleventh hole to get
to 15 under par, at the time three strokes ahead of Love. Heinen then
birdied the thirteenth to get to 16 under, parring his way to the final
hole, while Love, playing four holes behind him, caught him at 16 under.
The local player thought he had killed his chances for a second career
win by hitting his second shot into the water at the last and making
double bogey.
This gave Love the chance to play the final four with a two-stroke
lead. He parred the par-5 fifteenth easily, the next less so, making a
six-footer for par. He was bunkered at the seventeenth and missed
virtually the same par putt he had made on the previous hole.
With just a one-stroke lead, Love went to the last -- the toughest
hole on the course. Love missed the water with his second shot by a few
yards, ending up in a bunker. The bunker shot went 12 feet by, and he
lipped out the par putt which would have won it for him.
But Love is now on his way to Augusta National.
Ian Woosnam has a few questions of his own about next week. After a
five-bogey 41 on English Turn's front nine Woosnam felt like walking in.
''And I almost did,'' he said afterwards. ''I played so bad on the front
it was unbelievable. Then I changed my swing a little and just ripped it
on the back nine. I think because I'd been playing in the wind so much I
had been rolling it back a bit.'' The resulting 33 coming in boosted
Woosnam's hopes for next week.
Woosnam's total was 74, four under par for the tournament, one stroke
behind Sandy Lyle. The Scot had his second successive round of 71
yesterday, a disappointment after having got to seven under par after
nine holes. Still, Lyle is more optimistic this week than he has been
upon leaving the past two tournaments, from which he took his exit two
days early. ''My mid-irons are good, which will be important next week.
I just need some putts to drop.'' Final scores (US players unless
noted):
274 -- D Love III 68, 69, 66, 71; M Heinen 66, 71, 71, 66.
275 -- D Duval 67, 68, 71, 69.

to leave him 14 shots behind joint leaders Jack Nicklaus and Japan's
Isao Aoki at the Tradition Senior Classic in Scottsdale, Arizona.

AUSTRALIA demolished West Indies' batting line-up for the second time
in less than three days yesterday to score their first win at
Bridgetown's Kensington Oval.
They won by 10 wickets, seamer Glenn McGrath starring with a
career-best five for 68 as West Indies were bundled out for 189.
The home side had resumed at 13-0 seeking to erase a 151-run
first-innings deficit. But three wickets fell for just 18 runs in the
first 40 minutes -- including two to McGrath.
West Indies captain Richie Richardson (36) engineered a minor
fightback after four wickets fell cheaply, but was bowled by Paul
Reiffel in the last over before lunch.

BOXING
RENATO ''Ric'' Magramo flew into Glasgow yesterday afternoon following
a 16-hour journey from the Philippines.
And the first thing he told us was that he wasn't too confident about
taking the World Boxing Organisation light-flyweight championship from
Irvine's Paul Weir at the Magnum on Wednesday night.
First impressions were that the little fellow had come an awful long
way to throw in the towel three days before the fight, but those changed
when the little smile was noticed on the face of Magramo's manager,
Johnny Elorde.
The challenger, with Elorde interpreting, said: ''I feel very tired
after the journey. No, at this moment I am not very confident, but that
may change on the night.''
Elorde himself, confirmed that it all may have been a bit of
gamesmanship when he said later: ''Ric is a fighter rather than a boxer,
and you can be sure he has come to Scotland to fight.''
Weir, who will be having only his tenth professional contest on
Wednesday -- five of them for world titles -- was completely unphased by
it all and, in fact, got in the first blow in the psychological
build-up.
As the Philippines' contingent took their places for their session
with the press, the Scot handed each of them a coloured picture of
himself wearing the championship belt.
''Before you start, I've got a present for you,'' he said. ''At least
you'll be going back home with something.''
There is, however, no chance of the Scot being over-confident. He
said: ''I saw a video of Magramo making his last defence of the
Philippines' title in January, and he is a seasoned professional. Anyone
who challenges for a title is a threat and I won't be underestimating
him.
''I see myself retaining the title, however, and whether it is on
points or a stoppage, doesn't really matter. I am getting better and
more mature all the time and I don't believe the public has seen the
best of Paul Weir yet. I believe I will win on Wednesday, then it will
be on to better and bigger things.''
* CRAWFORD Ashley, of Leeds, failed in his bid to take the WBA light
heavyweight crown from Virgil Hill, of the United States, who won a
12-round unanimous decision in Nevada, at the weekend.
In a second world title fight on the card, undefeated Ricardo Lopez,
of Mexico, successfully defended his WBC strawweight championship for
the 14th time by stopping Andy Tabanas, of the Philippines, after 2
minutes 45 seconds of the 12th round.
* Gerald McClellan flew home to the United States yesterday five weeks
after he was rushed to hospital for brain surgery following a world
title fight with Nigel Benn. He still needs a tracheotomy tube to help
with his breathing and is being fed intravenously.

IT should have been a good week for Dundee United but, from a
promising beginning, with the appointment of Billy Kirkwood as manager,
last week ended in farce and disappointment.
Despair began to descend on Tannadice on Saturday only seconds into
United's match with Rangers, whose Gordon Durie scored the first of the
goals which prevented Kirkwood from starting his new career with a
significant win which would have eased them clear of the relegation
mire.
However, Kirkwood will probably drag the team clear, but it will be
much harder for the club to haul themselves away from the notion that
they are becoming a petty, almost insular organisation.
Their image is not good and it will take the PR firm who are
conducting their media affairs some time to convince the outside world
that United are worthy of respect.
Certainly their peculiar request last week, that the SFA investigate a
transfer deal during Ivan Golac's short reign as manager, suggests
otherwise.
Apparently United were acting on information received from
journalists, the very same forces of evil against whom Tannadice club's
chairman, Jim McLean, has been waging war for a couple of decades. We
are to believe that suddenly the chairman believes what the men from the
fourth estate have to say.
Why the change? Why didn't United investigate the matter quietly
themselves before presenting damning evidence to the SFA and the rest of
the world?
McLean, especially when he is under pressure and unwilling to answer
difficult questions, is fond of pointing out that United are not a
one-man outfit, that the other directors have equal rights and are
capable of speaking for themselves.
If that is the case, then the entire board of directors at Tannadice
behaved without character last week.
If they have a genuine grievance regarding the transfer of Henrik
Jorgensen, then they ought to have investigated it thoroughly themselves
before approaching the SFA.
More importantly, in the light of current investigations south of the
Border, they should have given some thought to the reputation of their
former manager.
It would be naive to believe Scottish football has always been scandal
free, but if anyone wishes to cast aspersions on another, it would make
sense to be absolutely sure of the facts.
Having aroused interest and speculation, United should not be allowed
to step back and clam up as though the matter has nothing more to do
with them, and the SFA ought to press McLean and his directors to
explain in greater detail their reasons for having asked for the
assistance of the association in the first place.
It is not good enough for them to retreat back into their boardroom
until the matter fades into memory.
The supporters are entitled to know if there has been any impropriety
within the Scottish game.
It also will be interesting to see if Golac, who was reported to have
been hurt by United's action, pursues the matter, although in one
respect he was guilty beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. Golac smiled a
lot, and that may have been his most heinous crime within the walls of
Tannadice.
Football with a smile? Get out of here, Ivan.
Of course, league results during his two-year term were not a source
of amusement, but Golac couldn't help himself. He looked on the bright
side of everything and his self belief couldn't be shaken, though the
performances of his team were suggesting he might not be the manager he
thinks he is, even if he did win the Scottish Cup in his first season
with United.
He might go on and prove himself to be an exceptional manager with
some other club -- and I hope he does -- but whatever happens it would
be a mistake if Scottish football were to turn away from foreign
influences simply because United and Golac didn't gel.
The failure of that experiment can be looked upon as the wrong man
being at the wrong club at the wrong time.
Golac and United were a bad marriage, that's all. It might work with
some other club and another character from one of those countries where
skill and technique are valued above endeavour.
When you think of it, there is a huge world out there waiting to be
trawled for coaches, because there are very few places with a greater
disdain than our own for the subtleties of the game.
Certainly Alex Smith, chairman of the managers and coaches'
association, believes clubs shouldn't turn their backs on Europe, and
insists we can learn something from foreigners who have different ideas
and methods, some of which could be grafted on to our game.
''Yes, we would be making a mistake of we felt now that European
coaches couldn't help us in some ways,'' Smith said. ''I believe they
can.''
However, perhaps next time it would be better to bring in a foreign
coach and allow him to work with younger players, people who are still
impressionable and who would respond more readily to new ways. After
all, there seems little point in trying to alter the philosophy of a
30-year-old Scottish pro.

WITH just four miles to go in the London Marathon, Portugal's Antonio
Pinto was riding off with the spoils. He held a 54-second lead, and
looked uncatchable. But then the world's two leading exponents, Dionicio
Ceron and Steve Moneghetti, took the bit between their teeth, galloping
in pursuit and into the history books.
Pinto, who had promised to sit back and ''sweep up the pieces in a
sack'' if the other pair set off at their threatened world-record pace,
was inside such a pace himself at halfway, in 63min 21sec, then paid the
price.
Defending champion Ceron (Mexico), and Australia's Commonwealth gold
medallist, Moneghetti, caught Pinto in the final three-quarters of a
mile, then the Mexican waved in victory, 50 metres out, sprinting clear
up The Mall to win by 10 seconds in 2-08-30.
He is the first man to win the event twice, and the race's biggest
male beneficiary, with $80,000 in winnings and bonuses on top of a start
fee of $200,000. Add that to last year's take and he is approaching
$500,000.
Ceron lives at 8500 feet in Toluca, but goes up to train at 10,000
feet -- 140 miles per week for a month, on the run-in to this event, he
confided.
North Berwick artist Scott Cohen was the leading Scot, a creditable
twenty-seventh (2-20-17) on his debut, claiming the scalps of two of the
world's all-time top 10. He beat Abebe Mekkonen, last year's runner-up,
by one second, and Juma Ikangaa, the former Commowealth silver
medallist, by 46.
Glasgow-born Paul Evans, the former Springburn Harrier who elected to
adopt English nationality, was the leading Briton in fifth. ''When I
heard how far in front Pinto was, I was sure he would win,'' he said.
''I could not believe these guys running him down. They were with me
less than four miles out, but beat me by two minutes. It was awesome.''
Scotland's Liz McColgan, also fifth, but who has never won, has,
remarkably earned more from this event than Pinto, with her winnings and
appearances' deal.
She ran comfortably at the back of the lead group of eight, who
allowed the pacemaker, Cathy Shum, and American Kim Jones to break clear
and reach half-distance in 73-55. But McColgan became detached soon
after, and three-times winner Katrin Dorre was also soon in trouble.
McColgan persevered alone, picked off Dorre, then cut down Jones in
the closing stages. But by then Sobanska was locked in a battle with
European champion Manuela Machado and Finland's Ritva Lemettinen.
Sobanska finished with a 5-16 mile, the fastest of the race, to beat
Machado by 10 seconds. It was her first marathon win in six starts and
her best time by 83 seconds.
Lemettinen finished third in 2-28-00 exactly. One second faster would
have earned her a further $5000 in bonuses. A pity, because the Finn
dedicated her medal to the people of Kobe and may give some her winnings
to the fund for earthquake victims. She was there for a marathon when
the tremors struck last year and was trapped on the fourteenth floor of
her hotel. ''I thought I would die,'' she said. ''It taught me how
important life is.''
Lynn Harding, who ran for Scotland at the Commonwealths in Canada last
year, was third UK finisher, sixteenth, in 2-41-20 -- a commentary on
the state of UK women's marathon running, as the Milngavie women is
giving up athletics to concentrate on cycling.
NutraSweet, the race backers, have reached the end of their contract
and officials are now at a delicate stage of negotiation for a
successor, according to Chris Brasher, the event's founder.
In the past 10 years there have been just two British male winners,
Scotland's Allister Hutton, and Eamonn Martin, while the only UK woman
to have won was French-born Veronique Marot.
''It remains a source of sorrow that, for all the event's success, it
has never achieved its stated goal of revitalising British marathon
running,'' said former Olympic steeplechase champion Brasher.
''Despite having raised #750,000 for the British Athletics Federation,
from road-running fees, that money has all been dissipated. It should
have been spent on the shop window, improving the elite.''

Bolton Wanderers 1, Liverpool 2
SCOTLAND striker John McGinlay saw only part of his impossible dream
come true at Wembley yesterday.
The man from the Highlands did hold his place in Bolton's side,
despite being taken away by Scotland from a promotion battle at
Portsmouth last weekend.
The player who stood on the terracing as a member of the Tartan Army,
played in the Coca-Cola Cup final -- but then had to suffer the agony of
defeat against Liverpool.
And yet it took two moments of individual magic from Liverpool's Steve
McManaman to send Bolton, their manager Bruce Rioch, and McGinlay to
defeat.
The result was vital for Liverpool, of course, because not only did it
give manager Roy Evans a trophy, it also helped re-establish the club as
a force in the land once more.
However, it said a lot for Rioch's team that they could go two goals
down and then, at the death, still be handing Liverpool problems.
When other teams would have given in, Bolton did not. That is to their
eternal credit because, as well as the genius of McManaman, Bolton's
team spirit made this match the spectacle it became.
A goal down at half-time -- albeit unluckily -- they came out
attacking in the second half. Perhaps they realised things had gone
cruelly against them inside a three-minute spell which turned things
Liverpool's way.
In 34 minutes, David James somehow reached a fine shot from Alan
Thompson and pushed it on to and over the bar. It was the best try of
the game so far and it had fallen to Bolton, but James had thwarted
them.
Worse was to follow just three minutes later when McManaman decided to
take a hand in things. He carried the ball past two men on a mazy run
and then shot into the net.
When the second half began they seemed to have accepted they were down
-- but refused to believe they were out.
But then McManaman decided to take control again. He weaved his way
through the Bolton defence, and finished with a shot which curled into
the net away from the keeper.
Yet, a minute later, the first-division side were back with a
spectacular shot from Thompson. He turned on the ball after Liverpool's
defence had failed to clear it and volleyed a drive past James.
That, really, was the end of the action. But there still were times
when Bolton threatened, simply refusing to give in.
Bolton's contribution was enormous, even though their industry, and
their organisation, could never match McManaman's magic.
Afterwards McGinlay admitted: ''It took two special moments to defeat
us. Moments that everyone will remember. ''It has been a marvellous
adventure, but promotion to the Premiership is a priority.''
The only worry of the Bolton players, directors, and fans is whether
Rioch will still be with them if they do make that leap onwards and
upwards. He has emerged as favourite for the manager's job at Arsenal.
But if McGinlay was pleased, team-mate Owen Coyle, left out yesterday,
wants to return to Scotland. He was upset by Rioch's decision to leave
him in the stand -- without even a place on the substitutes' bench --
and now his unrest could again interest Celtic, who have tracked him for
some months.

AUSTRALIAN world championship leader Michael Doohan won the 500cc
Malaysian Grand Prix yesterday, continuing his dominance of the new
season.
Doohan dominated from start to finish, blazing around the 71.7 miles
at Shah Alam in 47min.54.380sec. to finish ahead of fellow Australian
Daryl Beattie.
Doohan, who won the inaugural event of the racing season at Eastern
Creek, Australia, last week, said he tried to break from the pack early
on ''but I had a few slides and then decided I'd better calm down.''
Beattie, also on a Honda, who also finished second at Eastern Creek,
said he was never close to catching Doohan, and battled with Spain's
Alex Criville and Keven Schwantz of the United States for second place.
World Champion Massimiliano Biaggi of Italy, riding an Aprilia, won
the 250cc race, finishing the 67.4-mile course in 45:27.292.

DEFENDING champions Midlothian and last year's beaten finalist East
Lothian set up an action replay this Saturday in the CIS Insurance
Scottish Cup final at Bainfield after both sides battled to four shot
semi-final wins at the weekend.
Midlothian secured their final spot again when they beat Headwell
76-72 at Blantyre, while East Lothian, inaugural winners of the event in
1989, beat West Lothian 77-73 at Edinburgh.
The rinks draw for this Saturday's final has produced some interesting
confrontations. Midlothian's national singles champion Paul Conlan takes
on a previous winner of the title Graham Robertson, Willie Peacock faces
Angus Blair, David Peacock lines up against Ian Bell and Willie Rankin
faces Willie Wood.
Despite Midlothian being the holders East Lothian will line up as
favourites.
Midlothian, who won last year's final 74-72 have struggled throughout
this season and were relegated from the first division just a couple of
months ago.
Their cup form, however, has been a different matter although they'll
need to be at their best on Saturday to retain the trophy. Results:
East Lothian 77, West Lothian 73 (G Robertson 14, G Sneddon 22; I Bell

MEN'S HOCKEY
TOUCHE Ross Gordonians are one of the most frustrating clubs in
Scotland. Despite their wealth of young talent, they promise so much but
fulfil so little, writes Joseph Dillon.
Subsequently, when they produce their best performance of the season
-- like on Saturday, All Fools Day -- and beat championship favourites
MIM 1-0, enthusiasts have to be convinced that the scoreline is not a
fake.
The meeting of Gordonians and MIM at Aberdeen, while producing the
shock of the day, was not short of drama, entertainment, or tension.
Phil Webster converted a second-minute penalty corner and, from then
on, the game was balanced on a knife-edge as Gordonians tried to
consolidate their advantage and then, after the interval, when MIM made
a bid to salvage a point.
The pressure was reflected in a disciplinary count of seven yellow
cards and one red. MIM were clear winners of this unwanted statistic,
taking all but two yellows, with their captain Steve Grubb not being
allowed to finish the contest. He now faces a suspension and could well
miss most of his team's championship run-in as they try to claw back
Grange's advantage.
Meanwhile, Clydesdale are back in the top flight after winning the
second division title. They made certain of the trophy by beating Morgan
2-0 from scores by David Rutherglen and Russell Bradley.
In Germany, where Grange were putting the finishing touches to their
preparations for the finals of the A Division in the European
Cup-winners' Cup at Cagliari in Sardinia at Easter, the Edinburgh club
played four matches against Frankfurt 1880, but lost the series 3-1.
Results:

LIVINGSTON Bulls completed a Scottish Cup and league double for the
seventh year in a row when they defeated Glasgow Brightsiders 74-61 in
the cup final at Meadowbank Sports Centre yesterday, writes Duncan West.
Although Ian Maclean scored 28 points, Livingston owed their success
to a fine all-round team performance. The 39-year-old Bobby Archibald
scored a remarkable 16 points in his eighteenth final and picked up his
fifteenth winner's medal. Alongside him with 16 points was Gordon Smith,
who last season was in the Glasgow ranks.
Despite their height advantage Glasgow, as they had been in the league
decider the previous Sunday, gave away far too many offensive rebounds.
Livingston led 39-27 at half-time, and survived a slight crisis midway
through the second half when Tony McDaid helped Glasgow level the scores
at 54-54. McDaid scored 16 points in one of his best displays of the
season.
Alan Kiddie was top-scorer for Glasgow with 20, including four
first-half three-pointers.
Polonia Phoenix also completed the double when they defeated Edinburgh
rivals Royal High 62-50 in the women's final.

WOMEN'S HOCKEY
BONAGRASS Grove celebrated the most successful 24-hours in the club's
history at the weekend, writes Joseph Dillon.
They scored their first victory over Western Klick Photopoint in the
national league on Saturday, then advanced to the Scottish Cup final for
the first time yesterday with a 2-0 defeat of Division 2 Eglinton.
It will, however, be the 2-1 victory over Western which will live
longest in the players' memories, for this was only the second time in
the 14 seasons of the championship that Western have been beaten.
Pauline Robertson hit a fully deserved winner 11 minutes from time
after Susan MacDonald had equalised an earlier counter by Nikki
Klepplang.
It was Robertson, too, who opened Grove's account against Eglinton,
this time following a superb solo run.
Some fine defence by Eglinton's experienced campaigners Chris Wise,
Babs Dawson, and Judith Martin kept Grove at bay until 51 minutes, when
Grove's captain, Audrey Sime, converted a penalty for the second goal.
Mike Gilbert, coach of Scotland's under-21 side, was not amused to see
his side lose all three matches at Bisham Abbey. They crashed 9-0 on
Friday night to England's senior side and then suffered 3-0 defeats in
their internationals with England and South Africa.
With the European Junior Championship qualifying tournament at Poznam,
Poland, Gilbert clearly has his work cut out if Scotland are to secure
one of the three places in the finals. Results:

The USA already had clinched the tie on Saturday and moved into the
semi-finals against Sweden. The tie ended 5-0 when Pete Sampras won
against Andrea Gaudenzi 6-3, 1-6, 6-3 and Palmer defeated Renzo Furlan
6-4, 6-3 to complete the sweep.
Stefan Edberg and Magnus Larsson completed a 5-0 rout of Austria for
the Cup holders. Edberg beat Thomas Muster 6-4, 6-2, and Larsson
defeated Gilbert Schaller 7-6 (7-4), 6-4.
Boris Becker, who was upset by Paul Haarhuis in four sets on Friday,
had a 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1 victory over Richard Krajicek. Michael Stich
then beat Haarhuis 6-3, 4-6, 6-4 to give Germany a 4-1 win over the

In the semi-final they will meet Russia, who beat South Africa 4-1.

EDINBURGH Racers' gamble in flying their squad to Cardiff for a
crucial British championship play-off clash paid off when they pocketed
a valuable point in a 6-6 draw.
It could have been two but for a breakaway strike from Devils' Great
Britain international marksman Ian Cooper three minutes from time.
But Racers' general manager Allan Maxwell said: ''We're delighted at
the result. This is one of the most difficult rinks to come to and we
almost pulled off a great win.
''We treated the players professionally and they turned in a
professional performance in a high-quality game which keeps us on course
for a semi-final place at Wembley.
''We've been beaten 16-5 and 6-1 in Cardiff this season and to almost
pull off a win is a tremendous lift for the club.''
In the promotion play-offs, Paisley Pirates bounced back after a
defeat by Peterborough Pirates to put themselves back in contention for
promotion with a 5-2 win at Bracknell Bees. Results:
Saturday: British Championship play-offs. Group A -- Fife 7, Sheffield

Basingstoke 3, Durham 2.

in less than three days yesterday to score their first win at
Bridgetown's Kensington Oval.
They won by 10 wickets, seamer Glenn McGrath starring with a
career-best five for 68 as West Indies were bundled out for 189.
The home side had resumed at 13-0 seeking to erase a 151-run
first-innings deficit. But three wickets fell for just 18 runs in the
first 40 minutes -- including two to McGrath.
West Indies captain Richie Richardson (36) engineered a minor
fightback after four wickets fell cheaply, but was bowled by Paul
Reiffel in the last over before lunch.

AS widely predicted, Cambridge took the Beefeater Trophy for the third
successive time on Saturday, beating Oxford by 12 seconds in the 141st
University Boat Race.
Following the performance of their outstanding crew last year,
Cambridge were always favourities to win this year, too, but in the last
few weeks' build-up to the race, Oxford had done enough, under the
guidance of their previous guru, Dan Topolski, to cause a ripple of
uncertainty.
That dark-blue hope was given life in the first few strokes of the
race when Oxford were clearly faster. After 15 strokes, they had pushed
their bows in front by a few feet. However, Cambridge got into their
stride and, with the umpire warning Oxford for coming too close to them,
gradually pulled level.
In a trial of nerve for both coxes, the crews raced side by side for
the next few minutes, but Cambridge always had the upper hand, with
Oxford struggling to stay in touch.
By just short of Hammersmith Bridge, and a third of the way through
the race, Cambridge had almost pulled clear, quickly and smoothly moving
out to a comfortable cushion.
With the race won, all Cambridge had to do was concentrate on their
technique, while the on-board cameras treated the world-wide television
audience of 400 million to a succession of agonised close-ups of the
Oxford crew as they tried, with grim determination, not to disgrace
themselves.
Cambridge crossed the line in 18min 4sec with a brave Oxford crew four
lengths behind.

Classic British Open at Plymouth yesteday, pipping Cardiff's Paul Davies
5-4 in the first round.
''It is good to start a tournament with a tough match, providing you
win, and Paul certainly made me work for that,'' said Davis.
Snooker's premier event starts at Sheffield's Crucible just five days
after next Sunday's 17-frame British Open final.
Alan McManus, the world No.6, produced his best form since winning the
Dubai Duty Free Classic at the beginning of the season to beat
Nottingham's Anthony Hamilton 5-2.
McManus, who now faces Stoke's former Asian Open champion Dave Harold
in Tuesday's second round, lost 5-3 to Hamilton in the Regal Welsh Open
second round at Newport in January, and he said: ''Anthony has really
impressed me.''

with victory in Saturday's Paragon Scullers Head of the River Race in

Plank took 22 minutes to cover the
five-kilometre course, an indication of how difficult the wind made
conditions on the Clyde. He beat Clydesdale's David Nolan into second
place with Stirling's Willie Brown third.
Aberdeen's David Pattulo had a successful weekend, winning the double
sculls with John Walters in the morning and the restricted singles in
the afternoon.
Peter Haining, the world lightweight sculling champion, yesterday
opened the new clubhouse wing of Aberdeen Boat Club. This is yet another
landmark in the success story of the club which is easily rowing's most
progressive organisation.
The new extension, which cost #160,000 -- all raised by the members --
doubles the club's boat-rack space and gives members a new gymnasium.
The development is in sharp contrast to the dilapidated conditions
that nearly every other Scottish rowing club has to endure.

A ROW of figures caught the eye this week. No, not the Scottish
Claymores' all-singing, all-dancing cheerleaders.
Digest this, if you can.
The third Rugby World Cup, which takes place during May and June in
South Africa, will -- we are assured -- amass a profit of some #20m. The
action will be beamed live to 120 countries and the cumulative fireside
audience is expected to be around 2.5 billion.
Like Topsy, the game has just growed. Profits from this year's bonanza
are expected to surpass the total turn-over from the event four years
ago, just as the surplus from the 1991 tournament overtook all of the
revenue generated by the inaugural competition in Australia and New
Zealand four years before that.
Last weekend, the All Blacks and Fijians contested the final of the
glittering Hong Kong sevens in the splendid new stadium which will host
the World Sevens Championship in 1997. Again, this tournament generated
millions of dollars.
All of which, by a scenic and circuitous route, brings us back to
Scotland, the Borders, and down to earth with a bump.
It is April, and the seven-a-sides are with us again. As they say in
the movies, any resemblance between the the Hong Kong extravaganza and
the concept dreamed up by the Melrose butcher, Ned Haig, back in 1883 is
coincidental. But not entirely so.
The Rugby World Cup, the Hong Kong Sevens and, now, the RWC
seven-a-side tournament are glorious sporting occasions in their own
right. But they are also money-spinners. The World Cup competitions in
particular are the dripping roasts on which the worldwide game is happy
to feed.
And therein lies the real connection with the ''Sports'' which Haig
and the Melrose club inaugurated at the Greenyards on April 25, 1883.
''Want of money made us rack our brains as to what was to be done to
keep the club from going to the wall,'' wrote a contemporary of Haig.
The ''Sports,'' so-called because there was foot-racing and all the
fun of the fair, as well as the rugby, proved to be a money-spinner, and
soon other Border clubs jumped on the Melrose butcher's bandwagon.
And so it remains to this day. Against all the odds, the Border
seven-a-side circuit has survived. The Melrose tournament apart, the
sevens are not as popular as they were a decade ago, but they still make
much needed money -- ask any Border treasurer -- and as part of the rich
tradition of Scottish rugby, they deserve to survive.
They are looked upon as a burdensome chore by many of the city clubs
which, in days gone by. would despatch their top players in an effort to
bring home the Border bacon. But, still, they deserve to survive.
The Border clubs' reluctance to give up their seven-a-side Saturdays
sounded the death-knell for the unofficial cup competitions of recent
memory. How could they ever succeed with some of Scotland's top clubs
absent?
Next season, with the advent of an SRU sanctioned cup competition, the
Border sevens will probably come under threat again. Currently the cup
quarter-finals are scheduled to be played after Hawick Sevens, with the
semis taking place on the Sunday following the Jed tournament.
How long will it be, one wonders, before city clubs begin agitating
for the roles to be reversed, with the sevens on Sundays, and the cup on
Saturdays. This could be the thin edge of a very fine wedge.
The sevens deserve to survive -- in harmony with expansions in the
game elsewhere -- not just because they are part of the tradition of the
Scottish game. And not just because they gladden the hearts of
treasurers from Milntown to Poynder Park. They deserve to survive
because they have also served -- and can still serve -- as the stage on
which some of our finest players have honed their skills.

LITHUANIAN marksman Dainius Bauba jetted back from world-championship
duty to help Paisley Pirates back into promotion contention at the top
of group A.
Bauba was inspirational in the 5-2 win at Bracknell and hit a hat
trick in last night's 9-7 success over first-division champions Slough.
Captain Mike Bettens also hit three.
Edinburgh Racers edged closer to a British championship semi-final at
Wembley. They were denied victory at defending champions Cardiff by an
Ian Cooper goal late on but last night Racers cruised to a 9-3 win over
Basingstoke.
A mass brawl at the final hooter ended with defenceman Paul Hand
receiving a gross misconduct. His younger brother, Tony, and Scott
Plews, plus two Beavers were given game misconducts.
Fife Flyers lost at Nottingham but stayed on course for a semi-final
after Saturday's win over premier champions Sheffield Steelers 7-5.

MAJOR League Baseball owners voted yesterday to begin the season on
April 26 with regular players, who ended their 232-day strike on Friday,
Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos said. ''Everyone is delighted.
Baseball is restored in its original and traditional form,'' Angelos
said.
The vote was unanimous against a lock-out of the regular players,
Angelos said upon emerging from an owners' meeting on yesterday's
scheduled and then cancelled replacement-player Opening Day. The
replacements were released on Saturday night.

CEILIDH Boy, one of two horses forced to pull up in the notorious
fence incident at Kelso last Friday, gained some compensation at
Sedgefield when he won the McEwan's Durham National Handicap Chase.
Although delighted by the success, Earlston permit-holder Dawn
Goodfellow was in anything but a forgiving mood.
She is still angry over the incident in which Eastern Oasis fell at
the second fence in the three-mile handicap chase and failed to get up.
With the fatally injured horse lying behind the fence it was dolled off,
leaving only eight feet available for jumping on the second circuit.
Eight got over but Ceilidh Boy and Side of Hill, trained by Bruce
Mactaggart, had nowhere to go and pulled up.
Goodfellow insisted the race should have been void because of the
inherent dangers. ''I have sent a complaint to the Jockey Club because
the race should have been stopped. The horse lying behind the fence was
not dead and if it had got up suddenly there would have been mayhem,''
she said. ''I just hope that Kelso can learn how to run a race properly
in future.''
The stewards at Kelso have sent a full report of the incident to the
Jockey Club although they insist all the proper procedures were carried
out.
Ceilidh Boy is entered for the Stakis Scottish Grand National at Ayr
on April 22 but has been rated at 7st 7lb and is unlikely to get a run
unless there are large scale defections after Aintree.
For the second year running there are no Scottish-trained runners in
the Aintree National. The last Scottish runner was two years ago when
Sue Bradburne's Interim Lib unseated his rider.
Len Lungo, on 24 winners after Livio's success in the two miles five
furlongs novice hurdle at Sedgefield, is expected to have two runners at
the three-day Aintree meeting. Attadale, who just failed to make the
frame at Cheltenham, is in the Barton and Guestier three-mile handicap
hurdle on Thursday, and Noyan in the Oddbins Handicap Hurdle on Friday.
Meanwhile, conditional jockey Gary Cahill who was injured when Peter
Monteith's Beldine took a fall in the April Fool Handicap Chase at
Sedgefield on Saturday will miss three rides at Kelso today.
Cahill, who was concussed and broke a toe, required hospital treatment
and has been stood down for the Kelso and Hexham meetings. Tom Jenks has
been engaged to replace him on Back Before Dawn and Brilliant Disguise.

BRIAN Huggett birdied the final hole to snatch a one-stroke victory in
the Windsor Senior Masters in Nairobi on Saturday, the first event of
the European season.
Huggett trailed leader David Creamer by three shots going into the
last nine holes, but he played almost faultless golf in difficult, windy
conditions to pip Spain's Antonio Garrido with a level-par 72.
Creamer dropped five shots on the last nine holes to slip to joint
fourth place.
The #8887 first prize took Huggett's winnings since joining the senior
tour in 1992 to #125,000 -- #12,000 more than he managed during a
20-year career on the full tour. Leading aggregates (British and Irish

In Louisiana
FOR weeks now golf fans have been following Davis Love III and the
agonising saga of his attempts to win a tournament and thus gain entry
to the Masters. Yesterday was Love's last chance for a trip to Magnolia
Lane, and it was a battle before he got it.
Love, 30, one of the most talented and well-liked young players on
tour, did not win last year and missed by less than $1000 the chance to
finish in the top 30 on the 1994 money list and gain his invitation to
Augusta that way.
He started the day with the lead, was as many as three strokes behind,
had a two-stroke lead with two to play, and ended up winning on the
second hole of sudden-death with a birdie from four feet.
Mike Heinen, a local Louisiana boy from Lake Charles, nearly upset the
Love story to become the first native Louisianian to win the New Orleans
Classic.
Heinen was part of the pack hovering in and around the lead on the
front nine, but pitched in for eagle on the par-5 eleventh hole to get
to 15 under par, at the time three strokes ahead of Love. Heinen then
birdied the thirteenth to get to 16 under, parring his way to the final
hole, while Love, playing four holes behind him, caught him at 16 under.
The local player thought he had killed his chances for a second career
win by hitting his second shot into the water at the last and making
double bogey.
This gave Love the chance to play the final four with a two-stroke
lead. He parred the par-5 fifteenth easily, the next less so, making a
six-footer for par. He was bunkered at the seventeenth and missed
virtually the same par putt he had made on the previous hole.
With just a one-stroke lead, Love went to the last -- the toughest
hole on the course. Love missed the water with his second shot by a few
yards, ending up in a bunker. The bunker shot went 12 feet by, and he
lipped out the par putt which would have won it for him.
But Love is now on his way to Augusta National.
Ian Woosnam has a few questions of his own about next week. After a
five-bogey 41 on English Turn's front nine Woosnam felt like walking in.
''And I almost did,'' he said afterwards. ''I played so bad on the front
it was unbelievable. Then I changed my swing a little and just ripped it
on the back nine. I think because I'd been playing in the wind so much I
had been rolling it back a bit.'' The resulting 33 coming in boosted
Woosnam's hopes for next week.
Woosnam's total was 74, four under par for the tournament, one stroke
behind Sandy Lyle. The Scot had his second successive round of 71
yesterday, a disappointment after having got to seven under par after
nine holes. Still, Lyle is more optimistic this week than he has been
upon leaving the past two tournaments, from which he took his exit two
days early. ''My mid-irons are good, which will be important next week.
I just need some putts to drop.'' Final scores (US players unless
noted):
274 -- D Love III 68, 69, 66, 71; M Heinen 66, 71, 71, 66.
275 -- D Duval 67, 68, 71, 69.
276 -- C Parry (Australia) 71, 69, 66, 70.
277 -- J Maggert 72, 66, 70, 69; D Peoples 70, 69, 66, 72; M Standly
70, 65, 69, 73.
278 -- S Simpson 68, 70, 71, 69; B Bryant 65, 74, 69, 70.
279 -- D Briggs 69, 71, 73, 66; K Triplett 66, 73, 71, 69; B Claar 68,
70, 71, 70; M Wiebe 70, 68, 68, 73; L Clements 69, 68, 70, 72.
Other scores: 280 -- J Parnevik (Sweden) 71, 67, 70, 72.
283 -- S Lyle (Scotland) 69, 72, 71, 71.
284 -- I Woosnam (Wales) 70, 69, 71, 74.
300 -- D Feherty (N Ireland) 70, 73, 77, 80.
* TONY Jacklin shot a third-round 72 for a seven-over-par total of 223
to leave him 14 shots behind joint leaders Jack Nicklaus and Japan's
Isao Aoki at the Tradition Senior Classic in Scottsdale, Arizona.

At the Gala Sevens
THE ability of John Amos to regenerate attack moves by mining ball at
contact points, notably with admirable floor work, and the blinding pace
of Mark Moncrieff were crucial ingredients in yet another Gala Seven
success as they swept to a 40-7 win over Stirling County in the final of
their own Netherdale Sevens.
Gala now have contested 52 of 103 Gala finals and this, their
twenty-fifth win, was a repeat of a year ago by the same margin against
the same opponents.
In scoring 20 tries in four ties, Gala put together sequences of
magical interplay that swept all opposition aside.
Even the loss of that short game wizard, Grant Farquharson, for the
semi-final hardly blunted the sharp edge of their combined play with its
intuitive running off the ball.
Moncrieff was the tournament's top try scorer with eight, of which
four were recorded in the final as the result of unfailing vision in
angling his scorching runs. The top points scorer with 48 was the Gala
captain, Michael Dods, with four tries and 14 conversions and Mark
McKenzie of Stirling County was second with three tries and 14
conversions for 43 of his side's 96 points.
Farquharson had two tries as Gala cruised through against Selkirk.
Harry Bassi then opened the scoring as GH-K put up a spirited battle,
without the injured Cameron Little, before being Gala's second victims
by 26-12. Hawick had played their opening tie like sleepwalkers who had
not been introduced, then second time out just squeezed through with a
late Cameron Murray try against the sprightly Watsonians. In the
semi-final, Hawick stretched Gala but eventually couldn't cope with the
Moncrieff-Dods duo and went down 24-19.
Stirling County, meanwhile, had been 19-7 adrift of Heriot's FP before
McKenzie exerted a mighty influence with 16 of their points in their
eleventh hour win by 21-19. McKenzie then added 17 points in the 42-5
destruction of Melrose and Colin McRobert scored the clinching try in
the 28-19 defeat of Jed-Forest.
Stirling badly missed the power play of Gareth Flockhart (hip injury)
in the final but when Brian Ireland, of the monumental workrate, looped
the impressive Gordon Mackay for a try converted by McKenzie for 7-7, a
close run final seemed in prospect. Gala, however, shifted the ball with
bewildering dexterity and always covered the width of the pitch for Amos
to cap a fine all-round performance with a try, Moncrieff to bring the
stand to its feet with four long-range scores, and Dods to complete the
clinical execution with a try and five conversions.
The tournament was notable for several memorable recoveries. Hawick
were 0-12 down to Stewart's-Melville FP before a try by the New
Zealander David McGuinness, converted by Kevin Reid, eased them through
14-12. Kelso were 7-17 down to Kirkcaldy for whom John Mitchell broke
tackles for three tries. Graeme Aitchison, however, sparked the Kelso
revival for a 21-17 margin. Heriot's FP, with Donald Fowler a livewire,
led Stirling County 19-7 before conceding 14 points without further
reply.
Whereas Gala stitched together a blizzard of passes for several
marvellous team tries, perhaps the outstanding individual score was by
Mackay who, in rollicking form throughout, fielded a Melrose restart
kick and, showing impressive pace, stayed just out of reach of Ross
Brown over 60 metres.
Gala have now appeared in eight of the last 11 Border string finals
and in such rippling form must be favourites to win the Kings of the
Sevens series.
The Gala club also went some way to restoring the tradition of earlier
tournaments by introducing prizes for the top try scorer (Moncrieff), a
pre-Sevens goal-kicking competition -- won by Scott Welsh of Hawick --
and a rugby players' sprint in which the winner was Adam Lowles of
Melrose with Aidan Dow (GH-K) second and Darren Burns (Boroughmuir)
third. It was, indeed, just like olden times when the Sevens were
affectionately referred to as ''the Sports''. Results:
First round -- Watsonians 35, Boroughmuir 14; Hawick 14,
Stewart's-Melville FP 12; GH-K 26, Currie 0; Gala 38, Selkirk 7; Kelso
21, Kirkcaldy 17; Jed-Forest 31, Peebles 14: Melrose 34, Langholm 0;
Stirling County 21, Heriot's FP 19. Second round -- Hawick 24,
Watsonians 19; Gala 26, GH-K 12; Jed-Forest 22, Kelso 19; Stirling
County 42, Melrose 5. Semi-finals -- Gala 24, Hawick 19; Stirling 28,
Jed-Forest 19. Final -- Gala 40 , Stirling County 7.
Final teams -- Gala -- S Paterson, M Moncrieff, K Simpson, M Dods
(captain); N J Crooks, I Corcoran, J P Amos.
Stirling County -- C McRobert, M N McGrandles, M McKenzie, K G M
Harper; G T Mackay, B Ireland (captain), R Wyllie. Replacement -- C M
Sangster for McRoberts, 18 minutes.
Referee -- J C Bacigalupo (Edinburgh Wanderers).

EDINBURGH Academicals' victory in their last Division 1 league match
by 20-7 against West of Scotland lifts them into a final third place in
the top division. They finish ahead of Hawick on points difference after
looking a certainty for relegation at the December league break.
A win by 46-16 in Aberdeen against Gordonians in their final league
match sent Glasgow Academicals into sixth place in division two after
being in relegation trouble only two weeks ago.
After going 11 league matches without a win, and losing more than 30
points per game, Hutchesons Aloysians came good in their penultimate
league match when they defeated Royal High by 35-8 at Auldhouse.
Cumbernauld's 25-20 victory at Linlithgow took them above Madras
College FP to claim the last place in the new National Division Three
next season, with the St Andrews club in National Four.
A long journey to Aberdeen from Earlston proved more than worthwhile
when the border club defeated the university by 28-16 to climb above
their opponents and ensure a place in National Five in September.
Aberdeen finished ahead of their fellow university from St Andrews on
points difference and will also play in National Five next season with
St Andrews dropping down to National Six.
Garnock's successful run in division seven continued with their
twelfth victory in as many matches. They defeated their newest
challengers for the title Whitecraigs by 28-6 to claim the division
seven title.
Moray must win their final match next Saturday in division seven
against Cumnock by more than 46 points to take their place in National
Six next season and send Broughton to National Seven.
Rosyth and District won the Midland District league play-off by 18-15
against Kinross and will play in National Seven next season. This time
last year Rosyth lost a play-off for entry to the National League
against Lochaber.
Two of the other district league winners who join National Seven next
season are Dalkeith, winners of the Edinburgh league, and RAF
Lossiemouth, winners in the north. The winner of the Glasgow league has
yet to be decided.

Dundee High School FP 15, Currie 22
WHEN it was put to Currie coach Bruce MacNaughton that this was only
the third league victory his side had managed all season, his quick
reply -- with grin to match -- was that this was ''two in a row.'' He
referred to the fact that having beaten only GHK until March, his side
had taken the scalp of West of Scotland and followed it up with
Saturday's victory over Dundee in their next game.
The strong wind, and the way the respective stand-offs used it, were
the major influences on the game.
Dundee player/coach Tom Dymock -- he came off the bench for
half-an-hour -- felt he could explain his side's tactical ineptitude.
The Dundee men are in the throes of a major change in policy --
electing to play expansive rugby rather than percentage stuff.
Dundee's open game plan foundered on handling and confidence frailties
-- due largely to the chopping and changing of personnel and the
effective harrying and tackling of the visitors.
In contrast, Ally Donaldson, Currie's wily stand-off, had but one
thing in mind from the start of the second period. The game was to be
played in the home 22, and everytime he got the ball in his own half, he
hoisted kicks which the wind caught and swept downfield.
Within minutes of the restart, Donaldson created, scored, and
converted the only try of the game and from then on, Dundee were playing
catch-up rugby.
A largely dour first half had seen Jon Newton strike four successful
penalties to two by Donaldson in reply. Following his try, Donaldson put
over a scruffy 40 metre drop goal. Newton closed the gap to a single
point with a superb penalty but the territorial advantage held by the
visitors spawned two further penalty chances which Donaldson goaled.
Currie's two league points gain them nothing in tangible terms but
given that the sides will meet again next season there may a
psychological boost. One suspects however that the full Dundee side with
valuable points to be gained might play it differently next season.
Dundee HSFP -- M Lamont; M Cousin, D Hamilton, R McFarlane, D Gray; J
Newton, G Sandford; T Smith, G Scott, D Herrington, R Walker, G Hayter,
A Keys, J Kidd, C Samson. Replace -- T Dymnock for Walker (60mins).
Currie -- G Keen; C Robertson, W Weatherhead, M Plumb, S Forrester; A
Donaldson, D Rogerson; C Boyd, G Ellis, D Massie, C Carson, S Dunn, B
Watt, S Hardy, S Logan.
Referee -- Mr C Henderson (Kelso).

KIRSTEEN McGibbon became the first Scottish skier in more than a
decade to win the women's downhill title at the British Land National
Championships at Tignes, France, on Saturday.
McGibbon, 19, one of the most improved performers this season, showed
confidence as she swept down the 2.3 kilometre track in 1min.27.33sec,
over a second ahead of the British team's current best downhill
prospect, Kelly Morris.
On this showing alone, McGibbon should be in the running for the
British squad -- but she admitted: ''I don't particularly like the
difficult courses, but then sometimes I guess you just have to take your
brave pills and get on with it.
''Today I felt really at home on the course and knew where I could
give it everything. I trained on it during the season and that helped my
confidence.''
Martin Bell lifted the men's downhill championship and with it his
record fourth British combined title.
Yesterday, Michal Pilarski, 17, from Falkirk, again finished second in
the British junior slalom to the British team's Tim Fawke.
Shona Robertson, 18, from Aberdeen, won the British junior women's
slalom title and Emma Carrick-Anderson won the international junior
race.

TWO players each have been banned for nine matches from today as
indiscipline mars the season's climax. Peter MacCallum, of Oban Celtic,
and Roddy Munro, of Lovat, are now out until well into next season, but
the two-game ban on Fort William's Ian Rodger means that he will miss
this weekend's cup final.
A total of 12 cases were dealt with by the Camanachd Association's
latest disciplinary committee meeting, and a total of 38 games will be
missed by the dozen players involved.
Two players also are facing court appearances -- one in Glasgow and
another in Inverness -- as the result of alleged incidents at games.
There were further reports of indiscipline at the weekend, with the
referee at the Kyles Athletic-Inveraray match, Jimmy Kerr, now
threatening to quit.
Inverness-based official Donald MacFadyen withdrew from Saturday's
Camanachd Cup-tie between Fort William and Inveraray.
Saturday's Camanachd Cup ties saw the form book rule, although Fort
William and Glenurquhart will have to meet again after their draw at the
Fort.
Glen were two up before Fort William got their act together and they
will now meet at Drumnadrochit for the right to meet Kingussie.
The cup favourites comfortably disposed of Glenorchy 8-1 with Dave
Anderson netting five.
In the other semi-finals, Glasgow Mid Argyll's magnificent late rally
was not enough to catch Newtonmore, who won 4-3, and Oban Camanachd
overcame north first division strugglers Beauly. Results:
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup: Fifth round -- Fort William 2,
Glenurquhart 2; Kingussie 8, Glenorchy 1; Newtonmore 4, Glasgow Mid
Argyll 3; Oban Camanachd 1, Beauly 0.
North: Marine Harvest League: Division 1 -- Lovat 3, Skye 3. Division
2 -- Inverness 4, Caberfeidh 2. Division 3 -- Beauly 2, Lovat 3.
Division 4 -- Caberfeidh 1, Kilmallie 5.
South: Marine Harvest League: Division 1 -- Kyles Athletic 1,

CEILIDH Boy, one of two horses forced to pull up in the notorious
fence incident at Kelso last Friday, gained some compensation at

the second fence in the three-mile handicap chase and failed to get up.
With the fatally injured horse lying behind the fence it was dolled off,
leaving only eight feet available for jumping on the second circuit.
Eight got over but Ceilidh Boy and Side of Hill, trained by Bruce
Mactaggart, had nowhere to go and pulled up.
Goodfellow insisted the race should have been void because of the
inherent dangers. ''I have sent a complaint to the Jockey Club because
the race should have been stopped. The horse lying behind the fence was
not dead and if it had got up suddenly there would have been mayhem,''
she said. ''I just hope that Kelso can learn how to run a race properly
in future.''
The stewards at Kelso have sent a full report of the incident to the
Jockey Club although they insist all the proper procedures were carried
out.
Ceilidh Boy is entered for the Stakis Scottish Grand National at Ayr
on April 22 but has been rated at 7st 7lb and is unlikely to get a run
unless there are large scale defections after Aintree.
For the second year running there are no Scottish-trained runners in
the Aintree National. The last Scottish runner was two years ago when
Sue Bradburne's Interim Lib unseated his rider.
Len Lungo, on 24 winners after Livio's success in the two miles five
furlongs novice hurdle at Sedgefield, is expected to have two runners at
the three-day Aintree meeting. Attadale, who just failed to make the
frame at Cheltenham, is in the Barton and Guestier three-mile handicap
hurdle on Thursday, and Noyan in the Oddbins Handicap Hurdle on Friday.
Meanwhile, conditional jockey Gary Cahill who was injured when Peter
Monteith's Beldine took a fall in the April Fool Handicap Chase at
Sedgefield on Saturday will miss three rides at Kelso today.
Cahill, who was concussed and broke a toe, required hospital treatment
and has been stood down for the Kelso and Hexham meetings. Tom Jenks has
been engaged to replace him on Back Before Dawn and Brilliant Disguise.

WHEN does a man become a man? It's a good question, and perhaps we --
in all sports, but especially rugby -- expect our youngsters to don the
full trappings of maturity to the utter detriment of their continued
participation in physical sport, instead of giving them time and space
at their own level to develop among like minded and like sized young men
or women.
And perhaps, just perhaps, the ''private'' school pursuit of rugby
excellence dissuades more youngsters from enjoying rugby than it
encourages. Some argue that it puts most of them off forever.
Whatever the reasons, the fact remains that rugby loses many of its
talented players immediately after they leave school.
''I see it especially in the boys who have been to private schools,''
says Andrew Manzie, the rugby coach at Strathclyde University. ''These
young men have been in an environment where the commitment has been far
too great, and they have been out several afternoons a week practising
rugby, and then sometimes playing twice at the weekend.
There is pressure to succeed. All of the schools involved have a
financial incentive in that they want a profile that is not only good
educationally, but good sportingly.
''It is important that the rugby team does well. Boys who have been in
that environment, quite obviously, just want to do something else when
they leave school. That is why they give up.''
I will be frank with you here. I had never heard this line of argument
before, and here I was about to get it from two people who should know
in the same day.
Manzie says that young Irishmen and Englishmen, who have been through
the same system in their own country, display identical characteristics
on arrival at Strathclyde University. They don't want to play rugby.
''Of my first XV last year,'' says Mike Paterson, a rugby stalwart at
the combined school that is Hillhead/Jordanhill ''not one of them is now
playing rugby. I get different reasons for that from them of course, but
it is very disappointing.
''Some go away to university, and nobody else in the hall of residence
is playing rugby so they don't feel like it, or they don't like
university rugby. Others say that they just want one or two years out to
get past their exams, but I know that they will be lost to the game
forever.''
Paterson continued: ''I do think that schools in the independent
sector give their boys so much rugby, and it is compulsory for them,
that when these boys leave school they feel they would like to try other
sports.''
I quoted a list of names that included David Sole, John Jeffrey, Rob
Wainwright, and Gavin Hastings. They were all public schoolboys, they
didn't give up. ''Well,'' said Paterson, ''there are more people of non
rugby backgrounds able to send their kids to private school now. I
assume that those you mention had fathers steeped in rugby. Many of the
kids at private school now have fathers who did not play rugby, but they
have the money to send their boys to fee paying school.''
Manzie says that once precocious 17-year-olds do arrive at the next
step in their rugby careers, the realisation that what helped them
succeed at school can only form a tiny piece of their armoury is a
sobering thought indeed to weedy youths who had previously thought
themselves indestructible.
''Youngsters, especially those who have been successful at school,
very quickly realise that they have a new learning curve to go through.
They look at their heroes in the national team and see that they will
never be that big, or that strong,'' he says. ''They cannot see
themselves bridging that gap, and they find it difficult to accept that
they will just be added to the long list of ordinary rugby players.''
''We should understand that it is a huge transition between school
rugby and beyond,'' says the Strathclyde coach, ''and life is littered
with people who had been talented players, but went to join good rugby
clubs, and were devastated to find that no one spotted them as huge
talents, went into the third XV and then gave the game up.''
One talented youngster about to make his way in the big rugby world is
Alan Bulloch, younger brother of Gordon, the West hooker. Alan, at 17
still a pupil at Hutcheson's, has been drafted into the Scotland Under
19s to go to the FIRA tournament in Rumania. Like his brother, he is a
real prospect.
''Well, I don't know about all of that,'' he says. ''We find at the
school that even some of the boys who give rugby up in fourth year come
back to it. It's the main sport. But I do see the point that some people
do just give it up. My father, Jim, is a rugby man and maybe that's why
we all play. I think that the biggest problem is that most of us leave
for university in another town, and then make friends at university that
don't play the game.''
And start to live life a little too, I bet! Paterson and Manzie agree
on one thing, and that is the need for a level of rugby, for developing
youngsters, that is between school and seniors. ''More age group rugby
is the way ahead,'' says Manzie ''and I think that universities and
colleges could have an important role to play in providing a forum for
these young men to play rugby. Clubs should be encouraged in their
under-19 and under-21 sides too.'' I can just see the clubs doing that.
''Maybe what is needed is more fun rugby, in their own age groups, for
these youngsters as they try to pass exams at a difficult time in
life,'' says Paterson.
Scotland has 18,000 rugby players, Japan 180,000, and England 375,000.
Yesterday I did my bit to make it 18,001 ... I didn't force my
nine-year-old son to play mini rugby.

West of Scotland 7, Edinburgh Academicals 20
THE final league curtain came down on West with a resounding clunk.
Their desperate battle to survive Division 1 rugby disappeared last
week, and on Saturday their hopes of a flourishing finale failed
miserably.
The visiting Accies, on the other hand, have climbed to an amazing
third place in the table after an horrendous start to the season.
The clubs are now a league apart and that was apparent very early at
Burnbrae.
The West forwards played out of their skins as usual but the
much-changed back division were given little opportunity to show their
paces.
Accies would contend that they, too, were fielding an understrength
side but it did not affect their determination to play 15-man rugby.
West had their moments in the second period, especially when skipper
John Lonergan thundered forward, but they tried to start their forward
drives and mauls too deep in their own territory instead of using a
judicious diagonal kick to put the opposition on the defensive in their
own half.
Accies were fortunate to have a seasoned stalwart in Brian Hay-Smith
at fly half. He judged the correct moment to take the ball back to the
forwards or, conversely, to utilise his kicking prowess to turn West
back on the defensive.
West took 25 minutes to get into their opponents' half in the first
period but Accies' discipline was exemplified by the fact that West had
only one penalty shot at goal in the whole game and that was after 43
minutes. West too often piled on top of a tackled player and handled
over-zealously in the rucks.
Hay-Smith dealt harshly with their indiscretions by collecting 15
points -- and also missed three other kickable efforts.
For all the territorial advantage, Accies led only 6-0 at the break
with Hay-Smith slotting a drop goal and a penalty. The Edinburgh fly
half had his second penalty miss just after the turn-round and West's
Colin Wallace saw his sole effort go wide.
Hay-Smith popped over two more penalties then Adrian Fairbourn rounded
off an exhilarating multi-handling move with a try in 64 minutes.
West's glory moment arrived five minutes later when Alan Williamson
jinked his way between the posts after an exciting forward drive.
Wallace converted but Hay-Smith had the final say with a fourth penalty
seven minutes from the end.
West of Scotland -- A Williamson; M Craig, C Dunn, K Siems, A Hogarth;
C Wallace, F Stott; P Wong, G Bulloch, D Jamieson, S McKechnie, G
Perrett, D McVey, J Lonergan, J Shaw.
Edinburgh Academicals -- S Burns; M Gordon, R Hunter, J Russell, A
Fairbourn; B Hay-Smith, K Troup; R Moffat, P Haslett, B Stewart, T
McVie, A Adamson, D McIvor, M Waite, R Hoole.
Referee -- J Steele (Dumfries).

SCOTLAND'S under-18 team lost the last game of their Spanish tour in
Madrid yesterday, well beaten 32-6 by the Spaniards who will go on to
represent their country in the FIRA under-19 tournament in Bucharest
next week.
Bob Easson, the Scottish coach, suggested that the Spanish forwards
would have given Scotland's under-19 team a hard time.
Iain Banks, the stand-off from Mackie Academy FP, twice put the Scots
ahead with a first-half penalty goal, and the visitors led 6-3 at the
interval, deservedly so especially through the sterling line-out work by
Dunfermline lock Paul Millar.
But three tries from Miguel Claramunt (2) and Aitor Etxebarria in the
third quarter finished the Scots off. Antonio Gonzalez added a fourth
try before the end. Etxebarria and Aratz Gallastegui each kicked two
penalty goals.
On the team's arrival at Edinburgh Airport last night, James MacPhail
was taken to hospital for an examination on his jaw. It was suspected to
have been broken by a Spanish punch late on in the match.
* JONATHAN Callard produced a near-perfect goalkicking display and
Tony Swift claimed a couple of clinching tries as Bath took their
customary place in the Pilkington Cup final with a 31-13 win over
Harlequins.
Bath stayed on course for a fourth English League-Cup double as they
reached Twickenham for the ninth time in 12 seasons.
But their double bid might be hit by a knee injury to England
full-back Mike Catt, who moonlights as stand-off for Bath. Catt must
rest from two League matches this month anyway and his injury might
determine his period on the sidelines.
Harlequins stand-off David Pears -- England's full-back just over a
year ago -- endured a more serious setback when he was concussed in the
last minute of his first serious match since last May.
Meanwhile, Wasps, with England fly-half Rob Andrew kicked 20 points,
won the second semi-final, beating Leicester 25-22 -- but in the end
they had to rely on a dropped pass by Leicester centre Stuart Potter to
clinch their place in the final on May 6.
Potter held his head in his hands in despair after having dropped an
inside pass from Tony Underwood with the Wasps line at his mercy. Rory
Underwood had flown down the left wing and found his younger brother in
support as Leicester attacked desperately.
The Wasps defence, outstanding all afternoon, was finally broken but
Potter's error seemed to sum up Leicester's inability to put things
together.

HAVING been a Motherwell fan for the last 16 years, I was deeply
saddened by the death of Davie Cooper.
I considered myself privileged to witness his immense skill. When
someone highly regarded dies, reading about them sometimes lessens the
great sense of loss that we feel, so I was touched by the piece in last
Friday's diary (about Cooper's reaction when a young fan was hit in the
face by the ball).
Imagine my shock and revulsion when reading the diary of Tuesday,
March 28. I found the story loosely based on the Scotland team's flight
to Russia at best deeply insensitive.

JACK McLean is incorrect in his statement that Allan Glen's had
achieved something unique in Scottish rugby (20/3/95).
In the late seventies, when I lived in Stirling and watched Stirling
County play, they were in Division 7. They were regularly promoted, and
reached Division 1 some years ago. This year they won the ultimate
prize, the first-division title, playing with great flair and style.
That, I think Jack McLean will agree, is a unique achievement, and is
something to crow about. Please ensure he gets his facts correct next
time.

AS WE approach the next game in Scotland's bid to qualify for the
European Championship it is clear that Craig Brown's men will need all
the help and inspiration they can get in the difficult task that awaits
them. One thing is certain. They will receive no inspiration at all from
the singing of the ''National Anthem'' selected for them by the powers
that be at the SFA. The word ''singing'' is of course inappropriate, as
no-one ever sings the music-hall ditty, Scotland the Brave.
The inspiration provided for our rugby players by the SRU's choice,
Flower of Scotland, is perfectly obvious as they and the crowd roar out
the well-known words. As a recent peculiar diatribe against the anthem
in a Scottish Sunday paper made clear, I am well aware that this song is
not universally popular, probably because it is a little too patriotic
for those of an Anglophile disposition.
However, it is clearly the people's choice and it is high time that
the SFA recognise the need for the country to have one anthem and
abandon their preference for a song written originally for a pantomime.
Let them give Scotland's football players and supporters the chance to
unite in singing Flower of Scotland, the anthem that inspires Scotland's
gallant rugby team.

AS A keen golfer, and avid fan of the sport, I turn to The Herald golf
section on a Tuesday morning, in eager anticipation of finding that
little snippet of information or technique which will improve my
knowledge or practice of the game.
Imagine my disappointment today in failing to discover which football
teams our leading Scottish Tour professionals support, especially since
I had learned from your golf correspondent last Monday morning that Adam
Hunter, winner of the Portuguese Open at the weekend, is a season
ticket-holder fan of a well-known Glasgow team.
Surely it would be advantageous to us, your many golf readers, to know
which teams our favourite golfers support, and so improve our playing of
the game.

YOUR Schools Rugby correspondent mentions the admirable quality of
player which has come off the Watson's College production line in recent
years.
They, along with the likes of Merchiston Castle, Edinburgh Academy,
Heriot's, and Stewart's Melville have provided the Scottish
international team with substantial numbers in the post-war years.
Some may match, but will find it difficult to better, the Stewart's
Melville contribution. Consider this team of post-war internationalists
from that quarter: J Forsyth, A Hinshelwood, D Wyllie, I MacDonald and G
Weatherstone; G Sharp and E Anderson; A Brewster, W Relph and S Wright,
M Robertson and G Weir, J Calder, J Douglas, and F Calder. Coach: D
Morgan.
No doubt these schools will continue to supply many players to the
national team but hopefully, in a few years' time, we shall see some
fruit produced by the work currently being done by the development
officers in the non-traditional rugby areas.
Perhaps in the next 10-15 years we shall see a Scottish XV which is an
amalgam of players with origins in the traditional private schools and
Borders areas along with others from Easterhouse, Drumchapel, Inverness,
and the Isles.
I hope so, because with such a comparatively small playing base at the
moment, we must not leave any potential sources of talent untapped.

BRIAN Meek's proposal (March 22) that professional golfers should no
longer be responsible for recording scores, and that this task should be
carried out by ''scorers'' and the media, ignores practicalities.
''Scorers'' are usually enthusiastic volunteers with no official
qualifications, who have to get their information from whatever source
available -- caddies, spectators, etc . . . They then pass it on to the
scoreboards and media. Would players accept such unofficial scores? Many
games have no ''scorer'' or TV coverage. Even in the Open Championship
only a few of the top games are accompanied by a qualified official.
Possibly the wisest words on this subject were spoken by the late
Bobby Jones, the founder of the Masters, referring to the Robert de
Vicenzo incident in the 1973 Masters. He said: ''I find myself differing
with you (Herbert Warren Wind) in your stand on the propriety of Rule 38
under modern conditions. You make the point that in an event like the
Masters, with hundreds of spectators at each hole and millions more
watching on television, everybody knows the score.
''You may recall that on two occasions in Open Championship play, I
ordered a stroke added to my score. In both instances, there were
several hundred spectators around the green and, in each case, I had a
scorer or marker, in addition to my playing companion. Both these men on
both occasions were standing within 15 feet of me.
''Yet each time I had to call the marker's attention to the extra
stroke; and on one occasion the gentleman went so far as to appeal to
the committee after the round, affirming that my ball had not moved.
There is scarcely any way the spectators around the green, and no way
the viewers on television, could know that de Vicenzo had not
inadvertently moved his ball and reported the fact to Aaron between the
seventeenth green and the eighteenth tee . . .
''The whole situation was tragic beyond expression. I like to think,
though, that it serves one useful purpose in emphasising the respect
which golfers must have for the rule book.''
One final thought -- why does Sam Torrance always have a pencil behind
one ear if not to record scores?

THE renaissance which has marked the latter stages of Jim Leighton's
career has been watched at close-hand by his goalkeeping guru, Alan
Hodgkinson.
For 10 years the one-time England internationalist has been at
Leighton's side -- during the seemingly doom-laden days after he had
been dropped from Manchester United's FA Cup final team, to the
still-worse times when he was shunted into Dundee's reserve team.
Hodkinson was always there, ready to advise his protege, ready to
listen to the problems, and always marvelling at the resilience Leighton
showed.
Last week in Moscow, Leighton made two saves which were remarkable and
gave an overall performance which helped inspire the men in front of him
to one of the most important results the national side has achieved in
the past few seasons.
If Scotland had lost manager Craig Brown would still have tried to
convince the public that the Tartan Army would be marching on England
next summer -- but the credulity of even the most loyal foot-soldier
would have been stretched.
Leighton helped make it all more realistic. Hodgson explained: ''He
has this amazing self-belief and that is what has carried him through
the bad times he has known in his career.
''I speak to him all the time, I'm on the phone every week and we talk
about what is happening, about training routines, and general
goalkeeping skills.
''He has been phenomenal. I work with a lot of top goalkeepers but I
cannot think of anyone who has been more professional than Jim.
''He has a toughness about him, too, an inner strength which has kept
him going. Other people would have been scarred for all time if they had
to endure what he went through. Some would have been destroyed
completely.
''Yet Jim took the chance Alex Miller offered him at Hibs and he went
for it. Hibs and Scotland have both benefited.''
So much so that Hibs have challenged powerfully in the premier
division for most of the season and are in the semi-finals of the
Scottish Cup. When Rangers' Andy Goram was injured it was the ''old
man'' of the Scots' goalkeeping mafia Craig Brown turned to.
Hodgkinson didn't find that surprising. Age, he believes, should not
be a barrier if a player is willing to continue to work and train at the
same level.
He pointed out: ''It's easy when you get that little bit older to turn
away from the harder work and tell yourself that you don't have to do it
any more. It's the biggest mistake any keeper can make, and I have
spoken to Jim about that and I know that he does not stint himself one
little bit.
''I worked out with him before the Russia game, tough sessions they
were, too, on Saturday, Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday and even a little
bit extra on the morning of the game.
''He wanted to do all of that and that is why his skills have not
diminished and his fitness level remains so high. He works as hard as
any youngster who is just coming into the game.
''I see no reason why Jim can't perform at this level until he is
forty -- or even older, given that he escapes injury.''
Hodgkinson, of course, in his time with Scotland has helped end the
jibes which used to haunt every keeper who played for the international
side.
He believes that Leighton began the burial of that nonsense and his
successor, Andy Goram, completed the rites. No-one, says Hodgkinson, can
question the professionalism of the keepers Scotland have.
''I go around England working with the keepers at Manchester United,
at Everton, and at Sheffield Wednesday. All the lads there, Woodsy,
Neville Southall, Peter Schmeichel -- they all ask about Jim and how he
is doing. They do that because they admire him. They look up to him for
all that he has achieved in his career.
''And that career is not yet over. He has a lot he still hopes to
achieve and, knowing his single-mindedness, there is no way he will rest
until he achieves at least some of his objectives.
''When Andy is fit again that may put Jim out of the Scotland side --
but, if it does, it will give the country two of the best goalkeepers
around. There's not much anyone can laugh at when they are together in
the squad, is there?
''If it was up to me, then he would be the Player of the Year in
Scotland. I know all about Brian Laudrup and other outfield players but
Jim Leighton has done remarkably well and that should be recognised.''
Oh, and it was not only the two saves we all remembered that impressed
Hodgkinson in Moscow.
''They caught the eye,''he smiles,''good saves always do. The one he
held and the one he saved with his feet, they are the ones which will be
remembered. But, for me, and for other goalkeepers watching it was the
way he dominated his area, the way he punched balls clear and the way he
organised the lads at set pieces which proved how professional Jim
Leighton remains.
''When he is there then you don't have to worry about to much, do you?

I SEEM to be doing a lot of footy this weather. Of course I do: I am a
male in Britain, Scottish, West of it, Glaswegian really. Football is
part and parcel of all of the above; a major thread in what Marx called
false consciousness. There is a lot of false thought out there. And it
starts early in sport, from the very beginning.
Saturday saw much of it because it was the quadrangular international
tournament for Junior football, held at Newlandsfield Park for the
Guinness Cup.
It was won 3-2 by Northern Ireland after a series of hard-fought games
by Scotland, the Isle of Man, and the Republic of Ireland. Billed as it
was as the first time that an all-Ireland team would represent football,
eventually the North wore the green shirts and beat the dark blue of
Scotland, rather well in fact.
That is not the point. The green shirts, in the aftermath of the peace
process were meant to be worn by Irishmen from Kilkenny to Kildare,
Blackrock to Bangor. The Republic team, headed by four managers and even
more trainers and officials, had 13 Dubliners and only three
''Culchies.''
Centre-half Joe Kane, from Ireland's capital, scored the final penalty
against his own country, from the North of Ireland, which took him into
the final against Scotland.
Noel Kennedy, vice-president and PRO for the Republic regretted not
only the defeat, but the fact that of all the sports in his country,
football still cannot get itself integrated. ''There is yet too much
politics in our game -- d'ye know what I mean?'' Well I do. I know too
well.
The reaon we have not an Irish team and why it remains split in two is
because the officials in North and South Ireland do not want to give up
their extraordinary privileges -- the wives and children, the splendid
blazers, the kudos of being some kind of official apparatchik living in
better hotels and with better dinners than the players. And there is a
lot worse than that: Ireland is yet riven with cultural divides.
Take Finn Harps, the top football team from Donegal, who have done so
well in Gaelic football over the last few years. Their own Patsy McGowan
has been warned off for playing association football. He has been told
by the autocratic Gaelic Athletic Association, which has overseen the
development of Gaelic sports and arts over the last 70 years, from dance
to athletics, that anybody found playing soccer will never be allowed to
play Gaelic or any other art or sport which comes within their remit.
Tell that to national hero Pat Bonner of Celtic, who has played
everything in Ireland but the fiddle.
And there I was again at football yesterday: the Puma Street Soccer.
Heavens, depressed enough as I was the day before, it came hard upon me
on the Sabbath Day too. Street soccer I have seen before. The Scottish
Football Association has promoted it enough in the last few years, and
indeed, rival sports company Reebok has given a few quid into it and we
have written it before. But Puma, a major sports company has gone into
the kiddies market and produced this street footy. It started in
Germany, the company tell us, last year. It ends next year, indeed in
Berlin.
Sixteen venues throughout Britain in two age groups, 11 -13, and
14-16, boys and girls. Four-a-side, out of five players. Held over four
weekends in 15 urban centres in the UK, girls and boys qualify for the
national finals in London at Earls Court on May 28.
There were Irish junior teams, which mumber unbelievably, 736 clubs.
That is a real football culture.
No girls' teams; no mixed teams. The Football Association in England,
our own SFA, does not permit mixed teams. Until recently neither
permitted any girls to play, at least officially, football at all.
Recently they allowed lasses to kick a ball, but only until they were
12 years of age. The reason why not one single girl played in
yesterday's tournament was because of rules.
I watched the final of the under-13s. Erskine Rovers against Young
Hoops of Trinity High, Cambuslang. One of the parents, whom I know and
will not name, was giving out more F-words than you would get from a
drunk miscreant at Pitt Street, and he was sober.
A little boy, just 11 stood up to his astounded Erskine opponent in
the usual pro manner, chest stuck out, little stupid chin akimbo, finger
jabbing, for some imagined foul or slight.
His face was contorted by rage and stupidity. He got cautioned by the
referee -- in street football, for heaven's sake. Why not learn the joy
and pleasure of knocking the ball about the way I did, or my dad, or the
great players of the past.
A caution he got. It's a smacked bottom he was needing.
But there was the wee team from St Aloysius, a school which yet,
ludicrously, refuses to have football on its curriculam at all. The
Gonzaga Select, (named after one of the Houses), got through to the
semi-finals, and were among the very youngest of all the teams. Just
turned 11. They didn't win. But then again, maybe they did.

St Johnstone 1, Clydebank 0
THE white flag may not have been hoisted by St Johnstone but manager
Paul Sturrock is showing every sign of looking past the remaining six
games to next season.
The weary weekend win over Clydebank -- secured by George O'Boyle's
twenty-second goal of the campaign -- extended Saints unbeaten sequence
to 11, but Sturrock admitted: ''We just have to hope something drastic
happens to the teams above us.''
Realistically, though, he is already planning the next campaign. Two
teenagers have now been blooded, Stuart McCluskey and Danny Griffen, and
central defender Jim Weir had been ordered to rest for the remainder of
the season because of a pelvic complaint.
O'Boyle, who has signed an extension to his contract which will keep
him at the club to the summer of 1997, admitted: ''Unless other teams do
us big favours we'll be in the first division again next season. Really,
we're gearing up for next term.''
Clydebank coach Brian Wright made no excuses for a disappointing
performance by a side now flirting with the relegation zone.

Ayr United 0, Raith Rovers 1
YORKSHIRE folk, it is often claimed, can usually find something to
moan about and one son of the White Rose county does not have to look
far these days for a reason.
Simon Stainrod, manager of Ayr United, enjoyed many highs during his
playing career, but with the good inevitably will come some dejection.
And after his side was defeated at home by Raith Rovers, the probability
of slithering down a division next month took a giant leap closer to
reality.
A five-point gap has emerged separating Ayr from third bottom St
Mirren and, with just six matches remaining, it is little wonder that
the Ayr supporters slipped off home with heavy hearts.
Stainrod gave pass marks to several departments within his team, but
paused at the front line. ''When are we going to score a goal?'' he
asked. ''When is a striker going to look dangerous?'' He has combed the
land without success trying to unearth a fellow who could finish off the
lead-up work.
With the shutter having been drawn on transfers for the season,
Stainrod must proceed with what he has -- which is precious little.
Ian Gilzean usually is handed a striker's shirt, but seldom does much
of note in it. ''What we are doing each week,'' said Stainrod, ''is
asking the defence not to concede a goal, otherwise the chances are we
will lose.''
Just as Stainrod was pouring out his heart, Gordon Dalziel walked
past. The Raith striker is called upon less and less these days and as
Stainrod looked at him, one could almost read the thought: 'Now if I had
you, Gordon, my club might not be in this mess'.
For Raith, the success means if Clydebank can be overcome tomorrow
night the men from Kirkcaldy would leap-frog Dunfermline and be running
alongside Dundee as the title race gathers pace.
The winning goal was scored just on half-time when Stevie Crawford --
the best player in the division, according to Stainrod -- galloped down
the right, waited until support was forthcoming, before popping the ball
over for Davie Kirkwood to bludgeoned it high past Cammy Duncan.

Airdrie 2, Stranraer 0
THE #60,000 fee Airdrie paid York City for striker Steve Cooper in
October is proving the bargain of the season.
He has formed a potent scoring combination with Andy Smith, and the
goal apiece they netted against Stranraer brought their tally to 33.
They represent a genuine threat to Hearts in their Tennents Scottish
Cup semi-final at Hampden on Saturday.
Cooper's goal after 51 minutes to open the scoring, was his thirteenth
for the Diamonds, whom he believes have the skill and determination to
eliminate Tommy McLean's men.
Cooper said: ''Playing at Hampden would be a dream come true for me.
I'd never been in Scotland until I signed for Airdrie and it's amazing
that after only a few months, we are in the semi-final of the cup.
''I was impressed with Hearts when I saw them knock out Rangers on
television, but we have such a good team spirit that I feel we can cause
an upset.''
Cooper, 30, has played twice at Wembley in a career which has taken
him to 10 clubs.
He was with Tranmere when they lost to Birmingham in the Leyland Daf
Trophy final in 1991, but made up for that the following year by helping
to beat Bolton in the league play-off finals. Now he is aiming for two
trips to Hampden and a Scottish Cup medal.
Smith, whose goal in 73 minutes wrapped up the points in a one-sided
game, said: ''I scored in the 1992 final when we lost to Rangers, and it
would be great to go one better this time.''
Manager Alex MacDonald was pleased with the three points which helps
keep alive Airdrie's hopes of promotion to the premier division.
Bottom-club Stranraer, with eight squad players missing through
suspension or injury, never looked like causing an upset.
Manager Alex McAnespie said: ''The relegation clouds are really
gathering now. Mathematically we can still stay up and that's the way we
will be approaching the remainder of the season.''
Stranraer's last visit to Broadwood saw them have four men red-carded
in an 8-1 defeat, but this time it was such a tame affair that referee
Martin Clark didn't even have to issue a yellow card.
The crowd of only 811 was a record low home attendance for Airdrie
this season.

St Mirren 3, Hamilton 2
A SECOND-HALF blitz, which saw St Mirren score three goals in 19
minutes, eased considerably the relegation worries of manager Jimmy Bone
and allowed him the rare luxury of enjoying his weekend.
''This is the first time this season we've got the breaks,'' said
Bone. ''And though we started to panic towards the end, over the piece
we deserved the victory.''
Certainly, the first half was following a predictable pattern with
Saints pressing hard but Hamilton snatching the vital goal. Barry Lavety
saw his powerful drive blocked by keeper Allan Ferguson's legs, and
Stuart Taylor placed his 18-yard shot just wide of a post, before
Hamilton took the lead against the run of play.
From a Paul Hartley corner, Saints keeper Campbell Money flapped at
the ball which fell kindly to Hamilton's recent signing from Rangers,
Scott McCulloch, who swivelled on the six-yard line before shooting low
into the net.
Taylor was injured in a bad tackle and Hamilton's Charlie McLean, who
had been booked earlier, became involved in the incident and was wisely
withdrawn.
The breaks which Bone mentioned, arrived just after the interval.
Referee Willie Young and a linesman agreed that a Lavety header had
crossed the line despite a gallant effort by Ferguson to scoop the ball
out. Then Martin Baker ran virtually unopposed from the centre circle
before driving home from 10 yards.
A wicked deflection from substitute Grant Inglis' shot wrong-footed
the Accies keeper to leave the home side looking comfortable winners.
However, Dave Elliot handled and Sean McEntegart converted the penalty
to set up an anxious final six minutes for the home side.
Incredibly, Hamilton hit the post twice in that period with shots from
Peter Duffield and McEntegart.
Bone praised his strike-force of Lavety and Alex Bone, but the
contribution of Jim Gardner pleased him most. ''The lad has gone through
a difficult time, but he played exceptionally well today and his crosses
from the left created chances. Our ability has never been in doubt. Now
the confidence is returning.''
Accies manager Iain Munro was still in with his players fully half an
hour after the final whistle.

THIRD DIVISION
IT is no wonder that Forfar are sitting top of the division with a
12-point lead, as business-like manager Tommy Campbell certainly knows
his priorities, writes Bill Sutherland.
Their 3-0 win away to Albion Rovers on Saturday took them to 64 points
and they need only three more wins to be certain of promotion. The title
would be assured with a total of 77.
Campbell claims that he does not look at the league table. He concerns
himself only with the progress of his team. ''Performances don't matter.
It's all about results,'' he said.
It would be harsh to suggest that Forfar's win over Rovers was
functional rather than pretty. Campbell's team have acquired the habit
of making a good start, and then turning on the style when they have
establish a cushion.
Sandy Ross was the striker who did most damage. He tapped in after the
keeper had failed to hold a shot after 10 minutes, and midway in the
half, he set up Steve McCormick for a drive which allowed the visitors
to coast.
Ross took advantage of a helpful rebound off a defender to shoot in
the third on the hour mark.
Something will have to give next Saturday when the hapless Rovers
visit Cowdenbeath, who slumped to a ninth straight defeat despite former
Rover Sammy Conn giving them the lead at Alloa. Keith McCulloch, with a
header, and Steve Cadden turned it around in the closing 20 minutes,
with Cowden's Dom Maratea being sent off in between the goals.
East Stirlingshire remain in second place, hotly pursued by Ross
County after both achieved 1-0 home wins. Mike Geraghty struck for
'Shire after only two minutes against Caley Thistle, while Alan Duff
headed home the goal at Dingwall that beat Queen's Park.
Arbroath's run of seven wins in a row came to a spectacular end with a
5-0 thumping at Montrose. John Brogan was tasting defeat as Arbroath
manager for the first time while Montrose revived their promotion hope
with a second win under caretaker Andy Dornan.
Colin McGlashan opened with a great shot and added a penalty. After an
own goal by Tom McMillan, Shaun Smith headed home for an improbable 4-0
half-time lead, and a swerving shot from Craig Cooper completed the rout
in the final minute.

SECOND DIVISION
THE points were shared at Ochilview on Saturday and the fans were
treated to an entertaining game, but no-one was happy with the result.
At Boghead, however, Dumbarton's Murdo MacLeod was delighted with his
own team's 4-1 win over Brechin as well as a perfect result at
Ochilview.
Stenhousemuir manager Terry Christie was disappointed at having to
settle for a 1-1 draw after his team had been in front, whereas Morton
counterpart Allan McGraw's regret was over missed chances, a lack of
luck, and unhelpful refereeing decisions.
Home player Adrian Sprott and visitor Marko Rajamaki both hit the bar
but each was to gain a reward. Just after the break, Tommy Steel
wriggled through the Morton defence and John Anderson's tackle was
judged illegal. Up stepped Sprott to make his usual tidy job of the
penalty. Rajamaki was instrumental in the equaliser midway in the half
when his inswinging corner was fumbled by Mike Harkness and Derek Lilley
scored.
Both sides will have to do without one of their midfield men for up to
a month. Morton's Alan Mahood injured a hamstring and the home team's
Max Christie suffered ankle ligament damage and also went off.
MacLeod was busy on the signing front before last Friday's deadline,
but his Dumbarton squad seem strong enough as it is. Top scorer Martin
Mooney struck twice in the first quarter of the game and further goals
came from Jim Meechan and Roland Fabiani on either side of half-time
before James McKellar's late consolation for Brechin.
Away wins kept the other promotion hopefuls in touch, with Berwick's
1-0 victory probably killing off their hosts, East Fife. Willie Irvine
missed a penalty for Berwick but only after he had punished an error by
the home keeper. A similar mistake led to John Dickson's goal for Clyde
at Meadowbank, which did not help Jim Leishman's battle to save his club
from relegation.
The status quo in that respect was maintained when Queen of the South
also lost at home, by 3-1 to Stirling, who were given an early lead by
Willie Watters. Counters from John Gibson and Joe McLeod were more than
enough insurance against Garry Telfer's late goal for the Dumfries team.

Celtic 1, Motherwell 1
IT is a typical football irony that Rudi Vata has forced himself into
the Celtic first team just when he had resigned himself to seeking
employment elsewhere.
The Albanian has played well in Celtic's last two games and might keep
his place for the Tennents Scottish Cup semi-final on Friday but it
remains doutbful that he will be at Parkhead after the summer when his
contract runs out.
Apart from the fact that his infrequent appearances for the first team
may make it difficult for him to have his UK work permit renewed, Vata
has to decide if he can be sure of a regular top-team place with Celtic,
or whether it would be better to follow up interest from Greek clubs.
''My visa is up at the end of June, and I don't know what will happen
then,'' he said. ''I would like to play for Celtic but I also need
first-team football if I am to keep my international career going.
''This is my third season here and I have been waiting for this chance
to show what I can do. I will have to wait to see what happens when I
discuss things with the manager.''
Vata, unlucky to have given away the penalty which put Motherwell
ahead, was a big influence in the Parkhead side's improved performance
after the interval, turned down the chance of joining former Celtic
manager Liam Brady at Brighton.
''If I leave Celtic I want to go to a European team,'' said the former
Dinamo Tirana player, ''I play as a sweeper or centre half in the
Albanian team and I may get the chance to play there with a European
club.''
He said that AEK Athens, the team who knocked Rangers out of the
Champions' Cup this season, have been asking about his future, as have
Olympiakos and OFI, of Crete. ''The transfer deadline is passed for me
to go now,'' said Vata, ''but we have to wait and see what is decided
after June.''
The 26-year-old felt that he had done nothing worse than shield the
ball with his body when Motherwell substitute Alex Burns went down early
in the second half at the penalty incident. His manager, Tommy Burns,
was inclined to agree. ''I felt sorry for Rudi,'' he said. ''I didn't
think it was a penalty but I can't say too much about that.
''Rudi has done well in the last two games and I am open minded about
his future. It will depend on the work-permit situation.''
Vata was prominent in the last half of the second period when Celtic
discovered an energy, a drive, and a variation in play that forced
Motherwell into a sustained spell of desperate defence.
During that time Miodrag Krivokapic was outstanding and if his team
had held out, it would have been due to his amazing composure.
Perhaps his new team-mate, Mitchel van der Gaag, would learn more from
Mio's display than anything else on his debut after having joined
Motherwell for #400,000. The new man had a mixed start, defending well
at times, especially in the air, but not using the ball on the ground as
well as expected for a man from PSV Eindhoven.
However, he confessed that the pace of the game was faster than he is
accustomed to and will benefit from the experience. ''In Holland if the
keeper throws the ball to you, there is time to play it to a team-mate,
but here you are pressured right away,'' he said, ''but it is what I
expected and I enjoyed it.
''I was satisfied as it was my first game. I thought Celtic put us
under a lot of pressure and they deserved the goal they scored.''
That goal was headed in by Andy Walker from Vata's cross, the
striker's second goal in two games, following up his score as a
substitute against Kilmarnock last week.
He, too, may have grasped his chance of a place in the semi-final
side. Walker admitted that when he was left out he was not playing well
and also acknowledged that Pierre van Hooydonk's arrival had given the
team a lift.
''He and Willie Falconer were getting goals and when that happens all
you can do is wait until you get a chance. I feel strong and fresh and,
like everybody else, looking forward to the game next week.''
Motherwell were the better side in the first half but may have thought
the job was done when Tommy Coyne scored their penalty. At anyrate, they
never really got back into the game in the same way again and might well
have ended up losers.
They lost Dougie Arnott, who did not come out after the interval after
having suffered a leg injury.
The Motherwell player went down after a clash with Tommy Boyd, who was
playing at the heart of Celtic's defence, and was one of their most
effective players.

Scotland Under-19, 13 England Under-19 32
STIRLING has been the setting for some epic encounters between the
Scots and the English. Sadly for the home side on Saturday, there was to
be no repeat of the victories at Bannockburn or Stirling Bridge.
The Scottish youngsters played with gritty determination against
physicaly superior opposition but found, like countless Scottish sides
before them, that a good little 'un will invariably play second fiddle
to a good big 'un.
The Scots, who fly out for their first appearance in the FIRA youth
tournament in Bucharest at the end of the week, now have first-hand
experience of the severe physical challenge which awaits them in the
Balkans.
At Bridgehaugh on Saturday, the English side were, to a man, bigger
and stronger than their Scottish counterparts. Even Phil Belgian, the
English stand-off, looked like a refugee from the scrummage front-row.
The Scots were beaten but not disgraced. Of much more concern to the
Bucharest squad management is the fact that both centres went down hurt.
Russell Kennedy has a wrist injury and Craig Murray damaged a hamstring.
Because Scotland -- with Bucharest looming -- were playing to FIRA
age-group rules, the England side had a nine-month age advantage.
Nevertheless, it would be churlish to put the English win down to bulk
alone.
At times, and always when they weren't playing that dratted English
mauling game, the English youngsters produced some sparkling continuity
rugby which had the Scottish defence at full stretch.
England scored five tries to Scotland's two, a fair distribution of
the spoils.
Both of Scotland's touchdowns came from left-winger Danny Bull, a
schoolboy cap out of Stewart's-Melville College last year, and very fine
efforts they were. Each was manufactured from little or nothing and
served to underline Bull's value as a first-class finisher.
It was to the Scots' great credit that they got stuck in about the
English youngsters.
So much so in fact that, within two minutes, the Scots had taken the
lead. A Gavin Dalgleish kick took play to a lineout near the England
line. The Scots punished untidy lineout work by England and drove to the
try line where a penalty was conceded and Scott Tomlinson goaled to give
first blood to Scotland.
It was, though, a false dawn. Thereafter, the Scots were invariably
forced to defend like demons.
Tomlinson missed two more penalty chances and, after 17 minutes,
England went into the lead with a Graeme Smith try, converted by
Belgian.
Dalgleish and England's Andrew Blyth (twice) both missed with penalty
attempts before Belgian kicked England into a seven point lead at the
interval with a successful penalty attempt of his own.
Kennedy departed hurt at half-time to be followed a short while later
by Murray. Scotland had begun the second period with a foray into
England territory but, in quick measure, they found themselves defending
deep inside their own half and this set the pattern for the second
period.
Robert Ashforth had a try for England after five minutes of the second
half. Belgian converted.
Daniel Zaltzman, a huge lock forward, powered over for a try six
minutes later.
Just a minute after that, Roy Winters had a try and it really did look
as if the Scots' boys were en route to a five-star thrashing.
Then, Bull set the match alight with fine try resulting from a
breakaway and 30-metre dash up the left touchline.
Three minutes later, after a tap penalty by Beveridge and a pass by
Tomlinson, Bull was galloping over for his second. That made it 13-27
and the outlook wasn't nearly so grim.
Then, Bull almost made it three in a row. The young Stew-Mel winger
pirated ruck ball inside his own half and made off for the line. He
elected to chip over the head of Truelove, his opposite number, but the
Englishman got his fingertips to the ball and Bull was denied.
From then on the Scots' boys found the going hard. England's superior
bulk began to take its toll on strength and stamina and four minutes
from the end Fraser Waters set the seal on an England victory with a try
which followed the most gigantic up-and-under from Belgian.

ALAS there was no sheer genius among Scotland's juniors on Saturday as
they succumbed to a very good Northern Ireland side in the final of the
Guinness Cup.
The 3-2 scoreline, though, does not reflect the comprehensive defeat
at Newlandsfield.
The final itself was hard fought, with the Irish having the upper hand
for most of the game.
They opened the scoring in the eighth minute with a header from
ex-Bangor City striker Steve Barnes and continued to dominate throughout
the first half.
However, Scotland equalised against the run of play thanks to a
swerving free kick from Beith's Stevie Tennent.
In the second half, Ireland continued to pile on the pressure and that
man Barnes -- the scourge of the Scotland team -- and winger John
Johnstone, put them 3-1 ahead.
A late penalty converted by Martin Nelson, of Shettleston, made the
scoreline look more respectable. So for this season the Guinness Cup is
on its way back across the sea to Ireland.
Manager Gray could barely hide his disappointment, especially at the
manner in which his team were beaten. The team has lots of class and
talent but perhaps lack some of the alternative junior qualities.
Scotland's starting line-up for both games was: Picken (Dalry
Thistle), Walker (Petershill), Kennedy (Glenafton), Smith (Shettleston),
Tennent (Beith), Bonnar (Camelon), Nelson (Shettleston), Taylor
(Whitburn) Grainger (Pollok), Scott (Whitburn), Harkness (Kilwinning).
The weekend had started so differently with Scotland scoring a
convincing 5-1 win over Isle of Man at Maryhill.
This was an excellent performance and five goals by five different
scorers must have given manager Gray hope for the final to come.
For the record, the scorers were: Nelson (Shettleston), Bonnar
(Camelon), Scott (Whitburn), Grainger (Pollok), Taylor (Whitburn).
Northern Ireland qualified after beating Southern Ireland on penalties
after the game had finished 1-1.
The play-off for third and fourth places ended with Southern Ireland
beating Isle of Man 1-0.
Next season's competition will be held in the Isle of Man.
The draw for the OVD Cup was made after the Guinness final and
produced these crackers: Lochee United v Camelon and Whitburn v
Glenafton.
Camelon manager Brian Fairley was not too unhappy at being paired with
underdogs Lochee.
Camelon already have knocked out Tayside teams Downfield and North
End. Lochee had a convincing victory over the fancied Hill O'Beath in
the last round.
The ties are due to be played on April 27 and 28 at venues to be
decided.
The semi-final draw for the Scottish Gas-sponsored Under 23 Cup
resulted: North Region v Ayrshire Region and Tayside Region v Central
region.

Alloa Brewery Cup -- Ormiston 2, Camelon 0.
John Walker League -- Dunbar 3, Linlithgow 8; Haddington 3, Bathgate

Dunfermline 1, Dundee 1
THE veteran American comedian, George Burns, was once told not to
drink any more, to which he replied: ''Sure, doc. I'll just stick to the
amount I'm drinking at the moment.''
Jim Duffy was once told he could not play football competitively
anymore because of a crocked knee. So he just does what's he's able to
do -- and the man of the match award at East End Park proves he still
does it well.
And the guy who will be 36 shortly is still proving, on and off the
field, what he has said all along -- that he does not feel under
pressure in the cauldron of battle for promotion.
It was he who referred to George Burns after the match. When asked how
he felt about the award, he said: ''Let's face it, when you take the
stage at our age, you get a round of applause just for being alive.''
Both sides heard plenty of applause in an absorbing match that always
threatened to explode, but never quite made it because of the tension.
Duffy and Dunfermline manager Bert Paton described it as ''a game of
two flukes,'' but come the day of reckoning, on May 13 -- and both are
in agreement the fight will go to the final day of the season -- these
could be vital.
George Shaw's strike just on half-time was spectacular, but the fact
he was invited to the after-match press gathering and elected to ride
off into the sunset, would suggest he prefers to leave to the Fourth
Estate to decide whether or not he meant it.
John McQuillan's short throw-in way out on the right was not even
allowed to touch the ground as Shaw swivelled and hammered over what the
experts call the ''early ball'' that incoming strikers relish.
It was far too early not only for Dundee's front men, but also for
Dunfermline keeper Guido van de Kamp. He was sleeping in no man's land,
and the ball sailed over his head.
Step in Ivo den Bieman, kept in reserve because he was still carrying
stitches in an ankle injury -- ''right on the bone'' as Paton put it.
Fans' favourite den Bieman was being called to action by his followers
long before he replaced the tiring debutant, Greg Shaw, after 72
minutes.
And just as it was a right back who supplied the ammunition for the
Dundee goal, so it was Jackie McNamara who set up the equaliser after 83
minutes. His cross into a penalty area that would rival a Saturday in
Sauchiehall Street found the head of den Bieman.
Up went the ball in a splendid loop, Pageaud stood and looked, Stewart
Petrie came hurtling in, missed it, and the net was only slightly
ruffled as referee Crombie signalled a goal.
Ray Farningham then had to come to Dundee's rescue with a goal-line
clearance, which as television pictures proved, was completely legal
despite claims that either it should have been a penalty or that the
ball had crossed the line.
Honours even was more of a pleasure for Dundee, who remain top.
Paton's main worry is that the goals which flowed earlier in the season
now are hard to come by, while his defence have not had a shut-out in
the league this year.

' If I'm going to continue I have to start playing well again and the
best way to do that is to play in more tournaments. '
THE dogwood and the magnolia; the perfectly manicured fairways; and
the presentation of the treasured green jacket. A far cry from the start
of the golf season for hackers on a wet Saturday in Troon or
Duddingston. But later this week all eyes will be on the timeless glory
of the US Masters in Augusta.
The European hopefuls will be back, eager to stamp their authority in
the magical setting in the Deep South. With six wins in the past seven
years (Fred Couples spoiled the pattern in 1992) doubtless they have
reason to be confident, especially with so many of the favourites for
the tournament in their ranks.
Not so confident but bidding for a seventh victory will be Jack
Nicklaus. The Golden Bear's record in world golf is unsurpassed. His
favourite course is said to be Augusta and the record shows why.
He has had the most wins (6); is the oldest winner (46 in 1986);
shares the lowest total (271 in 1965); has had the most sub-par rounds
(64); and is one of only two people to defend the title (1965-66).
Of course, there are others who remember being record holders at
Augusta -- but at the other end of the scale. Tom Weiskopf had an
inauspicious 13 at the twelfth in 1980. Mind you, I can hardly smirk if
I recall the last hole at Kirriemuir during an outing several years ago.
Let's just say an abacus might have been useful.
As Nicklaus heads for Georgia, presumably on his private jet,
appropriately called Air Bear, there is talk of him quitting the
tournament circuit. His game has been in the doldrums. Not content to
sit back he has been playing more than for some time, hoping that by
doing so he can regain his form.
''I love playing but I have hated the way I've been recently,'' he
said. ''If I'm going to continue I have to start playing well again and
the best way to do that is to play in more tournaments.'' He said that
if he doesn't play well then he will quit.
That would be a huge loss to the golfing public. Nicklaus has been
hugely influential in the development of the modern game. Nick Faldo is
said to have taken up the game after having watched his hero on
television. All over the world his name is synonymous with oustanding
ability, fair play, and sportmanship of the highest calibre. However, it
wasn't always so.
The greatest golfer of our time struggled for popularity on his debut.
A touch brash he was perceived as something of an upstart, especially as
he began to overshadow Arnold Palmer. But his whole attitude changed
when he turned professional. ''I'm a pro now and I intend to behave like
one,'' he said and has kept his word since.
He has always had the mark of a true sporting hero -- dignified in
victory and magnanimous in defeat. And the crowds love him for that as
well as his dedication to the game.
Most golf fans would far rather turn out to watch him than the
seemingly endless supply of over-coached robots who regularly appear
from golf schools around the globe, their teachers always on hand to
caress their fragile egos. Of course, in many sports it's depressing to
watch a champion continuing past his prime -- the boxers who should have
hung up their gloves, the footballer who just isn't fast enough any
more. But golf is different. And so is Nicklaus.
He has said that most tournaments are lost and that only a few are won
and he proved the point with his fairytale victory at Augusta in 1986.
Many watched with a lump in their throats as he triumphed over a phalanx
of young pretenders.
Asked what his best memory of playing in the Masters is he will say
that sharing that last victory with his son, Jackie, who caddied for
him, was the best part. That is a true measure of the man.

' Only so long as the American majors keep widening the international
content of their fields can an overseas challenge be sustained. '
At the US Masters
INCREASINGLY, since television has beamed it live across the Atlantic,
the Masters tournament has come to be seen in this country as almost THE
defining event of the golfing calendar. Surely, now that April's here,
the worst the winter weather can inflict is past and the promise of
spring will revive old hopes -- not to mention old habits and old
follies.
But if the rank-and-file of golfers think so, also, for very different
reasons, do the world's foremost professionals. On Thursday will begin
the contest for the first of the season's four major championships, the
winning of which distinguishes a player's career more than any of the
regular tournaments he may win and all the prize-money he may earn.
Those who by right of specific qualification or by the mandate of the
hosts will have received their engraved invitations: ''The Board of
Governors of the Augusta National Golf Club cordially invites you to
participate in the 1995 Masters Tournament to be held at Augusta,
Georgia, on the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth of April.''
The card is signed by the club's chairman, Jackson T Stephens, and
there is not much doubt that acknowledging the request to RSVP is as
swift an act by those who have gained a place in the most restricted
field of all the championships as accepting the ruling of a free drop.
None has more successfully responded to attend this rite of spring
than the European professional. Of the past 15 Masters nine have been
won by Scottish, English, Welsh, Spanish, or German players, and six of
the last seven. Tomorrow evening, at the champions' dinner in the
ante-bellum clubhouse, Jose-Maria Olazabal will take his place as host.
Olazabal will, by custom, have chosen the menu and then foot the bill
as Severiano Ballesteros, Bernhard Langer, Sandy Lyle, Nick Faldo, and
Ian Woosnam have gladly done before him. The club chef must be wondering
when such exotica as paella, bratwurst, and haggis are going to be
replaced by a plain old sirloin steak.
The explanation for this domination, unique among the majors, can be
quite readily identified. Only in the past two decades have European
professionals in numbers been admitted on a regular basis to this holy
of holies, to which, of course, they have then returned year after year.
They have become thoroughly acquainted with the course.
At the same time, European and other countries had begun to produce
players better equipped to command the world stage than their American
counterparts. The American appetite for the gourmet, a la carte overseas
bill of fare had become dulled and appeased by the cholesterol-rich
domestic table d'hote offering.
True, the US Open was last year won by a South African, Ernie Els, but
he was the first foreigner since Australia's David Graham, in 1981, to
do so. And the argument could legitimately be led that Graham was, so to
speak, house-trained, essentially a product of the US Tour's academy of
sombre and unimaginative application and orthodoxy.
Also, US Open courses are habitually set up in a rigorous way that
discourages flair and improvisation. So, although rather less
puritanically, are US PGA tests, so that three of those past five
championships have been won by foreign-born players, the Australian,
Wayne Grady, and twice by Zimbabwe's Nick Price.
Moreover, an American-born professional has captured only one of the
past 11 Open Championships; before which only two of the previous 14
Opens had not made the trans-Atlantic journey westwards.
In the quest to restore a semblance of self-regard, the absence
through illness or injury of Paul Azinger and Fred Couples has certainly
not been helpful.
Americans are regarded as unrepentantly, not to say irredeemably,
isolationist, not least in sport. But more than one of their golf
writers has made the point that winning the past two Ryder Cup matches,
both by slender margins, and tying the one before that, was, as an
indication of restored superiority, a false prospectus.
Some American professionals have excoriated the Sony world-rankings
system as favouring the European Tour, but, based on three years of
play, its conclusions do not seem to be unreasonable. Since 1987, 11
players have been, at season's end, in the first five; only three have
been American and but one, Couples, has finished in the first three.
Trends of that sort tend to be cyclical and, as it must always be
noted, Ballesteros, Langer, Faldo, Woosnam, and Lyle -- the pathfinders
for Europe's resurgence -- are all growing old together, now in their
later 30s, and are no longer the consistent force they once were,
especially Lyle.
Weight of numbers may well tilt the balance back to the United States
sooner rather than later, for at this stage only Olazabal and Colin
Montgomerie, Europe's No.1 for the past two years, seem to have not just
the talent and the perseverance to bridge the generation gap, but the
ambition and the acceptance of the modern pressures applied to fame and
success.
But only so long as the three American majors keep widening the
international content of their fields can an overseas challenge be
sustained. It is hardly helpful to that cause when the Masters
stubbornly accommodates fewer than 100 players and the US PGA, purely
for old times' sake, some 40 club professionals.
Criticising the composition of a Masters field is, as one American
professional has said, ''a little like insulting the mother alligator
before you finish crossing the swamp.'' All the same, inflexibility does
persist and thereby created the glaring anomaly that occurred three
years ago.
Tom Kite, who had one of the most distinguished records in the
tournament of a non-winner, could not command a place under any American
qualification. That summer, Kite won the US Open and a groundswell of
opinion formed that the club should take on board the discretionary
power to add, at a late stage, one or two players worthy of inclusion.
The amateur content, which used to measure almost 10% of the field,
has now been reduced to the more realistic proportion of four
representatives, but although sentiment and nostalgia are upheld by
allowing former winners to take part well into their golfing dotage, the
feeling remains that they should be ''in addition'' not as ''still one
of the boys.''
Players make championships, not their regulating authorities, even one
as autocratic as Augusta National. To be sure, the Masters is ''their''
tournament and to that extent the club can please itself. It is also,
however, the custodian of one of the great championships and is,
therefore, obligated to assemble the strongest challenge for it.
Whatever, the attractions of the tournament remain irresistible. This
week, for the first time, admission to the three practice days is by
ticket only; the appalling scrum from Monday to Wednesday last year made
the usual restricted attendance for the first round on Thursday seem
positively sparse -- yet it is fully subscribed at some 30,000
spectators.
Indeed, the list for series badges for the tournament proper was
closed as long as 23 years ago and the waiting list followed in 1978,
since any additions would not become eligible for tickets ''in the
foreseeable future.'' In this sporting rite of spring, whatever its
defects, there remains a compelling interest, to some even an affection
not often evident in this careworn age.

IN ENGLAND
BLACKBURN Rovers yesterday received the clearest indication yet that
they will become champions of England after a wait of 81 years.
Manchester United, beginning the afternoon six points behind their
Lancashire rivals, managed to cut the deficit by only one as a
disjointed performance at home to Leeds brought them no more than a
goalless draw.
Blackburn, 2-1 winners at Everton on Saturday, now have a game in hand
as well, and will extend their lead to eight points if they can win away
to Queen's Park Rangers tomorrow.
It was ironic that United, the great entertainers, could not manage a
goal in a weekend when 38 had flown in during the nine other Premier
League matches.
Missing suspended captain Steve Bruce and the injured Andrei
Kanchelskis, they were not comfortable at either end of the pitch and
might easily have fallen behind before finally creating some
opportunities in the second half.
The bookmakers responded more decisively than United's strikers,
cutting Blackburn's odds to a forbidding 5-1 on.
Kenny Dalglish's team had started the ball rolling, and the net
bulging, only 13 seconds into their game at Everton, where three centre
halves were deployed against Chris Sutton and Alan Shearer.
Not enough. Sutton scored in the first move of the match, while
Shearer added a second within seven minutes. Graham Stuart pulled one
goal back with a clever chip and Colin Hendry needed to surpass his
Moscow heroics to help his team withstand a sustained assault by the
Goodison men.
''Absolutely magnificent, a giant among men,'' was Alan Hansen's
verdict on his fellow Scot.
Hendry's international defensive partner Colin Calderwood had less
success yesterday morning as Tottenham went down 4-3 to Southampton in a
wonderfully open game at The Dell.
Matthew Le Tissier, discarded by England, scored twice, as did Teddy
Sheringham, who had been controversially selected ahead of Andy Cole.
The effect on the league table was to bring Southampton level on points
with Everton.
Aston Villa were the other main beneficiaries, a last-minute own goal
by the Ipswich defender Chris Swailes, on his debut, giving them an
important victory after their recent slide back into trouble.
They need now to avoid defeat tomorrow away to Crystal Palace,for whom
Chris Armstrong scored again in the 2-1 win over ailing Manchester City.
Even Southampton and Spurs could not match the scoring at
Hillsborough, which was rather more one-sided as Nottingham Forest
humiliated Sheffield Wednesday on their own pitch by 7-1.
Bryan Roy and Stan Collymore, given a volley by their manager Frank
Clark recently, have responded in just the way he must have hoped, and
were again in irresistible form.
So, less predictably, were Arsenal, who demolished Norwich 5-1 and
Wimbledon, 4-3 winners away to doomed Leicester.
Arsenal will be buoyant going into their European Cup-Winners' Cup
semi-final at home to Sampdoria of Italy on Thursday; Chelsea, who
travel to Zaragoza in Spain for the other tie, less so after conceding a
late equaliser to Newcastle on Saturday that leaves them badly in need
of more points.

Aberdeen 0, Kilmarnock 1
DOMINATION and determination count for little in the relegation battle
as Aberdeen found to their cost against Kilmarnock.
The visitors scarcely entered the Dons' territory during the 90
minutes, they had one corner while the home side won almost 20, keeper
Lekovic was given his most demanding test of the season by Aberdeen,
while at the other end, Watt was idle, yet Kilmarnock headed south with
the three points and a major boost to their battle to remain in the
premier division, while the Dons now are deep in crisis.
''It's a cruel game,'' said Aberdeen's caretaker-manager Roy Aitken.
''I can't fault the performance but it's results we need.''
What must seem cruel to Aberdeen is that premier division keepers
consistently choose Pittodrie to turn in outstanding displays.
Two weeks ago, Jim Leighton earned Hibs a point by denying the
superior home side on several occasions.
On Saturday, the former Red Star Belgrade and Yugoslavian
internationalist keeper Dragoje Lekovic was superb time after time to
hold out Aberdeen and help Kilmarnock to become the first club to beat
the Dons four times in a season in the premier division.
Aberdeen started the game with the same line-up as against Hibs, with
the exception of Michael Watt replacing injured Theo Snelders.
Paul Wright, their #340,000 record signing and once an Aberdeen
player, led the Kilmarnock strike force in his debut game.
Kilmarnock started strongly, forcing Aberdeen back into their own box,
but within a few minutes Aberdeen had taken control and stepped up the
pressure.
Kilmarnock's goal after 50 minutes was against the run of play.
Ally Mitchell crossed from the right and Mark Skilling raced through
the defence and volleyed the ball past Watt from eight yards.
Eoin Jess was brought on six minutes later to replace Brian Grant, but
nothing he could do was enough to get the Dons back in the game.
''That and the Hibs game were unbelievable,'' said Aitken. ''We had
pressure, possession, chances, and we peppered the goal.
''That was not a just result. I can't criticise the players, they gave
their lot again and didn't get a result.
''I feel we are definitely on the right lines, but we are coming up
against fortunate defenders and fortunate goalkeepers.
''Hibs and Kilmarnock have been so fortunate, it's frightening.
''We will get ourselves out of this situation. There are six games
left and if I get that performance week in, week out, we will avoid
relegation, but we definitely need a wee break. There are still 18
points available.
''As far as I am concerned we are very close to giving someone a real
hiding. If we keep up that level of performance, the results will
come.''
Alex Totten echoed his words: ''At the moment, it's all about results.
If you get a good performance, that's the icing on the cake, but the aim
is to try to stay in the premier division.With six games to go anything
can happen.
''It's a funny old game as they say, and to use another cliche, we
have to take each game as it comes.''
Ex-Don Robert Connor said that Aberdeen were playing well and had put
Kilmarnock under tremendous pressure over the last quarter of the game.
All they could do was to continue to play well and hope the ball started
finding the net.
He admitted he was surprised that Jess was unable to command a
starting place.
''I don't know what is going on between those involved, but certainly
if he has got the right attitude then he would be in any team in
Scotland.''

Hearts 0, Falkirk 1
THE nervous, worried teams in the bottom three places in the premier
division table this morning should have commissioned a video of
Falkirk's winning performance at Tynecastle on Saturday.
For the footage would have contained a comprehensive formula of how to
completely rid yourself of relegation pressures in one, 90 minute
session.
First you require no nonsense, physically strong defenders like John
Clark, Joe McLaughlin, and John Hughes on which to base the complete
creation.
You add in midfield players like Brian Rice, David Weir, and Scott
McKenzie who are all happy to indulge in the intricacies and the
creative side, but make sheer hard graft the priority.
And lastly you lace the concoction with the height of Steve Kirk, pace
and mobility of Paul McGrillen, and class of Maurice Johnston, before
making determination the binding ingredient.
Falkirk manager Jim Jefferies, with all his experience of life at the
realistic end of the game, certainly paraded a template that others
would have been wise to follow.
Just one month ago, with seven clubs in jeopardy, Jeffries worked
tirelessly to put together an ambitious transfer package that has
resulted in a top half of the table position.
Although he had to sacrifice Eddie May's departure to Motherwell, he
negotiated in return Kirk, McGrillen, and enough cash to fund Johnston's
move from Hearts.
And at Tynecastle, in Falkirk's victory over the Edinburgh club, they
were a frontline that were so clearly of premier division quality, given
that they were competing with international defenders.
Now, after having battled for points for eight anxious months, the
Falkirk manager can enjoy the luxury of looking up the way in the league
table, to spy the next challenge.
''Our target today was to jump over Hearts in the league and now we
can set our sights on Celtic, who are immediately above us.
''They have a three-point advantage but they still have to come to our
place,'' said Jeffries.
''Only last week our captain, John Hughes, was insistent that the team
would not be beaten again during the remainder of the campaign, and I'm
not going to argue with him.
''Although no-one here will be allowed to become complacent in the
next few weeks, it is satisfying to have opened up a comforting gap.''
Significantly, his three recent signings were all involved in the
match winner after 41 minutes.
Johnston just missed contact with Kirk's low cross from the right, but
McGrillen was at the far post to knock the ball in.
Completing a dismal day for Hearts was a knee injury to goalkeeper
Craig Nelson, which saw him replaced by Henry Smith after half-an-hour.
Although the injury was too swollen to allow accurate assessment, the
former Partick Thistle player faces a struggle to be ready for the
Scottish Cup semi-final against Airdrie on Saturday.
* BASLE did their chances of winning the Swiss league title no harm at
all yesterday when they beat leaders Grasshoppers 1-0.
The Zurich club have 22 points, while Basle now are on 16. Aarau also

UNITED we stand -- but because of United, we may fall. The expressions
of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson and his assistant Brian Kidd
need no description.
It was the end of a goalless result against Leeds United at Old
Trafford, and the realisation that his side will be eight points adrift
in the Premiership with only six games remaining if leaders Blackburn
Rovers win at Loftus Road against Queens Park Rangers tomorrow.
Ferguson was his usual blunt self. Of yesterday's draw, he said: ''It
could not prove so much crucial as decisive.''
Of the champions' hopes of retaining their title, he said: ''We will
continue to battle as we always do, but now I think that Blackburn can
only throw the league away. That's the situation.''
Ferguson then got back to the positive attitude that has brought his
team so much success.
''Now we've got six games left and we'll try to win them all. That's
the nature of this club. It's not built on giving in, it's built on far
stronger foundations than that.''
The humour came through as well. ''We're just hoping for Blackburn to
do a Devon Loch,'' referring to that famous Grand National incident when
the Queen Mother's horse, well clear, tried to jump an imaginary fence
-- and lost.

Partick Thistle 2, Hibernian 2
WAYNE Foster came back to haunt Hibernian at the weekend, equalising
twice for a Partick Thistle side who simply refuse to give up their
struggle to retain premier division status.
The former Hearts striker had several happy Edinburgh derby matches
against the Easter Road outfit, probably none more so than last year
when he came on as a substitute and scored the goal which knocked
Hibernian out of the Scottish Cup. But Saturday's double strike at
Firhill could well prove to be the most valuable goals he has scored in
his career.
After Keith Wright had given the Edinburgh side the lead in 13
minutes, Foster admitted he was quite fortunate to see his near-post
shot spin off Steven Tweed and past Jim Leighton in 46 minutes, and then
after Kevin Harper put Hibs ahead again in 61 minutes, Foster had the
nerve and poise to slam home a penalty kick just four minutes from time
to pull Thistle to within one point of second-bottom Aberdeen -- and
they have two matches in hand.
''I can't remember the last time I took a penalty,'' said the
31-year-old Englishman. ''That was my first for Thistle, and when I was
at Tynecastle the regular penalty taker was John Robertson.''
The last time Foster was on the spot, in fact, was more than six years
ago against Motherwell -- and he missed. Happily for Thistle, there was
no mistake this time.
''I was so confident,'' said Foster. ''When we got the penalty, I told
our captain, Albert Craig, I would take it. He just asked if I felt
confident enough and I assured him I was.
''Mind you, the team is disappointed at not getting a win, for we felt
we were the better side. Really, in our position, single points are not
good enough. Aberdeen are losing, but we are not capitalising as we
should. However, if we were to be offered a play-off place right now,
I'd take it.''
Manager John Lambie also was disappointed at not taking the three
points, and was unhappy at the two goals lost. ''They were shocking,''
he said.
Indeed they were, for the initial mistakes were made when Thistle had
possession deep inside Hibs' territory. Lambie, however, is delighted
with the response from his men in recent weeks.
He said: ''Six weeks ago everybody had us down and out, but these
players have now given themselves a chance of survival. If we keep
battling away, the man up there might give us a wee break or two.''
Hibs manager Alex Miller, who saw substitute Mickey Weir sent off for
stamping shortly after he had come on for the injured Gordon Hunter, was
not a happy man either. ''I was disappointed with the performance,'' he
said. ''I don't think we strung three passes together in the whole
game.''
On the penalty, when Dave Farrell was judged to have fouled Steve
Pittman, Miller said: ''It was a penalty. It was also poor defending,
because the man was going nowhere.''
On the ordering off, he said: ''I don't have to go along with the
decision, but I have to accept it.''
And he explained why he had taken off Harper immediately after the
youngster had scored his side's second goal. Said Miller: ''I had
already made up my mind he was coming off, because he just wasn't taking
part in the match at that particular time.''
Miller must certainly be hoping for a more positive reaction from his
men for Friday's Scottish Cup semi-final against Celtic at Ibrox. Weir,
of course, will be suspended, while Hunter and Wright are suffering from
thigh injuries.
Thistle will continue their fight against relegation when they meet
Hearts at Firhill tomorrow night, knowing that a win will hoist them
above Aberdeen and give them a huge psychological boost.

SCOTTISH football could learn something from Eric Cantona. No, not how
to kick loudmouth fans. But to express themselves more poetically.
His comments on leaving court -- ''When seagulls follow a trawler it
is because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea'' -- takes us
worlds beyond traditional soccer references to parrots, the moon, and
how good the boy has done.
I can hear Scotland coach Craig Brown drawing on his background as a
college lecturer to comment: ''When the boys in dark blue board the big
metal bird for distant horizons to meet challenges new, we are always
happy to settle for a 0-0 draw.''
After a certain cup-tie at Ochilview in February, Aberdeen manager Roy
Aitken might have said: ''Man was born to suffer. We all have to cope
with the transient nature of success and failure. Anyway, Scottish
football needs a strong Stenhousemuir.''
Jim Farry, as a bit of a philosopher and student of Scottish
literature, would, no doubt, say: ''The soccer of Brazil is not for me.
Give me a typical five-four-one Scottish line-up that scores few goals
and breaks the heart.''
And now that Michael Kelly has had time to reflect on life after
Celtic I am sure he would say: ''To everything there is a season; a time
to change; a time to move on. And you really have to admire Fergus
McCann for all he has achieved in such a short time at Celtic Park.''
* SPEAKING as one who enjoyed a cool beer or two at last year's World
Cup it is nice to hear of a sporting event where a drop of refreshment
will be on hand.
The Scottish Claymores American football team's first home game at
Murrayfield on Sunday will be preceded by a three-hour party at which
quantities of Budweiser will be on sale.
Budweiser are sponsoring the Scottish Claymores as part of their
#500,000 investment in American football in Britain. Unfortunately, none
of the cash appears to have been earmarked to provide free beer for the
fans. Strong drink, of course, is prohibited at Murrayfield which is a
designated stadium under the Criminal Justice (Let The People In The
Executive Boxes Drink Themselves Stupid But Arrest Any Fan Who Is
Carrying A Plastic Bottle Of Vimto) (Scotland) Act, 1984.
The Claymores have got round the problem by holding their party on the
back rugby pitches at Murrayfield which are not within the meaning of
the Act. Will Wilson, the Claymores' PR director, says that fans will
have the opportunity to get inter-active at the party. Unfortunately,
this is not a reference to the Claymore cheerleaders but to various
activities which simulate the experience of playing American football.
These include diving over an inflatable wall, throwing passes, and
something called Velcro wall-jumping. The traditional US sport of
stuffing your face with hotdogs and barbecued burgers will also feature
prominently.
* A Sports Diary informant tells of a fixture which would have
benefited from a bit less bevvy. Our man in Stirling, in search of some
football action last week when most premier division teams were having a
day of rest, took himself to the Scottish Amateur Cup tie between St
Ninians and West Kilbride.
He was very impressed by the standard of play but less so by the
standard of behaviour of some fans. The match attracted around 250
spectators, a higher turnout than at some senior matches.
On arrival, a number of West Kilbride fans proceeded to decorate the
green grassy slopes at the side of the pitch with huge Union flags and
then get tanked into considerable carry-outs of strong drink. There were
no serious incidents but locals visiting the public library adjacent to
the pitch had to run the gauntlet of lager-swilling fans.
The Stirling folk were more than puzzled to see such a contingent of
bears from such a douce wee town as West Kilbride. Were the fans merely
refugees from another place which also favours the red, white, and blue?
There will be an opportunity to find out when the match, which ended in
a draw, is replayed.

* BRITISH clubs could be set to join forces to challenge UEFA's
controversial three-foreigner rule.
They have been badly hit by the rule which allows only three
'foreigners' per team in club competitions, because England, Scotland,
Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic are deemed to be seperate by
UEFA.
Radio Five Live programme On The Line yesterday claimed the rule is
illegal under the Treaty of Rome, which allows citizens of member states
free movement to work anywhere within the European Community.
On The Line alleged both UEFA and EC chiefs knew the rule was illegal,
but struck a gentleman's agreement to ignore the fact at a meeting in
Strasbourg back in 1988.
Both the Premier League and Manchester United have commissioned law
reports which concluded the rule would be unlikely to survive a
challenge in the European court. So far United have fought shy of a
legal battle -- because they fear a ban from European competition while
they fight the case.
But that could change following the forthcoming European Court case in
which Belgian international Jean Marc Bosman will challenge the legality
of transfer fees.
Bosman claims they are a restraint to the freedom of movement in the
workplace guaranteed by The Treaty of Rome -- and if he wins the case,
the three-foreigner rule would also be exposed as an impediment.
United will be monitoring the situation closely -- and Rangers
vice-chairman Donald Finlay told On The Line the Glasgow giants would be
contacting fellow British clubs in a bid to create a combined challenge
to the rule.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
HUNTLY'S comfortable victory in the Jarlaw Aberdeenshire Cup final did
more than simply return the ornate old trophy to Christie Park for the
third time in four years.
It confirmed the growing suspicion that the club has begun what is
destined to be a long-term domination of Highland football.
The strength in depth of the squad, an attacking front three who are
touching 100 goals for the second season running, and a manager who
shows no signs of losing his Midas touch, suggest that Huntly will
continue to dominate the decade as Elgin City, Inverness Caledonian, and
Keith did in years gone by.
Paterson, who has steered his side to 10 finals in four years -- and
won eight of them -- admitted as much yesterday as he reflected on his
side's ability to produce the goods when it matters.
''Three or four years ago, winning the cup would have had our players
and supporters doing cartwheels.
''But, on Saturday, it was like it was another day at the office.''
A disappointing final was won by a Gary Whyte double, after Brian
Thomson opened the scoring, for a 3-0 victory over Cove Rangers.
Cove's season has turned sour over the past three weeks and manager
Kenny Taylor may begin some summer reshaping to re-establish his squad
as stronger challengers to a Huntly side which is rightfully taking its
place with the great sides in Highland history.
In the Highland League, an individual great, Ian Stewart, hit a
four-goal blitz for Lossiemouth as they brushed aside Wick Academy 6-0.
Scott Paterson and Ian Shaw were also on target as Stewart took his
season's total to 41.
Kevin Christie gave Deveronvale the lead at Brora Rangers only for
team-mate Derek Ironside to score an own goal two minutes later for a
1-1 draw.
Sad Nairn County finished their season with a 4-0 home drubbing by
Fraserburgh, who scored through a Marino Keith hat-trick and an Ian
Murray first half strike.
Ronnie Smith goals in the last minute of the first and second halves
gave Buckie Thistle their 2-0 win at Inverness Clach.
Ex-Don Ian Polworth hit a double for Fort William as they got a fine
2-1 victory at Peterhead, who netted through Scott Shepherd.

WORLDWIDE
GERMAN internationalist Andreas Moeller, under investigation for
alleged tax evasion, could be imprisoned for 10 years if found guilty.
Fraud squad officers have raided the home of the Borussia Dortmund
midfield player and his agent, Klaus Gerster, to spark off the latest
scandal to hit the Bundesliga.
The probe centres on Moeller's moves to and from Germany. In a complex
deal, he bought out his contract from Eintracht Frankfurt to join
Juventus, whom he then left to join Dortmund.
Moeller denies the charges, saying that he left his financial affairs
to his agent. Under German law, though, he will be held responsible for
any illegalities. Tax authorities have indicated that as much as #2.5m
may be involved, which would lead to a fine as well as jail.
Meanwhile, Dortmund are rueing the loss of their Swiss striker,
Stephane Chapuisant, injured in a training incident with assistant coach
Michael Henke.
Chapuisant's father, Gabet, a former player of some renown, caused a
furore by insisting the reason for the injury was covered up.
''It is disgusting that a leading club should allow this sort of
behaviour to happen,'' he said.
Dortmund's general manager, Michael Meyer, replied: ''When I hear
remarks like this I shake my head. Injuries are an everyday part of
training.''
Ironically, Moeller returns to Italy this week to meet his former
club, Juventus, in a semi-final of the UEFA Cup surrounded by strife.
Controversy has been flamed by Juventus, who have enraged their
supporters and players alike by conceding home advantage. The tie has
been switched from their Delle Alpi Stadium to the Giuseppe Meazza in
Milan because Juventus can earn an estimated #2m more through increased
advertising and greater support.
The Italian League leaders enjoy considerable support throughout the
country, even in the city of arch rivals AC Milan and Inter.
But their striker, Fabrizio Ravanelli, was scathingly critical,
insisting: ''It is ridiculous and appalling that the club should give up
their own ground at such a stage in the UEFA Cup.
''Football has been taken away from the real supporters and put in the
hands of commercialism. I understand the club's motives, for the people
of Turin have given our challenge in Europe a cold reception, but I
cannot agree with them.''
* AC Milan's support will be able to assess their latest acquisition,
George Weah, when Paris St Germain contest the Champions' League
semi-final on Wednesday.
Weah, valued at #4m, said yesterday that he is 90% certain to join
Milan next season. Meanwhile, city rivals Inter have failed to tempt
coach Louis Van Gaal away from Ajax to replace Ottavio Bianchi.
Apart from their interest in Manchester United's Eric Cantona,
Blackburn's Alan Shearer and PSV Eindhoven's Brazilian Ronaldo have also
been targeted as part of a massive re-building programme by Inter.
* GERMAN coach Berti Vogts has asked his FA to consider a three-month
winter shut-down due to growing interest in the Inter Toto Cup.
Only Italy and Spain have totally shunned the competition which
provides the considerable incentive of qualification for the UEFA Cup.
Elsewhere on the Continent, it has attracted many of the leading clubs
and Vogts maintained: ''This means that players will have virtually no
respite during the summer and must have a longer winter break.
''This is especially important next season as I do not wish to compete
for the European Championship in England with a tired team.''
* BRAZILIAN referee Oscar Roberto de Godoi faces a life ban if
allegations that he was drunk in charge of a game between Corinthians
and Sao Paulo are substantiated.

GREGOR Townsend faces a summer of exasperation and examinations as a
result of the confirmation at the weekend that he is out of Scotland's
squad for the World Cup.
Townsend, 21, who injured the posterior cruciate ligament of the left
knee in an innocuous looking tackle against Hawick last weekend, now
will spend the summer months sitting his finals at Edinburgh University.
The injury is much more serious than had at first been thought and he
will know this week whether an operation is required. If the ligament
heals without surgery then he will be out of the game for four to five
months.
However, if he has to undergo surgery then he could be sidelined for a
year.
Yesterday he said: ''It's disappointing but that's life. I had my
heart set on going to South Africa but now I just have to get on with
it. I'll be sitting my final exams when I should have been at the World
Cup.''
The Scotland World Cup squad of 26 players will be chosen on Tuesday,
with a public announcement on Thursday.
At the weekend the pre-selection squad held public training sessions
at Perth.
Yesterday team-manager Duncan Paterson said that Townsend would be a
big miss: ''The way that he has come on this season has been superb and
the conditions in South Africa would have been tailor-made for him. It's
a great shame but we just have to get on with it.''
The manager provided an update on the other casualties.
Ian Jardine (fractured cheek) is expected to be fit for the World Cup
warm-up games in Spain in May, but not for the Murrayfield match against
Romania on April 22.
Paterson said that the Bristol prop, Alan Sharp, who has recurring
back problems, was ''extremely doubtful'' for South Africa but the news
on fellow exile David Hilton -- the Bath prop who damaged a rib
cartilage against England was more encouraging.
Andy Reed, the Bath lock who has been out of the game since Christmas
after an operation on a bulging disc, will attend the sports injuries
centre at Lilleshall this week and may be recovered in time for South
Africa.
Damian Cronin, who damaged his right elbow against France in Paris,
has recovered full movement in the joint and he is also to attend at
Lilleshall this week. It may be that the selectors will give the two
locks more time before naming the World Cup line-up.
Shade Munro, still recovering from a groin injury, did not attend the
weekend session and his continued absence makes the situation at lock
even more uncertain.
Andy Nicol, the former Dunde HS FP scrumhalf who is now with Bath,
played for the West Country club's second team on Saturday and,
according to reports, came through without mishap to the damaged knee
which had kept him out of the game since last May.
Peter Walton, the Northampton flanker who has also been recovering
from a knee injury, has played a couple of games and, according to
Paterson, did all that was asked of him in Perth at the weekend, as did
the Boroughmuir prop Peter Wright who suffered collar bone damage
against England.
Kenny Logan, the Stirling County wing, took no part in the weekend
sessions because of a septic cut to a leg but there are no doubts over
his fitness.

THE men's and women's winners, Dionicio Ceron and Malgorzata Sobanska,
collected bigger pay cheques yesterday, but neither looked as pleased in
victory as did Liz McColgan, who finished fifth in the NutraSweet London
Marathon.
The beaming smile as the Dundee woman leaned toward her daughter
immediately on crossing the line, spoke more eloquently than all the
post-race interviews: her legs were intact.
McColgan's time of 2hr 31min.14sec. earned her a total of $15,500 in
addition to her appearance fee. It was a modest performance and purse
compared to that of the Polish winner, Sobanska, who collected $65,000
for her 2-27-43.
McColgan has run 11 seconds faster. But that was more than three years
ago, on her debut in New York. After a nightmare saga of injuries, and
having been told she would never run again, this was not far short of a
triumph for Dundee's former world 10,000 metres champion, who finished
two places ahead of defending champion and three-time winner Katrin
Dorre.
''I have mixed emotions,'' said McColgan, who may yet sue over her
medical problems. ''I just was not competitive, but I must be realistic.
It would be foolish to think I could start where I left off.
''After two years out of major athletics, I lacked the competitive
edge. My legs just could not turn over fast enough. I felt strong and
relaxed, but there's no use feeling strong and relaxed, then finishing
fifth.
''Yet I have come from nothing to here on just 12 weeks' training. I
have sacrificed pace to get in the miles, and put strength back into my
legs. Look,'' and she bent at the knees and pranced around on the spot.
''Remember two years ago? I had dreadful cramp, and could not even
bend my knees to walk down a flight of steps to the prize-giving.''
McColgan, hair tied in Mini Mouse bunches as much to amuse her
daughter as to keep it from annoying her, revealed she had logged more
miles for this race than for any other, following the Chinese regime.
''For the first seven weeks of January, I ran farther than I've ever
done in my life,'' she confessed. ''I was still doing over 100 miles per
week until three weeks ago. But I've overdone the carbohydrate diet in
the past few days.
''But the cobbles were a real test of my injuries, and coming through
the way I have gives me a lot of confidence. I am definitely on the way
back. I felt I could have run 30 miles.
''This is just the first step for me on a long build-up to the
marathon at the Atlanta Olympics. I will be doing a hell of a lot of
racing on the track, to get my pace back, then I want to go for the
10,000 metres at the World Championships in Gothenburg.'' Results:

Dundee United 0, Rangers 2
RANGERS were not as predictable at Tannadice on Saturday as their
former reserve team coach, Billy Kirkwood, believed they might be.
Kirkwood insisted before the game that he knew the strengths -- and
the weaknesses -- of the Ibrox side.
However, Gordon Durie and Alan McLaren decided to show him just how
wrong he could be.
Almost before he had taken his seat on the bench for his managerial
debut, Durie struck the opening goal after just eight seconds.
Then, eight minutes later, it was McLaren's turn to surprise him -- by
taking on the fresh role as a free-kick expert with a shot from almost
30 yards for a magnificent second goal.
Afterwards, Rangers manager Walter Smith said: ''We have felt that
Alan should be taking more free kicks and have encouraged him to do so.
I think this goal proved to everyone that he should take more.
Obviously, it was important to get a result here and Alan's goal helped
set that up.''
For Kirkwood, these opening minutes must have been a chastening
experience -- yet, afterwards, there were signs that United were better
organised and that some of the players were ready to respond to his
return.
Andy McLaren, for example, who has been lost for most of the season
because of disciplinary problems, made his comeback. The man who ran
Rangers ragged in the Scottish Cup final last season continued to
threaten, though, this time he inflicted little damage.
But it was a welcome return, and one that bodes well in the Tannadice
side's fight against relegation.
Kirkwood admitted: ''I'm delighted to see Andy return in this way, and
I'm also happy at the contribution from Billy McKinlay. Both have had
their troubles at the club but they gave me the response I wanted.
''What we need is the players to continue to show that self-belief,
it's something we have to encourage.
''If they play as well as they did after having lost these goals then
we will get away from the bottom of the table.''
While Kirkwood talked of relegation Alan McLaren's after-match words
were in stark contrast.
The defender who was bought from Hearts earlier in the season is a man
in a hurry. He has searched for a domestic honour to add to his rapidly
growing collection of Scotland caps, but without success. Now, the
championship medal he craves is within reach.
''It's been a long wait for me but all I want is to get my hands on a
medal, and the quicker the better,'' he said.
It was an important result for Rangers. With Motherwell being held to
a 1-1 draw by Celtic at Hampden and Hibs drawing 2-2 with Partick
Thistle at Firhill, the Ibrox side increased their lead in the premier
division to 14 points. They now require just five points from their
remaining fixtures to secure their seventh league title in a row.
United, and Kirkwood, face a battle at the other end of the table. But
they can take consolation from Aberdeen's defeat, and the spirit of the
side which was evident after the early blows which would have destroyed
most teams.
However, their treatment of Brian Laudrup in a second-half spell was
disgraceful.
Maurice Malpas should have been ordered off for a cynical challenge on
the Dane. When referee Sandy Roy allowed that to pass with only a yellow
card, more cruel challenges followed.
Before anyone thinks I am asking for special treatment for this unique
talent they should recall a story told by the late Jack Mowat, the dean
of Scottish referees.
Celtic's Willie Fernie was being subjected to the same type of
challenges as Laudrup faced at Tannadice.
The game was at Firhill and when Mowat realised that the Thistle
players were lining up -- taking turns -- to stop Fernie at all costs,
he acted.
He called the Thistle captain aside and told him quietly: ''The next
foul on Fernie will bring a caution or an ordering off.''
It was not exactly playing by the laws, but Mowat always insisted that
an extra law existed -- common sense.
After all, what he was doing was defending the beautiful game, and
defending a player who graced the game.
Referees, all, should take note.

FALKIRK'S millionaire chairman George Fulston faces a challenge to his
chairmanship at the club's annual meeting tonight, writes Ken Gallacher.
There are moves from Brockville shareholders to try to unseat the
outspoken, rumbustious Fulston, who took over the club after selling his
controlling interest in Hamilton Accies.
Fulston paid more than #500,000 to take over Falkirk.
He has plans to move the club to a new stadium next season, and
extravagant plans to hand manager Jim Jefferies considerable cash to
strengthen the team at the start of the season.
Yet the chequered background of the Falkirk board is bringing problems
even to Fulston, who is guiding the side to safety in the premier
division.
Yesterday at the Coca-Cola Cup final in London, Fulston insisted: ''I
know I am to be opposed at the meeting -- but it is not going to worry
me.
''I will fight any moves against me and I will win.
''Falkirk are going places. If everything works out, then instead of
worrying over relegation next season, we will be looking at a place in
Europe.''

Eric Kennedy visits Scotland's first purpose-built dedicated building
for day surgery managed by South Ayrshire Trust
A NEW day-surgery suite at Ayr Trust Hospital is already proving its
worth, substantially in advance of its formal opening by the Queen on
July 5.
All the signs are that this #3.7m self-contained unit will meet its
target of 15,000 patients a year. Day surgery is growing in popularity
as increasingly sophisticated medical procedures and equipment make it
possible for many patients to be home on the day of their operation.
The suite has been functioning since November 28 last year, gradually
introducing new services such as orthopaedic procedures, plastic
surgery, and endoscopy (inserting a tiny telescope into the stomach to
check for ulcers, etc).
In January, urology became part of the scene and last month two
ophthalmologists began doing cataract operations there.
Many minor surgical procedures can be carried out in a modern day
surgery and the idea is a hit with the public, with most people glad to
avoid overnight hospital stays.
The medical authorities are, however, keen to dispel the notion that
day surgeries are cost-savers. On the contrary, the intensive nature of
the nursing care laid on means that the person to benefit most is the
patient.
''People who are refused day-surgery operations are usually very
disappointed,'' says Mrs Mary McGinn, the day surgery manager.
''Refusals can be on a variety of grounds. If a person has had past
problems with anaesthetics, or irregular heart beat, that is enough to
rule him out.
''Or perhaps a person has no-one to care for him at home. In that
event we would not accept him as a day patient. And if a patient is
overweight, or underweight, that would also rule out day surgery.''
The new suite has its own entrance and parking facilities and is
independent from the main building though linked by a corridor. This
means the facilities of the main hospital are available to it as
necessary.
The unit has its own personnel for electrocardiographs and blood
tests, and its nursing staff totals 25 at the moment. Eventually this
number will rise to 30.
There are also three secretaries, a receptionist, and records staff: a
mini-hospital, in effect.
The suite has three operating theatres, six interview rooms, six
changing rooms, and a small reception area. There is a first-stage
recovery area which can take up to five trolleys, then to a second-stage
recovery with space for 20, and finally to the appropriately named
departure lounge.
Patients are given sandwiches, or tea and toast, before they leave and
if they have had a general anaesthetic they have to wait a minimum of
two hours in the unit before being allowed to leave. They are constantly
monitored while in first-stage recovery, which is designated an acute
area with emergency facilities to hand. They undergo a full assessment
to ensure they are fit to leave before being allowed to go.
The suite was Scotland's first purpose-built, dedicated building for
day surgery and, says Mr J Douglas Brown, chairman of the South Ayrshire
Trust, is an excellent example of the benefits a Trust can bring to a
local community.
''Day surgery is precisely what patients want these days,'' he says.
''It means convenience, with more people being treated more quickly,
allowing them to get their operations and get home on the same day.
''Day surgery also means we can concentrate resources on in-patient
beds for patients who are seriously ill and need specialised care.''
Many minor surgical procedures can be carried out and the idea is a
hit with the public, with most people glad to avoid overnight stays.

GLASGOW School of Art is internationally recognised as a masterwork of
architectural design, but a fresh claim seeks to advance it further as a
neglected prototype of environmental technology a century ago.
The Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society will receive a paper tomorrow
arguing that the project which established their man's genius also saw
the installation of the world's first pure air-conditioning system.
The remarkable claim comes after four years of research and detective
work by Strathclyde University lecturer Dr George Cairns through which
he tracked down the first patent for a rudimentary air-conditioning
system. It was granted in 1892 to two Scots engineers, William Key from
Glasgow and Robert Tindall from Aberdeen, a full 12 years before
American patents said to have pioneered the field.
The connection with the Glasgow School of Art, Dr Cairns contends, is
through a chain of architectural projects in the 1890s and early 1900s.
William Key was directly involved in an air distribution system built
into the Victoria Infirmary, Glasgow, completed in 1890. His ideas
impressed many, including architect John Keppie who worked on the same
project.
Keppie's subsequent move into partnership with Dr John Honeyman is the
significant link, because it was the firm of Honeyman and Keppie which
won the open competition for the Glasgow School of Art commission in
1897. The design plans, and the schedule of accommodation, were drawn up
by the firm's 29-year-old rising star, Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Dr
Cairns maintains that it was through Keppie that Key's revolutionary
system was absorbed into the overall design for Glasgow School of Art.
This refutes the often promoted image of Mackintosh as sole author of
the Glasgow School of Art design, one which unmistakably carries the
signature of his unique visual style. Dr Cairns argues a case for
Mackintosh as receptive to the very latest technological advances, and
that this was a product of teamwork involving both Keppie and Honeyman,
rather than of Mackintosh operating as a visionary loner.
This case has already aroused a range of strong reactions, from
enthusiastic support to intense scepticism, when Dr Cairns published an
article in the current issue of the Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society
Newsletter.
A pre-emptive strike at Dr Cairns's theory (first argued in his 1992
doctoral thesis) may be detected in a recent study on Glasgow School of
Art by Dr James Macaulay, a senior lecturer at the school.
In Glasgow School Of Art: Charles Rennie Mackintosh, published in
1993, Dr Macaulay specifically challenges ''claims for the uniqueness of
the heating system'' installed in the school.
He quotes Mackintosh's 1896 specification notes, ''This system is
almost too well known to require advocacy and has been applied with
success to many well-known buildings in Glasgow.''
Another authority, art historian Roger Billcliffe, an honorary
vice-president of the CRM Society, disputes much enthusiasm on the part
of Mackintosh for cutting edge technology, pointing to a complete
absence of mod-cons in his subsequent architectural designs.
Only a Luddite would have ignored electric light and air heating
systems in the 1896 application for the competition, according to Mr
Billcliffe. He speculates that these features were requirements set out
in the brief for the 1896 competition, but there are only the vaguest
references to air extraction by shafts and a centrally-located heating
chamber among the 32 conditions of the competition.
The mystery remains, how did the Glasgow School of Art inherit such an
advanced air distribution system? Dr Cairns uncovered a complex of
horizontal and vertical ducts, supplying heated air to every room in the
building, in a double fan-powered system capable of completely changing
air up to ten times an hour.
Crucially, he detects in the presence of water sprays for the air
sucked in from below the basement, a rudimentary means of cooling and of
controlling humidity levels. This, by definition, would confirm an early
air-conditioning system.
The Cairns theory has attracted the enthusiastic support of a
distinguished Mackintosh authority, Emeritus Professor Thomas Howarth,
at the University of Toronto. He is impressed by the plausibility of the
practical-minded Keppie bringing over the ventilation system to the team
of architects, and having it adopted by the individualistic Mackintosh.
Professor Howarth added from Toronto; ''This doesn't detract one iota
from Mackintosh's stature. His role would have been to put the
contributions of others into a coherent plan and design, something he
did supremely well.''
Within this collaboration, was there a role for the mysterious William
Key, a virtually forgotten figure until Dr Cairns started his detective
investigation? The breakthrough was the discovery of British Patent No.
19,900.
It surprisingly yielded a description of environmental control that
sounds like air-conditioning in all but name. Applied for by Key and
Tindall in December, 1890, it deals with adjustments of air temperature
and humidity. The method was admittedly crude. It used water sprays
and/or ice blocks for cooling air, and steam coils for heating.
The patent pre-dates those granted in 1904 to Stuart Cramer, the
American engineer normally credited with the first developments in
air-conditioning. There is no evidence that Key was personally involved
in the Glasgow School of Art project, and Cairns argues only that Keppie
had absorbed his methods. It is possible that he may have acted as a
consultant, for his name surfaces again in another British Patent
granted to him (without Tindall) in 1901 for Improvements In The
Ventilating Of Buildings.
Other than that, Key remains a shadowy figure, sometimes described as
a gas engineer, with an address in Eidon Villas, Mount Florida, Glasgow.
Perhaps he is yet another of those unhappy figures of the turn of the
century who first patented an idea which would revolutionise
twentieth-century living, but never reaped the rewards.
Cairns believes the school, from the first planning stage, applied the
technology outlined in the previously unknown patent of Key and Tindall.
He concludes: ''It is on this basis that the School is acclaimed as
the first known building into which the technology for form of true
air-conditioning was incorporated at the initial design stage and fully
integrated into the construction.''

AYR'S new day-surgery suite can handle a variety of minor operations
and the first procedure carried out there is a typical example.
Arthritis sufferer Mrs Hannah Russell went in for a 15-minute operation
on her wrist, which necessitated only a local anaesthetic, and went home
later in the day.
Consultant orthopaedic surgeon Mr Peter Rae, who carried out the
procedure, said later that ''the use of day-surgery techniques will
increasingly reduce waiting lists in South Ayrshire and allow us to make
an already impressive service even better.''
Mrs Russell had had to wait only 11 weeks for her operation since
being referred to the unit by her doctor. ''Given that the waiting-time
guarantees we give are a total of 35 weeks here in South Ayrshire, she
and our other orthopaedic patients are getting the benefit of one of the
quickest NHS services in Scotland.''
Orthopaedic work is carried out with the aid of an arthroscope, a tiny
telescope which enables close-ups of ligaments, cartilages, tendons,
feet and hands.
These are exciting times for the South Ayrshire Trust in general, and
late last month a celebration was held at Ayr Hospital to mark the fact
that five different national awards had been won by its staff at the
Trust's three hospitals, Ayr, Ballochmyle and Biggart, in the previous
12 months.
That was in addition to the prestigious Charter Mark award presented
earlier in the year by the Prime Minister for excellence in public
service.
Says Trust chairman J Douglas Brown, himself a retired orthopaedic
surgeon: ''These independent endorsements have helped prove that NHS
care in South Ayrshire is first-class.
''The remarkable achievements of our staff have brought great credit
to the Trust and sent its reputation soaring throughout Scotland. But
the real winners are our patients, whose care under the NHS is clearly
second to none.''

IT may be a little early to confidently say that the last of the
blizzards has gone but daffodils, spring and Easter stir the body's
senses. Warmer days with lighter evenings are on the horizon and
holidays come into focus. Holidays in the great outdoors have captured
many an imagination but the thought of joining the thousands whose
weekends and holidays are given to building tents or finding a suitable
caravan site has often brought mixed feelings.
Camping or caravanning to many people conjures the thought of hardship
or of living rough in a cramped tent or caravan where life's little
luxuries have no part and where hot water is something for the
''softies''. What those people do not realise is that the modern caravan
is fitted with central heating run from gas or electricity. A fitted
shower, cooker, lighting and comfortable beds are also part of the
package.
For the would-be camper a possible tent might be a full-sized framed
version with separate inner apartments that make up bedrooms and a
framed ''push-out'' kitchen. Canopies can be made from front and side
panels to provide extra covered space. The sites, too, will be clean and
modern with facilities such as restaurant and recreational activities
for all ages.
Because caravans are so well-equipped and can be hooked-up to water
and electricity on site, their use can no longer be considered seasonal.
This bonus provides for low-cost holidays and weekend breaks, anywhere
and at any time, and after the initial purchase costs are distant your
holidays are almost free.
Most people have their favourite park but with almost 5000 sites
scattered around Britain the choice of location is vast. You can choose
from a seaside resort to a country park or perhaps your favourite might
be near to a busy or historic town.
Prices for a new caravan start at around #4000. For this you will get
a fairly basic caravan with little equipment installed. Extras can be
fitted by your local dealer or yourself and bought as cash flow permits.
There is the secondhand market of course and here a fully fitted caravan
that has not seen its tenth year may be bought for around #3500.
By going to a reputable dealer your questions will be fairly answered
and you will know exactly what your money will buy. The important aspect
of towing and towing weights and what your car is capable of pulling
will also be explained. Remember also that it is not just the cost of
buying the caravan that is an outlay but insurance, accessories and
security devices must be taken into consideration.
The caravan awning is an excellent way of moving ''outside'' and yet
remain in the immediate vicinity of your kitchen and toilet. The extra
space created can be used in a variety of ways and awnings come in
different styles to suit your needs. Choose a lightweight aluminium
frame that is easy to erect, however, fabric choice is often a matter
for individual's taste -- some swear by vat-dyed cotton, others prefer
acrylic coated polyester fabrics because they ''breathe''.
Camping at the most basic level introduces the lightweight camper,
where the tent will be no larger than the average backpack. As this will
be your home, and the weather has to be considered, it is wise to buy
quality. Visit camping exhibitions to see what is on the market. They
will often have tents erected and you will be able to assess their
merits and try them out for size. Or why not hire for a weekend?
Accessories for the lightweight camper again put demands on quality
and the sleeping bag will require a good combination of warmth and
compactness. A closed cell sleeping mat will provide you with a firm
insulating sandwich between your body and the ground.
Expect to pay around #170 for a traditional ridge tent and around #80
for a good quality sleeping bag. A stove will cost about #20 and a good
pair of boots, #80.
If your demands are greater and you have to consider a family sized
tent your choice may be restricted by the size of your car. Camping
gear, especially the tent, can be bulky and unless your car has a large
boot a small trailer may be a necessary investment.
The package that might be considered to get you under the stars will
cost around #1500. A reasonable tent will cost around #350 but to this
you must add a ground sheet, double airbed and two single airbeds and
four sleeping bags. This takes the total up to #600. Incidentals we must
not forget and a foldaway kitchen with two burners and a grill, cool
box, first aid kit, fire extinguisher, saucepans, cutlery, cups, saucers
and plates will add another #300 to the bill.
To complete our package a table and chairs, stools and basic chemical
toilet are needed. If you have a big boot in your car then deduct around
#300 from the bill as this is what a typical trailer, cover and spare
wheel will cost you.
Caravan and camping shows are a great source for discounts on goods
and for gathering information and intelligence about various products.
Whichever way you decide to go, be it lightweight or family camping or
a brand-new or secondhand caravan you will be made welcome among the
thousands of caravan and camping enthusiasts in Britain.

In a country that offers so much to the tourist, Jim Kelly finds a few
days in the city more than enough
THAILAND hasn't had the best press of late, but it is still the top
family holiday destination in Asia. The drugs and sex industries so
beloved of the media are a very small part of what this tropical
playground offers the tourist, and the average family on holiday is
unlikely to come in contact with either.
So forget the lurid headlines and the TV documentaries and enjoy the
year-round sunshine and the exotic customs and friendliness of what are
in fact a demure and well-behaved people, devout Buddhists all.
Package holidays to Thailand invariably give you a few days in Bangkok
and the rest of the time in a beach resort, usually the nearby Pattaya
but occasionally Phuket or Koh Samui, island resorts off the west and
east coasts of the southern peninsula, or even the quieter Hua Hin,
oldest resort in the land and a popular venue for golfing weekends. Some
may even include a side trip to Chiang Mai, the northern capital noted
for its cooler climate, beautiful women, and hilltribe handicrafts.
Look for the packages that offer fewer nights in Bangkok and more time
in the provinces. A little of Thailand's capital goes a long way these
days, and once you've done the temples and the floating market there's
not much else that should detain you. Good shopping, restaurants, and
nightlife are found at all the main resorts, and you have the bonus of
fresh air. Bangkok, by comparison, is in the process of expiring from
vehicular thrombosis; slowly strangling itself with traffic and the
resultant toxic fumes.
The more adventurous traveller would be well advised to ignore the
package deals and book flight-only. A number of airlines compete on the
Europe-Bangkok run and it's well worth shopping around. Prices vary
according to season, but most of the carriers will fly you free of
charge to Heathrow, Gatwick, Schiphol or wherever their flight
originates.
This allows you to find accommodation to your liking (easier than
you'd think) and gives you the freedom to roam. Car hire is cheap and
Thai roads are excellent. And like most of Asia Thailand drives on the
left. You just have to remember the first rule of the road, and that is
that there are no rules of the road. You may find yourself being
overtaken on both sides, sometimes at the same time.
My most recent flight was with the relatively new Taiwanese carrier
EVA, which wins hands down in two of the most important aspects of
long-haul flights -- legroom and food. And I was travelling in the fifth
of EVA's five classes.
The shock to the system begins as you leave Bangkok Airport for the
30-minute chariot race downtown -- or the three-hour crawl, depending on
what time of day you land. On a recent visit the multi-lane airport
highway appeared to have acquired a half-dozen extra lanes in the three
years since my last visit, and Parkinson's law of traffic (is there
one?) had applied. They were all choked.
Downtown the situation is completely out of control. Someone somewhere
has evidently decided that the answer to traffic congestion is to build
more roads, and whole city blocks are being bulldozed to accommodate new
expressways. One is reminded of the village in Vietnam that had to be
destroyed in order to save it. Meanwhile many of the old roads are
having roads on stilts built over them. It's quite a novelty to ride
across the rooftops -- until you think of the poor sods who have to
spend their lives underneath breathing the gunk.
There are now two million cars in Bangkok, most of them new, and they
are poisoning the air. It's been years since blue sky was visible from
the capital, and a recent check found carbon monoxide levels at five
times the recommended limit.
But don't let that put you off a Thai holiday. The rest of the country
is a delight, and Bangkok still has some of the world's most picturesque
temples and excellent hotels. The Thais are no slouches either when it
comes to nightlife. But beware of the clip joints that can charge you
#25 (or worse) for a beer. Always try to get a recommendation before
entering a bar or a club.
The big bargain buys are in leather goods and clothing, and not just
silk. Don't bother taking a change of clothes. Take empty suitcases
instead. You're going to need them to bring back all the stuff you buy.
A really serious bargain hound could save enough to pay for the holiday.
But I am hereupon claiming the world record wait at a red light. On
Friday, January 13, 1995, at 5.15pm at the Victory monument roundabout
in Bangkok's Phya Thai district, thousands of cars and motorcycles (we
were second in line) were stopped at a red traffic light for exactly 30
minutes. This beat the previous world record of 25 minutes, which had
just been set at the previous set of lights.

Christopher Portway visits an old favourite
IT'S a strange thing but so many people have never been to Nottingham.
Could it be that the place holds some magnetic draw that brings the
first-time visitor back? I wouldn't be surprised for Nottingham holds
irresistible -- as well as subliminal -- appeal.
When negatively stated that lace-making and Robin Hood used to be
Nottingham's main claims to fame, or that very little lace is made there
today and nothing of Robin Hood's Nottingham remains, then one's
perception of this East Midlands city undergoes a nose-dive. A place of
has-beens and past glories is the immediate verdict. But look again.
Only a quirk of history prevented Nottingham from becoming Britain's
capital in which the Palace of Westminster could have been on the banks
of the River Trent and the Royal Palace that of the present Nottingham
Castle. For long Nottingham was a royal city, and remains the only one
outside London where Parliament may be held.
From a visitor's point of view the attractions are many. Though anyone
looking for a medieval stone fortress atop the sandstone bluff will be
disappointed with the dour palace that takes its place there. Over the
years it has been riddled with caves and underground passages -- used
for strategic defensive purposes and as hiding places -- which can be
most gainfully explored together with the incorporated Brewhouse Yard
Museum and nearby lace centre and costume museum.
In an age that has seen a decline in railway construction it is
heartening to see a reversal of the trend with a new line -- inevitably
the Robin Hood Line -- reaching out to Newstead and in process of
extending beyond. And at Newstead is a ''must'', the evocative Newstead
Abbey, family home of the Byrons, where a collection of Lord Byron's
poetry manuscripts and letters is to be found within a stately home
surrounded by a lakeside park.
In the village of Eastwood, 10 miles distant, stands the more humble
abode of Nottinghamshire's other world-famous writer, D H Lawrence, at
8A Victoria Street, now, naturally, a museum, too, but one so lovingly
and painstakingly restored that it is a cut above many a similarly sized
establishment.
Out of Nottinghamshire and into neighbouring Derbyshire -- but only
just -- where along the border is to be found a host of further
attractions. Mention of railways prompts reportage of two sites of
emphatic interest to anyone with the slightest yen for the smell of
steam and the beat of flanged wheels on metal.
The steam arises from the Midland Railway Centre, a family theme park
of its own, with an assortment of operating trains on five miles of
track; the beat arises from the celebrated Crich Tramway Museum where I
was able to fulfil an ambition of driving an early twentieth-century
tram.
Large enough to command the best in entertainment, facilities,
accommodation and communications, small enough to be personal and
friendly, Nottingham just didn't happen to become capital of England.
But then it would hardly be Nottingham if it had.

A CYNIC might say we are witnessing the most detailed and
comprehensive record of the death of an industry in the red meat sector.
Colin Maclean, director-general of the Meat and Livestock Commission,
totally disagrees.
In evidence he points to the success of the Commission's latest #10m
''Recipe for Love'' advertising campaign, the revival in beef sales last
year through increased eating out and the fact that 97% of the
population still eat meat sometime during the week.
Even amid the current storm over live animal exports, he retains a
buoyant optimism. ''For both calves and lamb, there is an assumption
there will be a ban on exports. At the moment that is an incorrect
assumption.
''There are two ways in which it can be banned. It can be made illegal
or because one industry or another -- either our own or some
intermediary such as transport companies -- can ban it. Subject to the
legal cases the best guess is it is not going to be banned and therefore
the trade, or some part of it, is still going to run.''
Based on continuing relatively high levels of exports, he remains
confident the business will continue. At the same time he points out
that the industry is taking effective counter measures such as today's
MLC Conference on options for the calf market in London.
''I believe we are goimg to provide reasonable, rational approaches to
the problem. There is a very small market for veal in Britain and it
would be a brave man who would say we could expand that much. But we
must try to fill as much of the home market as we can. The key to that
is to ensure that caterers buy as much of our welfare-friendly veal as
possible.''
Catering is very much to the forefront of Mr Maclean's thinking on a
number of fronts. It has helped the slide in beef sales level off and
with the projection that by the end of the decade 50p out of every #1
spent on food will fall into the general out-of-home area he is
confident this will help the red meat sector. He admits to a constant
battle with his own waistline and often skips lunch.
Manchester-born, he admits to some Scottish ancestry but he is not
sure exactly where. He studied for his veterinary surgeon's degree at
Liverpool University but for the past 20 years has lived in Berkshire
where, until a few years ago, he kept a pig unit which he built up to
100 sows.
As well as science subjects, his early talents ranged from music --
including bassoon playing -- to rugby which he carried on playing until
he was 33. He has given up the bassoon but still plays piano to let off
the excess steam which may not be dissipated by the odd game of squash.
Like many executives he gives the impression of constant supplies of
energy. He took over as MLC director-general in September 1992 after a
period as technical director during which he oversaw the transition of
the commission from a large policing function on livestock grading to
one more concerned with advisory and development work.
Quality became one of the watchwords during this period, either in
relation to quality assurance schemes or eating quality improvement with
the various blueprint schemes. The commission became a much more
hard-nosed business concerned with revenue-raising activities and this
helped cushion a painful redundancy programme.
The change suits the abrasive commercial style of Mr Maclean whose
ability to make things work was spotted by former MLC chairman Geoffrey
John who recruited him following an upward career curve through the
Unilever organisation, BOCM Silcock and latterly with Glaxo animal
health.
He has shaken the MLC into a thriving business force but occasionally
expresses some exasperation that the industry, notably at farm level,
has not followed the lead. This applies particularly to a lack of
progress in farm assurance schemes.
Supermarkets, which handle about a half of all red meat sales, as well
as independents have to be confident their brand is safeguarded, he
points out.
''That demands some kind of mechanism behind it to assure them that
the product of the animals they are getting is whiter than white. That
is where farm assurance works and we have to find ways to make sure it
works better than it has in the past.
''There is no doubt there is a will among some supermarket chiefs to
make a serious contribution to the welfare issue and they believe that
traceability is an important component.''
He pays tribute to the Guild of Scottish Quality Meat Suppliers in
seeking to promote this through support of Farm Assured Scotch
Livestock. The Scottish Pig Industry Initiative also provides an
effective role-model.
Farm assurance should be the norm, he says, although he admits it will
not be easy to achieve this. But this is only one of a number of fronts
on which the meat business is engaged and on which Mr Maclean intends to
keep fighting.

IF success is judged by how many times you get the better of your
friends, then the job has gone a good deal better this week. It's all
because of the price of straw which has gone bananas.
No-one quite knows why there is such a shortage. Is it because so much
land is now being set aside, or because the drought last summer meant
the straw was shorter?
Is it because the welfare people are bullying pig farmers into
fattening their piggies on straw? Or is it all those people who are
growing carrots? They need 11 acres of straw to cover each acre of
carrots and one farmer in Morayshire has 120 acres to cover.
Some of the problem is caused by people like Mossie and me who have
done the sums and seen that silage is a thing of the past where grain is
an alternative. How can you possibly grow an acre of grass to feed
cattle if you can grow barley on it, sell that for up to #400, get
another #100-plus from the Government and feed the straw which costs you
nothing, to your cattle? All right the straw may not be as good as the
silage but it isn't #500 an acre worse.
Well, we have a couple of hundred bales spare and selling them has
been a delight. I entered 50 bales in the electronic auction at
Thainstone with every hope that I'd beat Mossie's record-breaking
average of #9 at harvest. I had even dreams of beating his top bid of
#11.50. Mind you, as I was going electric, my bid would have to win
without the help of passing seagulls.
The first indication that a good sale was imminent was when no fewer
than three potential purchasers came to view the straw. Then, on the
morning of the sale, down the field stalked a tall, shambling figure
with a head of hair which is not quite so shocking now that there are so
many silver threads among the red. It was the Red Rooster, looking a bit
sheepish, I thought.
The Rooster has hill cows and finishes the calves on barley and
silage. He just needed a ''wee suppy straw'' for bedding. How I enjoyed
telling that grain baron that, much as I'd like to help, this crofter
was going for a world record and had committed his straw to the auction.
And I got a good score off another neighbour. You will remember my
pride at harvest time with the Dutch barn full, the old cornyard full
and a line of 400 bales down the strip of setaside which I am using as
an auxiliary cornyard. Well, I was daft enough to tell Young Bellmie of
my pride and asked him to agree that all that straw made an impressive
show.
''I see naething impressive aboot it. It's just a lot o' strae.'' I
was hurt, of course, but tried not to show it.
I can tell you that Young Bellmie is more impressed now. He is so
impressed, in fact, that he was still trying to buy that straw when the
bidding was over #13.
And, of course, I also got one over Mossie. My price of #14.60 a bale
for four-footers was far above his record. I was ashamed to take it
really though I need not have been. The phone has never stopped since,
with others needing straw at the same price. I keep making another trip
to the cornyard to see if I can spare a few more. Usually I can.
And to think that they've had to pass laws in England to stop them
burning straw. Indeed they will have to rewrite the fairy story about
Rumplestiltskin who knitted straw into gold. At today's prices it would
hardly be worth it.
It's not often Mossie gets it wrong but he's fairly wrong this time.
He has plenty surplus straw but it has all been treated with ammonia to
increase digestibility and palatability. That cost #6 a bale and it
isn't worth as much as the untreated stuff.
''It's nae for me to say,'' he says sulkily, ''but my strae is a far
better buy.''
Maybe so, Mossie, but nobody's buying yours. These people want
bedding. They don't want to choke their cattle with ammonia.
So it has been a good week. On top of that we have 20 calves now, half
bulls, and I still haven't seen a single calving.
Our yearlings are much the best we've had, in the sense that there is
hardly a tail-ender. The Jersey blood is all but gone. I will sell the
heifers as soon as the grass is here and the straw is over. The grazers
will go daft then.
I had intended to finish the bulls but now I'm tempted to let them go.
Mossie thinks I should. ''Why be the workin' feel?'' he says.
Mind you. We have had a warning.
The prices of houses in the village being so high we have more or less
decided to build a death house for ourselves on the farm. We've even got
a site looked out and if we can get planning permission, we'll move
there when Potions and the elder Investment take over in four years.
The Breadwinner went on Sunday to show the site to the Investment and
her little Investments.
Now when we were in Africa, Potions cut down a huge plain tree in the
garden and some scraggy firs and we have been enjoying a great supply of
logs since we came home. That had clearly impressed the Investment's
elder daughter. She said to her grandmother: ''When you're living here,
where will you get your logs then?''
The Breadwinner said: ''Oh, there'll never be any shortage of logs
here. There are woods all over the farm.''
''O-no,'' said the little girl, ''they'll be our woods then.''
We have been warned.

A SURVEY prepared for the Forestry Commission to investigate the
extent to which woodland owners in receipt of Government planting grants
have been observing the conditions and guidelines imposed by the
Forestry Authority has given a clean bill of health to the private
sector.
The Canopy report examined 303 sites, covering 3888 hectares in
Britain, which had been planted between 1981 and 1993. Surveyors were
specially trained and a detailed investigation was made of each site
into observance of the plan of operations and four sets of guidelines --
for forest landscape design, forest nature conservation, forest
recreation and forest and waters.
The plans of operations agreed by the landowner and the Forestry
Commission were followed in over 93% of the schemes.
In general terms, taking all the guidelines together, the findings
were that in 87% of the planting sites inspected the guidelines were
being followed acceptably or better.
The landscape guidelines were the most closely followed, reaching
acceptable standards for 93% of the schemes, and of these 22% were
regarded as excellent.
Conservation guidelines were almost as well followed with 90% of the
sites acceptable, and of these almost 20% were judged excellent.
Recreation was found to be the least well followed, ''doubtless
because private woodland owners have tended to guard their privacy
jealously,'' said the report. However, 74% were found to be acceptable
and 6% excellent.
For the water guidelines about 50% of the sites visited had neither
watercourses nor drains, and they were excluded from this part of the
survey. Of the remainder, 10% were regarded as having followed the
guidelines excellently, 73% were acceptable and 17% were considered
unacceptable.
During the 12 years of planting examined, five different grant schemes
were involved. The oldest, dedication, had started its life in the
1950s. The results of the survey clearly indicated that the newer the
grant scheme the higher the success rate, which is perhaps not
surprising as some of the guidelines had not been thought of at the time
the earlier plantings were carried out.
Mr Peter Wilson, chief executive of the Timber Growers' Associaton,
said that the report clearly showed that there was a high rate of
compliance generally. As new guidelines had been introduced, so
standards had improved further. The report painted a picture of success,
he said, and allowed the Forestry Commission to home in on areas where
there was scope for still further improvements.
The commission said: ''We are very encouraged by the findings of the
report. We expect increasingly high standards and the survey has shown
that owners are meeting them. Regarding recreation it has to be pointed
out that these guidelines are voluntary. Despite that, by and large, the
private sector is observing these guidelines.''

SPECULATION is growing that Allied Domecq may soon sell its Tetley Tea
business to a management buy-in led by Leon Allen who chairs Scottish
sausage skin giant Devro.
If completed, it will mean that the drinks and fast-food retailing
group will have severed its last connection with the Lyons food business
which it acquired two decades ago.
This is a policy vigorously pursued by chairman Michael Jackaman whose
first love is the spirits business, where Allied is now the world's
second-largest operator after Grand Metropolitan's IDV, and chief
executive Tony Hales.
It is thought that around #400m could be involved in the deal which is
being backed by Prudential Ventures. Mr Leon is highly regarded in the
food industry because of both his experience with Procter &amp; Gamble and
also more recently with the former Del Monte Foods subsidiary of RJR
Nabisco which was sold to management. That was planned to have a London
Stock Exchange listing but instead was acquired by the Royal Foods Group
of South Africa, an affiliate of Harry Oppenheimer's Anglo-American
Corporation.
Tetley is a world-class tea brand with its position underpinned by it
being the first to introduce a circular tea bag as a marketing tool.

IN the boardrooms of several hundred companies, decisions are being
made as to whether they should seek to join the new Alternative
Investment Market (AIM) which the Stock Exchange has decreed should take
place on the Rule ''4.2'' market.
The Rule 4.2 Market was the Stock Exchange's tiniest market and grew
up around a rule which was never intended to create a market at all.
Under its umbrella, deals could be done in the securities of unquoted
companies whose presence was sanctioned by the Stock Exchange with
minimum investment and regulation. A few well-known companies such as
Weetabix, National Parking Corporation and National Grid Holdings
appeared there.
It clearly filled a need. Companies which felt they could not afford
or did not wish to seek a full quotation could have their shares traded
there. It even had a specialist in the shape of J P Jenkins, a member
firm of the Stock Exchange started by John Jenkins, a former jobber,
although several other member firms were also interested in the business
of buyers and sellers of shares in unquoted companies together as an
addition to their more conventional business.
If you wanted to become a shareholder in your local football club,
something which, with a few notable exceptions, is an investment
inspired by enthusiasm rather than avarice this was a good place to look
for a deal. Transactions are, in fact, still going on with recent deals
recorded in debentures of Rangers Football Club as well as unquoted
shares in small breweries, stores and media companies.
Despite its low profile, 42 companies with activities ranging from
garden centres to mineral prospecting raised more than #112m through it
last year.
Something of the order of 250 companies were traded fairly regularly
and perhaps 100 of these appeared sufficiently frequently for them to be
regarded as having some degree of liquidity particularly, as Mr Jenkins
has been acting as a market-maker in some. They have been paying #2000 a
year to have data distributed on the screens of various ''member
companies'' to give them a pretty high exposure.
A quote on AIM will cost more. The Stock Exchange itself is starting
it off with a ''bargain offer'' of a #2500 fee but the total expense
will be a good deal more. This is because, taking an entirely new line,
the exchange is passing the bulk of the regulation work on to a
''nominated adviser'' or a ''nominated broker'' who may well be one of
the same.
The responsibility for getting the figures and other information right
is put squarely on the directors but the nominated adviser introducing
the company has to confirm to the Exchange that it understands and has
met the requirements of the AIM market. He also has to continue to keep
an eye on it.
Some observers feel the Third Market, the Exchange's earlier attempt
to create a market for very small firms, failed because companies were
often left without any effective on-going relationship with their
sponsor once they had been floated.
In the AIM market, which it is hoped will help small companies raise
finance to expand, a company must retain an approved adviser ''at all
times''. He will be paid by the company but responsible to the Stock
Exchange.
This was a clever move by the Exchange which neatly manages to keep
its costs down while at the same time having someone with plenty of
financial expertise very close to the company and seeing that it toes
the market line.
It does not have to try to regulate the company itself at long
distance but will confine itself to keeping a close watch on the
nominated advisers who win a place on its approved list. That place will
be worth keeping for the rewards are bringing more companies to the
market and earning more advisory fees.
It has been made clear that if the Exchange feels an adviser has
brought too many problems to the market he will be dropped from the
approved list. The advisers are put in a position of power by the
Exchange's requirement that companies which lose their adviser for
whatever reason must find another within three months or quit the
market.
The Exchange has been trying to find a formula for small companies to
be traded, raise new capital and so on under its wing since it set up
the Unlisted Securities Market in 1980.
The new AIM concept has won over a lot of cynics. A surprise to some
observers was the warning that companies currently traded under Rule 4.2
will have to join will be traded off market. Member firms will still be
able to match bargains in their shares but the companies will not have
the advantage of having information on them displayed on Stock Exchange
screens.
This is forcing the directors of companies using it to make decisions
in time for a mid-June deadline for the start of AIM and the effective
demise of Rule 4.2.
There is now, however, a fairly strongly possibility that the deadline
for joining AIM may be extended probably to September. The new market
will still definitely open on June 19. But after behind-the-scenes moans
that the timetable was too tight it now looks as though companies which
have decided they want to make the transition will be given a few more
months to make the arrangements.

SCOTTISH Financial Enterprise has had its hopes of a Glasgow-based
secretariat handling AIM's compliance and marketing functions dashed by
the Stock Exchange.
It has been confirmed that the new market, due to begin trading in
June, will be regulated and promoted from London.
But last night Craig Campbell, chief economist with the Scottish
Council Development and Industry and a member of the Scottish Advisory
Committee to the Stock Exchange, was not surprised at the decision.
He said: ''The people pushing this Scottish headquarters' idea were
always pushing against a blancmange -- there was nothing there! All
actual trading takes place across the wires.''
Mr Campbell suggested there was more scope for establishing groupings
of lawyers, accountants and stockbrokers operating as ''go-betweens''
for the market and companies.
Mr Hamish Morrison, chief executive of the Scottish Council Building
and Industry, added: ''AIM is another way of getting relatively
inexpensive finance for small companies. Full Stock Exchange listing can
be terribly expensive.
''The Alternative Investment Market will come to life. Whether
administered or regulated in Scotland there would probably never have
been more than a dozen jobs.''

An Institute of Management report by Patrick Mileham of the University
of Paisley discovers much that is positive about the post-Cadbury role
of the non-executive director in British industry.
THE beleaguered Jonathan Aitken, like a number of other prominent
persons in recent months, is suffering a bout of the non-executive
directors' syndrome.
Let me explain. Instead of sugar and spice and all things nice, it
seems that his non-executive directorship of BMARC between 1988 and 1990
turned out to be all slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails.
Should he have known about the suspect contract, without an
''end-user's certificate'' required for arms-related sales? We once
traded Chieftain tanks with Iran, but later became squeamish about
pom-pom guns for motor boats. Left, right and centre of British politics
have always supported the British arms industry. But morality is
morality, foreign relations are foreign relations and the law is the
law.
Although I could write about the 1980s' arms trade from my previous
professional military-academic background, my particular interest is the
current and future role of non-executive directors in UK companies and
organisations of all shapes and sizes.
Our research report, covering over two years of detailed research,
survey and interviews, is published today by the Institute of Management
under the title Coming on Board: The Non-Executive Directors' Role in
Strengthening Boardroom Leadership.
Setting out from two universities, Paisley and Surrey, I have
discovered much that is positive about the post-Cadbury role of the
non-executive director in British industry, on both sides of the Border.
If Mr Aitken had possessed a copy of the Cadbury Committee's report and
my (the Mileham) report, he might now be saved the embarrassment he
faces.
The Cadbury report was chiefly about the financial aspects of
corporate governance, which is to do with how to look after other
people's money. But wait, aren't the skills of corporate governance
transferable? The answer is emphatically ''yes''.
Commerce is a real battlefield, with real casualties, and risks of
physical and moral collapse. A good full-time captain of industry is a
doughty entrepreneurial fighter for his shareholders and workforce. But
as Lloyd George might have said ''adding value is too serious a business
to leave to the executives''.
The findings of our research indicate that the role of non-executive
directors is being taken extremely seriously now. Public pressure for
ethical behaviour and fair treatment of stakeholders has added to the
increasing commercial pressures of the market place.
Incompetently run companies are a threatened species. NEDs are
increasingly employed for positive reasons, ie both their business
intelligence networks and equally importantly their cerebral
intelligence -- in asking the right questions and scrutinising in depth
the executives' work.
The NED's own position in law, of which he (or sometime she) is
constantly reminded, is exactly the same as that of a full-time
director. There is absolutely no excuse for ignorance about whether the
company is run on best practice principles, financially, commercially,
legally or ethically.
Directors' future careers rely on reputation in the competitive world
of business and a duped non-executive can be blackballed even where
patronage rather than pure meritocracy persists. Incompetent family
members, chairmen's yes-men and ancient title-holders are being crowded
out in modern-day boardrooms.
NEDs increasingly look at the quality of the company they are joining,
and whether they can trust other board members. A public figure should
be particularly careful about the company he or she keeps.
Yet even so some 45% of our respondents were still uncomfortable that
there were some topics omitted from board meetings that should be
included. A NED is only as good as his information, we were constantly
told. Where does a NED get at least a semi-independent view of most
things going on in a company? How about the accountants -- we learn that
Stoy Hayward in the BMARC case did warn about the regulatory risks of
taking over existing contracts from Oerlikon.
The Official Secrets Acts do cover some overseas defence contracts up
to a point, but not when confidentiality is being used as a smoke screen
to hide illegalities. Similarly the nod and wink discussion conducted at
two levels, in or out of the boardroom, should not disguise the
malodorous chemistry of collective irresponsibility, or worse
conspiracy.
''Good chemistry'', we were also constantly told, is vital in the
boardroom with absolute trust and reliability maintained between
directors, and in which the BMARC board signally failed.
Good chemistry between directors is now recognised as including
constructive tension in the boardroom, where the non-executive's duty is
seen as being of a challenging nature. If not, how can the best
commercial, financial and ethical decisions be made. The Cadbury
criteria that NEDs should be ''independent of management and other
relationships to the point of resignation'' is also fully subscribed.
Post-Cadbury, few NEDs will stake their local or national reputation
for #10k (less tax at 40%), particularly if they have public service or
ministerial aspirations. Reputation building, as ministers or
ex-ministers will tell you is a long-term matter, and even businessmen's
reputation can be destroyed in a twinkling.
So don't knock all NEDs for the few spectacular individual failures.
Many are honest and fully competent for their jobs, and increasingly
work very hard in the majority of companies and organisations, at a far
lower rate of reward per diem than consultants.
Furthermore and astonishingly, we have discovered that since the
Cadbury report and in view of the public scrutiny of the competence and
honesty of boardrooms, executives and non-executives alike recognise the
value of training. Whereas at the time the hapless ministerial NED
joined BMARC in 1988, 65% of all directors had never attended a
director-level course. They now acknowledge that all first-time
directors (83%) and new non-executives (70%) should attend appropriate
courses.
Thirty per cent favour whole-board training and development. This is a
major change. Amateur directors, whether executive or non-executive have
no future, and their successors already streaming through the gates of
our universities are exerting societal pressure by example.
Competent NEDs are recognised by boards as bringing significant added
value to their strategic planning. Many more companies in the small and
medium category could do well to invest in one or two well-motivated
outsider-insiders, instead of paying through the nose for in-and-outers
of dubious value.
Above all we have detected a growing confidence among NEDs for their
own work and the recognition of other board members for the value that a
good NED can bring to the boardroom. In 1988 a lot of NEDs did not know
what they were doing, or what their company was about. They are very
keen to be seen as full professionals. Now they must convince the public
in helping to put right the British economy.

BUSINESS life is Scotland appears to have become tougher in the last
three months with the number of failures escalating rapidly and in sharp
contrast with the rest of the UK.
There were altogether 907 failures, an increase of 27.7% on a year
earlier with a 35% leap in liquidations to 139, while bankruptcies
increased by 26.5% to 768.
Business information suppliers Dun &amp; Bradstreet point out that
Scotland accounted for 9.1% of the total but add that the changes in
bankruptcy laws had been responsible for part of the reduction last
year.
Wales was the best performing area with a 30.4% fall in total number
of failures. Dun &amp; Bradstreet analyst Philip Mellor says that 1995 looks
set to see the largest drop in the rate of business failures among small
businesses for at least 15 years.
However, this still means that just under 450 are going to the wall
each week.

STAND BY, Scottish Opera patrons. Coming your way in six weeks, the
weirdest opera you have ever seen. Beta-blockers and blindfolds may be
required by the most delicate of opera lovers for certain parts --
especially the second act -- of Alfred Schnittke's bizarre black comedy,
Life with an Idiot, an artistic collaboration between English National
Opera and Scottish Opera which received its British premiere in London
on Saturday night.
Actually the hype and sensation that have characterised the run-up to
this new production of Schnittke's surrealistic, allegorical tale of the
monster within communist Russia and the monster within ourselves, don't
really represent the full story. Indeed the opening 45-minute act is, if
anything, a little static, dominated by narrative. A husband and wife
are compelled to take into their home a lunatic from the asylum. They
pick Vova, who seems a harmless, thoughtful character. He is
monosyllabic. At first he's subdued. When unleashed, he destroys them.
Vova, cast here as a cross between Lenin and a clown, is played with
an almost charming childlike innocence by Alasdair Elliott, before, in
act two, he trashes the house and reveals (and there's no delicate way
of putting this) an enormous erect penis with which he runs
spectacularly rampant. A physical, almost acrobatic tour de force from
Elliott here.
The sex scenes are graphic, but so portrayed in -- ahem -- rhythmic
liaison with Schnittke's music by director Jonathan Moore that they
provoked riotous hilarity among the first-night crowd. (It becomes a
macabre human circus: this show literally swings from the chandelier.)
Despite the hysteria, despite the farce, the cruelty and the
brutality, at root Life with an Idiot is an immensely lyrical piece,
conducted with authority by Richard Armstrong. The vocal demands on the
husband and wife (stratospheric performances by David Barrell and Louisa
Kennedy-Richardson, though the words aren't clear enough) are virtuosic.
Choral writing, ranging in style from Bach to Stravinsky, is stunningly
dramatic.
Some major problems on opening night with David Blight's set.
Featuring swivelling rooms and flying scenery (the bathroom scene, where
Vova seduces the husband, was a shambles -- it literally didn't happen)
the set is creaky and noisy. Though it is potentially dazzling to the
eye, technical problems caused a 20-minute delay to the opening of the
show. This has got to be fixed before it comes north.

ANOTHER triumphant homecoming. While rightly famous for floppy-haired
sensitive types, it's fitting that even post-industrial Glasgow should
have a metal band to be proud of: a band calling its albums Gallus and
Swagger.
With dislocated dancing, blond close crop, and skin a stark white
against black leather, singer Mark Rankin looks more vulnerable than
before -- certainly less substantial than the Gizzi clan flanking him on
guitar and bass.
Then Rankin crooks his microphone arm, bares his teeth and takes
command with: ''No, no, I won't Stand In Line.'' Is the song about a
two-timing lover or the DSS? In fact it's about both. This is not to
deny the pop accessibility of demon hooks like Steal Your Fire: Bon Jovi
would be glad to play that at half speed and wreck it. But Gun combine
melody, energy, and credibility in a very smart package.
The sassy, knowing cover of Word Up and Dante Gizzi's punk rant on the
new single, Something Worthwhile, make the point. When you sing along to
Gun, you aren't just mouthing metal cliches about losing in love (though
you can if you like). The personal emotion can also become political if
you want it to.
Calling for an encore, Saturday's audience even makes Flower of
Scotland sound decent and is rewarded with the feel-good verdict of
Better Days: ''This should be Heaven, but this feels like Hell.''
It sounds as defiantly hopeful as it did in 1989, and even more
relevant.

LOUIS Weaver and Peggy Shaw, as Glasgay supporters will know, are the
American performance artists better known as Split Britches, one of the
longest established lesbian groups around. Their Lust and Comfort, just
opened in London (under the Gay Sweatshop banner) and due to be seen
later in New York, shows them mellowing but losing none of their
inventive edge in confronting a universal problem -- how do you, in
middle age, sustain a long-term relationship? What happens to lust and
desire?
Typically, Weaver and Shaw don't so much answer the question as use it
as a way of commenting on a whole set of scenes around power, dominance,
sex, and comfort. Drawing conscientiously on cultural references such as
The Servant, and Fassbinder's Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant, their
cross-gendered Chandleresque spin-off (with a hint of Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf thrown in) would seem to suggest that if you want to keep
your love alive, keep reinventing yourself, keep an ''open'' marriage.
Set loosely in London, the couple enact scenes between Shaw's ''male''
Hollywood scriptwriter and Weaver as first a reinvented (after Dirk
Bogarde) manservant, Barrett, then as Berlin barmaid Karin -- a rampant,
very funny spoof sex goddess.
Always powerful as performers -- Shaw's cool ''butch'' persona
perfectly complements Weaver's ''femme'' eroticism -- the hardest
challenge awaits them as homespun pajamaed lovers on a stage stripped of
props.
Never less than enthralling, if sometimes a touch wilful, with The
Killing of Sister George just around the corner, Lust and Comfort could
not be more welcome as an upbeat antidote to the latter's sadder and
more distorted view of lesbian ''butch'' and ''femme'' lifestyle.

OPERA in the New Athenaeum is very different from opera in the Theatre
Royal. It's difficult to favour one over the other but in the New
Athenaeum, Glasgow Grand Opera has created an especially intimate
production of Bizet's touching tale of love and friendship.
Although Bizet hadn't yet achieved the operatic maturity evident in
his true masterpiece, Carmen, The Pearl Fishers none the less contains
some passages of real beauty within the inconsistent score. That
infamous act one duet (an early example of male bonding in extremis)
united not only the two long-lost friends but also the entire audience,
such was the expressive intensity of the music.
Both male leads -- Jonathan Hawkins as Zurga and Campbell Russell as
Nadir -- are accomplished soloists and together with Scottish Opera
colleague Frances Morrison, as the Priestess Leila, they dominated the
vocal action. Russell's honey-sweet tenor blended perfectly with the
rich baritone of Hawkins; Morrison's love-struck joi de vivre revealed
in stunning vocal acrobatics.
Glasgow Grand benefits from a strong chorus, particularly the men.
However, their solid singing, at its peak in the act two finale, was
mirrored in a somewhat solid and regimental stage presence. The simple
yet effective sets offered much potential for movement, demonstrated in
the striking dance interludes from pupils of the Dance School of
Scotland.
Hiccups in the orchestra pit are best explained by lack of rehearsal
and are sure to settle as the run continues under the assured
directorship of Graham Dickie. Musically, this is a great achievement
from an amateur company, demonstrating the wealth of home-grown talent
in and around the city. Financially, they need your support -- further
performances 7.15pm each night this week, ending Saturday.

Sculptor takes a short George Wyllie journey by train and finds a
vision of the future face of the Clyde.
IWONDER how they'd have done it in America? Let's face it, #4m is a
lot to spend on making an old tunnel new again, and while the Greenock
to Gourock one re-opened on time there was no Euro-tunnel champagne at
Greenock West. It was a big day both for ScotRail and for the Inverclyde
locals, all of them fair delighted with their reconditioned 1926m-long
hole through the ground.
A touch of razzmatazz would not have gone wrong -- maybe Chatanooga
Choo Choo from the Greenock Big Band to accompany Strathclyde Transport
convener Charlie Gordon's was of a chequered flag ceremoniously to stop
the 8.08 from Gourock. A squad of drum majorettes would have added even
more lustre, and hastened our scurry over the footbridge to board the
8.15 from Glasgow for tunnel, Gourock, breakfast, and speeches. At the
other end there was dear old Gourock, looking better that any painting,
fresh and clear on a sunkissed morning. Thank you, BR, for your tunnel
vision.
The Firth of Clyde at Gourock is a place of superb scenic grandeur --
that is if you exclude a big yellow kettle carefully sited so as to
obscure the view of the Cowal Hills. It is strange how some of us think
that such objects are superior to a gift from nature. Right now there's
an idea to build a supermarket on the seafront further to obscure the
Cowal Hills, as if the kettle was not doing that well enough already.
The traders of Gourock are not delighted at this prospect and have
formed the Clyde Development Corporation Trust and come up with plans of
their own. These include a yacht harbour that will mean -- sorry folks
-- shifting the big kettle and building some quality housing that will
-- sorry, again folks -- leave insufficient room for a waterfront
supermarket.
There could be a Sea World below the prom -- in which a media-friendly
whale has already shown interest. A well-placed tower suggests there
could be a future for an Inverclyde Hilton. Let's face it, the lochs and
mountains deserve the appreciation, for the Firth of Clyde can hold its
own with other scenic harbours, like those of Sydney, Hong Kong, and
Vancouver. There is a world-class light at this end of the tunnel.
At the other end, some with less vision may be puzzled to know how a
bunch of local folk have managed to form a trust and win a positive
initial response to their plans from the Millennium Commission. Perhaps
it is because the commission is not interested in proposals for
supermarkets and kitsch kettle -- it could be that evident of quality
and imagination is the secret.
Back in sun-kissed Gourock -- and with a bit of Millennium luck -- the
Greenock Big Band could swing into The Song of the Clyde with the
majorettes doing their sunshine routine. The world would come to visit
by way of the Gouro-tunnel. The whale might even turn up again.

Women left to cope, their loved ones at war; ethereal images of
flowers and lovers: it's the story of two artists' lives, as Clare Henry
discovers.
ABSENCE makes the heart grow fonder, so they say. As artists, Sylvia
Von Hartmann and Joyce Cairns are as chalk and cheese, but both
certainly believe the old adage, for it forms the basis of their very
different but powerful pictures, on show at Roger Billcliffe Fine Art,
Glasgow.
''At my age there has to be a reason for everything I paint,'' says
Von Hartmann of her romantic, very personal creations. Cairns focuses on
a different reality: women coping when their loved ones are in danger at
war, at sea -- or just coping on their own.
The weary, worn-out women in Glasgow city centre dragging themselves
home after a long working day to spend another five or six hours as
cook, cleaner, nanny or nurse, are nowadays the norm as the burden of
supporting a family again falls on female shoulders -- as in the war.
And they remind me keenly of Joyce Cairns's characteristic portraits:
women grey with exhaustion and worry, their faces drawn, their eyes
hollow, their spirits low.
Cairns experienced this kind of angst at first hand. Her own father, a
Cameron Highlander, went missing in the war. First captured, he then
escaped into the Atlas Mountains. ''It had a terrible effect on my
mother. It haunted her for the rest of her life.
''On his return, he never spoke of it.''
Only now, after his death, is Cairns setting off for Tunisia to
retrace his steps.
Many of her pictures draw on this tragedy, while the use of uniforms
in her paintings, on women as much as men, hints at its grip.
''I've got all my father's uniforms. He was a fabulous man; so funny
too. I was devastated when he died.''
Living beside Aberdeen harbour she is also very conscious of the
coming and going of ships in port, the sailors frequently foreign,
lovelorn -- or lascivious. The girls flaunt Camel cigarettes between
long red nails while sipping vodka. The Venos, Milk of Magnesia, and
lumbago pills stand at the ready.
But what's this? Alongside these sad creatures, Billcliffe shows
Cairns's new monotypes: vivid portraits of clear-eyed girls set against
cheerful yellow and hot red, elegant white-skinned profiles under a
jaunty hat, a seductive nude -- even if she does have a dead chicken in
her grip and a knife at her side.
Cairns has made a great leap by using monotype. In monotype you
swiftly paint the image on to perspex, transferring it to paper by
rolling it through a press. Because an artist can only manipulate the
paint while it's wet, the process requires the confidence and sure touch
of a consummate professional.
Monotype by its very nature encourages simplicity, enabling Cairns to
move away from busy surface textures and a mire of wild gestures to
welcome strong ordered compositions. Most monotypes here are
self-portraits. Cairns herself has, metaphorically speaking, found the
sun.
The drawback of cool, calm tranquillity is of course that, as with
minimalism, there's less to look at, less to read, to ponder over.
Cairns's tortured images are full of symbolism: ominous birds of prey,
cruel-clawed cats, storms on the horizon and dark clouds to obscure the
flickering lighthouse. I'm keen to see how she resolves things.
Compared with Cairns's bold universal statements on loss and grief,
Von Hartmann is consciously mysterious, her work unashamedly ethereal
and romantic, awash with flowers and lovers. Like Cairns, her
inspiration is autobiographical, but hers is a secret world, with a
complex subtext we are not privy to. ''Maybe just as well!'' she
confesses. Hints appear in Gothic script -- if your German is good.
These tests have the added bonus of implying overtones of an illuminated
manuscript: something precious, something to be treasured, even
cherished.
Her work relies on intricate detail. She has a light touch, and though
fey, avoids the sickly fairy-tale routine. Her technique, unique to her,
also helps. Since the age of 10 she has been working in wax, which she
engraves and incises with very fine lines so the whole surface is a
detailed mass of leaves, tendrils, petals, and birds. Both artists use
birds and fish symbolically, but while Cairns's birds are usually
sinister, Von Hartmann allows for a chirp or two. Nineteenth-century
sorrow rather than 20th-century angst.
Her flowers are also the old-fashioned variety: gentle pansies, roses,
and forget-me-nots.
Sometimes she weaves her riddles around a bow tie, a golden crown, a
letter from Salzburg, even some boiled potatoes. Her show is titled
Esprit d'Escalier. The staircase in question is found in The Transparent
Toadstool. ''It leads to my bedroom,'' she says coyly.
Von Hartmann is one of 15 artists commissioned to create work for the
enterprising new St John's Hospital at Livingston. There she has a
wonderful installation of five panels on the theme of a magical room,
complete with dresser, chair, table, and door, some low enough to be
seen from a wheelchair or bed. ''It brings pleasure to all,'' said a
hospital visitor.
Against this background Keith Tyssen shows his beautiful burnished
(and cheap) pewter bowls -- simplicity themselves. New to me is
innovative modern furniture by Jose Arriga whose father is a Basque
woodcarver making traditional designs on furniture.
''I grew up with it. Now I try for simple organic forms, contrasting
hard and soft, cold and warm.''
We shall hear more of Arriga. I also enjoyed Denise Clark's silver
rock-crystal perfume bottle and goblets by Wally Gilbert. It's good to
see applied arts shown in a gallery context, the first of a series
sponsored by John Smiths, Scotland's oldest bookshop.

SENSATIONAL. In last night's combined concerto and recital concert,
young American violinist Joshua Bell proved his stature as one of the
most sought-after soloists in the world. Aided by a fabulous programme
of Bruch, Beethoven, Ysaye, and Kreisler, Bell's performance was nothing
short of inspirational.
Bruch was a man of melodies, nowhere more evident than in his three
violin concertos. Bell chose the first, bending the glorious melodic
lines as if suspended on an elastic band.
Drenched in emotion, the central adagio emerged melancholic and
poised, contrasted with utter showmanship in the dazzling finale. Under
the baton of Polish conductor Tomasz Bugaj, accompanying orchestral
passages from the Royal SNO were wonderfully expressive.
In a second-half recital, Bell continued to charm and ultimately
seduce a captive audience through playing of the utmost musical
perfection. The first of Beethoven's Opus 30 sonatas found Bell equally
at home in sustained melodies and intricate passage work, delivering the
many Beethovian delicacies with immaculate taste and clarity.
Accompanied throughout his recital by British pianist Paul Coker, here
Bell has found himself a true partner. Coker possesses that precious
ability to provide so much more than mere accompaniment, allowing the
piano an eloquent voice in its own right.
In the middle of Ysaye's enchanting Ballade Sonata for solo violin,
Bell was heard to uttter ''Oops'' as he accidentally plucked an open
string -- he's only human after all. Despite the presence of this stray
pluck, the poetic beauty of the piece cascaded from the strings with
ease and simplicity. A handful of Kreisler miniatures including the
Liebesfreud and Liebeslied capped a truly sensational performance.

IT could be you. And if you are the Tobermory Arts Centre on Mull, the
Grampian Hospital Arts Trust in Aberdeen, or the little Cottier Theatre
in Glasgow it already is. For these three were among the first eight
recipients of lottery money disbursed on Friday by the Scottish Arts
Council's lottery committee.
They all received modest but doubtless very welcome funds from a kitty
which will become worth some #16m. There is, naturally, a snag. Like all
the other bodies charged with disbursing these windfall funds, the arts
committee can only consider bids for capital projects. So new buildings,
refurbishment of elderly ones, and items of equipment are all eligible.
Running costs, except in very specific and very limited circumstances,
are not.
Which means of course that our national arts organisations, of whom
more later, can't look to the lottery to apply Elastoplast to wounded
budgets. Some of the other funders involved, like the Scottish Sports
Council, have acknowledged that more bricks and mortar are not
necessarily the most urgent concerns set against the need to give
promising athletes in all sports the financial freedom to hone their
skills.
They've made no secret of the fact that they hope to persuade central
government to make the guidelines rather more flexible a couple of years
down the line.
The Scottish Arts Council takes a very different tack. Their view is
that as soon as lottery money becomes available for revenue funding, the
perfect excuse is given to government to cut back on the money given
annually to the SAC to fund its clients . . . currently some #23m. They
cite the example of other countries with lotteries where cuts in arts
funding from central government has swiftly followed the availability of
money from a new source.
Which brings us back to Scotland's major arts organistions who between
them contrive to gobble up over #9m of the SAC's annual largesse if you
add the Scottish Chamber Orchestra to the Royal Scottish Orchestra,
Scottish Ballet, and Scottish Opera.
Some of them figure that in these parlous times there's not much point
in running scared of what the bad old Treasury might or might not do
three Budgets away. They would like a slice of the new cake now thanks
very much and, in the hallowed tradition of Miss Scarlett O'Hara, will
worry about threats to the Arts Council tomorrow.
Which, depending on your perspective, is either admirably gung ho, or
suicidally myopic. But for the moment that particular debate is academic
since the arts lottery money guidelines seem certain to remain pretty
well intact for the first three years.
A more urgent question is the current health and survival of
Scotland's national companies, not least that of Scottish Opera who are
in the midst of yet another acute financial dilemma.
Twice before they've managed to find fairy Godfathers to bale them out
to the tune of half a million pounds, one of these rescue packages
coming from the Scottish Office (to the scarecely veiled chagrin of
Scottish Ballet). But, since that was listed as a one-off, it seems
unlikely that Mr Lang will feel inclined to an encore. So if they can't
look to the lottery or the Government, how can they bridge the deficit
gap? Merging their badly under-utilised orchestra with the BBC's
Scottish Symphony Orchestra is a game plan looking increasingly
improbable.
Yet they can probably assume that the Scottish Arts Council won't
spring an increase on their current #4.67m award without evidence of
stricter housekeeping.
Scottish Ballet, which has bitten a variety of bullets in order to
balance its budget, meanwhile faces a crossroads of a different sort.
Having spent much time and effort on a new strategy aimed at merging its
traditional repertoire with more opportunity for contemporary and
experimental work, it now finds itself a victim of its own success with
the dazzling Swan Lake.
That production, loved by all but the amalgamated union of Scottish
dance critics, seems to have convinced some of the Ballet board members
that the status quo is the safest option . . . a fatal assumption in the
creative arts.
Add that to the fact that the working party set up to consider a
Scottish National Theatre resource was unable to convince itself that
such an ideal could attract the necessary finance, and you begin to ask
yourself some very dispiriting questions about this country's ability to
sustain any kind of national company which can deliver innovation,
excellence, and solvency.
There is evidence of that equation working on a smaller scale as with
companies like the Citizens' in Glasgow. But can such organisations ever
claim ''national'' status when they serve such a geographical minority?
Not that the London-based ''a National'' Theatre necessarily earns
that title, given that it spends the bulk of its time bedded down in the
capital with occasional hit-and-run missions to the provincial natives.
Somehow we Scots have to find coherent answers to two questions. The
first is to establish what in a Scottish context we understand the
obligations of a national company to be.
That conundrum lies at the core of Scottish Ballet's pressures to give
the audience the classical repertoire without stifling artistic
development. And the second is to ask ourselves if these companies, of
whom we are all rightly proud, are increasingly unaffordable cultural
virility symbols, or are a crucial component in protecting and nurturing
our sense of identity.

NOT many politicians are known for their brevity, especially those who
work in the talking factory which is the European Parliament. But there
is an exception who has proved his worth as the enemy of Eurospeak.
Mr Edward McMillan-Scott is the British Tory Euro-MP who sliced
through the jungle of jargon in the Maastricht treaty to make it
understandable in one minute. Being a professional communicator from a
background in public relations, he thought it helpful to distribute
copies of his masterpiece on a little plastic card which fits neatly
into a pocket diary.
His card has become an essential Euro-tool which explains why every
now and then in the press room of the European Parliament or the
Commission you might spot a furtive reporter, in a moment of crisis,
sneaking a look in his diary and immediately sounding impressively
authoritative.
News of Mr McMillan-Scott's triumph as a sub-editor par excellence
soon travelled. Despite the fact he is a political partisan, his card is
a hit with his opponents, not to mention his own colleagues. You can
often spot Euro-MPs from other parties going through the same routine
whenever someone asks them a tricky question.
For example: under which of the three pillars of the Maastricht Treaty
is the question of arms procurement dealt with? ''Simple, just give me a
moment,'' replies the average Euro-MP these days, as he rummages in his
pocket for a sneak look at the McMillan-Scott idiot's guide.
''Ah, yes, thought so, common foreign and security policy -- first
pillar.'' Life is so much easier for everyone nowadays, thanks to
Maastricht in a Minute.
Well, Mr McMillan-Scott has now turned his skills to another
complicated question made almost incomprehensible by Eurojargon. His new
target is European economic and monetary union (known as Emu), the
process which will lead one day to a single currency.
As from last week, courtesy of the McMillan-Scott Emu card, this
horrifically complex process is reduced to a mere 600 words of plain
language. The useful thing about this latest guide is that it is
non-political. ''This is not propaganda for or against a single
currency,'' says its author. ''I have tried to de-mystify the whole
process and to give the essential facts.''
He says he is open-minded about a single currency. You can believe
that if you like. I just wonder why Mr McMillan-Scott issued a press
release with his Emu card giving a table showing how the British pound
shrinks when it is exchanged for other EU currencies.
He's right, of course. Emu will save us all lots of money in exchange
transactions. According to the McMillan-Scott thesis, any unfortunate
daft enough to start off with #1000 and begin changing it into all the
other EU currencies will be left with only #500 once the process is
complete -- and that is without actually spending any of it.
The best thing for ordinary people about Emu and the single currency
is that it offers the prospect of stopping the banks ripping us off.
They will just find another way, transaction charges for example.
The next best thing is that it will keep politicians' sticky fingers
off our money. This is, of course, why lots of them don't really care
for the idea. When the single currency comes, the politicians' ability
to manipulate national currencies will be reduced. Instead, there will
be a board in the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, composed of
representatives from all participating nations, invested with a duty to
keep the currency stable and strong and in tune with market needs.
Gone will be the days of competitive or political devaluations.
Interest rates will be fixed centrally and not made a politician's
plaything in a crisis.
Last week there was more speculation that the bandwagon for Emu could
be halted if the French hang back. The conventional wisdom is that
Germany, Austria, and Netherlands will be ready soon for a single
currency. Luxembourg would join, too, although there are complications
with Belgium which is technically almost bankrupt and enjoys a single
currency already with Luxembourg.
But a single currency still needs French participation. Logic dictates
that the process requires at least two of the Big Four member states --
of which one must be Germany -- if Emu is to get started. We have always
assumed that big country would be France, but now there are doubts and
weasel words as the French presidential election takes its course.
So here is a thought. It is one you will not find on the
McMillan-Scott Emu card and one which you read here first, to the best
of my knowledge.
We cannot have Emu before 1997 at the earliest and that target is now
being dismissed as over-optimistic. That means we shall probably have
had a British General Election comfortably before the single currency
can begin. All indications are that Labour will win.
Has Mr Blair thought of the economic advantages of Britain joining a
single currency with Germany and the others, and simply leaving the
French to fuss, as the British are doing now?
That really would put Britain, as Mr Major used to say, at the heart
of Europe. And on the biggest issue in British politics, Labour would be
completely in tune with business. But knowing New Labour, it is all
probably a touch radical.

TORY activists, the seasoned middle-aged ones, dedicated souls who
have raised their financial quotas to Central Office in times of dire
trouble, know what they want. These folk, who have felt let down, have
received a belated pledge from the Prime Minister to deliver.
They want Identity Cards (like wartime), parental responsibility,
school discipline (including the cane); ''boot'' camps for young
offenders, tougher sentencing, fewer traffic offences, and more
detection of real crime; speedy and condign punishment for criminals and
full retribution for victims.
They want tax cuts, of course, and plenty of them; mortgage tax relief
reinstated and a revived housing market; volunteers themselves, with
only an OBE and the occasional knighthood to show for it, they desire
less bureaucratic meddling and more voluntary ''caring''.
They do not want any more argument about a single currency, which they
abhor, or even the slightest hint of Tory divisions at Westminster;
clever Cabinet Ministers exploiting the Prime Minister's problems. They
particularly do not want any more from the Heritage Secretary Stephen
Dorrell telling estwhile Tory voters that they have got to stop
regarding their own homes as an investment.
Those of them gathered in Birmingham at the weekend, those who know
''Middle Britain'' best, have had good reason to think of themselves as
overlooked and disregarded increasingly with every year that the Tories
have been in power. Their say in matters has been sidelined.
Nobody asked them if they wanted to ditch Margaret Thatcher for John
Major (or anybody else). They were not consulted when Britain joined the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism at the wrong time and the wrong rate,
with disastrous results.
I bet, like me, they were thinking of this when they received the
first sign of contrition from the man who did the deed, the Prime
Minister. ''No doubt we've made mistakes'', he said, ''but we've learned
from them.''
At last, an apology for sponsoring the toughest recession, intensified
by the ERM, that Middle Britain has ever experienced. I give him, as
they did, the benefit of the doubt as to this expression of regret. It
could have been fuller. I would have been happier with Mr Major and his
Ministers if they had used the annual conference of the Central Council
(the Tory Party voluntary wing) to be more explicit in their apology to
these, their hard-core faithful.
Their trust has been betrayed more severely than that of any other
section of the political community. What we got instead was a succession
of speeches from the Cabinet dressed up as a new agenda for the
twenty-first century. What they delivered was a restatement of the core
Tory values that these people who knock on doors and raise money day in,
day out, have never abandoned.
When the Labour Party is ahead in the polls on law and order and the
ability to run the economy you can see why these remarkably unsullen
people believe that the problem has been that their Government has
failed to deliver. The advent of Mr Tony Blair has been salutary. He has
adopted these core values. This has forced the Government to try to
deliver while they still have a chance.
In the circumstances it was a great cheek to go to the party faithful
to rediscover the priorities of Toryism that they have never forgotten.
''I'm going to tell you how we're going to win back the faith and trust
of the British people'', Mr Major had the gall to pronounce. They might
have taken it as an April Fool's joke, had it not been after noon.
At least there was no mention of Dorrellism. On the contrary, there
was the promise to extend home-ownership still further. This might have
been greeted with a guffaw, but, as I say, these people are faithful and
trusting; often even in private. They do not desert to Labour or Lib Dem
as so many of their neighbours have done -- or at least, they have not
done so yet.
They were reassured, but disenchantment has been setting in. ''Extend
home-ownership still further?'' said one. ''That's a joke in very bad
taste unless they do something about negative equity, and do it quick. I
can't tell you how many times I have warned Central Office that the
search for the Middle Britain vote begins and ends there.''
In the light of this kind of response (and there were others) the
revivalist tone of the Prime Minister and his colleagues lacked bite.
Heseltine and Howard and Gummer and Clarke and Portillo and Hanley and
Hurd all did their bit, but it came over to me rather King Learlike:
''Get thee glass eyes; And like a scurvy politician, seem to see the
things thou dost not.''
The Prime Minister listed 25 policy developments in his speech to try
to impress upon them that his Government is still thinking of them when
it considers what to do next. Given that he was primarily seeking to
speak to the nation, much of it was banal. I guess that even the
ordinary voters out there, let alone the activists, do not need to be
told: ''We Conservatives believe in thrift, with individuals encouraged
to build up tax-free savings.''
What galls these people is that they can smell a winner in Blair, a
Prime Minister to be in their trusted clothes.
Heseltine came nearest to giving them hope: ''Public opinion sways
like a weathervane -- all that's new about Blair (closet Tory all along)
is that he's been outed.'' They also liked his support for Major: ''It
is our task to give him a bandwagon for the next campaign.'' They
understood from this that there will be no more plotting from the man
who brought down Thatcher.
As a PR exercise, the Birmingham gathering worked in so far as it
displayed solidarity in the ranks, where it really matters to a
desperate political party. But there it ends until Mr Clarke comes up
with the business in his November Budget.
These people will keep their nerve until then, providing the
parliamentary party does so too. But woe betide Mr Major and his list of
25 policy items if the Chancellor fails to deliver those restated core
values into people's pockets.

THE LAST OF THE DUCHESS. By Caroline Blackwood. Macmillan: #16.99
NEVER beautiful, often impeccable, Wallis Simpson was that rare
individual whose very public appearance wrought a sea-change in society.
Initially, upper-crust enemies sneered at her Americanisms, and
Londoners, propelled towards delinquency by her entrapment of a king,
would edge up close to stick pins in her as she walked through Mayfair.
By her own craving and contempt for status, Wallis powerfully
demonstrated how notions about royalty send all kinds of people off
their rockers. Injudicious love drove a weak-minded fop with Nazi
inclinations to rid himself of sovereign duty, and instead of throwing
its hat in the air, a whole nation responded by going doolally.
Wallis's hard-edged elegance exposed the parochial grandeur and deceit
of Little England, its well-bred slyness, its silly, pompous snobs. But,
without the American Duchess to hate, Britain would never have been able
to cultivate its curious adoration of the Queen Mother.
The woman whom Wallis dismissed, with wise-cracking bitchiness, as the
Monster of Glamis and a fat cook, loathed her with the ferocity of a
widow's grievance, believing the pressures imposed on George VI by
Edward's abdication had accelerated her husband's death. Yet on that day
of bizarre solemnity in 1972, when the Duke of Windsor's own burial at
Frogmore brought the two old adversaries together, it was Elizabeh, who,
moved to pity, came forward and kissed the Duchess suddenly
disintegrating under the weight of tranquillisers, vodka, and loss.
In fact Wallis outlived the Duke by 14 years but ''living'' was the
very least of those long, vacant days. She was 76 when Edward died and
almost immediately she surrendered her then fuddled existence to Maitre
Suzanne Blum, the French lawyer who had ingratiated herself with the
Windsors, and whose perverted worship of her client now kept the Duchess
hostage in her Parisian chateau.
There in the Bois de Boulogne this house became as secretive as a
pharaoh's tomb, its incumbent held together only by the tyrannous
hardware of medical science. Just one window was left unshuttered --
that of the Duchess's bedroom. Otherwise 4 route du Champ
de'Entrainement was transformed from the dazzling court of a frivolous
lapsed, monarch and his Baltimore gadfly to the bunker of a macabre
fairy tale.
''Staring at her house through the prison netting of her fence, I felt
that this poor woman's worst terrors (her horror of being alone without
light) must now be realised. If the Duchess sometimes regained
consciousness, she must feel that few people were as abandoned as she
was, few people had been so completely left alone in the dark . . .''
The author and journalist Caroline Blackwood defines her latest book,
The Last of the Duchess as ''an example of the fatal effects of myth''.
Gothic in content, it is a morality tale and a comedy of the blackest
order, Orton with nobs on. A story where Wallis's final sorry state
becomes so dependent on her lawyer's diabolical cunning one woman seems
subsumed into the other.
It was as if Maitre Blum was draining the very breath out of the
wasting Duchess so that she could somehow relocate it in her
nonsensically idealised image of the golden girl who won the prince. And
for a decade the lawyer had so incredibly terrorised the mighty that
none of Wallis's circle had been permitted to visit the chateau to check
out her wretched condition.
But then along came Blackwood, despatched by the Sunday Times to write
a profile of the Duchess which would accompany photographs by Lord
Snowdon. At least that was the proposal but no-one had taken into
account the formidable Blum, spry of step, dowdy of dress yet with a
face surgically lifted to such tightness it gave her eyes an oriental
slant. Both interview and photographs were angrily ruled out. The lawyer
was now too far down a path of denials about the Duchess's health to
allow any prying eyes to observe the monstrous truth.
Yet the pretence that Wallis was frail but in good spirits didn't
destroy rumours, and there were indications, too, that pieces of the
Windsors' hidden treasure were being sold off, ostensibly to pay
preposterous medical bills. But was there some sinister motive behind
the sales? What was Maitre Blum really plotting? Were the British crown
jewels in danger of becoming her ill-gotten goods?
Blackwood writes: ''At an age when many women feel useless, defeated,
depressed and unwanted, Maitre Blum had found love; and possibly even
more difficult, she had found a brand-new sense of purpose . . . While
she loved and controlled the Duchess, while on occasion she could feel
she was the Duchess, there was no reason for Maitre Blum to sag and lose
her wits and become despondent and go into a state of physical decay.''
So Blackwood decided that if she could not speak to the Duchess, then
she would badger this old crone into giving an interview herself, and
glean what other information she could from those whose crumbling
memories could still summon insider stories about the ruined social
wonder of the age.
Blackwood's record of that mystery tour around a tyrant, her moribund
patron, and a decrepit jet-set was written 15 years ago, but it was only
after Maitre Blum's death at the age of 95 last year that she dared to
publish the tale.
During their very first meeting Blum had threatened to kill Blackwood
if she did not refer to the Duchess according to the lawyer's
beautifying descriptions: ''The Duchess's face still looks so
beautiful'' she would burble. ''The beauty of her soul is shining
through . . . it has nothing to do with facelifts . . .'' On and on
about a woman known to have always been narcissistic. On and on about
her high-toned friends, the very best, and, of course, the Duke's
kindness: ''The Duke used to open the doors of cars to people of no
importance . . .'' All of Blum's rantings were purposely distorted to
meet some necrophiliac need in the lawyer herself. But if the Duchess's
friends were such honourable people how did that account for the
presence in her heyday company of Jimmy Donohue?
This heir to the Woolworth millions, an alcoholic homosexual and
reprobate whose obscene jokes were designed publicly to taunt the
servants, was, for a brief period, the Duchess's lover as if, through
irritation, she decided to punish and humiliate the besotted Duke.
Donohue, the very best?
The man had castrated a young American soldier in a drunken brawl and
when Donohue committed suicide that did not distract the Duchess from
dining at the Ritz in Paris the very same evening. ''She must have
minded desperately,'' one dear friend, Mrs Brinsley Plunket, told
Blackwood, ''but she didn't show it. She was immensely dignified. I
remember when the Duchess came out of the lavatory having peed, she said
to me: 'Even that can be a pleasure . . .' That was her sense of
humour.''
Her first husband was another alcoholic who locked her up at home
while he toured saloons. Her second husband, Ernest Simpson, a
shipping-broker, was said to be cosmopolitan but although he moved in
royal circles he was a skinflint and something of a groper; in the eyes
of Lady Diana Cooper ''an awful, common little man . . . the sort of
creature who was always trying to get you into the garden.''
More for style than for love she married the Prince of Wales, taking
delight in having his gifts of family gems recast in modern Cartier
settings. Back at Buckingham Palace the royals fumed, every now and then
despatching Lord Mountbatten to the chateau in the hope that he would
wrest at least the ceremonial swords from the clutches of Maitre Blum.
But why were the Duchess's most intimate friends so impotent in
helping? Blackwood, a former wife of the painter Lucien Freud and widow
of the poet Robert Lowell and the composer Israel Citkowitz, is pretty
well-connected herself although estranged from her mother, the
Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava.
But her problem in this instance was that she was dealing with a batch
of dilapidated aristocrats: the Mosleys, that doddering pair of
Fascists; the still beautiful but bed-bound Lady Diana Cooper; the
genteel Mrs Brinsley Plunket worrying whether she could retrieve a gift
of tweed she once gave the Duchess now it was evident her friend would
never use it; Laura, Duchess of Marlborough, who actually booked herself
on a Paris flight, determined to brave the dreaded Blum but at the last
minute cancelled the trip because of a cold and the need to ''restring
her pearls''.
In nearly every instance the quest for explanations resulted in bleak
farce.
Only one person, an Austrian baron, managed to breach Maitre Blum's
security, and he was horrified by what he found. Blackwood reports:
''The Duchess had shrunk to half her original size and she seemed to be
unconscious. She was lying in bed, looking like a tiny prune. She had
turned completely black.'' But still nothing was done, and the suspicion
grows that despite their professed concern Wallis's once radiant
confidants, in some careless, or perhaps unconscious way, were now
finally rejecting this ''outsider''.
In Blackwood's book someone refers to Maitre Blum as most dangerous
when clownish. But that was true of many who spun in the golden orbit of
the Windsors. Selfish, clever, powerful, worthless . . . a venomous
bunch of clowns just the same.

A NEW row is brewing between the Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party and the
ANC in South Africa over the country's final constitution. The first
nationwide colour-blind South African elections were held last April,
and returned an ANC majority just a fraction short of that required to
let it govern by itself and frame the constitution entirely to its own
liking. The outcome was a coalition which brought into the fold both the
National Party and Inkatha. The brake this put upon the more extreme
radical groups within the ANC was probably welcome to the President, Mr
Mandela, who has seen the need to keep all ethnic groups moving forward
in agreement. He has proved to be a moderate manager of men and has
retained his appeal across every tribal and racial grouping, but
especially among the whites who remain the most important group
economically and who are essential to the the smooth functioning of the
most advanced parts of the economy. (They may also be essential to the
country's success in attracting foreign capital since their continuing
content is an obvious proof of stability.) Mr Mandela's authority is
beyond dispute, and last month he showed he could test its appeal
confidently when he sacked his former wife Winnie from the Government
for persistent disloyalty. Mrs Mandela remains a powerful force, and few
would rule out her return to the main stage at some time, but so far she
seems to have accepted her fate. That is not so with Inkatha and its
leader, Chief Buthelezi.
Buthelezi has lost ground steadily to President Mandela but he speaks
for a great many (though not all) Zulus and has some appeal to white
Natalians. He threatens to boycott the constitutional discussions later
this week if the Government does not accede to his proposals for
independent foreign arbitration over the proposals for provincial
devolution. The ANC really wants a strong central government for the
country but says that it will provide also for provincial devolution in
respect of matters like health, housing, local government, and
education. Its own supporters in the provincial governments want
devolution as well. They do not want as much as the Zulus, the country's
largest group: Inkatha certainly wants a very large measure of devolved
power. The ANC's internal discussions on the subject, which ended
yesterday, showed they are unlikely to concede that, whatever foreign
observers might recommend. The ANC confirmed the need for a centralised
state, suggesting that economic considerations, apart from anything
else, strongly endorsed it.
South Africa is a huge country, and could easily afford a relaxed
central government with generously devolved powers to the provinces. The
danger, which is really what worries the ANC, is that too much
generosity could easily encourage fragmentation. It is not a risk it is
willing to run. Less understandable is its insistence that the grand
coalition cannot exist after 1999. Like other African states, it may
find that such a structure is preferable to other modes in a racially
divided society which is just discovering democratic cohesion. The
country will not have Mr Mandela for ever.

THIS week we vote for the shadow versions of 29 of the 32 unitary
authorities which will govern Scotland a year from now. Should we be
enthused by this, fired with the vision of new opportunities, of greater
democratic control and decentralisation of power to the people? If there
is a swelling of approval and support for this reform it is not, it has
to be said, terribly visible. The only real enthusiasm glimpsed thus far
is shown by those who will use the poll as an opportunity to comment on
the national policies of the Government. We shall return to the issues
which motivate people and to the role of the shadow authorities over the
next 12 months in due course, yet among the confusion and apathy over
the process of local government reform, one fact has become perfectly
clear. In the eyes of the public and, hopefully, in the minds of any
conscientious politicians, the new, reformed local government structure
will only succeed if it delivers services in a manner at least as
efficient as that which exists at the moment. If this does not happen,
the unitary authorities will be damned by those they seek to serve and
the result will be a diminution in the reputation of local government
which will be of the utmost seriousness for the future of democracy in
Scotland.
The changes which will take effect in 12 months, and which will be
forming slowly in the public consciousness over that period, are
radical. This means that there are plenty of people involved in the
process who have axes to grind. Many of those participating in the
current provision of services, and who will be involved in the future,
speak privately of their own perceptions of chaos to come. Few can stand
to be counted, for in the working out of these plans there has been an
unwholesome element of ruthlessness which has swept aside suggestions of
independent reviews, or even independent minds. Nevertheless, there is a
widespread apprehension that the role which the new authorities will be
expected to play, and especially those smaller ones who must band
together in order to be able to provide decent services, may not be
capable of delivering the whole range of existing services with any
precision. It is undeniable that there is scope for decentralisation of
some council activity, and a greater willingness to listen to the public
over the way services are delivered would also be welcome. The danger is
that the din of confusion in the near future might drown out the small
voice of need.
Three areas stand out in the league table of anxiety over the future
provision of services. These are education, social work, and transport.
Education is the greatest worry, for it is in itself an area on which
the main political parties disagree. The potential for disaster when
councils which must co-operate to provide education services are led by
different political parties is immense. Nor do the organisational plans
inspire confidence with, for instance, some Strathclyde secondary
schools due to receive pupils from primaries in a different educational
authority. Social work is the soft target that all ideological bullies
love to attack, yet if social-work provision fails it is the most needy
who suffer. Specialist social-work services can be expensive, nor is it
likely that small authorities will easily agree what services they want,
or whether they can even afford them. Transport is another minefield,
complicated by the lack of provision (which we bemoan at every
opportunity) of an integrated national transport system. The
fragmentation of responsibility for some transport functions makes this
dream even less likely to happen. On the larger scale, Strathclyde
Region at present subsidises ScotRail to the tune of #112m annually.
When Strathclyde becomes 12 unitary authorities who will pay for this,
indeed who could pay for this? These questions must be prominent at the
ballot box. The Scottish public must hold current services in its mind,
for it may have to struggle for them in the future.

AS they made the lucky draw, we were told that last year's prize was a
weekend in Paris. What was it this time? First, let's have the name out
of the hat. And the winner is . . . yes, I had won it!
A weekend in Paris? Well, not quite. Instead, a weekend in Aberdeen.
Now, as most of civilisation knows, I have nothing against Aberdeen. It
was the subsequent information which raised alarm.
That weekend at the Copthorne Hotel was to include a fishing trip on
an unnamed stretch of water? The River Dee perhaps? Ah well, despite my
aversion to the rigorous experiences of life, I might run into the Queen
Mother who seems to delight in wading up to her royal oxters in search
of Deeside salmon.
The destination was not revealed until I reached the Granite City and
the chap arrived at an ungodly hour to convey the two winners to their
fishing beat.
''Deeside then?'' I queried with forced joviality.
''Na na, man,'' said the driver. ''We're gyan tae the Lake o'
Pitfour.''
The Lake o' Pitfour? But that's within a couple miles of where I was
born -- where, more than 50 years ago, I attached a piece of string to
an old stick and dug up a garden worm as bait. But Pitfour it was, an
estate once boasting a magnificent mansion house and a miniature model
of the Temple of Theseus.
Much of the grandeur had gone but, to my surprise, the temple was
still there, right by the lakeside, where a little oary-boat was bobbing
up and down, awaiting its prize-winners from the south.
Into the boat I jumped, as Mike Morris the gillie supplied the gear
and rowed out to the middle of the lake, explaining the rudiments of
angling.
I thought you simply cast the line and left it there till the fish
came to bite. But it is not that simple. Apparently, at this time of
year, the cunning creatures are lying at the bottom, feasting themselves
on shrimps. You must skilfully entice them to the surface.
Mike the gillie, a corpulent, hairy, delightful character,
demonstrated the repetitive rhythm of casting which leaves you, on a
cold day like this, with aching muscles and a freezing posterior.
Wading in the water in search of salmon, he explained, is an even more
arduous business, which left me wondering how on earth the Queen Mother
achieves her success at the age of 94, when she casts away merrily and
up come the fish. Maybe it's by royal command.
Anyway, the regal lady is welcome to her fun, I was thinking to myself
as I checked my watch, shook it to see if it had stopped, and wondered
how I could possibly endure the full six hours.
Mike the gillie was diplomatic and encouraging. No, I was not the
worst novice he had ever encountered. He could remember one who was even
more impossible.
Speaking of diplomacy, how could I arrange a tactful form of words to
tell him I was planning to quit at lunchtime?
Thus engaged in deep thought, I was suddenly jolted back to reality.
Miracle upon miracle! I was straining at the rod.
''Mike!'' I cried, ''I've hooked something. I've got one!''
''Yes, I know,'' he replied dolefully. ''It's me!''
My glaikit look of discovery confirmed that the poor gillie was
carefully trying to unhook my fly from his considerable foliage. The
apologetic inquiry as to how I could possibly have managed that was met
with another model of diplomatic expression.
Well, that was it. Goodnight Vienna. Back to the Temple of Theseus,
where the Copthorne people had laid on a magnificent hamper lunch:
smoked salmon, fresh salmon, cheese, celery and grapes, fruit and a
whole bottle of Jack McLean's wee goldies.
As my teeth chattered over lunch, the other winner, Ian Cash, a
chemical engineer from Aberdeen, arrived with much complaint about the
heat. The heat? Yes, he had been so enjoying himself that he hadn't
noticed the cold. But Ian was a real angler.
Whereas I had just visited hell, Ian Cash was in seventh heaven,
drooling over his memorable morning and entering into a fishermen's
conversation with the gillie in which they could have been talking
Swahili.
They obviously knew the psychology of the species, a couple of Freuds
of the fishing world, reaching near-orgasmic enthusiasm in trying to
tell me what it feels like to hook the little blighters.
Mind you, it was all right for Ian Cash. With a name like that, he had
already hit the jackpot with a whopper of a rainbow trout and was
destined to land two more before the day was out.
While he returned to the joys of fishing, I wandered across the road
to the ancient Abbey of Deer and privately re-lived the last time I was
here, filming my final scene of As Time Goes By eight years ago.
Fishing, they say, is the biggest participation sport in the land. But
I wouldn't have believed there were so many human nuts in one small
nation. On the other hand, they are nice people. Unknown to me until
later, Ian Cash had quietly left one of his rainbow trout for my
consolation.
Back home, I put it in the microwave for 90 seconds. And it was truly
delicious.

IN the now widely publicised saga of the Loch Lomond and Trossachs
Working Party's report Sir Hector Monro, strictly speaking, is correct
when he says that the Secretary of State's decision fully endorses its
recommendations (March 24).
I accept this, but beyond that there is no failure on my part to
understand either what the working party recommended or the Government's
response to it, as he infers.
What Sir Hector fails to make clear is that the Secretary of State
specifically required that the working party should not make any
recommendations involving new legislation. As an independent joint
board, with adequate powers and resources, would have needed this, the
working party was forced from the outset to the weaker joint committee
solution.
The working party's report nevertheless hints strongly for a more
robust answer to the problems of Loch Lomond, stating: ''We propose a
joint board in a further evolutionary stage which would accompany the
proposed local government reform.''
In an annex responding to the Scottish Office consultation paper on
local government reform the working party is even more specific, stating
that ''the principle of the joint board within the context of new
legislation is recommended for early and serious consideration'' and
that the creation of a joint committee would be ''second best'' to a
joint board.
Sir Hector suggests that in omitting the element of the local
authorities' financial contribution to the management of Loch Lomond my
comparison with the funding of the English and Welsh national parks is
misleading.
My point was that the annual Government contribution in the south is
very much greater than that provided for Loch Lomond. For the Peak
National Park, for just one year (1993-4), the Government's national
park supplementary grant was of the order of #4m.
Sir Hector does not consider that the pressures on Loch Lomond are
comparable with those in such as the Peak and the Lakes. Bearing in mind
that Loch Lomond is within easy travelling distance of 70% of Scotland's
population, upwards of four million people -- not to mention thousands
of visitors from England and beyond -- his view must be open to
question.
Even if it were the case, it is no argument for not setting up an
effective planning and management structure now, when the pressures may
still be manageable, rather than leaving it until irrevocable damage has
been done and the situation is completely out of hand.
In criticising the Secretary of State's decision the many responsible
bodies and individuals in Scotland -- not least those who live around
Loch Lomond -- are in no sense decrying the efforts of the working
party. They are simply recognising the impossible situation into which
it was put by the embargo on new legislation.
It reflects no credit on Scottish Office Ministers that the working
party was not allowed to deploy its wide experience and expertise to
make proposals which would deal effectively with the ever-increasing
problems which exist around Loch Lomond today.
The weakness of the Secretary of State's decision is a fundamental
impediment to progress in meeting the pressing needs of this
internationally renowned area and the people who live in it.

WHAT good news for Scotland and many future residents of new housing
that at last a sensible planning restriction on potential flood areas is
being imposed on new developments. The sad part, of course, is that this
legislation should have been here many years ago. This would also be the
ideal time to address the causes of so much of this flooding.
One only has to follow local watercourses to see the neglected
condition the majority are in, due to either complete disregard through
being out of sight or lack of interest by many of the riparian owners
who are unaware that they are responsible for the half on their side of
the burn.
Many of the owners who are aware show no interest either, unless they
are responsible enough to appreciate the vast improvement correct
cleaning out can make and have the genuine interest of a landowner to
see that this is done on a regular basis, regarding banking overgrowth,
rubbish, and silting up.
I would hope that this is the first step to see that this grey area,
which few wish to enter, of watercourse maintenance is given the
attention it merits, which is not happening at present.
The result of proper attention would be that there would be
possibilities of development in some areas presently neglected providing
someone takes responsibility for the regular watercourse maintenance.
Surely this type of condition should be imposed at the planning stage in
the interest of all concerned.
District councils should have a responsibility through one of their
committees to make periodical inspection of local burns, including their
own sections, which are one of the district's greatest asssets, allowing
many developments to take place and accepting the surface water from
them.

THE SNP in Tayside are obviously firm believers in the maxim that a
lie repeated often enough will be believed. Councillor Ian Hudghton
again says that the #503,000 scheme to alleviate fuel poverty in Tayside
was an SNP idea (March 29).
The truth is that the scheme bears a remarkable similarity to the
#500,000 scheme proposed by Labour and Independent members of the social
work committee which the SNP voted against. Days later they came up with
''their'' scheme by taking the content of our scheme and adding #3000 to
the cost in the hope that that would diguise its origins.
The SNP were forced into this act of theft by desperation at their
repeated failure to honour an election promise to provide each pensioner
in Tayside with #10 to alleviate the imposition of VAT on domestic fuel.
Labour councillors would be less annoyed than they are if stealing the
credit was all the SNP were up to. What is far more devious is that they
have attempted to pay for the scheme (which works by reducing charges on
social work sevices in the winter months) by putting an extra #1.5m
worth of charges on services to much the same clients.
Not only are they robbing the elderly to pay the elderly -- they are
robbing them of three times the cost of the benefit they are getting.

COUNCILLOR Colin Robb appears not to comprehend the importance of
committees on his council (March 28).
Opposition councillors are denied representation on no fewer than six
committees: the appeals committee; the district liaison committee; the
joint consultative committee; the equal opportunities sub-committee; the
members, officers and trade unions sub-committee, and the corporate
management group.
To imply, as Councillor Robb does, that these committees are
unimportant shows a lack of understanding of the affairs of the
district.
The joint consultative committee, for example, has the remit of
dealing with all matters of mutual concern between the East Kilbride
Development Corporation and the district council. At this time, during
the turmoil of the corporation being wound up, it is difficult to see
this committee as being other than important.
In East Kilbride, Labour has given itself 83.5% of committee places,
and all external representation of the council is by Labour members
(apart from the two Tories whom it allows to sit on the Strathaven
project steering group).
If Councillor Robb had checked his own council minutes before hurling
his accusations of dereliction of duty, he would find that three Labour
councillors, including the provost, were absent from the meeting at
which the budget was discussed.

SNP Group Leader,

THE Government's pig-headedness in pressing ahead with its railway

It is perhaps also symptomatic of a Government quite out of control

HELEN Messenger of the Infant and Dietetic Foods Association gives a
false impression of the situation in maternity hospitals regarding baby
milks (March 24).
Infant formula manufacturers did indeed provide free milk supplies to
hospitals until May 18, 1990, when NHS Circular No 1990 (GEN) 17 asked
health boards neither to accept nor distribute free samples of infant
formulae; to refuse to accept subsidised supplies of infant formulae;
and to seek to negotiate the keenest possible commercial price for
infant formulae and associated products.
It was not industry conscience but Government action that reduced the
role of the hospitals as a market-place for the companies.
Helen Messenger also claims that free supplies are permitted under the
new regulations. I understand that this is not the case. The NHS
circular still stands. For Helen Messenger to claim that the infant
formula manufacturers are going to exercise restraint by continuing to
ban free samples is dishonest. The Government will continue to disallow
free or subsidised supplies.
As regards ready-to-feed formulae, annex 13 to the circular states
that ''the manufacturers used to supply ready-to-feed formulae at a
price which represented only a fraction of their cost, thus giving a
large subsidy to health boards''.
Helen Messenger states that ''baby-milk companiews have never supplied
free samples of ready-to-feed formula''. This is true, but it is not the
whole truth. Ready-to-feed formulae were not supplied free, just almost
free.
So health boards do indeed pay an economic price for baby milks. But
for the mother the ready-to-feed bottles are free and convenient, and
give no indication of what bottle-feeding really entails, exactly as
Joan McFadden suggests (March 16).
Finally, would infant formula manufacturers really bother to spend
#12m a year on advertising if they did not firmly believe that it
influences our choices?

WE are indebted to Dr Purves for highlighting the Government's
proposals to create in Scotland new water authorities which will be
outwith the control of our elected councils (March 24).
Those who have long pursued the idea of using our drinking water for
so-called preventive medicine are cock-a-hoop because they now see this
as a means whereby the health boards can recommend fluoridation without
any proper means of public opposition.
We are assumed to be living in a democracy. As recently as 1993 the
would-be fluoridators had a chance to state their case and have it
judged democratically throughout the country. It was universally
rejected by regional councillors who, as they repeatedly told us, were
voting in accordance with perceived majority opinion.
Medical ''experts'' such as Dr Purves do not heed democratic opinion.
They insist they know best. On this issue their minds and their
researches appear to be cast in stone.
Yet there is a world-wide mass of accumulating evidence pointing to
health risks associated with waterborne fluoride; it includes the
authenticated studies of highly qualified medical and clinical
personnel, and cannot simply be dismissed as ''ill-informed''.
Scotland is lucky in having thus far no fluoridation track record,
apart from local experiments now terminated. But from heavily
fluoridated countries we get constant updates on osteoporosis, hip
fractures in the elderly, dental fluorosis, and weakening of the human
immunity system.
This tends to indicate that with fluoride we should be looking, not
only at what it does to the teeth, but at its potential for affecting
the entire body.

ROBERT Bain rightly maintains that there is no excuse for calling any
bacterium a virus, as they are quite distinct (March 24).
Reporters who frequently commit this error, eg in recent accounts of
illnesses caused by Esch. coli and by meningococci, could easily conceal
their lack of knowledge by using the word ''microbe''. This covers
infecting agents such as bacterium, virus, fungus, and protozoon.
The term ''bug'', although incorrect when applied to a microbe, may be
popularly understood as indicating a dastardly invisible invader -- fair
enough.

THE dispute over what is allowable in Scottish law in order to mount
an appeal is not one which would necessarily arise in England (March
25). For centuries, from Anglo-Saxon times until the present day, the
principle of justice in England has been justice.
For example, Lord Denman, the Chief Justice, stated in London in 1841
that ''the statute cannot affect our right to see justice executed''.
Lord Denning and other lord justices expanded this concept. Lord
Denning ruled that ''it is beyond doubt that, if a tribunal fails to
observe the rules of justice . . . its decision is a nullity and void''.
English justice has developed the principle that unless Parliament
specifically stated in a particular statute that the rules of justice
must be excluded from it, then the rules of justice must be followed.
Justice in England is not in this way following a sort of ''soft''
option. It is one of realisation that no statute can be drafted in any
language in such a way as to be able to cater for all eventualities.
The present problem with appeals in Scotland is partly historical. In
England, the objective is justice. In Scotland, it is to rubber-stamp
any statute without thinking beyond the literal wording at what
Parliament intended, and without consideration of the interests of
justice.
In England, there is an acceptance that courts are fallible and that
higher courts must correct any mistakes in the interests of justice. In
Scotland, this does not always seem to occur.
Scotland's rigid educational system may sometimes encourage such
unthinking, uncritical, or blind obedience to the system rather than
fairness or justice to the individual.
No change in the appeal law is required in Scotland other than the
belated appreciation by judges in Scotland of the paramountcy of justice
at all times. Where justice has not been done, or does not seem to have
been done, the appeal must be heard.

While we always welcome constructive criticism, we wish to point out
that our aim at The Big Blue is not to be a ''restaurant'', but a great
bar which also serves food during the day and early evening. We serve a
limited menu of starters, pastas, meat, fish, and desserts at prices
which, dare we say it, are a lot better than ''reasonable''.
If Margaret Hughes would like to review one of our restaurants she is
very welcome to visit us at La Parmigiana (Great Western Road) and

From Geordie Bad Lad to New Man in an Armani suit, Jimmy Nail shrugged
off chauvinism and subservience, emerging with native wit intact, to
show his new face to the world.
THEY call it in the business simply the Crock, an affectionate,
slightly ironical short form for Jimmy Nail's pot of gold. Take heart if
you were one of the thousands of fans who failed to get tickets for the
Crocodile Shoes tour which visits Edinburgh and Glasgow this week. A
further mid-summer tour is now booking and it's arenas this time around
instead of mere concert halls.
It's been onwards and upwards for Jimmy Nail since he first hit our
screens a decade ago in Auf Wiedersehen Pet, now showing in a timely
repeat on Channel 4 and as fresh as the day it was born.
There was Dennis the sensible one, Neville the worrier. And then there
was Oz. Oz was the chauvinist, the reincarnated Likely Lad, the
archetypal unreconstructed Geordie, the man whose definition of caring
about the wife was not sending any of his wages back from Germany in
case it interfered with her benefits.
''First things first, eh pet?'' as he greets the nightie-clad Marjorie
in the bedroom on his return from Dusseldorf.
''Get the kettle on. Make us a cup of tea.''
Oz was the one always on to some scam, the emotional blockhead, the
foot-in-mouth merchant, winding himself up for a rant with the familiar
cry: ''Nooowwww haaaang on a minute Dennis . . .''
With the benefit of hindsight, Nail can be seen now to have seized on
the superb Clement/La Frenais script like a dog with a bone. In his
hands, Oz became a cult hero, not bad for a man who had never acted
before and only went to the audition on his wife's instigation.
Clement and La Frenais had pretty much bowed out by the time the
second series of Auf Wiedersehen appeared and the scripts were the
poorer for it. Still, in one episode at least, there was an inkling of
what Oz and the man who made him flesh might become.
Permitted a brief romantic interlude with an Older and More
Experienced Woman, Oz demonstrated a taciturn and unembarrassed
wonderment that boded well for the future. That was the episode in which
Nail, long involved in the bands in the North-east and a veteran of the
clubs, sang for the first time on the box. It was a country song, of
surprising sweetness, sung in a pub and prompting Bomber's now famous
remark: ''How can someone so ugly make such a nice noise?''
The ugly tag has both benefited and bedevilled Nail. He was four stone
heavier when he arrived on screen with a crooked nose and a broken tooth
that branded him a bruiser. And life seemed to be conveniently
dovetailing into art when the press discovered that the real-life Oz had
served his own term out at one of Her Majesty's prisons.
It's a murky netherworld, the one of tabloid show-biz stories, one
that yearns to slash away at a stroke the tiresome boundary that exists
between a man and the part that he plays. With Nail it looked like it
might have got what it wanted.
So Nail took his place as the official Bad Boy of the small screen,
taking over the mantle from Dirty Den who had gone on to other things.
Except suddenly he wasn't Oz any longer, he was Spender, the square-peg
detective, all Tyneside film noir and Armani suits and sounding
suspiciously beneath the tough-guy exterior like a New Man in the
making.
When the BBC dithered over the second series of Spender, Nail made up
their mind for them by doing the thing himself through his newly formed
Big Boy Productions, taking his first leap into screenwriting and
thereby damning himself in the eyes of those for whom the uppity Geordie
has become a control freak.
The criticism, which continues to dog Nail, is a strange one,
particularly coming, as it often does, from people whose business is to
write about television.
For they must know what everyone in the business of writing knows,
that the whole process of television drama has changed almost beyond
recognition in the past decade, and that these days the best, sometimes
the only chance of getting your dream on screen is by forming your own
production company and doing it yourself, something more and more people
are doing.
Perhaps it didn't help either that Nail came from a hard-pressed
outpost where an attitude of grateful subservience, or at least bleating
Oz-like belligerence, was thought to be more the order of the day, a
peculiar place regarded as somehow out of step with the rest of the
country, whose only claims to fame were its football team and a beer
that wits called ''milk of amnesia''.
But worse was to come. For tucked up Nail's sleeve was an idea he'd
first sketched out on a scrap of paper on the set of Auf Wiedersehen
Pet, the story of a Geordie country star who tries for the big time and
fails.
As anyone not living in an attic without access to television or
newspapers now knows, Nail produced, wrote and starred in Crocodile
Shoes. He also wrote or co-wrote seven of the 10 songs on the album
including Calling out Your Name with its early Beatles feel, the tender
ballad Between a Woman and a Man, and Only One Heart which in a fair
world would become a country classic.
He co-produced the album too, no insignificant credit since it's an
exercise in the art. And of course he sings all the songs with the voice
of a mournful angel.
Another criticism of Nail, also mysterious, is that he always plays
himself, as if this in some way separates him from the rest of his
profession. But all actors, aside from character actors, play
themselves.
It was a simple piece, Crocodile Shoes, but not simplistic. Direct
might be a better word. ''Broad brush strokes,'' was Nail's summing up
of the pieces. Broad brush strokes. An art in itself. And possibly the
secret of successful popular culture.
For, so far, his three distinctively Geordie screen personas have
brought him from unreconstructed navvy, through savvy detective to the
Jed of Crocodile Shoes.
Before Nail, Newcastle meant Get Carter, a grey, old-fashioned little
place, frozen in time and forever 25 years out of date, where the
natives were still suitably in awe of the worldly-wise cockney.
Thankfully Nail has changed all that, reversed the whole process,
first with Spender and now latterly with Jed, a man outwardly ingenuous
with a native wit, in the fullest sense of the word, more than enough to
prove himself the smarter man in the long run than city-slicker Ade.
Jimmy Nail says that he likes to ''fly the flag'' for his native
North-east. He likes to remind people, he says, that Newcastle is there.
And that he has unquestionably done.
* Jimmy Nail appears at the Playhouse, Edinburgh, tonight and the
Glasgow Royal Concert Hall tomorrow.
* Carol Clewlow is the author of four novels. She is currently
adapting her latest, One For the Money (Michael Joseph), for the stage
and will be bringing it to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August.

While Hollywood dresses up history to suit the script, French director
Patrice Chereau, who will be involved in this year's Edinburgh Festival,
shows there is no need to rewrite the past, reports William Russell.
HOLLYWOOD tends to treat the historical costume drama as an excuse for
a romp -- Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, Kevin Costner's all-American
tour of the greenwood, and the 'Charlie Sheen High School Football Team
drink lager' Three Musketeers are classic examples. But even if history
does not repeat itself, there are lessons to be learned from the past.
Alan Bennett's script for The Madness of King George finds its
relevance for today in the plight of the king's descendants, notably
Prince Charles, who has been waiting in the wings trying to find
something to do for just as long as the Prince of Wales who eventually
became George IV. Bennett also shows how divorced from reality royals,
constantly kowtowed to, can become. Think of what they showed the Queen
in Soweto the other day, for example. She saw Africa, she visited
Soweto, but she did not see life as it is lived there.
Gillian Armstrong has given Louisa May Alcott's Little Women
contemporary relevance by subtly shifting the preoccupations of Meg, Jo
Beth and Amy -- particularly Jo -- and altering Marmee's messages to her
girls. Marmee saw their futures as that of a partner to a good man. Ms
Armstrong's Marmee sees them fighting the good fight as themselves, not
as adjuncts to men.
It will be interesting to see how Rob Roy turns out. The film could
just be a rainwashed romp in the heather by a collection of improbable
kilted Scots played by Hollywood stars with dicey accents. But it might
have something to say about the nature of the Scottish rebel, and since
it has a script by Alan Sharp one is entitled to think it will meet
those expectations. We shall see on May 14 when it gets its British
premiere in Edinburgh. Similarly, we await with baited breath Mel
Gibson's Wallace in Brave Heart to see what he has done to our national
hero.
A costume drama that is not just an excuse to swash and buckle can be
made. One of the best examples of how to do it which we saw this year
was La Reine Margot. Like Hytner, French director Patrice Chereau made
his name as a director of plays and opera, including a televised Ring
Cycle at Bayreuth.
During this year's Edinburgh Festival, he directs and appears in the
Odeon-Theatre de L'Europe production of Bernard-Marie Koltes Dans la
Solitude des Champs de Coton. His co-star is Pascal Greggory, who
starred in La Reine Margot.
Chereau chose Alexander Dumas's novel about the Massacre of St
Bartholomew's Eve for his subject. While the film fulfilled all the
requirements of the traditional costume epic, he also managed to find
contemporary relevance from one of the more bloodstained episode's in
French history.
In 1572 France was divided between Catholics and Protestants. The
latter had come to Paris for the wedding of the Huguenot King Henri of
Navarre to Marguerite of Valois, sister of King Henri III, and daughter
of Catherine de Medici, the Queen Mother, who effectively ruled the
country. On St Bartholomew's Eve, six days after the wedding intended to
heal the divisions, Catherine persuaded the King to order that the
Huguenots be massacred.
''The film is speaking about intolerance, fanaticism, religion and
war,'' Chereau said. ''It was important to tell this story. I started
off thinking about the situation with Khomeni in Iran, and then I had to
go on, not only to tell the love story between Marguerite and the young
nobleman, Le Mole, but to explain the whole massacre, to go into the
wider situation in France. If I did their love story I had to do that as
well.
''Today we have Bosnia and Yugoslavia where you discover that same
sort of horror taking place. You realise this kind of violence inspired
by intolerance can still happen.'' Northern Ireland was another example,
but the situation there has changed since he made his decisions about
what was relevant.
Chereau also wanted to avoid the usual trap of costume films, which is
to focus on lavish sets and costumes. Not that La Reine Margot looks
shabby, but the way he approached photographing the story was important.
He concentrated on the players rather than the scenery.
''I asked myself every day on the set -- 'If this was a contemporary
film how would I shoot that incident?','' he said. ''I tried to make it
look as if it were all happening today. That was partly so the story
could move faster than a normal historical film, but also because I
wanted, at all costs, to avoid the trap of feeling as if one were
leafing through a beautiful picture album.''
Oddly, the film, for which Virna Lisi won the best actress prize at
Cannes last year, is not included in the nominations for the best
foreign film at this year's Oscars. The Oscar rules are arcane and it
all has something to do with the production links with television, but
the omission is unfortunate.
Chereau said he had wanted an Italian actress prepared to take on a
character role, but although he saw all the actresses available between
50 and 60 years of age, Lisi was the only one who accepted the need to
show herself as old, sometimes not pretty, to be fatter, and to play the
sadness and bitterness and loneliness of the character. ''She was the
only one to have the courage to do that,'' he added. ''It was like a
contract between us. She gave me her broken face with great courage and
after that point it was easy to work with her.''
The gamble paid off, as did the gamble of making a historical film.
Lisi's Catherine de Medici proved a revelation to international
audiences who probably only remembered her in her glamour girl days --
her best-known Hollywood film role was opposite Jack Lemon in How to
Murder Your Wife. Historical films by any standards are gambles.
Cromwell Productions gambled with Culloden in Chasing the Deer, and did
not quite succeed. But, like the Spider Man, they are appropriately
trying again and are about to start filming The Bruce.

VICTIM among other things to Thatcherite philistinism and
tight-fistedness, the British Library building at St Pancras was
potentially the most ambitious public building in Britain this century.
It is now an indecent administrative joke. Nearly #500,000 has been
spent yet openings planned for 1991, 1993, and 1996 have all been
abandonded on account of unanticipated problems of funding, design, and
construction.
Over in Paris, making the joke crueller, President Francois Mitterrand
is inaugurating the recently completed building of his new national
library, the Bibliotheque Nationale de France, or BNF for short. The
#900m project was designed by 42-year-old architect Dominique Perrault
in a run-down industrial district in the east of Paris now undergoing
massive redevelopment.
Building the largest of the ambitious architectural schemes which the
President has bestowed on Paris during his 14 years in power has taken a
mere seven years. Right-wing propaganda has turned into a tribute of the
library, to the French leader's vainglory. But however much his personal
vanity may have been flattered, the real reason for the existence of the
BNF is quite pedestrian -- the desperate and chronic overcrowding of the
existing Bibliotheque Nationale built in 1720 in the centre of Paris.
Cutting the ribbon on the new library will have been one of President
Mitterrand's last and presumably most satisfying public gestures before
he leaves office in May. Moving in between 10 and 12 million books from
the Bibliotheque Nationale, not to mention 350,000 magazines, one
million records and cassettes, one million microfilms, and 100,000
electronically stored books is expected to take 18 months. The BNF,
which already has a staff of 1900 and an annual budget of around #150m,
will open to the public in two years' time.
The new library covers a rectangular area of some 17 acres and is
built around a central garden planted with 250 trees. It accommodates
both a 1650-seat public reading room and a 2000-seater hall for use by
researchers. At each corner of the rectangle stands a 80m high tower,
L-shaped in section, like a half-open book, to house offices and a total
of 250 miles of shelves for volumes which will be sought out and carried
to readers by an elaborate hi-tech system.
Strong centralised government in Paris has succeeded while St Pancras
has degenerated into fiasco. The BNF nevertheless survived a barrage of
fiercely hostile and often politically motivated criticism.

A witty new book serves to hold open a door upon a world, a way of
life, a sport in decline. JULIA LANGDON meets a woman who went to the
dogs.
THE dogs, according to Laura Thompson and you can see her point, is a
singular noun. The dogs was -- therefore -- born on July 24, 1926, in
the year of the General Strike, at an evening meeting in Manchester
attended by 1700 men. A week later 16,000 people were there and a year
after that attendances at licensed tracks throughout the land were over
five and a half million. By 1928 it was over 13 million and by 1945 it
was over 50 million.
Listen to Laura Thompson: ''On the night of the Greyhound Derby at
White City stadium in 1946, there were 44 other race meetings taking
place around Britain. On that night, nearly 2500 dogs cracked out their
half-minute runs; the traps whiplashed open nearly 400 times; more than
250,000 people staked more than #1m in bets; more than 50,000 of those
people bonded together in a sensual moment which peaked and evanesced
even as Monday's News crossed the winning line in the fastest Derby that
had yet been run; and, after six years of blackouts, of shadowless
afternoon meetings, the lights streamed through the teeming oval arena
of White City stadium, people saw and felt the play of brilliance upon
night, saw and felt that they were gloriously, gaudily, grittily alive
-- on that night, that early summer night in 1946, greyhound racing was
at its height, it was a colossus of a sport.''
As you can tell from that, Laura Thompson knows about the dogs. She
writes about dog days -- which means something different to her from the
long hot days of summer -- and dog talk and dog people and dog men. Her
father is a dog person, of an age with the sport, they grew up together.
She is not a dog person, but she was a dog child, an owner at the age of
nine, a spectator, a member of a family where the dogs matters.
She has written a wonderfully witty and lyrical history of the dogs,
to some extent an autobiography, which tells you far more than you ever
thought you might want to know about the subject which proves,
unexpectedly, to be extraordinarily interesting.
The book serves to hold open a door upon a world, a culture, a way of
life, a group of people, a sport in decline. It is immensely revealing:
one recognises the characters she describes; one understands the
passions but, for the outsider, it is still oddly ephemeral. It is as if
one can peek, but not touch; oh yes, one can go to a meeting, of course,
but it is almost as if unless one was born a dog person, has spent a
lifetime with the dogs, going to the kennels on Sundays, reading The
Greyhound Life every day, going to the dogs, one will be forever
excluded from a true understanding.
And now that the heyday is over, now there are supermarkets where once
there were dog tracks, now that there are only 37 registered tracks
compared to the 77 in 1945, attendances down to four million and only
8000 bothering to turn out for the Derby final, now that White City has
closed and BBC offices now stand upon its site -- its almost-sacred site
to any real dog person -- it would be impossible now for any newcomer
really to comprehend what it used to mean to be a dog person.
Dog people know. There are a great many of them left, among the
remaining dog people, in Scotland: there are a lot of independent tracks
in Scotland; there is a Scottish Derby; the sport should continue to
thrive while there is still an interested clientele.
Laura Thompson does not believe that tracks should be bailed out if
they get into financial trouble because they are not viable, but she
does think that the sport is unfairly treated financially compared to
horse-racing.
There is a wonderful word which crops up a great deal in her book: the
word ''lary''. A footnote from the author explains that its dictionary
definition says that it is of Australian provenance, but she regards it
as a Cockney conflation of leery, wary, and garish. ''It is a
millionaire market trader, it is a bright gold Rolls Royce, it is a
country mansion in Wanstead, it is the good-humoured smile and
suspicious eyes of a successful bookmaker,'' she writes. She also
provides an illustration.
An acquaintance of her father who made some money from selling food
out of the back of a van, started flashing it around in rings and
clothes, red polo-necks, and declamatory suits. ''He used to be a silly
old sod,'' said my father. ''Now he's a silly lary old sod.''
When I met Laura Thompson she seemed the antithesis of lary, or indeed
of anything as vulgar as the redolence carried by the very phrase ''the
dogs''. She is tall and elegant, a fashionable 30-year-old, living in a
basement flat in London's Holland Park which is furnished -- or, rather,
not furnished in what designers would call a minimalist style; that is
to say there is almost nothing in it. She apologises for this; she was
about to move, but then didn't.
She gives the impression that there are more important things: like
the computer which has pride of place in the middle of the space in
front of the window, in the best light. She went to a ballet school and
was going to be a dancer until she grew too tall; she read English at
Oxford instead, did some directing of Shakespeare -- to which she
aspires to return -- and is altogether astonished to find herself
working as a journalist and with a commission from Chatto to write a
novel. She does write very well.
Despite the somewhat languorous elegance, there is also a discernible
touch here, in her style and manner, of the raffish. After all, as she
points out when we talk about the dogs, it has in its time been very
fashionable for ''elegant slumming''.
One can imagine that she would not be out of place at the dogs, even
if she hadn't once been a dog child. She likes gambling, she likes the
glitz of an evening meeting, the bookmakers, the atmosphere.
''It's robust and it's real to me,'' she says. ''I like gamblers, I
almost admire them: they win and lose, they're rather brave actually. I
like being among people who are trying to use their brains very hard in
a rather purposeless way. You've got your racecard, you've got a chance;
you might get a bit of information. It's in your power. It's a sport and
a spectacle.''
She is also, however, pulled towards what she calls ''the other
side''; she means the dogs, the animals, the affection which grows up
between owner and dog, which has to be resisted, which everyone pretends
they do resist while caring greatly for them; the problem of housing
dogs whose racing days are over -- ''that pull,'' she says, ''is what
really attracts me to it.''
She has performed a great service for the sport: explaining and making
sense of it. There is only one thing which doesn't make sense: in my
Brewer's Dictionary ''to go to the dogs'' is defined as ''to go to ruin,
morally or materially.'' On the contrary, it all sounds like good
old-fashioned fun.

An unapologetic champion of deserted mothers in the US, Charlene
Dunbar tells Jennifer Cunningham what she would do with the CSA.
Despite cross-party backing and wide support among the population for
the principle, the Child Support Agency, two years' old on Wednesday,
has been a sad failure. The political agenda was to cut the social
security bill by ensuring that errant parents supported the children
they had deserted. The more challenging social agenda was to orchestrate
financial incentives and penalties to halt the increase in broken
families. Neither has been acheived.
In setting up the Child Support Agency, the Government's slogan was
''Parenthood is for Life.'' That is the sort of tough talking which
appeals to Charlene Dunbar. To her, men who refuse to support their
children are deadbeats. An American whose grandparents emigrated from
Italy, she combines a powerful sense of family with a no-nonsense
approach which has made her private agency for tracking down errant
fathers an embarrassing as well as irritating thorn in the side of the
Government's Child Enforcement Protection Agency.
Her crusade sprang from her own experience. Her husband left her and
their three children for another woman after 15 years of marriage. ''It
took me 12 years to get the money that was rightfully owed to my
children. It was not due to the fact that the Child Support Enforcement
Agency helped me. If anything, they did everything in their power to
hinder me from getting my support and my children from getting their
support.''
It was disgust with the enforcement agency combined with her success
in prodding them into action which prompted her to set up in business as
a collector of unpaid child support. It has proved profitable. She takes
a commission of 20% of the sum collected and made over $200,000 in her
first year. Although she has been criticised for making money out of
hungry children, she is unrepentant.
''In our country we have 11 million children living below poverty and
$38bn in uncollected child support. Privatisation like myself has helped
some of those children who have gone through the system and fallen
through the cracks. Most of the women who come to me are what I would
call the lost generation, whose child support arrears are up to the
$30,000 -- $40,000 range. I had one that had $300,000 outstanding for
four children. By the time they get to me, they have already tried
everything else.''
She is appalled at what she has learned of the workings of the CSA in
the UK. An unapologetic champion of deserted mothers to the point of
saying: ''Well, go ahead, that's one less deadbeat we have to deal
with,'' when told a few men have committed suicide as a result of the
demands of the CSA, she would like the formula tilted further towards
the needs of the first family.
''In America, the divorce decree is a valid document signed by a judge
and even if the child is 30 years' old and the father never paid, the
mother can go back and get her money. Child support in America is like
murder, there is no statute of limitation. Thank God for that because I
don't know what I would have done.
''I am amazed at the fathers' support groups which have started here.
They know how to work the system and they think that if they jump and
stamp their feet like a little child they are going to get their way.
Baloney. That child is the fruit of your loins and this is how you treat
it? Shame on you! In America you would be laughed at. I have dealt with
fathers' rights groups and there is nothing wrong with verbalising your
stand but when a child does not get its support, there is a no-win
situation. You are forcing that child and the custodial parent into a
lifestyle of poverty.''
As a second wife herself -- her new husband runs the financial side of
the business -- she has little time for complaints of second wives that
the requirements on their husbands to pay maintenance prevents them
having the family they would like.
''There are women who say they do not think it is right that someone
else should dictate how many children she can have as a second wife.
Maybe, but they have to consider that they are depriving an existing
child of what is rightfully his.
''As a society we need to make it clear that if you are going to have
a child, you had better be responsible for that child.''
The financial formula applied by the CSA has been much-criticised by
the second families' lobby, but Dunbar is also critical of a system
which allows costs such as housing and travel to be exempt from the
calculation. ''In the UK they have to admit it is not working and they
have a mess on their hands and then go back in and redesign the
programme, because these men are very smart and are now working the
system to their advantage.
''Here if a man buys a lavish big house the cost of that counts as
exempt earnings. In the states, the cost of child support is calculated
according to earnings whether it is 50/50 or 60/40 or whatever. Housing
is not considered. Whatever money is left is what he has for whatever
kind of house he can afford. Here they seem to be doing it backwards and
the cost of the house comes off first,'' she added.
''My heart is so heavy for the women I have met here. You need a
Charlene Dunbar, a woman to go out there to kick butt and say: 'Enough
is enough. Your system sucks.' All right, it is a system but it is not
working for the children and on behalf of the children. You need to get
these women what is rightfully owed to them and get them off welfare.
None of them wants to be on welfare, but it is the only resource they
have and without it they would be among the homeless.''
* Charlene Dunbar will appear on Scottish Women on Wednesday evening
at 10.30pm on Scottish TV.

Bruce McKain, Law Correspondent, reports how the English media gets
away with murder in respect of the contempt of court law while the legal
strait-jacket applied in Scotland has led to a state of utter confusion.
WHEN someone is arrested in Scotland on a serious charge such as
murder you won't find out much about the case by reading your newspaper
or watching the TV. Until the trial or guilty plea, the media in
Scotland is normally restricted to publishing a few brief paragraphs.
When an arrest is made south of the Border, the English media will
provide its readers, viewers, and listeners with a wealth of detail
about the case. Newspapers will publish pictures of the accused and the
unfortunate victim and background information, including the apparent
motive for the brutal killing, will be revealed.
The lurid reporting of the Frederick West case is the latest in a long
and dishonourable list stretching back to the Yorkshire Ripper where the
the rights of the accused have floated down the Swanee at an early
stage.
In Scotland, journalists who behaved in this way would almost
certainly be given the opportunity to write a colour piece about prison
conditions from the inside.
Yet in England, apart from forlorn pleas from defence lawyers and a
rap on the knuckles for a small local paper, the Attorney-General, who
is responsible for initiating contempt-of-court proceedings south of the
Border, has done nothing.
Of course, tackling a small local paper is one thing; taking on rich
and powerful national media giants is a rather more daunting
proposition.
This should not be dismissed as a matter of passing interest only for
the chattering classes. It is a question of balancing the public's right
to be informed about serious crime against the right to a fair trial.
The strange thing is that the law governing Scotland and England,
contained in the 1981 Contempt of Court Act, is exactly the same.
The Act says that any publication which creates a substantial risk of
serious prejudice to forthcoming legal proceedings is punishable by
imprisonment of up to two years.
To paraphrase the editor of Private Eye, if dozens of stories
published and broadcast in England since the Contempt Act was passed
have not seriously prejudiced countless trials, the law is a banana.
In Scotland, meanwhile, newspapers and broadcasting organisations have
been fined heavily for publishing articles that their English
counterparts would not even have bothered to check with their lawyers.
Of course, much more of Scottish pre-trial procedure takes place
behind closed doors, but that does not justify the same law being used
as a strait-jacket in Scotland while it is consistently flouted in
England.
At least in England the lawyer advising a tabloid newspaper or News at
Ten is in the happy position of being able to offer fairly simple
advice. ''You can get away with murder.'' In Scotland it will often
depend on which judge or defence counsel is involved because a complaint
of contempt in Scotland can be raised not just by the Crown but by the
trial judge and the defence. Two examples should suffice to illustrate
the understandable confusion of journalists in Scotland.
A bank manager denies stealing #163,000 in used notes over a period of
20 years. During his trial a newspaper headline states as a fact: ''Bank
Boss stole cash for 20 years.'' A sub-heading states, again as a fact:
''He grabbed old notes.'' The first paragraph of the story describes him
as ''crooked''. The judge takes the view that this did not create a
substantial risk of serious prejudice to a fair trial.
Two men are charged with robbing a filling station. Their trial begins
with the indictment, which provides details of how they are alleged to
have carried out the crime, being read to the jury. A reporter from an
evening newspaper leaves court immediately to send a story for the next
edition, based on the indictment. His story begins: ''Two men threatened
a petrol station attendant with a sawn-off shotgun before robbing her of
#10,000, a court heard yesterday.'' Scottish judges apparently take the
view that the use of the words ''a court heard'' are not justified
because, although the charge has been read to the jury, no evidence has
yet been led. Amazingly, the legal consensus seems to be that a report
in such terms may prejudice a trial.
The net result is that Scottish journalists and the lawyers who advise
them do not know whether they are coming or going. They are not looking
for an English-style licence to commit contempt, just some commonsense
and a realistic rather than legalistic assessment of the risk of
prejudice in any given case.
The situation has now become even more confusing in the light of an
opinion issued by our leading judge, Lord Hope, in which the publishers
and editor of the Evening Times newspaper were fined a total of #2750.
The paper had published an entirely accurate story, along with a
picture, warning the public that a man called Daniel Boyle, who was
facing an armed robbery charge, had escaped from custody and might be
dangerous.
The Daily Record had also published a story, wrongly describing Boyle
as a killer, but the court decided that the Record had not committed
contempt because it hadn't mentioned the fact that he was standing trial
in a few months' time.
Lord Hope said: ''In our opinion there was a risk, which cannot be
dismissed as a remote one, that the evidence of witnesses might be
affected.
''Witnesses to the armed robbery might well be alerted by the
reference in the article to the escape from custody of a person charged
with armed robbery who was said to be dangerous and have their attention
drawn to the photograph of the man to whom this description was
attached.'' Until now, it seemed to have been accepted that witnesses
would not be affected by pre-trial publicity.
Lord Justice-General Emslie stated in a drugs case in 1979: ''We are
not impressed by the supposed risk that the evidence of witnesses would
or might be tainted by anything they had read or heard (following the
arrest of the accused).
''The basis upon which any witness's evidence or opinion was given or
expressed was open to the test of cross-examination.''
In a fatal accident inquiry into a hill-walking death in 1991 it was
suggested that stories in The Herald and Evening Times amounted to
contempt because they might influence the evidence of witnesses.
The newspapers' lawyers argued strongly that this would be a dangerous
extension of the law because it was tantamount to saying that witnesses
would not fulfil their oath to tell the whole truth.
Sheriff William Palmer decided that it had not been established that
there had been any substantial risk of prejudice to the proceedings.
Now, confusion reigns, and for the reputation of the law on both sides
of the Border, it is high time it was sorted out.

Chris Holme meets the man whose team devised the triple-whammy
inoculation which finally brought the dreaded TB under control.
The captain of all these men of death that came against him to take
him away was the Consumption, for it was that that brought him down to
the grave -- John Bunyan
(Life and Death of Mr Badman)
EVERY would-be scientist or doctor dreams of discovering the cure for
the greatest disease afflicting mankind. Only a handful ever live to
achieve that ambition, and certainly not at a sufficiently early stage
to carve out distinguished new careers in other areas of medicine.
An Edinburgh team led by Sir John Crofton did precisely that 40 years
ago in discovering the first totally effective treatment for
tuberculosis. It is thanks to Crofton and his colleagues that the White
Plague is now largely just a memory in most of the Western World and not
the terrifying scourge it was only a generation ago.
Crofton will be presented tonight with the prestigious Edinburgh
Medal, a recognition of the team's achievement by his adopted city.
Fate has always looked kindly on him. Born in Dublin, his family
thought they might spend one Easter in the country. It was 1916. Sinn
Fein and British Army riflemen fought a battle on the rooftops of
Merrion Square and four bullets pierced young Crofton's nursery.
In the Second World War, as a newly qualified doctor, he joined the
RAMC, and in the retreat from France tended horrific injuries when
bombers attacked two troop trains and an ammunition train near Rennes.
As shells exploded around him, he applied splints and administered
morphine. He was back in Southampton before he got the chance to wash
the blood off.
He was appointed to the chair of tuberculosis and respiratory medicine
at Edinburgh in 1952. He arrived complete with plummy English accent.
One colleague advised him to keep his mouth shut for three months.
The work carried out in Edinburgh was the culmination of a huge
pan-European effort to eliminate TB, starting with Robert Koch's
isolation of the bacillus in 1882.
Researchers worked under enormous stress and at great personal risk of
catching TB. The first antibiotic wonder drugs were developed from a
chemical dye by Gerhard Domagk.
In America, the discovery of streptomycin was taken forward by a
Glasgow-born vet, William Feldman, at the Mayo Clinic. He had been
deeply moved by the toll taken by TB in the tenements of his home city
and he devoted his life to the study of tuberculosis in animals.
0 By 1954, two other drugs had been discovered: isoniazid, based on
Domagk's research, and PAS, developed in Sweden. The trouble was that
no-one knew how to use them properly.
Administered individually they appeared to have some effect, but in
many cases the patient relapsed. The organism became resistant to one or
two drugs, rendering it more difficult to treat.
Crofton's solution was simple: hit the bug with all three drugs at the
same time. Kill it once, kill it twice, and then kill it when it was
dead just to be sure.
Scotland and Portugal were the only countries where the incidence of
TB was rising. In Edinburgh there were 600 TB beds and a waiting-list of
400. It was, by far, the the most feared disease. The pulmonary version
(consumption) killed one in two. Children with TB meningitis had
virtually no chance.
Crofton assembled a brilliant team of physicians: Norman Horne, Jimmy
Williamson, Ian Grant, and Ian Ross. The key to success lay with two
bacteriologists, Sheila Stewart and Archie Wallace.
They monitored each patient meticulously and discovered that where
combination chemotherapy was rigorously adhered to, there was a 100%
cure. Within a year the waiting-list had disappeared.
Their results were so dramatic that no-one believed them, except two
bacteriologists at the Pasteur Institute. With their help the Edinburgh
system gained acceptance by the back door: it was used as the standard
protocol for the first international co-operative trial of any
treatment.
Such was their success that the Edinburgh team had made themselves
largely redundant. They had dreamt of controlling TB within 20 years but
managed it within six.
In 1960 Crofton warned prophetically of the dangers if international
action was not put in place. The Edinburgh cure, the first great triumph
of the NHS, was accepted as the best form of prevention. It became the
standard treatment in developed countries, but apathy, continued bad
treatment and lack of Western aid has led to TB's resurgence in the
Third World and even in the slums of North American cities.
Tonight's award, however, is for the wider role medicine can and
should should play in serving humanity, which fits well with Crofton's
definition of a doctor.
Outstanding science is only the starting point. Patients are people,
not cases. Unusually among his colleagues, Crofton always made a point
of standing up to greet a new patient and introducing himself by name.
He also detested the misogyny of male-dominated medicine. Young
females had the highest rate of TB. For some reason, it seemed to claim
beautiful women. One Edinburgh consultant, delighted in touring the
wards telling them ''You are all rosy apples, rotten to the core.''
Crofton set a different tone, returning to his office at the end of a
gruelling day, using his professorial status to get jobs for the girls
who, once cured, still carried the consumptive stigma.
He accumulated the usual clutter of medical titles: dean of faculty,
president of the Royal College of Physicians, and a knighthood.
But the World Health Organisation's leading guru on TB is equally at
home in Pilton supporting the Barry Grub project or fighting for funding
for food co-operatives in Easterhouse.
Giving up has never been on his agenda. Nor is retirement. He is only
83 but still working with the enthusiasm of a 17-year-old. The brightest
spark at meetings of Lothian Health Challenge will be Crofton. He also
has the political awareness, clout, and personal charm to make things
work.
At home he is up with the lark and writing: reports on multiple
deprivation, a simple guide on TB prevention for health workers around
the world, or a British Council book on smoking with the Oxford cancer
epidemiologist Sir Richard Doll. Together they helped set up Action on
Smoking and Health (ASH).
Doll and Crofton were young radicals at St Thomas's in London at the
start of the National Health Service. Few have done more to shape its
development and post-war medicine.
Contacted by The Herald in New South Wales, Doll said: ''Crofton was
an extremely good, research-minded young physician. There weren't many
of them about in those days. He's very straightforward, uncorruptible
and completely honest in everything he does.''
Irish-born and English-educated, Crofton should be Scotland's pride.
He's probably the best physician we have ever had.

There is an open invitation to celebrate Jerusalem's 3000th
anniversary, but not everyone is in party mood, as Gavin Bell reports
IN A few months, Ehud Olmert will host a birthday party of monumental
proportions. It will last for 16 months, cost around #7m, and arouse the
kind of conflicting emotions that have sparked holy wars since the days
of Herod.
The occasion is the 3000th anniversary of Jerusalem as the capital of
the Jewish people. As mayor of the city, Mr Olmert has announced plans
to celebrate the milestone in its turbulent history with a series of
exhibitions and cultural events. He anticipates that Muslims will join
in the festivities in a spirit of solidarity and mutual understanding.
It seems a forlorn hope. Arabs have denounced the event as a further
attempt by Israel to deny their claims to east Jerusalem as the capital
of a Palestinian state; and orthodox Jewish leaders have challenged the
anniversary date as decades premature. (The city became the Jewish
capital after it was captured in about 1000BC by David, the founder of
the joint kingdom of Israel and Judah.)
Mr Olmert is undismayed by political or mathematical objections.
During a visit to Glasgow to brief Jewish leaders on his plans, he
explained why.
''This is a historical event,'' he says. ''How many cities do we have
that can celebrate 3000 years of continuous history, playing a major
role in the life of the universe, of being at the centre of everything
important that has happened in our civilisation? I think it's a good
reason to celebrate.''
He acknowledges that Jerusalem is a sacred symbol and inspiration for
Christianity and Islam, as well as for Judaism, and insists that the
festivities will be of a cultural rather than a political nature. ''The
Muslim and Christian faiths will certainly be invited to participate. We
think Jerusalem never was and never should be a political capital of
other people but the Jewish people. But we don't deny that there were
important Muslim and Christian chapters in its history, and I think they
must be expressed and reflected in the celebrations.''
In political terms, however, it may be fortuitous for Mr Olmert that
the anniversary has been decreed to fall during his term of office. As
mayor of the Israeli capital, a member of the Knesset for more than 20
years, and formerly a senior member of Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
Government, he wields considerable influence in Israeli politics. If
Likud is returned to power in elections next year, as opinion polls
suggest, Mr Olmert's stature will grow even more. A simultaneous period
in the limelight as host of Jerusalem's Jewish birthday bash will do his
political fortunes no harm.
During Mr Shamir's administration, Mr Olmert was a close ally of the
Prime Minister. As Minister without Portfolio and subsequently Minister
of Health, he routinely made statements viewed as reflecting Government
policy on a wide range of issues. A news magazine in Jerusalem recently
identified the 49-year-old former lawyer as one of the ambitious ''young
pretenders'' to the Likud leadership, and a possible future candidate
for Prime Minister.
Mr Olmert is aware of the power and possibilities of his municipal
post, which he captured from Teddy Kollek in November, 1993, and has no
intention of relinquishing it for a Cabinet position.
''By every objective analysis, being mayor of Jerusalem is more
important and interesting than any governmental job other than Prime
Minister. It is a very powerful position, it is a high-profile position,
it keeps you in the centre of all political activities, and it's a very
exciting job. So why do I have to trade it in for something less?''
He quotes one of the last British governor-generals of Jerusalem who,
when asked what promotion he expected after leaving the Middle East,
replied: ''There is no promotion after Jerusalem.''
Mr Olmert enjoys a close relationship with the present Likud leader,
Benjamin Netanyahu, and will be campaigning on his behalf in the
elections due in November next year.
In the meantime, he regards himself as a watchdog on the coalition
Government of the Labour leader, Yitzhak Rabin, whose majority of six in
the 120-seat Knesset is continually under threat. ''I am in a position
where I have to know everything, and I have to be a partner to all the
strategies and the security planning, as well as the building and the
expansion of the entire area. And then, of course, I can do a lot myself
by sponsoring building in different parts of the city.''
The latter point is crucial to Mr Olmert's avowed aim to ensure
Jerusalem remains the undivided capital of both the Jewish people and
the state of Israel. The city's population is predominantly Jewish, as
it was when Israeli forces captured Arab east Jerusalem in 1967, but in
the past two years a building programme has seen Jews outnumber Arabs in
east Jerusalem for the first time.
Mr Olmert does not like the term ''settlement'' applied to Jerusalem.
''Settlement is a code-word for Jewish expansionism, for pushing the
Arabs out in the West Bank. Here we are talking about a city, and a
housing programme in the middle of it which is typical and commonplace,
so there are no settlements inside Jerusalem.
''I don't put restrictions on anybody. If an Arab comes to me and says
he has bought a property in west Jerusalem and he wants to build his
home there, I'd be more than glad to allow him to do so. It is true,
however, that more Jews want to live on the east side than Arabs on the
west side, and therefore there is this perception of Jewish settlement.
But it should not be mistaken for discrimination.''
Having said that, Mr Olmert does not deny that he wants Jews to
''increase their presence'' in Jerusalem. His twin-track strategy is to
diminish the hostility of Arab residents by improving their social
services, education, and quality of life. ''I don't think they have to
pay me back by giving up their political aspirations. However, I think
that if we do all this we will lower the bitterness, we will reduce the
emotional intensity, and that will allow us to deal with our differences
in a more friendly manner.''
What the Jewish state is resolved not to do is to consider Yasser
Arafat's claims to east Jerusalem as a Palestinian capital. Mr Olmert
reaffirms the Israeli consensus on historical grounds: ''I give you a
challenge. Go to all the libraries of the world and find me a book that
was written in the year 900 which even mentions the term Palestinians.
This city never was, for one second, a capital of any Arab or Muslim
entity. The Muslims controlled Jerusalem for 12 centuries. Never for one
second did they make it into a capital. On the contrary, for ideological
reasons they refused to do so. So what historical rights does Arafat
claim?
''Secondly, I don't think it is a prescription for peace. Where did
you make peace by splitting cities and building walls? Don't you break
walls when you make peace? Don't you unite cities when you make peace?''
On broader issues, Mr Olmert says there is frustration in Israel over
the faltering peace process, and in particular with Mr Arafat. ''There
is a feeling that we are seeing Arafat as he always was, unreliable, and
that perhaps we made a mistake. The problem is that nobody knows where
they stand with him. He has never ceased to be a gang leader, rather
than a national leader. You're talking about a different culture,
another set of values. For example, he doesn't understand what people
mean when they talk to him about an organised economy. It will take
generations before this changes, and until it does there are going to be
enormous difficulties.''
Under a Likud Government in Israel, however, Mr Arafat would find that
his ''margin for manoeuvre'' had changed. Likud would continue the
negotiations on Palestinian autonomy, but it would have more freedom
than the Labour Party to take decisions unhampered by ''emotional
commitments''.
Meanwhile, Mr Olmert is content to press ahead with plans for his
municipal birthday party. He is aware that it is unlikely to precipitate
another Intifada, as long as Palestinian aspirations are focused on Gaza
and the West Bank. But nor is it likely to generate much enthusiasm
among the Arabs who are becoming a minority in their own quarter of
Jerusalem.

GRAEME SMITH DISCOVERS YOU MAY NEED A COMPASS TO FIND ANY AGREED
DIRECTION IN GRAMPIAN'S HOUSING PLANS.
THE developers behind a proposed #500m settlement to the south-west of
Aberdeen are confident it will still go ahead, despite the fact Grampian
Region's councillors have consigned the plan to the dustbin.
The idea of a new settlement to cope with a large share of the 17,000
houses required to be built in the Aberdeen area by 2006 was seen by
council officials as the most sensible way forward. It was also seen as
the best way forward by independent consultants they called in.
However, at the end of the day the councillors rejected it.
The Labour group had been firmly for the idea of a settlement to the
south west. The Liberal Democrats were also in favour of a new
settlement, but to the north. The Scottish Nationalists were in favour
of total dispersal -- adding new housing developments to existing
communities.
After major consultation exercises and a two-and-a-half year delay,
Grampian's Structure Plan has now been submitted to Scottish Secretary
Ian Lang for his approval. It proposes that the required housing
allocations be dispersed.
Stonehaven, for example, will receive 800 new houses in the next 11
years, Kingswells 900, Old Machar/Bridge of Don 300, Newtonhill 100, and
the Inverurie area 1300.
No compromise settlement site could be agreed and the Liberal
Democrats remain firmly convinced that, although a settlement may have
been the best option, to build it at Banchory Devenick -- the
developers' choice in the south west -- would have created more problems
than it solved.
However, the Stewart Milne Group who are behind the Banchory Devenick
scheme have not given up. It has appealed to the Scottish Secretary
against rejection of its planning application and now Aberdeen District
Council has added its weight to the campaign.
A delegation from the council has just asked Mr Lang to resurrect the
plan saying there was no technical justification for the Regional
Council's decision.
Mr Lang will consider the appeal at the same time as he considers the
Structure Plan. The Stewart Milne Group hope that, because of the unique
circumstances of the case, he will hold the first ''examination in
public'' for many years and decide to give them the go-ahead.
It is nearly nine years since Grampian Regional Council first
suggested that the area to the south west of the city was the best place
for any settlement.
In 1992, the draft Structure Plan appeared including such a settlement
and developers were invited to come back with more detailed proposals.
Their subsequent plans were investigated by Grampian's officials and
independent consultants. Both groups recommended the best option was a
south west settlement with a business park.
The director of economic development and planning, Dr Howard Fisher,
said the option had particular benefits:
* It was the best option in terms of costs to the public sector;
* It made the best use of existing infrastructure such as roads,
schools, water, and sewerage;
* It included a business park which was required by the Region;
* The Region would benefit from the provision of affordable housing
and community and sports facilities;
* There would be significant contributions from the developers towards
infrastructure and facilities;
* It would provide for future development in a marketable location;
* It lay beyond the Green Belt.
However, in July 1993, the members of Green Wedge, a small but highly
articulate and powerful opposition group of residents in the Banchory
Devenick area, were jubilant when the professionals' views were rejected
by the politicians who told their officials, following the closest
possible vote, to look at other sites.
In November 1993, Green Wedge had further cause to celebrate when the
south west settlement option was again proposed and again defeated.
After considering 26 potential new sites, the officials told the
elected members that there was no acceptable alternative to Banchory
Devenick and if that were not accepted then the ''clearly less
beneficial'' option was to spread the houses around existing
developments.
Once again, the professionals' advice was ignored and this time the
officials were told to find a site to the north west of the city.
Back they came in June last year and repeated their advice that the
only viable place for a new settlement was to the south west and if that
was not acceptable then dispersal was the only option.
Although it was inevitable that dispersal would cause widespread
objections from virtually every community where new houses were to be
built, that was their final choice.
In asking the Scottish Secretary to amend the Structure Plan to
include a new settlement, Aberdeen District Council say there was no
technical justification put forward by Grampian Region for the dispersal
option or for rejection of the new settlement concept earlier shown to
be viable.
Planning officer, Mr Bert Allen, said: ''Providing there is control
over the release of other Green Field sites, the City Council still
remains of the view that the balance of advantage lies in the inclusion
of a new settlement as part of Grampian's development strategy.
''The dispersal option does not avoid urban sprawl nor does it
encourage development within existing settlements. While the Regional
Council's strategy offers housing in a wide choice of locations, it is
less likely to provide for affordable housing or a choice of tenure.''
He added: ''Dispersal does not make the best use of existing
facilities such as roads, drainage, or school provision. Indeed, the
scale of development now being allocated locally may be inadequate to
secure sufficient contributions from developers to overcome shortfalls
on community and other forms of provision which may already exist.
''Some communities struggling to keep pace with the effects of recent
growth could well experience more pressure from additional
house-building which would place greater demands upon under-developed
services and facilities, and doubts about the chances of this option
being successful could lead to an increase in land speculation and put
pressure on the Green Belt.''
Mr Gordon Cochrane, executive director of the Stewart Milne Group,
said one of the major factors in favour of Banchory Devenick was that
the group had negotiated agreement with all the landowners that a large
proportion of the rise in land value if the development went ahead would
go towards providing infrastructure and community facilities.
He explained that the value of land multiplied many times when it
became development land and the landowners had agreed that, to enable
the go-ahead, their profits would be reduced, with the remainder going
to the infrastructure. They would still make handsome profits.
Other major benefits were that low-cost housing would be built on the
site and a high quality business park, providing the type of
accommodation which was badly required in the city area, would be
established.
He said the Regional Council had rejected the settlement option for no
sound financial or planning reasons.
The company, who planned to include three or four other national
developers to meet the required scale of development, had been
pleasantly surprised by the low level of objectors to the south west
settlement.
Mr Cochrane said: ''The dispersal policy was actually put to the
Region with a 'health warning' to their own officials and we have lodged
an appeal.
''We think there are special circumstances to this whole issue and a
unique opportunity could be missed. The decision eventually taken seemed
to fly in the face of all advice the council received from their own
officials, their own independent consultants, and the general view of
bodies such as the Chamber of Commerce, Grampian Enterprise, and the
Scottish Housebuilders' Association.
''Banchory Devenick is by far the best location for a new settlement.
We do feel the situation is so unique and the arguments so
overwhelmingly in favour of a new settlement, the Scottish Secretary
will review the whole housing section of the Structure Plan.''
Labour group leader on Grampian Region, Mr Bob Middleton, agrees.
He said: ''I was out that way recently and I thought 'what an
opportunity missed.' ''
He said that the council would have control over a new settlement and
they could build a community ''not just a lot of little boxes as in the
past''.
He continued: ''What is going to happen as a result of the Structure
Plan is there are going to be a whole series of inquiries, objections,
and folk getting in a stir because they don't want more houses beside
them. It is a recipe for disaster.''
However, Liberal Democrat leader on Grampian Region, Mrs Rhona Kemp,
thinks Banchory Devenick would have been a recipe for disaster.
She said: ''It does not have a good road network and is not close to a
rail line when we are trying to encourage people to use public
transport. The only spare capacity is in two schools which will be in
the new Aberdeen, Torry and Kincorth.''
She said the original consultants' report suggested a settlement to
the north west of city because it was the area of greatest growth and
still is.
''What we rejected was our officials' interpretation of the
consultants' report. Dispersal is better than Banchory Devenick because
it would have created more problems than it provided solutions.
''I really think when you are looking at new settlements you have to
take into account the traffic problems and you should not be increasing
them as Banchory Devenick would do.''

KEN SMITH looks forward to the 1995 Battle of Stirling.
IF electorates can be said to vote with their hearts or with their
heads, then Stirling may be the one council in Scotland where they vote
with their pockets.
In the national polls, the Conservatives in Scotland are, of course,
trailing dismally. But, if they are looking for a successful policy on
which to begin the fight back in Scotland, then Stirling may provide the
answer.
Since the Conservatives took control of Stirling District Council on a
cut of the cards after they and Labour took 10 seats each, they have
embarked on a campaign to deliver services at the cheapest cost to the
council taxpayer possible.
Last year the Conservative administration cut the council tax by #50
on average. This year it is a small, but symbolic, #3. The implicit
electioneering slogan is ''Forget about John Major and the party
nationally, vote for us and we will save you money.'' If the
Conservatives hold Stirling, or better still, take control without
resorting to the luck of the cards, then it will become the showcase for
Conservative-controlled councils of the future.
The Wandsworth or Westminster council of Scotland, in other words, but
without the controversy.
The new council borders remain the same as those of the present
district council. The only difference is that the internal ward
boundaries have been redrawn to make 22 seats instead of the old 20. Who
gains from the new boundaries?
Well, detailed research seems to show that on present form, Labour and
the Conservatives would take 11 each, and the first task of the new
chief executive would be to nip down to the newsagent's for a full deck
of Waddington's finest linen-backed to decide who wins control.
It isn't just about cutting the council tax, though. The Conservative
administration played some populist touches. Remember, outside Stirling
and Bridge of Allan, this is quite a rural area. Village officers were
introduced -- effectively street sweepers with little carts who
nonetheless were very much welcomed.
Litter wardens who can impose fines now patrol the streets of
Stirling. Council tenants with large arrears were pursued. The council's
women's committee was scrapped, and the shoppers' creche shut down --
both considered left-wing totems which had to go.
Conservative group leader Mr Keith Harding describes it as a platform
of ''improving core services, cutting tax and restoring civic pride.''
Now he wants to apply his philosophy to the regional services which will
come under the control of the new council.
''We are telling people 'Give us the chance to show what we can do' if
we take on the massive regional resources. We could guarantee to cut
taxes dramatically, but at the same time improve services.''
But can they win, and possibly end up as one of the few, if not the
only, Conservative-controlled council in Scotland? ''I honestly believe
we can do it,'' said Mr Harding. ''It's not going to be easy. There's a
lot of anti-Government feeling. We can't get away from that.
''But I believe that, if we can fight it on local issues, and if the
people judge us on our record, then we will be rewarded at the
ballot-box.'' This is not, of course the way that Mr Gillie Thompson,
the Labour group leader, sees it. He does not quite regard the council
tax cuts as the economic miracle portrayed by some.
He argues that the people in council houses for a start are worse off.
While the council tax fell, the rents were raised twice in the last
three years by an average of #1.50 a week -- far higher than the
#1-a-week tax saving.
Services have suffered, he maintained. And there were other victims.
He cited disabled people who are now charged for local fishing permits,
and the pensioners who now no longer have their gardens maintained when
the age limit was raised from 65 to 75.
''Between the national scene and what the Conservatives have done
locally, I don't think they will be saved. People here are absolutely
sick of being told how financially prudent the Conservative
administration has been. The simply truth is they are not.
''The #50 cut cost us #700,000 in Government grants, and they also
transferred #850,000 earmarked for capital expenditure to subsidise
services. That is #850,000 worth of work which is not being done, and
the people know it,'' he said.
Mr Thompson even claimed that many old people, who know their history,
were really upset when the Conservatives dropped Robert the Bruce from
the council logo and replaced him with ''silly matchstick men.''
Strange to think that Robert the Bruce may have the final say in a
Stirling battle in the 1990s.

DAVID ROSS surveys the rise of party politics in the North.
PARTY politics appear to be continuing their slow but steady progress
up the A9, judging by the nominations for election to the new
single-tier Highland Council. The Independent tradition in the
Highlands, however, will struggle on a while yet.
There will be 177 candidates involved in 63 contests on April 6, with
only nine being returned unopposed to the 72 member shadow authority.
This in itself is worthy of note given that as recently as 1990 half the
52 members of Highland Regional Council were returned without challenge.
Although for some time there have been small loose party groupings on
district and regional councils (Labour's nine on Highland Regional
Council being the biggest), they are largely unrecognisable as
counterparts to the central belt's factions.
However with the launch of the new council covering about one third of
Scotland, attempts to politicise local government in the North are
gaining momentum. SNP activists are making a bold attempt to establish
themselves as the largest group, fielding 35 candidates.
There had been hopes of putting up 36 candidates offering the
theoretical chance of overall control, but there was a hiccup in the
Glencoe and Nether Lochaber ward.
According to the SNP's Highland organiser, the big slate is crucially
important: ''We feel that the time has come for Highland councillors to
stop sitting on the fence of an 'Independent' ticket such has been said
of some Liberal Democrat candidates, and declare with which of the four
parties they associate.''
Labour, meanwhile, is determined to retain its status as the biggest
group but has only 18 official candidates plus one in Skye. Labour's
Highland regional chairman Dave Stewart is confident: ''We have suffered
because six of our sitting councillors either can't stand or are
retiring. They would have been experienced candidates. But we are very
pleased with the quality of our slate. We are not offering up paper
candidates as others appear to be. We also have the highest number of
women candidates ever with six.''
Labour are stressing that the prospect of a Labour government means it
is in the Highland voters' interests to return as many Labour
councillors as possible
The main battle ground between the two parties will be in and around
Inverness where there are SNP candidates in 18 of the 19 wards, opposed
by Labour in 10.
In Ross and Cromarty, with 13 seats, there are six SNP and five Labour
candidates. The estimable Margaret Paterson is unopposed for the SNP in
Dingwall.
Despite the high profile SNP and Labour campaigns in Lochaber this is
actually Liberal Democrat country. The entire council area embraces
three parliamentary seats all currently occupied by Liberal Democrats.
The three MPs: Robert Maclennan (Caithness and Sutherland); Charles
Kennedy (Ross, Cromarty and Skye) and Sir Russell Johnston, were in
Inverness recently to launch their party's campaign in support of 14
official candidates.
Sir Russell insisted that the party could have got candidates in all
72 seats, ''with a bit of persuasion and arm twisting'', but they
decided instead to place the emphasis on quality.
Robert Maclennan was equally clear that the party never had any
thoughts about seeking to take control of the new council. A curious
comment for a party president to make elsewhere, but it is clear the
Liberal Democrats are uneasy with the idea of intruding partisanship
into the independent tradition in the Highlands which has served them so
well. Many standing as Independents have Liberal Democrat sympathies.
Three prominent Liberal Democrats have already been returned
unopposed: the chairman of Skye and Lochalsh District Council John
Farquhar Munro in the new Lochalsh ward; former regional convener Sandy
Russell in Laggan, Dalwhinnie and Newtonmore; and Dr Michael Foxley in
Ardnamurchan and Morvern.
One name on the Lib-Dem slate which surprised was that of Rev Alex
Murray from Lairg. Mr Murray, one the leading lights of the Associated
Presbyterian Churches formed when Lord Mackay was suspended by the Free
Presbyterians, was a long time regional councillor, but always an
Independent.
He said of his decision to fight Central Sutherland under party
colours ''I have always been a Liberal and I thought it was right that
the local people should know what they were voting for this time.''
His opponent is Mrs Alison Magee, the convener of Sutherland District
Council who was a passionate opponent of the single Highland Council.
The Tories meanwhile have only three candidates willing to declare
their party affiliation, but there are some well known fellow travellers
among the 102 Independent candidates.
The Green Party is fighting: Maryburgh, Eleanor Scott; the Inverness
Ward of Inshes, Murray Falconer; and North Fort William and Inverlochy,
Daryl Tayar.
Neil MacInnes from Halkirk, meanwhile, is the solitary standard bearer
for the Scottish Christian Democrats.

RADICAL proposals to introduce performance-related pay, cut
allowances, and scrap many ranks in the Armed Forces will be unveiled
this week.
A revolutionary report by Mr Michael Bett, a former deputy chairman of
British Telecom, will form the basis for consultation between Ministers
and the military in a bid to produce a Service structure for the
twenty-first century.
The Ministry of Defence is expected to publish the full report on
Wednesday as a Green Paper -- Ministers saw it for the first time only
last Thursday.
Although some of the proposals are controversial, the military is
understood to be generally pleased with the outcome.
''There is a lot of very positive stuff in the report and there is a
guarantee that people currently serving will not be disadvantaged in any
way by the proposals,'' said a senior officer.
It is seen as a long-term strategic review which will take years to
implement fully.
The aim of the inquiry has been to remove the complex and outdated
system of varying ranks, pay bands, and a myriad of allowances.
Central to the plan are proposals to slash the number of ranks in the
three services, largely by merging various ranks, and to introduce pay
bonuses to reward skills, responsibilities, and good performance.
The move will allow much greater flexibility, making it possible for
more people to have increased pay without having to wait for promotion.
It will also help retain key personnel by allowing commanders to pay
specialists, such as electronic warfare experts, ''the going rate''
based on their job rather than their rank.
Proposals aimed at giving service people greater stability in their
personal lives include longer tours abroad, of up to five years.
This will reduce the need for boarding school allowances -- a topic of
great debate both inside and outside the armed forces.
Another allowance certain to be trimmed is flying pay. More than #5000
is paid annually to qualified pilots, even if they fly only
spasmodically. It is expected the allowance will be limited to those who
fly regular operational missions.
Months of intensive negotiations are now expected before final
decisions are made.

UNISON, Britain's largest trade union and potentially the biggest
Labour Party affiliate, has become the latest union to reaffirm its
political fund and thereby rebuff Government attempts to regulate its
political activity.
This means that 20 unions, including all the major ones, have now
reaffirmed their political ballots by substantial majorities of between
74% and 93% through secret postal ballots, only 50% of the cost of which
could be claimed back from the state.
As of today, that figure reduces to 25% and it disappears altogether
in a year's time.
Apart from the cost, the only real effect of the Government insisting
on postal votes has been greatly to reduce participation in the ballots
from the 80% to 90% or higher for the workplace ballots held when
political fund balloting was introduced 10 years ago to about one third.
Unison achieved a creditable 32% turnout, more than the other major
unions, to produce a 336,061 (74.9%) vote to retain the union's
political funds and 112,887 (25.1%) against.
As a result of the merger between Nalgo, which was not affiliated to
the Labour Party, Nupe, and Cohse, to form Unison, Britain's largest
union has two political funds -- one for general campaigning and one for
affiliation to the Labour Party.
Under the terms of the amalgamation, Unison's 1.3 million members can
opt for either, both or neither from next January which is expected to
result in a substantial increase in the 680,000 membership of the
affiliated political fund which is the level at which the union
affiliates to the Labour Party.
Welcoming the ballot result, Unison general secretary Alan Jinkinson
said it was an excellent result and one that confirmed that Unison had
got it right when it decided to maintain two political funds.
Unison's affiliated fund currently pulls in around #2.6m a year and
the general fund raises about #1.5m. They are currently being used to
fund press adverts ahead of Scottish local government elections and
campaigns in support of health workers fighting to improve a 1% pay
offer.
The ballot cost Unison around #300,000, half of which will be refunded
by the Government.

CARDINAL Thomas Winning is taking legal advice over a story which
appeared yesterday in a Sunday newspaper, a spokesman for the Roman
Catholic Church said last night.
The story centred on how the Archbishop of Glasgow dealt with a
28-year-old priest who fathered an illegitimate child with a 16-year-old
schoolgirl.
It claimed the Archbishop had failed in his responsibilities by
helping the priest to keep his job in the church.
The priest involved died from a heart attack in 1992, at the age of
40.
The church spokesman said the grandmother of the illegitimate child
had said how grateful she had been to the Archbishop for the way he had
handled the matter at the time.

COUNTESS Spencer, sister-in-law of the Princess of Wales, is being
treated for ''psychological problems'' at a private clinic, her husband
confirmed yesterday.
At the same time, in a strongly worded statement, Lord Spencer -- the
princess's brother -- launched a scathing attack on the ''sick minds''
of the tabloid press.
He said he planned to protest formally to the Press Complaints
Commission about the tactics of reporters who had ''constantly
harassed'' his wife -- former model Victoria Lockwood -- at the private
Farm Place clinic in Otley, Surrey.
He claimed journalists had posed as medical correspondents,
prospective patients, and even close friends of his wife to attempt to
gain access to the countess, who is reported to be suffering from
bulimia nervosa, the same eating disorder from which the princess
suffered.
''If ever proof was needed that sections of the tabloid newspaper
business in this country are riddled with hypocrisy and evil then it was
provided today,'' Lord Spencer said.
However, the News of the World, the paper which first carried the
story, last night denied its reporters had been involved in ''subterfuge
or deceit''.
A statement from the newspaper said: ''No News of the World journalist
or representative has at any time made any attempt to contact Countess
Spencer at the Farm Place clinic.
''Nor has any News of the World journalist or representative used any
form of subterfuge or deceit to gain access to her or to any other
patient.''
The chairman of the Press Complaints Commission, former Energy
Secretary Lord Wakeham, refused to comment on Lord Spencer's planned
complaint or the press coverage.
He said: ''If he wishes to complain we will take his complaint very
seriously and investigate it thoroughly.
''But it would be quite wrong for me to express any opinion until I
have seen the evidence.''
Lord Spencer said his complaint over the treatment of his wife would
test whether the PCC was the ''toothless'' body which many critics have
alleged, or whether it could stand up to tabloid ''bullies''.
''With the arrogance of the bully that believes the teacher is too
weak to stamp his authority, the Sunday tabloids, who have used the
crisis of my family to make their proprietors richer, believe the Press
Complaints Commission is toothless, as many have claimed before.
''I fully intend to test whether they are right.''
The News of the World article claimed Countess Spencer was suffering
from bulimia and a drink problem.
The newspaper also said the Princess of Wales was unaware of the
problems of her 29-year-old sister-in-law, who two years ago admitted
she had suffered from another slimming illness, anorexia.
Lord Spencer argued: ''How the sad tale of a mother-of-four receiving
treatment for psychological problems can be treated as news fit for
public consumption must be beyond all reasonable people.
''To use someone's medical illness to fill your newspaper has to be
the ultimate proof that sick minds dominate this part of the British
media.''
His wife had been constantly harassed by reporters when she needed
''peace to address her problems without distraction and with
considerable bravery''.
Other patients' privacy had also been abused ''repeatedly'', he said,
adding that two clauses of the newspaper industry's Code of Conduct
dealt with privacy and people receiving hospital treatment.
He said he would make a formal complaint today about the treatment of
his wife. The couple, who married six years ago, have four children --
Kitty, five, twins Katya and Eliza, three, and son Louis, 12 months.

MICE kept under laboratory conditions in Edinburgh could speed up the
search for new treatments for cystic fibrosis.
A team at the Western General Hospital have developed a hardy strain
of mice with a mutant gene which suffers from cystic fibrosis and passes
it on, just like humans.
Research from the team, published today in the journal Nature
Genetics, has shown the mice are prone to the same bacterial lung
infections as human patients and that this could lead to new work on the
disease.
The Medical Research Council said other teams around the world had
developed similar mice with the mutated gene but most died very quickly.
Professor David Porteous said: ''We have this big advantage that if we
keep the mice in their special conditions, then they do extremely
well,'' he said. ''That allows us to do careful experiments that shows
us they are susceptible to infection.
''We want to show the new treatments can actually prevent the
infections starting in the first place. That's what we see as the big
strength.''
Bacterial infections are thought to be responsible for around 95% of
all illness and death in fibrosis sufferers.
Now the researchers plan to carry out further studies with the most
common bacteria associated with the disease.

THE rise in drug deaths in Glasgow can be attributed largely to
addicts injecting a lethal cocktail of heroin and Temazepam, according
to new research.
Work by Dr Richard Hammersley, of Glasgow University, sheds light on
why almost 100 drug abusers died in Strathclyde last year, the vast bulk
of them in Glasgow.
''It would appear that the increase in Glasgow is related to the
practice of linking different drugs,'' he said yesterday.
He dismissed the popular theory which blames batches of unusually pure
heroin for causing addicts to overdose.
Dr Hammersley said the rise in the drug death toll can be charted from
the start of this decade and coincided with a change in the habits of
drug injectors.
''The situation in the mid-80s was that Scots drug injectors stopped
using heroin and started mixing Temgesic and Temazepam.
''Mixing these seemed to be quite safe. There were fewer deaths. The
problems began later when heroin and Temazepam were mixed. Temazepam can
kill.''
Dr Hammersley, of Glasgow University's behavioural sciences group,
presented his results at the annual conference of The British
Psychological Society at Warwick yesterday.
He also considered the behavioural effects of Temazepam, which about
4% of young Scots take orally. It can cause memory loss, blackouts, and
violent behaviour.

<HEADLINE>Ellis fuels furore over sleepers. Ghost train to haunt new ScotRail chief</HEADLINE>

THE new director of ScotRail took up his post today amid a growing row
over the future of Scottish services.
Mr John Ellis fuelled the furore over the axing of the Fort William
sleepers when he claimed to have no knowledge of the so-called ''ghost
train special'' being called into service to keep the line open.
He also raised questions about the future of rural services in
Scotland by stating that inter-city and suburban lines would be
ScotRail's core business.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Eye to Eye programme yesterday, Mr Ellis said:
''In the preliminary discussions I have had about the withdrawal of the
sleepers with my team in Scotland, that hasn't been raised and I haven't
heard anything of it,'' he said.
However, Mr Ellis denied the plan to run trains late at night on a
stretch of rail line only a few hundred yards long in order to keep it
classified as open and avoid an inquiry would involve extra expenditure.
''I can't imagine it would mean hiring rolling stock,'' he said. ''I
can only think it would mean a diversion of an existing service to
provide continuation of operations over a particular route.''
The short route in question, known as the Cowlairs chord, is used only
by the Fort William service, which stops on May 28. If ScotRail does not
timetable the new 11pm, Maryhill to Bishopbriggs service on it, the line
will be deemed to be closed, invoking a lengthy and tough consultation
process.
When asked if exactly the same rural services as currently provided
would remain after franchising, Mr Ellis said: ''I can't say that until
we have seen what the Passenger Service Requirements are. All of these
routes have been very heavily supported financially and we have to
continue to have that support provided.
''If that support is forthcoming, we will be very keen to continue
with the services and develop them to the best of our ability.''
Mr Ellis did claim that the likelihood that rural lines would be put
on seven-year franchise terms would put rural services on a more secure
footing than they had ever been before.
His comments on the Fort William line were met with anger. Mr Ken
Sutherland, of the Railway Development Society, said: ''Mr Ellis claimed
he was unaware of the tactic intended to wreck the possibility of a full
inquiry into the sleeper train withdrawal but refused to say he would
veto this vindictiveness.''
Mr Sutherland described the ''ghost train'' as ''a dirty trick'' and
warned it would probably not succeed in avoiding an inquiry.
''We do not believe the introduction of a one-way only late- night
service will qualify for 'the last train on the line status' which
ScotRail apparently hope.
''The Act related to genuine 'last trains on the line' which had been
provided on a historical bona fide basis and not a spurious introduction
of this ghost train, introduced at the eleventh hour to maliciously
block a fair hearing.''
Mr Bill Walker, Conservative MP for North Tayside, yesterday disclosed
that Conservative back-bench MPs today were meeting the Transport
Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney, in an effort to prevent the closure of the
sleeper service.
He described the ''ghost-train'' proposal as cheating of the worst
kind.
Mr Walker on Saturday met constituents in the Rannoch area of Tayside
who are up in arms at the idea of the service being terminated.
ScotRail, he said, had behaved abominably in not consulting all
interested parties.
He added: ''My constituents at the AGM of their branch also told me
that they reckon ScotRail often deliberately ran down the sleeper
service by changing the times of trains at short notice. They use the
service through Rannoch to Fort William quite a lot. It is wrong that it
should be closed down without proper consultation.
''Now there is every likelihood of my constituents challenging this in
court. They want a proper judicial review into the situation. The fight
to save the sleeper trains goes on.''

THE Rail, Maritime, and Transport union is campaigning for a change in
the law which allows seamen to be made redundant with only three days'
notice, regardless of length of service.
Scottish RMT officials have taken up the case in defence of a group of
merchant seamen made redundant by an English-based company this year.
Now RMT leader Mr Jimmy Knapp is writing to Employment Secretary Mr
Michael Portillo, urging the Government to review what he described as
an anomaly in the law.
The national RMT secretary in Scotland, Mr Norrie McVicar, said the
Government had failed to introduce standard terms of notice for seamen
in the Employment Protection Consolidation Act 1978. Section 49 states
that seamen do not qualify for the statutory minimum period of notice.
The RMT is backing a group of 24 former seamen who worked for the
Great Yarmouth-based supply boat company, Tide Water Marine (UK) Ltd.
The company dismissed the men, with 72 hours' notice, on January 1.
Mr McVicar said: ''In law, they might be able to get away with this
but we are taking it to an industrial tribunal and, with enough
information, we might be able to get the law changed.''
One of those involved in the fight for justice is Mr Alan Wiseman, 46,
of Broughton, Edinburgh. Tide Water Marine told him he was to be made
redundant because business had been squeezed and ships were being
withdrawn.
Mr Wiseman, who has written to the Prime Minister about his case,
said: ''There was no consultation and I was not given a written reason
for my redundancy. When you've been there for 20 years you should get
longer notice than we did.''
His MP, Mr Malcolm Chisholm (Labour, Edinburgh Leith), has also taken
up the matter with Mr Portillo. Mr Chisholm said he would raise the
matter in the Commons if there was any discrimination against seamen.
The standard period of notice is one week for every year of service up
to a maximum of 12 weeks.
A tribunal date has been set for April 28. Company managers declined
to comment until after the hearing.

THE ''middle business'' sector -- middle-sized independent companies
-- is run by people who typically did not go to university, have no
regrets about their career, work long hours, and believe ''overall,
business is fun''.
They are mostly male and married, do not smoke but do drink.
This emerges from a MORI survey, sponsored by the leading investment
capital group 3i, among 931 independent companies.
These businesses mostly rely on a small team with a clear leader, the
owner-manager, who combines professional management skills with
entrepreneurial drive and flair.
Highlights are:
* The typical chief executive of an independent company works long
hours -- two-thirds of them work more than 50 hours, and 7% work 70
hours a week or more. However, on the whole they do not like being
called workaholics.
* Overwhelmingly they are men, married with children.
* Fewer than a quarter have a university degree.
* More than half believe a ''satisfactory'' annual income for an
executive in their position is more than #75,000.
* Most believe that ''overall, business is fun'' and have no regrets
about their career. to date.
* Two out of three say they would welcome more leisure time but
three-quarters of them manage more than one holiday a year.
:: Only a quarter have a fax at home, and just half a personal
computer.
* Few smoke but 42% drink more than the officially recommended level
of 20 units of alcohol a week.
* The names that came up most often when they were asked whom they
admire were Richard Branson and Baroness Thatcher.
* Nearly half (47%) are founders of their present business. Only 17%
purchased it.
* Overwhelmingly these business leaders are men in their 40s or 50s
(average age 48), married with children. Only 4% of the sample were
female.
Mr Ewen Macpherson, 3i's chief executive, said: ''Middle-sized,
management-owned companies have a tradition of lean, keen management and
are often better equipped to seize emerging opportunities more rapidly
and more efficiently than larger organisations. Often they demonstrate
rates of growth and job creation more impressive than big companies.''
The survey was conducted by MORI from during the period October 27 to
December 15, 1994, with a total of 931 respondents representing
independent companies with turnover of #1m to #100m (average turnover
#17m).

Berlin, Sunday
GLOBAL agreement on fighting air pollution and climate change seemed
more remote than ever today as developing nations presented a draft at
the UN climate conference which set them at odds with rich countries.
The 11-day conference, a follow-up to the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, has
set itself the task of creating a framework for new talks on agreeing
cuts in industrial emissions into the next century.
However, while industrialised countries have argued about what kind of
cuts are necessary, developing countries have refused their demands to
take on more of the burden.
Today, at an unscheduled meeting of some 80 negotiators, a group of 32
key developing nations excluding oil producers presented a draft
document which said there should be ''no new commitments whatsoever for
developing country parties''.
The draft was a proposal for the negotiating mandate which it is hoped
the Berlin conference will produce, setting the scene for fresh talks
leading to a binding international protocol in 1997.
The text meant a victory for rapidly industrialising countries such as
India and China, which have faced some opposition from other developing
countries in their insistence that any emissions cuts could slow their
economic growth.
With only five days of the conference left, however, it set the
developing nations at odds with industrial countries led by the United
States.
These say that, in a few decades, countries such as China and India
will match their own output of ''greenhouse gases'' such as carbon
dioxide (CO2) which threaten to alter the climate.
The developing nations staunchly opposed another idea favoured by the
United States -- that industrialised countries should be allowed to pay
for emissions-reducing measures in poorer countries to offset some of
their own commitments.
It all meant that the 60 or so ministers who were hoping to find a
deal already done when they arrive on Wednesday will most likely find
that they must struggle to produce a result.
To complicate matters still further, the industrialised countries
failed today to bridge their own differences.
While the European Union is pushing hard for commitments to carbon
dioxide cuts, the so-called JUSCANZ countries -- Japan, the United
States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand -- have been more reluctant
to make concrete pledges.
A further obstacle to progress at the conference is the failure so far
to agree on a voting procedure.
Oil producers are holding out for consensus voting because they fear
losing markets if commitments are made to cut CO2 emissions, most of
which stem from fossil fuels.
The German hosts were continuing frantic talks today to try to secure
majority voting, which would prevent oil producers from having an
effective veto on important decisions.--Reuter.

Brussels, Sunday
THE European Union and Canada began new talks today in an effort
towards solving their dispute over Spanish trawling of disputed Atlantic
waters, but had not reached a breakthrough.
''The talks are still going on and we are still making progress. There
is no breakthrough yet,'' said a Canadian official.
''We can see the light at the end of the tunnel, but we are still not
there,'' said a spokesman for the European Commission, saying the
meetings were intended to study documents which could form the basis for
a solution.
Key commissioners would discuss the issue tomorrow, he added.
The optimism from the two camps was qualified by Spanish officials who
said Canada had made a solution more difficult by submitting extra
demands at the end of last week.
However Canadian Fisheries Minister Brian Tobin Tobin told Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation radio from Ottawa a deal could be reached this
weekend.
He said that Canada would not jeopardise the talks, at least for now,
by taking immediate action against Spanish trawlers fishing in disputed
waters off its Atlantic coast.
''What is important is that the talks are continuing again today in
Brussels. We are making very good progress and I can't say whether or
not we will conclude these talks this weekend but it is possible,''
Tobin said.
Canada accused the Spanish boats of fishing in a ''provocative''
manner.
Ottawa claims Spanish fishermen are endangering stocks of Greenland
halibut or turbot, the last big commercial species in the region, and
has imposed a unilateral moratorium in international waters of the Grand
Banks just outside Canada's 200-mile jurisdiction.
Spanish fishermen say the Canadian move to stop them fishing in
international waters is illegal. Canadian coastguards have seized one
Spanish trawler and cut the nets of another.
Canadian fisheries officials said about 10 Spanish trawlers had
returned to the disputed area known as the nose and tail of the Grand
Banks.
EU ambassadors were due to meet tomorrow to review any
progress.--Reuter.

Luxembourg, Sunday
FRANCE will urge its European Union partners tomorrow to back the
application of tighter quotas for American television programmes shown
on European networks over the next decade.
EU culture ministers plan to take a first look at a new blueprint for
quotas, drafted last month by the European Commission.
The quotas need approval from the EU governments before they come into
force. France wants to secure that approval before it relinquishes the
EU presidency in June.
Also on the agenda were plans to double EU funding for production and
distribution of home-grown films, and training for European film makers.
The Commission has proposed #346m in subsidies for Europe's
audiovisual sector between 1996-2000 to help it compete with Hollywood
producers and distributors.
Since 1989, EU television stations have been required to devote half
their air time to European programmes. However stations were able to
escape the restrictions because of a loophole.
The new proposal removes that loophole, but in a compromise aimed at
winning support from EU governments opposed to protectionism, some TV
stations are exempted from the quotas.
The Commission may have problems securing the necessary level of
support among EU nations for the TV quotas. Britain, the Netherlands,
and Nordic nations have expressed doubts.--AP.

Tokyo, Sunday
THE doomsday cult under investigation over nerve gas attacks in Tokyo
may also have been trying to develop germ and nuclear weapons, according
to news reports today.
Police searching a follower who fled the Aum Shinri Kyo's (Supreme
Truth) facilities after the gas attacks found a secret document on
uranium enrichment, the Mainichi newspaper reported.
It was the first time nuclear-related materials had been found on a
member of the religious sect, which police suspect made the gas that
killed 11 people and injured 5000 on Tokyo subways on March 20.
The eleventh victim, a 53-year-old man, died in hospital last night of
acute kidney failure caused by the gas.
The nuclear document belonged to a large heavy machinery company and
was marked ''internal use only'', the newspaper said. It was highly
specialised and referred to the use of lasers, which experts say might
in future be used to enrich uranium.
The man found with the document was a member of the sect's Science and
Technology Agency.
He had been arrested for obstructing police work after he fled from
cult premises on March 21, the day after the subway attacks, and the day
before the first police raid. They also found in his car aluminium alloy
vaporisers of the type found at Kasumigaseki station, one target of the
gas attacks.
Another newspaper said police had found evidence that the sect was
conducting research into biological weapons.
They uncovered around 300 biochemistry books as well as incubators and
electron microscopes, needed to produce weapons bacteria, at sect
facilities near Tokyo.
Some of the books explained how to culture botulinum, a bacterium
which produces a lethal toxin on food.
So far large quantities of equipment and chemicals have been found at
the sect's compounds, including all the ingredients of sarin, the nerve
gas unleashed on the subway.
However police have not yet found direct evidence that the Aum made
the gas or carried out the attacks.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankan police were on alert after reports that the sect
has shipped sarin to its branch near Colombo.--Reuter/AP.

Kathmandu, Sunday
HILLARY CLINTON today met the man for whom she is named -- mountaineer
Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest.
The wife of US President Bill Clinton, who is on a south Asian
goodwill tour, was greeted by Hillary, 75, at Kathmandu's Tribhuvan
International Airport. Mrs Clinton later left Nepal for a three-day
visit to Bangladesh.
Mrs Clinton, 47, told reporters in Nepal that her mother, Dorothy
Rodham, read an article about Hillary while she was pregnant and that
explained the unusual spelling of her name.
''She read an article in 1947 and that was before he climbed Everest.
So when I was born, she called me Hillary and always told me it was
because of Sir Edmund Hillary,'' she said.
Sir Edmund said it was sheer coincidence that their paths had happened
to cross. He runs a foundation which builds schools and clinics in the
Himalayas and had come to Nepal on a visit.
The New Zealander, who climbed the world's highest peak in 1953,
saying he had done so ''because it was there'', noted that Mrs Clinton's
fame now exceeded his own.
''In America before, if anybody recognised the name Hillary it was
always me, and now they say, 'Oh, you must be a lady','' he said.
Mrs Clinton and her daughter Chelsea, 15, relaxed on their 12-day tour
with a weekend safari in Nepal's Royal Chitwan game preserve, where they
rode an elephant on a jungle excursion.--AP.

Bujumbura, Sunday,
TROOPS in Burundi shot and killed three men in a mainly Hutu suburb of
Bujumbura today after President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya toured the area
calling for peace.
Residents showed journalists the body of one Hutu man, in his twenties
and shot in the stomach, on waste ground near an army position as troops
sealed off Kinama suburb.
A foreign photographer also saw the bodies of two other men hit by
bullets. A wounded woman was taken to hospital.
Residents said they did not know why the troops opened fire. Burundi's
army is dominated by the Tutsi minority.
The shooting erupted after President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu,
toured Kinama and the nearby Hutu stronghold of Kamenge, calling for an
end to ethnic violence.
Hundreds of people were killed in ethnic attacks in Bujumbura last
week when Tutsi gangs forced Hutus out of the Bwiza and Buyenzi
districts, raising fears that they would next move on to Kamenge.
The violence in Bujumbura and the killing of three Belgians, including
a four-year-old girl, by Hutu gunmen near the capital prompted hundreds
of Western residents to leave Burundi and some 35,000 Hutus and Zaireans
to flee to Zaire.
Both Tutsi and Hutu communities have spawned armed groups which
regularly terrorise parts of the capital. However diplomats fear ethnic
violence has been widespread in the interior last week.
''The presence of 200 foreign journalists in Bujumbura is keeping
things relatively calm for the moment because the people behind the
violence don't want to be seen,'' said one, ''but the countryside is
much harder to monitor.''
Burundi has teetered on the brink of bloodletting on a similar scale
to neighbouring Rwanda, where up to one million people were massacred
last year, since the killing by Tutsi troops of president Melchior
Ndadaye, a Hutu, in October 1993.
Meanwhile, a mass exodus bid by some 50,000 Rwandan refugees in
northern Burundi ground to a halt today with about 20,000 of them camped
in the bush while thousands more were transported by lorry back to camps
they had abandoned.
Fernando del Mundo, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said refugee leaders had agreed to stop near Kabanga
when they realised they could not cross the frontier, closed by
Tanzanian authorities to prevent the exodus.
In another development, the first trials of those accused of taking
part in Rwandan massacres will open on Thursday, the anniversary of the
start of last year's bloodbath when Hutu President Juvenal Habyarimana
was killed when his aircraft was shot down.--Reuter.

BUCHAREST: Air accident investigators yesterday recovered the engines
of the Romanian Airbus which crashed near Bucharest on Friday, killing
all 60 people on board. However they still had few clues as to why the
plane came down. Both engines were damaged but one was particularly bad,
according to an airline official.
One witness says he saw an explosion on the aircraft before it crashed
into a ploughed field after take-off from Otopeni airport en route for
Brussels. Tarom Romanian airlines has ruled out pilot error but says it
is considering every other possibility. It hopes that at least some of
the answers will be found when the ''black box'' flight recorders have
been decoded in Britain.

Gaza, Sunday
THE militant Muslim group Hamas vowed ''quick, decisive, and painful''
action to avenge the death of one of its most wanted guerrillas in a
Gaza explosion which it blamed on Israel and Yasser Arafat's Palestinian
Authority.
The PLO chairman's self-rule administration said the blast which
killed eight people when it ripped through a three-storey apartment
building occurred when a bomb being built by Hamas went off prematurely.
Top Hamas operative Kamal Kheil and two other guerrillas were among
those killed in an explosion so powerful that human remains were found
hundreds of yards away, police said.
Witnesses said the dead also included a newborn baby and a
three-year-old girl.
''The building was used by Hamas to prepare and make explosives,''
said Tayeb Abdel-Rahim, secretary-general of the Palestinian Authority.
Gaza police chief Ghazi al-Jabali said six bombs, 66lb of gunpowder,
150 hand grenades, and several assault rifles were found inside.
Hamas has carried out suicide bombings in Israel in an attempt to
wreck the 1993 peace deal between the Jewish state and the Palestine
Liberation Organisation. Last October an attack against Israel killed 22
people on a Tel Aviv bus.
Hamas said today's explosion was an attempt by ''Arafat's collaborator
authority and the Zionist enemy'' to kill Kheil.
Israel Radio described Kheil as one of the most dangerous Palestinian
guerrillas. He was wanted by Israel in connection with the killing in
Gaza in December 1993 of a lieutenant colonel responsible for
under-cover Israeli units.
Palestinian sources said Arafat's forces had wanted to question Kheil
about the killing, after self-rule began last May, of some 40
Palestinians whom Hamas and its Qassam military wing believed were
co-operating with Israel.
''Qassam will continue pointing its guns at the (Israeli) occupiers,
the traitors, and collaborators,'' said a Hamas statement. ''The Qassam
reaction to the massacre will be quick, decisive, and painful.''
Hamas has had a tacit understanding with Arafat not to carry out
attacks in self-ruled Gaza and Jericho in the West Bank.
However Abdel-Rahim said police found written orders in the wrecked
building in which the Hamas leadership told Kheil to launch ''terrorist
attacks inside and outside the Gaza Strip''.
Abdel-Rahim also pointed an accusing finger at Israel, saying some of
the explosives found in the building had been imported through the
Israeli port of Ashdod.
He said this suggested a conspiracy between Israelis and Muslim
militants sharing a common goal of wrecking the peace process.
Israeli leaders made no immediate comment on the explosion, which also
wounded 30 people and shocked many Palestinians in Gaza.
''This is terrible,'' said Muhammad al-Abed, 31, who saw the blast.
''It is a disaster for the whole Palestinian people who have just began
building their society -- and this came to destroy it all.''
PARIS: A 10-lorry ''peace convoy'' laden with 100 tonnes of
humanitarian aid left Paris bound for the Gaza Strip today.
The aid agency Equilibre said the supplies, which will arrive next
week, were an attempt to counter the lack of progress since the 1993
Israeli-Palestinian accord in Washington.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Sunday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's ANC, which governs South Africa jointly
with black and white opposition parties, today ruled out coalition rule
beyond 1999.
After a two-day meeting to discuss the country's political future, the
African National Congress said it would work for a post-apartheid
constitution which entrenches majority rule and devolves powers to South
Africa's nine provinces.
South Africa's First Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said the African
National Congress had adopted a set of guidelines to be used at the
Constitutional Assembly, which is drafting a final constitution.
''We have adopted guidelines to provide the framework for the building
of a united, non-racial, non-sexist, and democratic South Africa on
which government is based on democratic majority rule,'' said Mbeki.
Earlier, ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa told delegates: ''There
will be no enforced coalition rule beyond 1999. The NP can eat their
heart out.''
His remarks appeared to rule out coalition rule of up to 20 years, as
envisaged by the former ruling National Party (NP) of Second Deputy
President F W de Klerk; and an American or Canadian type of federalism,
as demanded by Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi and his Inkatha Freedom
Party.
The ANC won an overwhelming majority in last April's polls, but the NP
and Inkatha polled enough votes to secure a place in a five-year
government of national unity.
South Africa's interim constitution, which advocates more central
government intervention in the provinces, was completed in November 1993
and expires in 1999. The government wants the final constitution
completed by June 1996.
Buthelezi had said he and his party would walk out of the constituent
assembly on Wednesday unless the ANC met a pre-election pledge to bring
in foreign mediators to arbitrate on its demand for provincial autonomy
in a federalist constitution.
Ramaphosa said Inkatha proposals for a federalist constitution were
''suicide'' as the regions would not survive economically.''--Reuter.

<HEADLINE>Warning of bank job losses 'alarmist', say Tories</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>979075332</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Tories last night played down a warning from a leading banker
that the industry faced a loss of a further 75,000 jobs, claiming the
figure quoted was ''alarmist''.
Mr John Townend, chairman of the Conservative back-bench finance
committee, conceded there would be some losses through ''natural
wastage'' but said the figure given was ''rather high''.
The reaction followed a forecast by the chief executive of Lloyd's
Bank, Sir Brian Pitman, that jobs would be cut as a result of advances
in technology and increased competition.
The scale of the losses would represent one in five jobs -- on top of
the 100,000 jobs lost in banks and building societies in the past six
years.
Since 1989, around 3000 bank and building society branches have closed
as fierce competition has forced firms to drive down costs. Computer
technology, telephone banking, and increased automation has enabled them
to shed thousands of staff.
Mrs Harriet Harman, Shadow Employment Secretary, said the warning
would increase job insecurity.
''This latest threat of mass redundancies will spread the epidemic of
job insecurity that the Government has created even further through the
country,'' she said.
However, Mr Townend argued: ''There will be a certain amount of
rationalisation. There are always changes in industry.
''We will probably see some more losses through competitive and
economic pressures but a lot will be taken up by natural wastage over a
long period.
''I certainly can't see the figure reaching a level of 75,000. That
seems rather high and is somewhat alarmist.''
Mr Harry Greenway, a Conservative member of the Employment Select
Committee, said the figure was ''fanciful''.
''The figure has just been plucked out of the air and I can't see it
being anything like that,'' he said.
''I should be surprised if there aren't balancing new jobs in the
technological revolution and the banks should be concentrating on
explaining that instead of putting out gloom and doom stories which are
very thinly based.''
The banking union Bifu said Sir Brian's forecast, reported in the
Sunday Times, was ''devastating'' and claimed the cuts were unnecessary
and would affect customer service.
Spokesman Rob O'Neill said: ''We have seen 100,000 jobs go over the
last few years and this would mean we face the same level of job cuts
for the next five years. It would be devastating.''
Bosses in the banking industry see large-scale job losses as
inevitable in the next few years because of technological advances that
lead to overmanning.
Lloyds was one of the first big banks to set about slashing staff
numbers and fears of huge new job losses come after Lloyds completed its
#1800m takeover of the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society this
weekend.
However, a bank spokewoman reacted angrily to the job loss reports and
said there was nothing new in the article, which was unnecessarily
upsetting for its staff.
''It is typical of the Sunday Times to have carried the news two years
late,'' spokeswoman Geraldine Davies said.
''Five years ago, we started shedding and we are not announcing any
new staff cuts,'' she said.
Sir Brian's remarks were quoted out of context after a private lunch
at the beginning of last week where someone from the paper, and other
industrialists, were present, she said.

THE Dugald Baird Research Centre, which will house investigations into
improving women's health, will be opened in Aberdeen today.
The centre is in Aberdeen Maternity Hospital and its official opening
will coincide with a two-day international conference to celebrate 200
years of obstetric epidemiology in Aberdeen.
Guest speakers from around the world will address the conference and
the topics under discussion will include teenage pregnancy, the risk of
smoking, and the impact of Caesarean section on future pregnancy.
The new centre, whose director will be Dr Wendy Graham, is named after
one of Aberdeen's foremost medical pioneers, who was responsible for
establishing the North-east's renowned cervical screening service in the
early 1960s.
Sir Dugald, a graduate of Glasgow University, was Professor of
Midwifery at the University of Aberdeen from 1937 to 1965. During that
time, he revolutionised the practice of obstetrics and established
Aberdeen as a leading centre.
He became a champion of the Pill and was an advocate of the ''fifth
freedom'' -- a woman's right to have only the children she wanted --
long before contraception and abortion were available elsewhere.
His son, Professor David Baird, who is MRC professor of reproductive
endocrinology at the University of Edinburgh, will attend the ceremony
and speak at the conference.
The opening will also coincide with the university's quincentenary.
Professor Allan Templeton, head of the department of obstetrics and
gynaecology at the University of Aberdeen, said: ''The opening,
coinciding with the quincentennial, marks our determination to ensure
that Aberdeen is at the forefront of research to improve women's
health.''
The University of Aberdeen also is hosting the annual business meeting
of the governing council of the Association of Commonwealth
Universities, which opens today, with 55 delegates from Commonwealth
Countries attending.
They will be addressed by Professor John Sizer, chief executive of the
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council; Professor Donald Mackay,
chairman of Scottish Enterprise, who will speak about the Scottish
economy; and Professor John Arbuthnott who, as chairman of the Committee
of Scottish Higher Education Principals, will talk about Scotland's
universities.
''Graduates from the university have made important contributions to
the development of virtually every Commonwealth country,'' said
Professor Maxwell Irvine, Principal of the university.
''This is a great opportunity to encourage international awareness of
the University of Aberdeen among fellow institutions throughout the
world.''
The Association of Commonwealth Universities was established in 1913
and is the oldest university association in the world. Its aim is to
promote in practical ways contact and co-operation between its member
institutions.

EDINBURGH yesterday unveiled a #240m project as its bid for support
from the Millenium Fund.
It would look to the environmental future, with help from the
nineteenth century.
The district council hopes to secure #49m from the fund, with private,
public, and other sources providing the remainder.
Entitled Edinburgh -- The Dynamic City, the project aims to expand
green areas to link the natural and urban areas.
The plan is to create a more balanced city and follows the ideas on
town planning by Sir Patrick Geddes in the nineteenth century. He saw
the world as a unified whole, with all elements of the environment
interdependent.
The first part of the three-part proposal is a ''green web'', a
network of green spaces and routes across the city, linking communities
with cycle-paths, walkways, and waterways. It would have a central green
valley transforming Princes Street, the gardens, and Waverley Station.
The second part would be a range of model environmental projects:
transport systems with conventional and light- rail developments, energy
conservation, and a new, inner-city, car-free district around Annandale
Street.
The third part would be a Millennium centre: an urban observatory
where citizens could see the mechanisms by which the city lived and
breathed. It would bring to life through electronics graphic
illustrations of the varied factors influencing the city environment.
Councillor Lesley Hinds, leader of the council, said it was important
to continue to make Edinburgh a city in which people wished to live.

PLANS for a festival of Celtic arts and culture based in the Highlands
were boosted at the weekend with the announcement of a #40,000 grant.
The proposed annual Highland Festival will receive the money from
Highlands and Islands Enterprise, which believes the event will be of
international importance, bringing hundreds of thousands of pounds to
the northern economy over 10 days in the quiet spell between Easter and
summer high season.
The funding follows the lead of other enterprise companies which have
recognised the benefits of an arts-led regeneration, as proved in
Glasgow in the eighties.
Festival director Mr Ian Ritchie -- who is also artistic director of
the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and Orkney's internationally-acclaimed St
Magnus Festival -- said yesterday: ''The Highlands and Islands have for
too long been overlooked as a source of artistic inspiration, despite a
rich heritage and an explosion of activity in the last 25 years.''
Mr Ritchie said Celtic culture had undergone a renaissance over the
past quarter century and now had a massive audience, particularly with
the young, and had made inroads into mainstream entertainment across the
world.
The festival programme will be announced later this year.

TWO male counsellors have joined Britain's only rape and abuse
help-line for both sexes.
More than 20% of the calls being received by the help-line, based in
Dingwall, Ross-shire, are from men.
Until now, it has been staffed only by women but many men found this
too embarrassing.
Ms Joan Bell, the help-line's administrator, said: ''Sexual assaults
on adult males appear to be few but it does happen in the Highlands.
''Most of the callers are concerned about the abuse they suffered as
children. But some want to know how to help a wife or partner who has
been raped or abused. In many cases, they prefer to talk to a man.''
The help-line for males (01349 862686) is available only on
Wednesdays, between 7pm and 10pm, but it is hoped to expand the service
if more volunteers can be recruited. Calls are diverted automatically to
the counsellors' homes from where they operate.

AN Ayrshire builder has been put out of business and will have to sell
his dream home because of the failure of a development company.
Mr Tom Ferguson carried out building work for Greenbrae Development
Ltd in 1992 but, despite a court decree against the company, he has
never been paid the #66,000 he is owed.
Now the 52-year-old builder from Crosshill has been sequestrated and
has had to put the luxury home he built for his family on the market to
raise funds.
Mr Ferguson took on the contract from Greenbrae, run by Glasgow
solicitor Hugh Grant and former policeman David Wilson, to demolish a
filling station in the conservation village of Sorn and build a block of
four flats.
He was paid just one progress payment and sought a decree from the
courts. A sheriff granted the decree for the #66,000 plus legal costs
but Mr Ferguson has received nothing.
Greenbrae has ceased trading and because of the protection of the
limited liability laws neither of the directors is personally liable. In
addition, because the company has no assets, its creditors are unlikely
to receive any payment.
Mr Ferguson said: ''I took this work in good faith and incurred
considerable costs in materials and time. Now I am left with nothing
while Mr Grant continues in business as a lawyer with people working for
him.
''I worked in Australia for 11 years to be able to come back here and
set up my business and give my wife and family a decent home. Now I will
have to sell up. I am left with a piece of paper from a sheriff which
turns out to be worthless.''
He added: ''The law is unfair when a company can continue in business
while sub-contractors it owes money to are forced out. I had thought
that the architects' certificates which were issued for the flats would
have been binding but obviously I was wrong. It might not do me any good
now but if it can help someone in the future then the law should be
changed now.''
Mr Graeme McKinstry, the Ayr solicitor who acts for Mr Ferguson, last
night called for a radical change in company law to prevent small
businesses being forced to fail through no fault of their own.
He said: ''Once again we are seeing a classic case of the small man
being forced out of business because he dealt with the big boys who
failed to pay up.
''There is an inherent unfairness in the company law system as it
exists because the magic word limited gives companies a safety net
should things go wrong. There is no such net for the contractors who
give their time and materials in good faith.''
Mr McKinstry added: ''We must have legislation through Parliament. I
would like to see the legal and business worlds joining MPs to press for
this to restrict the level of indebtedness which a company may have
without proper security. The value of contracts should be pegged to the
level of investment within the company.
''If you or I wished to borrow money we would have to give security
but technically if we started a limited company with #100 today we could
be running up debts of a million next week. Then if we failed we could
just walk away and start another company next week.''
The lawyer conceded that many successful companies could not have
flourished without the limited liability protection but stressed the
unfairness of the system.
''Many more small businesses will fail if they are not protected from
bigger companies which have the safety net below them as they trade. Mr
Ferguson's case is particularly harrowing but he is not the first to
suffer in this way and, sadly, he will not be the last,'' he said.
Mr Wilson is understood to have ceased his involvement with Greenbrae
two years ago and both he and Mr Grant did lose money in the venture.
Mr Grant said: ''Had we not had the protection of limited liability,
the transaction would not have happened. I realise that is of little
comfort to Mr Ferguson.''
While Greenbrae Development Ltd still technically exists as a company,
it is understood that a request has been made to Companies House to have
it struck off the register.

NATIONAL Lottery organiser Camelot faces sweeping changes which could
see the size of jackpots and profits cut if Labour wins the next General
Election, it emerged yesterday.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith raised the prospect of a
shake-up in the way the lottery was run after Camelot confirmed that two
ticket holders would share this week's record jackpot of #22.2m.
Mr Smith suggested the jackpot money should be spread among more
winners and he questioned the amount pocketed from the takings by
Camelot, which looks set to make a profit in its first year, contrary to
forecasts.
He said he did not think the overall size of the jackpot was too big
''because the more money people spend on the lottery, the more money
ultimately goes to the good causes''.
However, he told GMTV's Sunday programme: ''What we need is to take a
look at where you've got just one or two people winning such an enormous
amount of money, whether it wouldn't be better to try to spread the
prize winnings a bit further down the list of winners.''
Mr Smith also questioned Camelot's earnings from the lottery.
He said: ''At the moment only 48% of the money is going in prizes. It
ought to be 50% under the rules.''
Asked if he would renegotiate Camelot's contract, he said: ''I would
want to sit down with them and see if they were prepared to talk through
whether the contract as a whole could be changed.''
''At the moment, they are taking something like 11% of the takings.
That might be fair enough because they have had a lot of start-up costs.
But, over time, that 11% may become rather a lot of money for running an
established system.
''I would want to talk to them about reducing that and perhaps putting
some more money into the arts, sport, heritage, and charities.''
The head of Oflot, the National Lottery watchdog, defended his claim
made last year that Camelot would not make a profit for over four years.
According to the latest estimates, the company, in fact, looks set to
make about #60m in the first year, if ticket sales continue apace.
Mr Peter Davis, the director general of Oflot, said this was a result
of higher than expected turnover.
He told BBC2's The Money Programme: ''I cannot accept that they are
huge profits in the context of the very substantial business which
Camelot is running, and indeed the very substantial amount of capital
which its shareholders have put at risk.''
The lottery jackpot went through the roof on Saturday after no-one
picked out the previous week's winning numbers.
It is only the third time the jackpot had rolled over to the following
week and people spent a record #76.2m on tickets -- 22.5% up on last
week -- in the rush for a chance to win a share.
The winning numbers were: 22 25 30 32 41 43. The bonus number was 29.
A Camelot spokeswoman later dismissed Mr Smith's claims that only 48%
of the money taken from sales was going on prize money.
She claimed his figure was based on the ''on-live'' weekly draw but
the figure balanced out with the 55% of sales money paid out through the
Instants scratchcards.
''Over the seven-year period of the licence, the figure for pay-outs
will be 50%,'' she insisted.
Camelot also said: ''We believe the current prize and game structures
are the most effective for raising the most money for good causes.''
Mr Smith's criticism of the percentage of the ticket sales -- which he
claimed was as high on 11% -- being taken by Camelot was also unfair,
she said.
''At the moment, we are not taking as much as 11% but what's important
to remember is that over the seven-year licence period, the average
taking will be 5%.
''We are working to tight, low margins, as far as we know the lowest
margins of any lottery operators in the world.''

A COUNCIL worker, who dug the graves of two fire victims, himself died
of burns just hours after their funerals.
Mr Peter Fraser, 38, ran screaming along the High Street of
Grantown-on-Spey, enveloped in flames.
His clothes are understood to have been soaked with petrol.
Only a few hours earlier, Mr Fraser, known locally as Peter the Piper,
had played his bagpipes at the large funeral of crofting pair Mrs Edith
Ross, 83, and her son Peter, 53, who died in a fire at their wooden home
nearby 10 days before.
Friends in Grantown yesterday said Mr Fraser was upset by the deaths
and had been trying to drown his sorrows in the days preceding the
funeral.
It is understood Mr Fraser has suffered bouts of depression in the
past.
Retired grave digger Mr Ian Fraser, 65, who handed over his job to the
former Army piper in December, said: ''Peter knew the Rosses and was
unhappy about their deaths. He came from a crofting and farming family
himself.
''He was a very deep chap. You never knew what he was thinking.
''He kept a can of petrol in his mother's garage for the lawnmower.''
The dead man lived with his wife, Audrey, and one-year-old daughter,
Lucy, at South West High Street, Grantown.
Hewas seen in flames running from a garage behind his mother's house
in High Street about 8pm on Saturday. His own house is only yards away.
Neighbour Mr Gordon MacGregor said: ''We heard the screams and thought
it was teenagers carrying on, but it was Peter covered in flames. He ran
along the street and collapsed on the pavement.
''People ran out of their homes with water and blankets to smother the
flames.''
Mr MacGregor's son Ewen, 36, managed to speak briefly to the dying man
as he lay on the ground.
Mr MacGregor said: ''All he was able to give was his name before he
lapsed into unconsciousness.''
Local entertainer Mr Alfie McQuade, who lives in High Street, was
preparing to go out when he heard a commotion outside.
He said :''I suddenly heard what sounded like an animal wailing and
then I saw a bright orange flash going past the window.''
Mr Fraser was taken by ambulance 35 miles to Raigmore Hospital, in
Inverness, suffering from extensive burns, but died early yesterday
morning.
A police spokesman said: ''There are no suspicious circumstances. A
report will go to the procurator- fiscal.''
Yesterday, Mrs Fraser was being comforted at her council house by her
parents.
Her father said: ''We are still in the dark as to how Peter came to be
on fire.''

AWARD-winning playwright and former prisoner Mark Leech is spending
his first days of freedom promoting his latest book -- a users' guide to
prisons.
Mr Leech, 37, who has spent most of his adult life in jail, was freed
last week from Saughton Prison, Edinburgh, after serving more than seven
years.
He immediately began a round of media interviews for his ''vital
task'' in launching his Prisoners' Handbook.
Mr Leech believes there is a lack of information on jails for
prisoners and their families. His book is to be published by Oxford
University Press next month and covers the 136 prisons in England and
Wales.
It details everything from the prisoner's reception to his release and
includes a section on prisoners' rights.
Mr Leech, who now lives in Bristol, said: ''The handbook is not a
subversive work. Except for the editorial, it is apolitical. There is
robust criticism of features such as prison management and the role of
prison visitors but I think the authorities will be strangely relieved
when they see it.''
He is planning an update every year, with editions for Scottish and
Northern Ireland prisons.
Mr Leech discovered a talent for writing while in Aylesbury jail. He
has written articles on prison matters for national newspapers and won
awards for radio and television plays.

Police said there was no obvious motive for the attack, which happened

Mr Harry Murray, 59, was found by a colleague making a routine visit to
the factory. Detective Inspector Kinnear Hirst, who is leading the
investigation, said: ''We have good reason to believe that whoever

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Tory official yesterday published a lengthy dossier alleging
waste and incompetence in Scottish local authorities run by Labour.
Sir Michael Hirst, chairman of the Scottish Conservative Party,
claimed his 19-page document exposed ''the reality of socialist
government . . . hiding behind the facade of New Labour''.
The dossier lists a series of incidents involving Labour groups in
regional and district councils across Scotland and also charts party
in-fighting within seven Labour administrations.
Sir Michael claimed that, on average this year, Labour authorities had
levied council taxes which are #72 higher than in Tory-run areas, and
pointed out that 11 of the 12 highest district taxes have been set by
Labour councils.
He said: ''It is clear that there is a strong connection between the
levels of waste, ineptitude, and mismanagement in Labour councils and
the high levels of tax that Labour councils charge.
''Some Labour-controlled councils now appear to care more about
attacking each other than providing services to customers.

SCOTTISH householders on average incomes are paying more in council
tax than their English counterparts, the Liberal Democrats claimed
yesterday.
Party leader Jim Wallace said the extra levy in Scotland ranged from
#30 to #195 for those living in houses worth between #27,000 and
#106,000. On average, this could mean the equivalent of an additional
penny on Scottish income tax.
He said the discrepancy, which benefited only the very poorest and
very richest Scots, was caused by the different banding structure for
house values in England and Scotland.
Mr Wallace pointed out that, while the bandings were different, ''the
houses cost the same and the same level of income would be needed to
repay a mortgage on such a property''.
Scots, he added, also faced higher domestic fuel bills because of the
colder climate, and extra petrol costs in rural areas.

SCOTLAND'S social workers, battered by the bad publicity of the
badly-handled, so-called child abuse cases and bruised by the upheaval
of Care in the Community, may find local government reorganisation is
the knockout punch.
Senior management in many social work departments have found the
enormous changes in community care has stretched their departments to
the limit. Many doubt if the local government changes will leave them
able to deliver a suitable service to the public.
If the new social work departments cannot deliver after next April,
the public will suffer.
As in other departments, there is the fear that specialist services
which large regions can deliver will not be able to function with
smaller councils.
A simple example is adoption. Fitting a baby to the right young couple
takes a lot of precise planning. Strathclyde has a good record of
finding parents to adopt 50 babies a year.
However, in future, will a couple from Ayr, for example, be able to
adopt a child from Glasgow?
Then there are services which a smaller authority may not be able to
afford. Strathclyde operates a 24-hour stand-by service, with social
workers on duty to deal with emergencies such as abandoned children, or
simply people in a very distressed condition.
There is also the work that rarely gets publicity. The region has a
sign language interpreting service, so that deaf people who have an
important doctor's appointment, court appearance, or similar can apply
for a signer to go with them.
Fears for jobs in the future are also being expressed at the
Blindcraft factories for disabled workers.
Sharing out current resources will also prove difficult. There are,
for example, only two resource centres, formerly known as assessment
centres, to help deal with troubled children. No doubt it is planned for
two authorities to take them over and then charge other authorities for
the places they use. But who pays the running costs when rooms are left
vacant?
Such problems have to be sorted out but more upheaval is the last
thing social work departments want at a time when there is an
overwhelming demand for their services.

SHADOW Foreign Affairs spokesman Robin Cook claimed yesterday that the
re-organisation of Scottish local government could cost millions of
pounds in lost European funding.
He said that, since 1979, a total of #1600m had been allocated to
Scotland by bodies such as the European Regional Development Fund and
the European Social Fund.
Mr Cook warned that the demise of regional councils would jeopardise
the ability to attract similar funding, as the new, smaller authorities
would not be able to sustain the same level of representation in Europe.
''The Tories are moving Scotland in the wrong direction for the new
Europe and Scots will lose out,'' he said.
However, Mr Cook claimed that new Labour councils would work with
neighbouring authorities and Cosla to ensure strong representation in
Europe.

THE Scottish National Party yesterday published its vision of local
democracy but warned that it could never be fulfilled unless Scotland
gained independence.
Local government vice-convener Maureen Watt said the SNP's 20-point
document was more important than ever because of ''the Tories attacking
local government from above, and Labour undermining it by neglect from
within''.
She claimed that the UK was a highly centralised state, with an
in-built disinclination to disperse power or recognise local
differences.
Without a written constitution, local councils had no real protection
against arbitrary interference by central government.
Among the SNP's proposals for change are the introduction of
proportional representation in local elections; proper remuneration for
councillors; and an end to the bar on council employees standing for
election in their own authority.

<HEADLINE>Switch of buildings echoes 'haggling over the estate of a curmudgeonly matriarch'. Who gets what in property transfer</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>CHRIS HOLME</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<TEXT>
EVERY council treasures its buildings as icons of municipal
achievement.
Civic centres and administrative headquarters are the physical
embodiments of power and permanent memorials to the foresight, wisdom or
folly of elected representatives long since departed.
This is why there is more to the disposal of property belonging to the
nine regional councils in Scotland than at first appears. It is not just
a question of bricks and mortar.
It will be up to the councillors for the 29 new unitary authorities
elected on Thursday to decide who will get what, subject to Government
guidance, in the moribund regions' and districts' last year.
Much of it will be painless. For the largest single component,
schools, it is reasonably simple, except where catchment areas overlap.
The same rule will apply to most other council buildings: if they are
within the boundaries of the new authority, it will usually assume
ownership.
For the larger cities, disposal of assets is certain to be
problematic. The analogy of quarrelsome relatives haggling over the
estate of a rich and curmudgeonly matriarch may not be misplaced.
Although former regional councillors may find seats on the new
authorities, they will still inherit the rich tradition of rivalry
between the old districts and regions.
Large office blocks form part of the equation. Strathclyde has a huge
HQ in India Street, Glasgow. So too does Lothian on George IV Bridge in
Edinburgh and Grampian at Woodhill House in Aberdeen.
They may seem valuable assets but that is illusory, according to Mr
Jim Fiddes, senior partner with Ryden property consultants.
''There is going to be a lot of second-rate property coming on to the
market, he said. ''Many of these properties were built in the 1960s.
Their type and location may be such that they will be of very limited
value.''
The new councils will each have a claim to the city centre office
space. Glasgow is losing Rutherglen and Cambuslang to South Lanarkshire.
This theoretically gives South Lanarkshire an 8% claim on a population
basis for Glasgow's buildings.
If South Lanarkshire takes over the County Buildings in Hamilton from
Strathclyde as its new heaquarters, Glasgow could have a counter-claim,
since some of the regional functions there also covered Glasgow.
The potential for interlocking claims is enormous. Within Glasgow
alone there are 6500 buildings owned or operated by the existing
district and regional councils. This could spawn a vast array of
bureaucratic and accounting procedures to keep everyone happy, assuming
initial agreement could be reached.
Inevitably most of the regional council assets in the cities will pass
on to the new city councils, since they are favoured by geographic
location and weight of population.
That means outlying authorities will be left disadvantaged -- stuck
with a share of offices in cities, where they do not want them, and
facing the problem of finding new ones in their own areas when the sites
or money may not be available.
The danger is that, if economies cannot be made in property and
buildings, savings may have to be achieved in services or staffing.
In Lothian, moves are already under way to secure agreements between
councils, but Scottish Office guidelines in a property transfer order
are not expected until December this year.

KILLER Susan Christie, jailed for knifing her Army lover's wife, has
started a secretarial job in Belfast just two years and four months
after she was sentenced.
The 26-year-old former private in the Ulster Defence Regiment has been
granted permission to take part in a ''work-out'' scheme from her cell
at Magherberry Jail, County Antrim.
During the day, she has freedom of movement to visit friends and
family before voluntarily returning to the jail in the evening.
Christie -- whose story was told in the ITV drama Beyond Reason -- was
convicted in 1992 of the manslaughter of Mrs Penny McAllister,
24-year-old wife of her lover Captain Duncan McAllister, 30.
Downpatrick Crown Court heard she nearly decapitated her with a
butcher's knife.
The jury accepted a plea of manslaughter through diminished
responsibility and the judge sentenced her to five years.
The Northern Ireland Appeal Court ruled this was ''unduly lenient''
and increased the sentence to nine years.
Mrs McAllister's parents Desmond and Norma Squire, of Arundel, West
Sussex, who believe she should have been jailed for life, were furious
yesterday over her treatment.
The Northern Ireland Office refused to discuss the case.
A spokesman said: ''All prisoners anticipating release within a year
can apply for working out.
''It's a gradual phased rehabilitation scheme which helps a prisoner
refresh their skills and improve their chances of getting employment on
release.''

<HEADLINE>Union calls for answer to claims of bullying at theatre</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>979075359</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A UNION is calling for an investigation into allegations of bullying
at Aberdeen's main theatre.
The complaints centre around Mr John Kerr, the technical manager at
His Majesty's Theatre, and cover a two-year period.
The theatrical union Bectu (Broadcasting, Entertainment,
Cineomatograph, and Theatre Union) is also demanding answers from
Aberdeen City Council, which owns the theatre and which was sent a
dossier about the claims three months ago.
Shop stewards claim the council, which has been the focus of bullying
allegations in the past, is trying to sweep the matter under the carpet.
Twelve separate incidents of bullying, ranging from sexual harassment
to actual physical abuse, have been listed in a document prepared by the
union on behalf of its 20 members in the theatre.
Mr Kerr, who came to work in Aberdeen four years ago from a similar
job with the Globe Theatre in Belfast, lives in the city's Summerfield
Place.
It is claimed he approached a stage hand from behind and held a dagger
at his throat during a performance of Sherlock Holmes and the Crucifer
of Blood.
During the same run, he is also said to have forced a 8mm starting
pistol against the man's head.
Had the gun gone off accidentally, the individual could have been
seriously injured, claims Bectu.
''The theatre has not been a happy place to work for a number of
months,'' said shop steward Paddy Copeland. He is now seeking advice
from his national officials in Glasgow.
When the initial complaint was made three months ago, theatre director
Robert Robson conducted an inquiry but said he failed to find evidence
of any bullying.
''But none of the victims was interviewed. How can there have been an
investigations if none of our members were asked to tell their story,''
asked Mr Copeland.
''As far as we are concerned, they have sat on it since January and
done nothing about it.''
One individual quit his job at the theatre two weeks ago because he
could not take any more, the union official claims.
There have been suggestions that Mr Kerr's actions are no more than
horseplay but Bectu disputes this.
''He has hit the wardrobe mistress over the head with a prop book a
number of times, giving her headaches, and he hit a male member of staff
in the testicles with a screwdriver,'' said Mr Copeland.
Aberdeen City Council and its former chief executive were the centre
of bullying allegations 18 months ago, at which time an independent
inquiry was staged.
Council spokesman Ray Gibson said yesterday: ''There is no question of
a cover-up. We tend to leave the theatre to manage itself but if any
further allegations come to light we will look into them.
''As far as the council was concerned, everything has been resolved by
Mr Robson and he said he could find no evidence of bullying,'' he added.
Mr Gibson explained that the union was welcome to discuss the issue
with the council's personnel department if they had any concerns.
''But it must also be remembered that most of the people concerned in
this are casuals who rely on Mr Kerr to give them work and that
obviously has a bearing on how much they are prepared to say,'' he said.

SHADOW Chancellor Gordon Brown yesterday seized on the Prime
Minister's admission that the Government has disappointed its
supporters, by claiming that this week will bring to 20 the number of
tax rises introduced by the Tories.
Mr Brown accused the Government of trying to make up for
''abandoning'' middle and lower income Britain by promising tax cuts.
''What people will remember long after this Government is gone is not
the promised tax cuts but the reality of the biggest tax rises in
history,'' he said.
A cut in mortgage interest tax relief and a reduction in the married
couple's allowance, both from 20% to 15%, were announced in the 1993
Budgets. Both take effect on Thursday, and Labour claims that these are
the 19th and 20th tax increases introduced by the Tories.
On Saturday, Mr Major told the Conservative Central Council meeting in
Birmingham that the Government's strategy of dealing with the crisis in
public finances by raising taxes over the past three years had
''disappointed our supporters and seemed against natural instincts''.
However, he pledged that, with the recovery strengthening, ''we can
look forward confidently to bringing taxes down''. The promise of
pre-election tax cuts was reinforced by suggestions that the Government
was considering a programme of ''rolling tax cuts'' over the next three
years.
Mr Brown sought to take maximum advantage of the Government's talk of
tax cuts in a week when taxes are going up. ''Repeating tired old
promises of tax cuts in the week you are raising taxes for the 20th time
does not add up to a new policy,'' he said.
''Saying you represent middle Britain when all you stand for is a
privileged elite in the privatised utilities does not constitute a
credible message.''
The state of the health service was evidence of the Tories' disregard
for lower and middle-income Britain, he told a Labour women's conference
in Derby, and announced a campaign to save the National Health Service
''for the nation''.
''This party, and the people of this country, will not tolerate
creeping privatisation or any break-up of our NHS. Just as we will not
tolerate bureaucrats taking the jobs of nurses, we will not allow
hospitals to be made into proft centres, patients into cash-flow
opportunities, and doctors into speculative businessmen,'' he said.
Meanwhile, Shadow Trade and Industry Secretary Jack Cunningham
attacked an expected increase of more than #2 billion in the combined
profits of the privatised utilities as ''ruthless exploitation of
consumers''.
Citing City research figures showing that electricity, water, and gas
profits reached #7.7 billion last year -- a 40% increase on the previous
year's #5.5 billion -- Mr Cunningham said regulation was proving
ineffective.
He said: ''These huge profit increases confirm the ruthless
exploitation of consumers by the private suppliers of essential
services. The massive profit increases will benefit executives and
shareholders to the cost of consumers.
''Regulation is manifestly ineffective and fails to protect consumers,
employees, and long-term investment.'' He repeated a Labour pledge to
curb such ''abuses''.

A COMPETITOR died during yesterday's London Marathon, the organisers
said, but a spokesman said no more details were available.
The person was the fourth to die in the race's 15-year history, all in
the last six years.
One competitor died in 1990, another in 1993, and a third last year.
The race's medical director, Dr Dan Tunstall Pedoe, immediately
defended marathon running, saying: ''It is still a very low risk
compared with many other activities. These random things occur -- it is
a random event of low probability.''
Fun runners found it tough going in the warm spring weather.
Though winner Dionicio Ceron's time, 2hrs 8mins 30secs, was London's
second fastest behind Steve Jones's 1985 course record of 2:08.16, less
experienced runners found themselves struggling.
Liz McColgan, in her first big race for two years after injuries, was
fifth in the women's event, won by Poland's Malgorzata Sobanska in
2:27.43.

<TEXT>
SCOTLAND Yard is to investigate fresh evidence concerning the
disappearance more than 20 years ago of Lord Lucan.
There have been claims that the runaway murder suspect was seen
drinking with friends Ian and Susan Maxwell-Scott 17 hours after his
last reported sighting. This contradicts the theory that Lucan took his
own life just hours after the Belgravia murder of nannie Sandra Rivett.
The allegations come from Mrs Mandy Parks, who had been a 16-year-old
baby-sitter at the Maxwell-Scotts' home in East Sussex. She says she has
spoken out after seeing Mrs Maxwell-Scott talking about the night of the
murder on television. According to Mrs Maxwell-Scott, Lucan left their
house soon after 1.15am on November 8, 1974.
Mrs Parks told the Mail on Sunday: ''What she said wasn't the truth.
It's not my place to question people like them but it's not right that
the truth should not come out.''
She says she saw Lucan sharing drinks with her employers and a woman
she did not recognise between 6pm and 7pm later that day.
Lord Lucan's car was found abandoned in Newhaven at about 8am.

<HEADLINE>Women in hashish smuggling bid are to appeal</HEADLINE>

FOUR women, including two Scottish grandmothers, announced yesterday
that they plan to appeal against the prison sentence they received for
trying to smuggle hashish worth #72,000 out of Spain.
They claimed they had been set up by a drugs baron, in an operation
which allowed other smugglers to slip past police and customs officials
at Malaga airport.
Mrs Gladys McConnachie, 55, and her daughter Maihri, 28, both from
Cleland, Lanarkshire, were arrested with Mrs Mary Caldwell, 57, from
Glasgow, and Ms Pamela Bell, 30, from County Durham, as they were about
to board a flight to Gatwick last December. All four had three
kilogrammes of hashish strapped round their waists beneath their
clothing.
Last week, they were each sentenced to four years and two months in
prison for illegal possession of the drugs, and a further two months
each for attempted smuggling.
Yesterday, the four spoke to reporters in the women's wing at the
Alhuin de la Torre prison, 12 miles outside Malaga.
Mrs McConnachie said: ''We were set up. It was all a trick . . . we
would get caught so that others could get through with much more.''
The women claimed they had been befriended by a man they knew only as
Pepe in a bar in the resort of Torremolinos.
Just before they were due to fly home, he offered them #1000 each to
carry three kilos of hashish each back to Britain.
They were caught because tin foil Mrs McConnachie had wrapped around
the drugs set off the alarm on an airport metal detector.
She said yesterday: ''We thought Spain was the same as Holland and
that pot was legal. That's what Pepe told us . . . and if we got caught
in England it would have been our first offence and we would have just
got fines, which Pepe told us he would pay.''
Her daughter Mhairi said: ''We believed what Pepe said because, in the
bar where we met him, and in a lot of others, everyone was smoking away
quite openly while policemen in uniform were taking no notice. What else
would we think when we saw this?''
Mrs Caldwell, said: ''We did not get a proper trial. We are going to
appeal and we are going to denounce all this to the European Court.''
The women said they could not name the bar where they met the man they
knew as Pepe but could have taken police there.
However, Ms Bell said: ''They weren't interested. They had caught us
and that was it. We should have been shown photographs of known drug
traffickers in case we could have picked out Pepe. But there was
nothing.''

WOMEN are threatening to stage a protest over their exclusion from the
annual Common Riding ceremonies in Hawick.
Each year, the men of the town ride out to surrounding communities in
a succession of cavalcades which reach their high point with the cornet
-- festival principal -- galloping the Town Moor carrying a banner at
the head of hundreds of male followers.
Now women could be about to make their presence felt at the
centuries-old event whether they are wanted or not.
Under the heading Hawick Common Riding, an advertisement has been
placed in the local newspaper, the Hawick News, which states: ''Would
all female riders residing in the TD9 postal area interested in riding
at the festival write giving details.''
The advert gives a box number and a spokesman for the newspaper said:
''This is not an April Fool joke. We have checked out the advert and it
is genuine. We cannot reveal who placed it.''
With the first ride-out scheduled for mid-May, the prospect of women
joining uninvited is certain to cause anger among many of the men.
Common Riding secretary Frank Scott commented: ''Male riders are
invited by the cornet to join him on the ride-outs and as they meet on
the public roads I suppose there is nothing to stop women arriving and
attempting to join in.
''But sections of the rides are across private land by agreement with
the landowners and I am not sure what the women's position would be once
they were off the public road.
''My committee is directly responsible for the main Common Riding Day.
That is restricted to male riders and will remain so. I have an idea
where this advert originated but I am saying nothing more.''
In recent years, the all-male rule has meant that Hawick's woman
provost, Councillor Myra Turnbull, has been excluded from some of the
key events at which the town's leading citizen has always previously
enjoyed a major role.
Last year, exercising her right to choose the festival's principal
guest, she picked another woman -- the former wife of the Duke of
Roxburghe and sister of the Duke of Westminster, Lady Jane Grosvenor.
The provost and Lady Jane both had to miss out on speeches and songs
on the main day and sat in a tent while the all-male proceedings were
relayed by loudspeaker from an adjoining building.
Provost Turnbull said: ''If the girls are planning to turn out, I
think they are very brave. It was bound to happen some time.
''As provost, I go to all the other Borders festivals, all of which
allow women riders to take part. It will be resisted here and it is a
form of sex discrimination.
''The official reason given is that women could fall and hurt
themselves but that doesn't seem to be a problem when men are injured,
which happens regularly.
''Women today are questioning the old rules but I hate to think what
could happen if there was a confrontation and tempers were lost. It
could be a tricky situation.''
One male supporter of allowing women a more active role in the Common
Riding is former Scotland rugby international prop forward Norman
Pender, a Hawick farmer and businessman.
''There are some narrow-minded attitudes over this and I think it is
time for a change,'' he said. ''The men should be persuaded to quietly
relent.''

<HEADLINE>Prime Minister arrives in US after 'rough patch' in relationships with President Clinton. Major flies in to build new bridges.</HEADLINE>

The Prime Minister, Mr John Major, flew into Andrews Air Force base
near Washington early this morning to begin a three-day visit which
seems to have less to do with mending fences with President Clinton than
with building with new bridges with the Republicans.
Mr Major is scheduled to have a three-hour working lunch with the
President tomorrow but officials on both sides insist it will be low
key.
Top of the agenda will be a series of foreign affairs issues --
Bosnia, Libya, Iraq -- with the Irish question pushed well into the
background.
Both camps seem anxious to draw a line under recent events which saw
Sinn Fein's Gerry Adams given the ''red carpet'' treatment in
Washington, much to the annoyance of Mr Major, who refused for a week to
speak to the President on the phone.
When the matter is discussed this week, it is likely mainly to be in
the context of monitoring Sinn Fein's fund-raising activities in the
United States rather than going over old ground on the Adams visit.
Mr Major will be seeking reassurance that proper monitoring procedures
are being carried out on Sinn Fein fund raising, to stop cash being
channelled into IRA arms.
The US side is expected to give a commitment to push Sinn Fein to
agree to negotiate over the surrender of the IRA's arsenal -- a key
sticking point in the process of moving to talks with Ministers.
A senior American diplomat in London said: ''Our objectives are
identical. We are emphasising and pressing Sinn Fein to move forward on
a serious discussion of decommissioning. We will not be satisfied until
that happens and until the talks move forward.''
Mr Major clearly is keen to forge a new relationship with the
Republican Party in America and his meeting with Newt Gingrich, the
controversial and outspoken Speaker of the House of Representatives, is
being seen as one of the highlight's of the trip.
The Prime Minister may be anxious to see if he can pick up from fellow
right-wingers, who secured a landslide victory over the Democrats in
last November's congressional election, any hints on how to counter the
threat posed by Tony Blair.
Whether the so-called special relationship between Britain and America
remains is a matter of some dispute. Clearly the one-to-one relationship
between Mr Major and Mr Clinton is not as strong as that of
Thatcher/Reagan and Macmillan/Kennedy, but senior figures say the two
countries always will have a rapport.
Mr Richard Holbrook, US Assistant Secretary of State, told BBC radio
yesterday: ''This is not a fence-mending exercise because although there
are a few holes in the fence at the moment, it is still a very strong
relationship. The relationship is special but that doesn't mean
perfect.''
One senior American diplomat in London said: ''Sure we have been
through a rough patch but the differences are tactical rather than
substantive.''
Downing Street officials travelling with the Prime Minister were
equally determined to put the Adams row behind them.
''It is no secret that we had our difference of view about the Adams
visit and the fund raising that has happened, but we are not looking
backwards on this, we are looking forwards,'' said one.
Among the senior figures lined up to meet Mr Major are Vice-President
Al Gore, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Jesse Helms of the
influential Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Senate Republican
leader Bob Dole. The Prime Minister is due back in London on Wednesday
evening.

NEGOTIATIONS aimed at halting the North Atlantic halibut war between
Canada and the European Union appeared to be heading for success again
last night after almost collapsing over the weekend.
After meeting twice over the weekend, officials from both sides were
working on a draft deal to be put before European Commission officials
in Brussels and senior government figures in Canada today.
It is probable that any settlement will be put before the EU's Council
of Ministers at a special meeting in Luxembourg on Thursday.
''The talks are still going on and we are still making progress,'' a
Canadian official said during a break in the discussion.
An EU official said: ''There is light at the end of the tunnel.''
Spanish trawlers re-entered the disputed fishing grounds of the Grand
Banks, off Newfoundland, late on Friday, angering the Canadians and
threatening the negotiations. The Canadians accused the Spanish of
deliberate provocation.
The Spanish responded by accusing the Canadians of making late and
fresh demands about inspection procedures for checking catches.
However, these problems appeared to have been overcome by yesterday
morning. Throughout yesterday, officials sounded much more optimistic
but would not go into details as the discussions continued into the
night.
The Canadian fisheries minister, Mr Brian Tobin, said a deal was
possible over the weekend and Canada would not jeopardise the talks, at
least for now, by taking action against Spanish trawlers in the disputed
waters.
''What is important is that the talks are continuing again today in
Brussels. We are making very good progress and I can't say whether or
not we will conclude these talks this weekend, but it is possible,'' he
said.

A 12-year-old girl was readmitted to an Edinburgh hospital last night
and put under observation following an incident at a football match
between Hearts and Falkirk on Saturday.
Dawn Wilson, 12, of Rosewell, Midlothian, suffered head injuries after
Falkirk player Steve Kirk kicked the ball into the Wheatfield stand from
close range, catching her in the face and head.
Kirk, 32, of Kennoway, Fife, is now the subject of a police
investigation.
Dawn -- taken to her first Hearts match by father Bryan -- was treated
by staff at Tynecastle after the incident just before half time. She was
later transferred to the Sick Children's Hospital in Edinburgh for
further treatment and then sent home with her parents.
However, yesterday morning she suffered dizzy spells and headaches and
was again taken to the Sick Children's Hospital. Hospital staff said
yesterday her condition was good and she was well.
Her father, who had also been at the game with his son, accused Kirk
of being ''an idiot'' for powering the ball into a section of the stand
popular with families and children.
He told The Herald last night: ''My lassie is back in hospital and I
just want to have her back and better. The police are involved and I
don't want that player anywhere near my girl.''
Dawn's mother, Carol, said it was lucky her daughter was not wearing
her glasses as normal -- they were broken the day of the match and she
had to watch the game without them.
She said Dawn was upset by the incident.
Mr Wilson's comments followed a plan to reunite Kirk and Dawn at a
South Queensferry hotel yesterday. The player wanted to apologise
publicly to the youngster.
However, around the time they were due to meet, Dawn was taken back to
hospital.
At the hotel, Kirk said he was deeply sorry for the incident and
wanted to offer Dawn the hospitality of Falkirk FC at a future match.
However, after Saturday's game, she was said to have told first aid
staff she never wanted to go back to another Hearts versus Falkirk
meeting.
Kirk said: ''I wanted to apologise to her face to face. I know what
it's like to get a ball in the face and I certainly wouldn't like it if
it happened to my young son. Hopefully, we can rectify the matter
another time.''
Kirk said he had not been interviewed by police but realised it was a
sensitive issue ''coming on the back'' of Eric Cantona's sentencing last
week for attacking a Crystal Palace supporter.
He explained what happened seconds before Dawn, who was sitting seven
rows back, was hit.
He said: ''I just kicked the ball out of the park into the stand. One
of our players was injured and I wanted to get the ball off the pitch.
At the time, I didn't realise what had happened. It was a nightmare when
I found out what happened. There was no malice or intent. I certainly
didn't know it was a family section.''
He said the club felt it was an ''unfortunate incident''. Kirk is due
to meet manager Jim Jeffries today.
A Lothian and Borders Police spokesman said Dawn had been treated for
tenderness to the muscles in her neck.
He said an investigation was under way.

<HEADLINE>GDA scheme is backed. Chamber U-turn on festival site plan</HEADLINE>

GLASGOW Chamber of Commerce did an apparent U-turn yesterday and gave
its backing to Glasgow Development Agency's ''bold and ambitious''
scheme for Pacific Quay.
The chamber's council said it was now unanimous in supporting the #80m
scheme for the former 43-acre Garden Festival site which will be carried
out by Edinburgh-based Miller Developers together with CTP Ltd from
Manchester. The plans include a national science park, a multiplex
cinema, and a number of office, leisure, and retail components.
''We are now convinced that the Miller/CTP proposal, backed by the
GDA, merits our support. We agree with them that this site is not just
the best in Glasgow but is the best in Scotland and is crucial to the
future development of the Glasgow city centre area,'' the chamber said.
Its former chairman, Mr Geoffrey Johnston, had endorsed previous
proposals by the Clyde Maritime Trust for the site, aspects of which
have been assimilated into a rival proposal put forward by a private
company, the Clyde Festival Gardens 1999 Ltd. It favours a maritime
heritage centre and Tivoli Gardens-style development, along with the
retail, catering and office components.
However, Mr Johnston said yesterday: ''In late 1993, we were
unenthusiastic about the original GDA plan for the site which suggested
it was destined to be a business park with some minor leisure and
tourist interests. Given the site's strategic value, we felt that was an
inappropriate and unacceptable solution.
''By comparison, at the time we believed the Clyde Festival Gardens
proposal, put forward by the Clyde Maritime Trust, deserved support for
its innovative scheme which had at its heart the river Clyde and the
Maritime Heritage Centre together with the Tivoli Gardens concept.
''GDA then appointed a successful developer whose new scheme was
centred around a national science centre, a bold and impressive
concept.''
Mr Johnston said they had looked closely at the schemes. However, they
differed in one crucial aspect, that of committed funding support.
He said: ''The reality is that the GDA owns the site and has a
developer ready to put hard cash on the ground, while Clyde Maritime
does not own this site or any of the sites it seeks to develop, nor does
it have any funding available.
''We take no sides on the architectural merits of either scheme. If
the GDA scheme is acceptable to the director of planning, we are happy
to place our faith in his judgment. But, since we are a business
organisation, we must support the party which can make the project
happen.
''We are therefore supporting the GDA's proposals in the belief they
are best for business, and best for Glasgow.''
Chamber chief executive Mr Geoff Runcie said: ''A business assessment
of the facts and figures demonstrated that only the Miller/CTP proposal
had real development backing.
''The chamber expected to see a science centre of sufficient
proportions to meet the objective claims that this will be an

<HEADLINE>Labour doubts on Stewart's Lockerbie trial plan</HEADLINE>

DOUBTS over the feasibility of arranging for a Scottish court and jury
to sit abroad are likely to prevent Labour from supporting an amendment
to the new Criminal Justice Bill which could bring about a trial for the
Lockerbie bombing.
The amendment, tabled by former Scottish Office minister Allan
Stewart, would allow a Scottish court and jury to sit abroad for the
trial of the two Libyans charged with carrying out the attack.
Libya has refused to hand over the men, who are accused of murdering
the 270 people who died when Pan Am flight 103 exploded above Lockerbie
in 1988, claiming they would not receive a fair trial in Scotland, or
the United States.
Mr Stewart's amendment offers a potential solution by keeping the case
within the jurisdiction of the Scottish legal system while satisfying
Libyan demands that the trial be held in a neutral third county,
possibly The Hague in the Netherlands.
The amendment will be opposed by the Government when it comes up in
the Commons Committee considering the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill.
With a Government majority of one on the committee, Labour's support for
Mr Stewart could force a defeat.
However, although the Scottish Labour leadership is sympathetic to the
demands of those campaigning for a solution to the impasse, it is
understood to be concerned about the feasibility of having a Scottish
court sit abroad.
Sources suggest there are ''fundamental problems'' including the need
to alter Scots law to fit in with European law which could result in a
''mongrel court''. However, Labour is not yet prepared to dismiss Mr
Stewart's clause, and will wait for the committee debate, expected after
Easter.
Labour MP Tam Dalyell, who sits on the committee and who will support
the amendment, said yesterday he would fight to secure his party's
backing. He said he had received assurances from Deputy Shadow Scottish
Secretary John McFall that Labour would back the amendment.
''I would be astonished if we didn't,'' he said.
Yesterday Mr McFall, who leads for Labour on the committee, said his
side would wait ''with interest'' to hear Mr Stewart explain his idea.
Mr Stewart's proposes to visLibya from next Friday, to meet Libyan
government officials with the aim of persuading them to accept his idea.
The former minister, who will announce details of his trip today, will
write to all the MPs on the committee explaining the reasoning behind
the new clause. He does not accept the argument that procedural
difficulties would make it impossible for a Scottish court to sit in a
third country.
Meanwhile, the British authorities yesterday refused to comment on a
newspaper report which named an Arab businessman as the mastermind
behind the Lockerbie bombing.
It claimed that Dr Ihsan Barbouti, who had offices in London and
Malta, planned the attack, and received #3.2m from a Libyan account.
Officially, Dr Barbouti died in 1990 after suffering a heart attack,
but the newspaper suggests he may have faked his own death to avoid
capture and trial.

<HEADLINE>#80m park with an all-Scots theme</HEADLINE>

AN #80m Scottish Heritage Park in central Scotland has been put
forward for Millennium Commission funding.
The private-sector project would create about 1100 jobs, with
estimates of more than a million visitors a year.
The 150-acre theme park aims to be open all year round with a number
of wet weather pavilions devoted to various aspects of Scottish life and
culture.
The project is looking for #19m from the commission, with the backers
confident they can raise around #30m in private equity capital and a
further #18m in syndicated private debt. The balance, around #13m, will
be sought from public-sector agencies, like Scottish Enterprise.
The project, which has already won enthusiastic backing from the
Scottish Tourist Board, will include interactive exhibitions devoted to
various themes, such as the history of the clan system, castles, and
battles.
There will be working versions of a whisky distillery, a woollen mill,
and a Highland village and a wax museum of prominent Scots. One pavilion
will be devoted to Scottish achievements in science and technology.
Outdoors there will separate flora and fauna parks, a children's play
area, and other attractions. The complex also plans to include a
3000-seater arena for Scottish music and dance.
The precise location of the project is being kept secret but an
outline deal has been done with the current landowner and speculation
about the site centres on the Stirling or Perth areas.
The team behind the project is led by Mr Robert Saunders, former
marketing director for the SECC in Glasgow. Others include Sir David
Roche, one of the developers of what was the Forum Hotel, now the Moat
House, on the SECC site; accountant Jim Henderson; Mr Ted Allen,
president of the Bureau Internationale des Expositions, a trade fair
operator; and Professor Eddie Friel, former tourism executive in
Glasgow.
The company, Scottish Heritage Park, also has the services of Mr Don
Waisanen, principal adviser on live entertainment to American brewer
Anheuser Busch, the company which runs Busch Gardens theme parks in
California and Florida.
Lead consultants are Coopers &amp; Lybrand and SHP has engaged landscape
design consultants Gillespies and architects, The Parr Partnership, to
develop conceptual designs. Event Communications, specialists in
interactive exhibitions, are also on board.
The project is also thought to have initial support from the local
enterprise company covering the area of the planned site. Pieda, the
planning consultancy headed up by Professor Donald MacKay, chairman of
Scottish Enterprise, is also on the team of advisers.
Those close to the scheme say they have planned it on careful market
research of what tourists want when they come to Scotland and what will
attract maximum local interest.
If the project does get its funding together and wins planning
permission for the park, work could start in spring next year, with the
opening set for spring 1998.

SEVEN-year-old Irma Hadzimuratovic, whose plight after a Serb mortar
attack moved a nation, lost her fight for life at the weekend, but for
many it was not a vain struggle. Her example forced the way open to the
West for other child victims of the war.
Menira Drace, 12, was also rescued from the war-torn former Yugoslavia
and brought to the UK. She had faced a struggle against failing health
in the Bosnian enclave of Mostar with a growing hole in her heart. She
and her mother Edina, 40, were taken through the Croat lines by the UN.
Twelve days ago, surgeon Mr Kenneth McArthur operated on her at the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow.
Dr William Doig, her consultant cardiologist, said yesterday: ''The
operation was a success and she is doing fine.''
She is expected to be fit soon to return to Mostar and her father,
Maid, 41, and nine-year-old brother Mithad.
Meanwhile it was reported that Irma died peacefully in her sleep in
Great Ormond Street Children's Hospital in London.
Her plight in a war-torn Sarajevo hospital no longer able to provide
the treatment she needed caused an outcry in Britain.
Mr Major, who cut through red tape so that Irma could get out of
Bosnia in August 1993, said he was ''deeply saddened'' by the news.
Irma, who had developed meningitis and gone into a coma as a result of
her shrapnel wounds, was still paralysed and on a ventilator after she
recovered consciousness.
She recently developed complications which prevented her from eating
and was being fed intravenously; finally she developed a blood
infection.

<HEADLINE>Portillo rules out challenge. Backing for Major linked with crisis. Portillo rules out challenge to Major's party leadership.</HEADLINE>

THE Employment Secretary, Mr Michael Portillo, yesterday boosted Tory
unity by ruling himself out as a challenger to Mr Major, then rocked the
party by admitting it was in crisis.
By his statement that ''I would never challenge'' him, he strengthened
Mr Major's claim to the leadership of the party, calling also on his
right-wing supporters to back the Prime Minister.
However, his expression of ''absolute confidence'' in Mr Major came
with a potentially devastating blow to party morale, when he admitted
that the Conservatives were in crisis only 24 hours after Mr Major's
attempt to relaunch his Government.
With four days to go before the Scottish local elections, the
standard-bearer of the Tory right surprised his colleagues by conceding
that the Government faces devastating results in Scotland and in the
English elections next month.
He also appeared to undermine Mr Major's efforts to impose discipline
on the party by openly declaring the depth of its difficulties. ''The
crisis that is faced by our party is not that they (supporters) have
lost faith in what we want to do or what we have done but rather that
the difference between the parties has become blurred,'' he said.
Labour immediately capitalised on his use of the word ''crisis''.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said Mr Portillo's remark showed that
''the Tory Party is falling apart 24 hours after its relaunch''.
Shadow Environment Secretary Frank Dobson said: ''The relaunched John
Major has been sunk by his own side. Tory candidates throughout the
country will be outraged by the Prime Minister ordering the charge of
the light brigade and Michael Portillo telling them they need not
bother.''
The damage caused by Mr Portillo was highlighted by the reaction from
the Tory right, traditionally Mr Portillo's closest supporters. Mrs
Teresa Gorman, MP for Billericay and one of those who has lost the whip,
said she remained optimistic: ''Despite what some of the newspapers are
implying -- or even, it appears, Michael Portillo -- the canvass returns
around the country for the Conservatives are remarkably bright.
''On the doorstep, people are regaining their confidence and so I am
certainly not writing off the local elections and I think I want to give
three cheers to all those people out there slogging it round the doors.
I shall be out there with them.''
On Saturday, Mr Portillo ignored Central Office efforts to preserve
party optimism by admitting he felt ''very sorry'' for Tory councillors
facing defeat in the elections. Yesterday, he back-tracked, saying he
had ''no particular reason to know whether we're going to do as we did
last time or worse or better. I make the general point that it is
difficult in the middle of a Parliament.''
His remarks left the Cabinet struggling to present a united front.
Transport Secretary Brian Mawhinney insisted he was optimistic and that
the electorate would back what the Conservatives had achieved.
Despite a number of Tory supporters who were ''less enthusiastic'' in
their recent voting patterns, Dr Mawhinney said: ''I am optimistic.
People will look at what we have achieved and the shallowness of the
alternative.
''But I am not trying to suggest that life has not been difficult.
People have been hurt and people's confidence has been affected. We need
to reassure people that the Government is in control.''
He refused to back Mr Portillo's assessment of Tory chances. ''What
Michael was reflecting was a factual analysis of what has been happening
as far as elections are concerned. I have absolutely no intention of
speculating on figures.''
On the leadership, Mr Portillo made it clear to his supporters that a
challenge would damage the party. ''If the Conservative Party gets into
the habit, half-way through each Parliament, of removing its leader, I
don't think it's going to do the party any good. I don't think that
helps our credibility.''
On London Weekend Television's Dimbleby programme, he refused to rule
himself out as a candidate should Mr Major stand aside. ''Any
speculation on whatever basis . . . is unhelpful to the position of our
leader. I just don't see why I should be led into that sort of
speculation,'' he said.
As for a direct challenge against Mr Major before the next election,
Mr Portillo said: ''I can say absolutely unequivocally that I would
never challenge Mr Major.
''I have absolute confidence in him. I believe he will continue to be
the leader until the next election and will lead us into the next
election. I think that would be, I am sure that would be, the view of
every single member of the Cabinet. He has our complete support.''
To those on the right who were plotting against the Prime Minister, Mr
Portillo said his message was ''lay off, stop it''.

THE BBC will face a twin attempt to place a legal block on its plans
to broadcast an interview with Prime Minister John Major on tonight's
current affairs programme Panorama.
All three opposition parties believe the high-profile interview with
Mr Major, which was recorded yesterday, flies in the face of legislation
about political balance on the airwaves in the run-up to an election.
This morning, the Labour Party and Scottish Liberal Democrats will
issue a writ for an interim interdict in the Court of Session in
Edinburgh to halt the transmission of the programme until after
Thursday's elections for the new Scottish local authorities.
The Scottish National Party believes the injuction may fail, despite
giving it moral support, and late last night announced an alternative
legal strategy against the BBC's broadcasting plan.
Party lawyers spent the weekend in detailed discussion over the best
way to stop the Major interview being broadcast.
The SNP leader, Mr Alex Salmond, the Scottish Liberal Democrat Leader,
Mr Jim Wallace, and Labour's Shadow Scottish Secretary, Mr George
Robertson, were locked in negotiation over a solution which would be
amenable to all sides.
Senior party officials, Mr Jack McConnell, Mr Andy Miles, and Mr Mike
Russell were on hand to give and take political advice.
However, at 10pm yesterday, a tripartite compromise for an interdict
was jettisoned with the SNP electing to adopt its own tactic and seek a
judicial review on the issue -- getting a judge to examine whether the
broadcast contravenes the Representation of the Peoples Act.
Last night, Mr Myles, the Scottish Liberal Democrat chief executive
said: ''We want to stop the Tories abusing the BBC and an interdict is
obviously the legal way to stop the programme being shown.''
Labour's Scottish general secretary, Mr McConnell, added: ''To us,
there was no point in tackling the issue after the event as a judicial
review would do.
''It doesn't matter how unpopular or incompetent John Major is, this
interview could affect the result of the elections -- there is a point
of principle at stake.''
Mr Russell, the chief executive of the SNP, said: ''Although we
support what the Liberal Democrats and Labour want to do -- and wish
them every success -- after taking the highest legal opinion we think
their intentions are unlikely to succeed.
''We will take the initial steps towards a judicial review but will
not issue the writ until after we have had a response from the Director
General of the BBC. Any action we then take will be in the light of his
response.
''At the end of the day, we are using different tactics to achieve the
same result.''
The three partes had no shortage of expert legal opinion to call upon,
before deciding their strategy.
In Lord McCluskey, QC, Mr Menzies Campbell, QC, and Professor Neil
MacCormick, Dean of the Faculty of Law at Edinburgh University, Labour,
Liberal Democrat, and SNP have three of the finest legal minds in
Scotland on their side, although the final legal advice may have come
from other quarters.
Privately, senior BBC Scotland sources say their hands are tied and
that it is a UK network decision. Senior managers believe their London
counterparts have not appreciated the seriousness of the situation.
Over the weekend, BBC Scotland preparations were still going on for an
additional programme with Scottish party leaders on Tuesday night in an
attempt to redress the political balance.
Under the heading Balance of Coverage, the producers' guidelines
state: ''In accordance with this principle, the BBC undertakes to
maintain balance, over a period of a campaign, in its recorded actuality
of political speeches and film, videotape, and studio contributions from
politicians.''
A spokeswoman for Panorama said: ''Our coverage across all programmes
will be balanced throughout this election and we do not believe we have
breached the producer guidelines.
''We stand by our previous position and the programme will still go
out as planned.''

THREE bodies were recovered yesterday in Glencoe six weeks after a
father, his son, and a friend were killed by an avalanche in Coire Na
Tulaich on 3345ft Buachaille Etive Mor.
The climbers who died were 50-year-old research engineer Allan Lang,
of Leeds Road, Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, his son Richard, 18, a student,
and his friend, also a student, 18-year-old Paul Bower, of West Lea
Crescent, Tingley, Wakefield, West Yorkshire.
The three had been practising ice-axe techniques on the lower slopes
of the corrie when the avalanche struck on February 21. Despite repeated
searches, when rescuers risked their lives as they faced the threat of
further avalanches, the bodies were not found.
A Northern Constabulary police spokesman said last night that the
bodies had been removed from the mountain and taken to Fort William. He
added that formal identification was not expected to be made until
today.
The first body was spotted by chance by two members of RAF Kinloss
mountain rescue team who were descending Buchaille Etive Mor yesterday
about 1pm after a recreational climb in the area. They alerted local
rescue teams.
Members of Glencoe mountain rescue team began a search of the area.
The Kinloss team was also sent to Glencoe to assist in the search.
The Glencoe team recovered the first body then found the two others
buried nearby in the snow later in the afternoon.
Twenty-one lives have been lost in the Scottish mountains so far this
year. The bodies of four other climbers have still to be recovered.
* An Ardrossan man, Mr Gerard John Flavelle, 43, died at the weekend
while walking in the Lake District. He was in Tongue Ghyll, near
Grasmere, when he collapsed suffering from chest pains. A local mountain
rescue team tried but failed to revive him.
An unnamed hillwalker from Dumfries and Galloway collapsed and died
near Grizedale Tarn on Helvellyn in the Lake District yesterday.
