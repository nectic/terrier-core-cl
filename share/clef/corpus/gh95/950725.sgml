CAR maker Nissan is testing a meter that monitors drivers' tiredness
levels. A tiny camera measures blinking patterns, sending the
information to an on-board computer, which can tell if alertness falls
below a set level. If the driver begins to nod off, a buzzer sounds and
a fresh mint spray is injected into the passenger compartment. A
spokesman said: ''A blast of peppermint has been found to keep a dozy
driver alert for up to 16 minutes.''

Lonely Road to the Aisle
IN Scotland in 1993 there were 33,366 marriages, down from 35,057 the
year before. The only obvious trend, however, is a decrease in the rate
of people getting married at all.
The proportion of people marrying for the first time has fallen by
about nine per 1000 in the past decade. Latest available figures show
that in 1984 the number of spinsters who married was 50 per 1000 of
population. By 1993, the figure was 41. For bachelors the figure was
57.7 in 1984, dropping to 48.9 in 1993.
The 1993 statistics show that the most popular age for marriage is
between 20 and 24 for women (10,738) and between 25 and 29 for men
(11,266) and teenage marriages are few and far between: 339 bridegrooms
and 1229 brides were aged between 16 and 19.
The collapse of much of the rigid social codes surrounding marriage
has created the freedom for people to reinterpret it in a way which is
relevant for the end of the century. Elizabeth Westcott explores modern
expectations
IT'S a good thing, marriage. It's different every year, I'm sure
you've found that too. Sometimes people come into the surgery and I wish
I could write on the prescription pad ''Marriage'' because it's clear
that that's exactly what they need. Mind you, I must admit I also see
some patients for whom I'd like to prescribe a speedy divorce. (Nothing
is Black, by Deirdre Madden.)
WITH almost half of British married couples prescribing for themselves
a speedy divorce, and prophets of doom foreshadowing the eventual demise
of marriage as an institution because we no longer need it, there
remains a curious fact. We are still getting married.
A whole new generation now in their twenties and early thirties, many
of whom watched their parents' marriages fold up and disintegrate --
even if they didn't divorce -- are still optimistically setting out on
the search for a partner. A happy, fulfilling marriage, despite the
evidence of how difficult it is to achieve, is still seen to be a
reasonable goal.
There is, it seems, a new freedom surrounding this ancient
institution, which is among our society's last remaining ''rites of
passage''. The past 30 years have seen the collapse of much of the rigid
social codes surrounding marriage, creating the freedom for people to
reinterpret marriage in a way which is relevant for the end of the
century. Couples can now marry at a more mature age, live together
first, redefine roles within marriage, and write the vows that are most
appropriate for them. As 23-year-old Brian Casey, from Glasgow, put it:
''I want to be in a relationship because life's too lonely to spend it
on your own, and marriage is the logical conclusion of that
relationship. It's telling your community you love this person and you
need their support. It's almost primitive.
''There are two forms of marriage; free union and institutionalised
marriage. I have seen marriages break down and I'm aware there are all
sorts of relationships and families, but marriage transcends cultures
and boundaries. There will always be a need for a contract to formalise
that love.''
Pamela Mozingo believes a natural, almost instinctive drive to settle
with one person is what motivates people to continue marrying. Julie
Inglis sees people as seeking out stability and enjoying the sense of an
ultimate promise. Ian Hodgson, who has been looking for his future wife
for more than 10 years, believes that life can be truly fulfilling only
if it is shared with an appropriate partner:
''Marriage is the ultimate expression of love, legally and
religiously. It is seen as the crowning way.''
Clinical psychologist Jenny Cozens, author of To Have and To Hold,
Men, Sex and Marriage, believes that the desire to marry partly stems
from a need to make up for what people missed from their parents'
marriage and consequent parenting.
''If you look at your own relationship with your parents and where it
failed you, you'll have some clue as to what you're really looking for
from your partner,'' explained Cozens.
''People say to themselves, 'I am not going to fall into that trap, it
doesn't have to be disastrous,' and marriage does keep people together.
Despite early experiences you can still work those things out. People
make wonderful moves within marriage.''
Pamela Mozingo, now 35, says she can see clearly how her own love-life
and search for a marriage partner is a continuation of her parents'
story.
''My parents divorced when I was four, and I'm always recreating what
happened. There have been people who would have married me, but I always
chose the one who would abandon me,'' she said. ''What I really wanted
to do is recreate the situation and then make it work -- but something
stopped me; I knew somehow that it would end in divorce. I think the
reasons people get married are complex.''
Most people, even the offspring of successful unions, would
acknowledge that we are driven by subconscious expectations, although
few would sit down with a counsellor to work out their Oedipal impulses
before saying ''I do''. Pamela says she would insist on premarital
counselling, if only to establish what the causes of conflict are likely
to be, but the others interviewed saw the presence of an impartial third
party as unnecessary.
Brian Casey and his girlfriend Julie Inglis, also from Glasgow, are
planning to marry eventually. Julie believes that while it is important
to understand her partner's background, premarital counselling is not
the only way.
''I would only consider it if there were already problems -- don't go
looking for them. You do need to talk about what your expectations are,
but I think you can share your ideas and draw from your parents just
between yourselves,'' she said. ''Because we're getting married a lot
later we can recognise the stages marriages go through.''
Brian Casey was equally adamant on the premarital counselling
question:
''It should be free of all coercion, including so-called expert
advice. It's a very, very private matter, even if statistically a
marriage looks as though it could be a total mess.''
Until Victorian times, romantic love was not considered a serious
motivation for marriage. Now it seems the sparkling essential
ingredient, although most people seem to be aware that it won't carry
them beyond the first few years. Indeed, according to Cozens, the more
couples rely on romantic love the more they will end up disappointed.
However, marrying for any other reason, to play homemaker to his
breadwinner, for financial gain or social prestige, has become virtually
obsolete.
''I wouldn't get married for any reason other than romantic love,''
said Julie. ''It's a good reason but there's a part of me that wonders
if I am looking at it with both eyes open! But it has to be there, I
think.''
Ian Hodgson says he can't imagine anyone entering a marriage devoid of
romance, but it is not the key to success.
''I think romantic love is closer linked to adoration and desire -- I
don't think it's the type of love that goes to making a great marriage.
True love is taking someone on board and accepting them in their true
essence -- you need to step away from the passion of moments to examine
whether you can live with this person in the light of day.''
The cultural forces which shape the younger generation are very
different to those which influenced their parents. Probably the most
dramatic of these changes is the altered status of women, a shift which
psychologist Jenny Cozens believes will have a lasting impact on the
future of marriage.
''I actually think the future depends on how men can handle the very
real change in women's status. People will have to work out a whole new
way of being married.''
For Julie Inglis, it is precisely that change in status which has made
it possible for her to consider marriage.
''I used to think I'd never get married, until I met Brian. I saw it
as giving a man too much power, and I used to worry about the legal
aspect; I'd heard so many stories about women left with nothing,'' she
said. ''But I've finally realised it is possible to have an equal
relationship.''
Ian Hodgson believes that the institution of marriage has taken such a
battering that what he calls ''the ascendency of women'' is just one of
the many factors. Nevertheless, he say it is increasingly difficult to
judge how to project masculinity.
''You're told to be strong and 'be a man' but you're also told to show
your feminine side; those forces are in direct conflict sometimes,'' he
said.
''This decade men have had to review what they mean to women. I sense
a heightened level of accountability when it comes to my behaviour
towards women. Obviously in the 1950s there needed to be a redress, but
we should be careful we don't take that to a ridiculous degree. Men and
women are different and should stay different.''
Jenny Cozens explores our society's need to maintain the differences
between the sexes in her book. Interestingly, she states that scientists
are more likely to find differences within the sexes than between them:
''Women are no more and no less intelligent than men, nor has it been
proved that they have different spatial skills or reasoning abilities.
We must have some pretty deep-seated need to insist on the contrary as
we do.''
Believing this, says Cozens, is bound to affect marriages. It all
worked beautifully when the homemaker/breadwinner model was in place but
now it's gone and couples are faced with the difficulties of having to
reinvent their roles within marriage.
Finally, one of the major reasons people continue getting married is
because they still want to have children. Single parenting has become a
genuine alternative and certainly a loving single parent is better for
children than being subjected to a destructive marriage. However, there
is still a general feeling that two loving parents who enjoy a healthy
marriage is the optimum environment. Pamela, who was brought up by her
mother, believes this:
''It is possible to be a single parent but it's extremely tough -- I
wouldn't want to do it. From my experience the child does need a father
and a mother. When they're growing up kids need to relate to the
opposite sex parent and also watch how their parents interrelate --
which is why it is so important the marriage is healthy.''
Although it is no longer necessary to get married, this old-fashioned
ritual is likely to remain an important part of our social fabric,
people need long-term relationships and we haven't found a better
solution. Despite her first-hand experience of the difficulties many
couples experience, Jenny Cozens does not believe the institution has
had its day.
''I actually feel quite optimistic about marriage. The other side of
the divorce statistic is that more than half of marriages survive,
despite the temptation to go elsewhere. I think marriage will go on
being a key in our society.''

* This week's tip comes from SANDY STRACHAN, the professional at
Bathgate Golf Club.
THE No.7-wood is the perfect utility club. It is great for using in
deep rough, or from bad or tight lies on the fairway. I would
particularly recommend the type with railer soles.
It is certainly a far easier club to use than the long irons. In
rough, they tend to get tangled in the grass and the clubface opens or
closes causing a real damaging shot.
Modern No.7-woods are designed to go the same distance as the long
irons, and no-one should suffer from an inferiority complex if they have
one in the bag.
The set-up for the No.7-wood is to have the ball well forward in the
stance, just inside the left heel. It is essential to make an in-to-out
swing path.
With any fairway wood, the most common mistake is trying to attack the
shot with the shoulders.
That leads to an out-to-in pathway, the clubhead comes across the
ball, and prevents the ball from rising into the air.
The correct method is to initiate the downswing with the hips --
attack it from an inside line.
No.7-woods are becoming more and more popular, and no wonder. They can
get you out of a lot of trouble, and are far easier to master than the
No.2 or No.3-irons.

IN the aftermath of his famous victory in the Open championship, John
Daly yesterday again took the cup affectionately in his hands and,
looking at the famous names engraved on it ahead of his own, said:
''It's amazing to be part of this. I've won a major title sober and I
hope that helps the people all over the world who are fighting alcohol
problems.''
Daly added: ''I'm just very fortunate to be here. Fuzzy Zoeller (the
former US Open and Masters champion who has been Daly's guide and mentor
on the US tour) says he won't get in a car with me because I drive
better drunk than sober, but six years ago I nearly killed my brother
and I haven't had a drink since December 21, 1992.''
The accident occurred when Daly, driving at 80mph in a 35mph area,
skidded and crashed. His brother was thrown from the car, but survived
without a scratch and it also was about that time when Daly was stopped
by a police patrolman who said to him: ''Son, you've been drinking a
little,'' to which Daly replied: ''No, sir, I've been drinking a lot.''
In contrast, Daly's celebration on Sunday evening consisted of eating
two steaks and ''a huge bowl of chocolate ice cream which kept me on the
john a good part of the night. Anyway I wasn't in the mood for sleep --
just talked with my wife, Paulette, and some friends and not very much
about golf.''
Daly, aged 29, whose turbulent life has already included three
marriages, assault charges, suspension from the US Tour, and a further
period away on, as it were, the suggestion of the tour's commissioner,
Tim Finchem, explained: ''Alcoholism is a problem that's with you every
day and the trouble is that golf is so stressful it encourages you to
want to drink.''
Then Daly, who won his first major, the US PGA championship in 1991,
added: ''It's been an astonishing four years of ups and downs. I've made
my share of mistakes, but I'm healthy now, my family's healthy and I'm
alive, and that means so much to me. And I just love being a father.''
Daly, who last year made unsubstantiated allegations that some
professional golfers used drugs, expressed gratitude to three of his
contemporaries, US Open champion Corey Pavin, Brad Faxon, and Bob Estes,
for their encouragement before the play-off in which he comprehensively
outplayed Italy's Costantino Rocca. ''We all make mistakes, but you suck
them up and just go on,'' Daly reflected.
Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal and Ancient Club, paid Daly
a glowing tribute. ''The way he won was good for golf. His humble
background and troubled times are obviously not typical of the game.
I've always found him an easy-going fellow, quite shy and grateful for
anything done for him.''
Bonallack, who disclosed that as long ago as last October he had
picked out Daly as a potential winner (without, however, backing his
judgment with a bet), added: ''He was successful in the Dunhill Club
over the Old Course two years ago and he has the ideal game -- hits it
right to left and has a very inventive short game.''
That was vividly illustrated by the punch shot -- he called it a chip
-- Daly hit from the rough on to the seventeenth green, the third hole
of the play-off. But over the four days of the championship, Daly
himself selected his driving and approach putting from the exceptionally
long distances unavoidable on the double greens, as being the strength
of his game.
Bonallack's one doubt was over Daly's patience. ''He lost it in his
final round of 80 at Turnberry last year, but this time he showed
resilience and didn't get riled at all when things went wrong.'' And
Daly confirmed the improvement: ''I have more patience than ever before.
I hung in there on every shot over the four rounds, as I've been doing
all this season.''
Daly, who thanked his equipment and clothing sponsors for not
deserting him, said: ''If I'd lost them, this year would have been
really tough.'' As it was he had made little impression on the US Tour
this season, having missed the cut in five out of 16 tournaments and
finished no better than equal twelfth.
Now, however, he must be a prime candidate to play for the first time
in the Ryder Cup match against Europe in September, almost certainly as
one of the two selections the American captain Lanny Wadkins, must make.
There are only three counting tournaments left, culminating in the US
PGA championship in Los Angeles, and Daly is playing the next two weeks
in Europe, in Holland and Sweden.
Thus Daly will inevitably become embroiled in the complex business of
managing his time learning, as every newcomer to the experience must,
how and when to say ''no''. Daly noted: ''I was a very immature
25-year-old when I won the PGA. In 1991 I went everywhere, because I'd
never been anywhere.
''But if I'm to progress, I'll have to work out what's best for me to
play in and how that fits in with the travelling.''
A place in the last Johnnie Walker world championship in Jamaica
before Christmas is, for example, guaranteed and appearances in the
Toyota world matchplay and Dunhill Cup events in successive weeks in
October seem logical.
Whatever direction his personal life and career may take, Daly's Open
will always be remembered for its extraordinary climax -- Rocca's putt
through the Valley of Sin after his fluffed chip.
The one-sidedness of the play-off was an anti-climax, but Rocca's putt
still placed the finish for drama on a par with the 1970 and 1984 Opens
at headquarters and the 1977 championship at Turnberry.
The Italian was responsible for that and few are given the chance.

Labour urges health alerts, as concern mounts over claims that
Instants are addictive.
HERITAGE Secretary Virginia Bottomley yesterday came under pressure
from the Labour Party to introduce a health warning on ''addictive''
National Lottery scratchcards.
Shadow Heritage Secretary Chris Smith wrote to Mrs Bottomley to urge
her to print a warning on the back of all Instants cards.
The move comes amid increasing evidence that the popular scratchcards
could be addictive and are also played by children.
A counselling service has been set up for punters addicted to the
cards, which bring in about 40% of Lottery income.
An independent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation highlighted
the ''addictive nature'' of the game, which offers a top prize of
#50,000 for a stake of just #1.
The report also claimed 20% of calls now received by Gamblers
Anonymous were related to the National Lottery.
In his letter to Mrs Bottomley, Mr Smith called for a warning on all
Instants cards, similar to warnings on cigarette packets, about the
potentially addictive nature of the games and offering help where
players felt they were getting into difficulty.
''All the experts agree that the most addictive pastimes are those in
which the interval between staking a bet and hearing the result is
shortest. With scratchcards, this interval can be as little as 10
seconds,'' he said.
Mr Smith also expressed concern about evidence that large numbers of
children were playing the Instants game, despite being below the minimum
legal age of 16.
''Scratchcards are particularly attractive to children because they
are fun and provide instant gratification if a prize is won,'' he said.
Mr Smith's concern was backed up by Tranx Release in Nottingham, which
has set up a helpline for punters who say they are unable to pay their
bills because they squander their money.
The service, which is also considering asking Camelot to print health
warnings on the tickets, fears unsuccessful punters could be driven to
suicide.
A Tranx Release spokesman said: ''It's like an instant buzz for them.
They go into a shop and all they see are the scratch cards.
''They get a high when they are buying, but they plunge into awful
depression when they lose their money.''
But National Lottery organisers Camelot immediately ruled out the
possibility of health warnings being introduced on their cards.
Research carried out by the firm had shown that the average spending
on Instants was just #2 a week, a spokeswoman said.
''We don't believe there is a widespread problem with people spending
more than they can afford.
''Instants are on sale to the over-16s and we feel at that age and
over, people are responsible enough to decide how much they spend and
ensure they do not spend beyond their means.''
She added: ''We don't plan to issue a health warning, although we will
continue to keep an eye on the situation.''
A spokesman for the Lottery watchdogs, Offlot, said there were no
immediate plans for introducing a health warning but added that the
organisation had commissioned research into spending habits to
investigate the addictive allegations.
But he stressed there was, as yet, ''no firm evidence'' that the
Instants game could become a habit.
A spokesman for the Department of National Heritage said there were no
plans to introduce health warnings on scratchcards but the department
and Oflot had commissioned research into the possible addictive effects
of the game.
He also repeated Oflot's point that there was ''no hard evidence''
that the game was addictive but conceded that the watchdog did have ''a
duty not to license games which could be addictive''.
The spokesman also stressed that Camelot had repeatedly warned
retailers of the ''strongest consequences'' if they sold tickets to
under-age punters.

HEARTS chairman Chris Robinson last night made the first concrete move
to replace sacked Tommy McLean with Falkirk's Jim Jeffries.
The Brockville manager travelled back to Falkirk yesterday from the
club's North of Scotland tour with his chairman George Fulston.
Both men were aware that Robinson had tried to make contact with
Fulston in Inverness yesterday, but, as yet, no direct talks have taken
place.
And Falkirk, who have watched Jeffries carry them from the first
division into the top half of the premier division, will not be keen to
accommodate the return of Jeffries to Tynecastle.
Fulston will insist that an expression of the Edinburgh club's
interest be made formally in writing before considering whether to allow
talks between Jeffries and his former club.
However, realist that he is, Fulston will proceed on the basis that
his manager's long-standing ambition in the game has been to oversee the
club he served so well as a central defender.
One stumbling block will be compensation for Falkirk over the loss of
their manager, who is under contract until December.
That may take some time after a frosty relationship developed between
Fulston and Robinson during Maurice Johnston's move in the other
direction between the clubs earlier this season.
However, if that can be attended to, Jeffries will be in place at
Tynecastle for the end of the week, in time for Hearts' pre-season
friendly schedule.
His arrival will end a patient wait for the former Tynecastle player,
who on two occasions in the past four years was on the point of being
brought to the club by former chairman Wallace Mercer.
HAMILTON and Airdrie, who are still poles apart regarding the transfer
value of Accies striker Peter Duffield, have until Thursday to settle
matters. If no deal is reached by then the fee will be decided at a

Meanwhile, Hamilton have arranged a friendly for Monday, August 7,

Esbjerg 3, Rangers 3
THE Rangers roadshow rolled into the southern part of Jutland last
night without the powerful presence of Paul Gascoigne and without a
glimpse of the elusive Romanian, Florin Raducioiou, and the
unfamiliar-looking team which manager Walter Smith fielded could only
manage a draw against Danish second division side Esbjerg.
Rangers had started the game without skipper Richard Gough, and two of
his normal defensive partners, Alan McLaren and David Robertson, as well
as Gascoigne.
Then, in the second half, when Craig Moore was injured, first-team
coach Davie Dodds appeared at the heart of the defence as a replacement
for the Australian.
It was after these changes that the makeshift Ibrox defence lost the
three goals.
Afterwards, manager Walter Smith explained: ''We did not want to use
Paul Gascoigne, or David Robertson, because they have played in all the
pre-season games so far. We felt they deserved a breather.
''Richard Gough and Alan McLaren both have slight knocks, nothing
serious, but enough to cause me some slight worry.
''If the game had been important then they would have played but this
is not a time for taking chances with anyone's fitness.
''That is why we took Gordon Durie and Craig Moore off as both of them
picked up groin strains.
''Davie Dodds had to go on because he was all we had left.
''As for Gascoigne, he needed a breather and we want him fit for the
tournament at Ibrox when he will make his home debut. It's important
that he is ready for that.''
Rangers were two goals ahead at half-time.
The first arrived after 13 minutes when Durie dispossessed the Danish
keeper, Peter Jensen, as he tried to dribble a pass-back round forward.
The ball broke from Durie to Brian Laudrup, who crossed to Alexei
Mikhailichenko, and his pass across goal found Trevor Steven, who scored
from close range.
Eleven minutes before half-time Rangers scored a second.
This time, Laudrup threaded a ball through the defence and
Mikhailichenko moved on to the ball, beat a defender, and shot home into
the corner of the net.
A minute later Mark Hateley became the night's first substitute when
he took over from Durie, who had collected an injury setting up the
opening goal.
At the start of the second half, Colin Scott appeared for Andy Goram
and Ian Ferguson for Laudrup, who had felt a hamstring tighten.
Within four minutes the defence became even more makeshift when Moore
was injured in a tackle at the edge of the box.
He went off to be replaced by Dodds and the Danes scored from a free
kick with John Lauridsen beating the defensive wall and leaving Scott
helpless.
Within two minutes Michailichenko had scored again. Stephen Wright
sent in a cross, Steven glanced a header towards the far post, and the
Ukrainian was there to stab the ball over the line.
Rangers seemed comfortable, though there were moments of concern in a
defence which now had only one player left who would be likely to start
the season -- Wright.
Then, a bizarre decision by a linesman helped Esbjerg score a second.
Two Danish players looked offside when the ball was played. While the
Rangers defenders appealled, the linesman waved play on and Scott
brought down Chris Hermensen.
The referee awarded a penalty and Michael Pedersen sent the kick
beyond the keeper.
Then, two minutes from the end, the defence was left in tatters when
Morten Christensen broke down the right and fired a cross into the box.
Hermensen rose to send a header into the net and the Danish fans
celebrated all around the neat little stadium.
Said Smith later: ''These games are about getting players ready for
the important matches which lie ahead early in the season.
''What we have done so far on this tour is to get the players working
together but Gough and McLaren will play in Copenhagen.
''There will be a more settled look about us for that match.''
RANGERS -- Goram, Wright, Mikhailichenko, Cleland, Moore, Reid,
Steven, McCall, Durrant, Durie, Laudrup. Substitutes -- Scott, Ferguson,
Hateley, Dodds.

MOSCOW: A Siberian court yesterday sentenced to death one of two
prisoners who murdered their cell-mate, then cooked and ate some of his
internal organs. The other accused was given 15 years' imprisonment. The
pair, aged 23 and 25, strangled their 23-year-old victim before cutting
out his innards and cooking them in a wash bowl which they held over a
blazing blanket. They said they had done it ''to add some spice to their
life''.

Andrew Popple warns that time can run out for happy families.
ON Tuesday, June 13, The Herald was a really good read. By which I
mean, of course, that it was even better than usual. First, on page four
there was a report on a study which concludes that more than 50% of
fathers spend less than five minutes a day with their children. Many put
sports (theirs) ahead of being with their offspring.
In the same article a new book was mentioned, The Sixty Minute Father
by Rob Parsons. Then, on page 13, there was an article on a father's
role in sex education. My daughter gave it a rave review: ''A literary
masterpiece,'' or words to that effect, but as the piece was written by
her dad I suppose this doesn't count. More importantly, the main feature
on that page was a review of a book about motherhood, and the working
woman, spanning most of this century.
Being of an inquisitive nature, I decided to find out what Parsons had
to say. A title like The Sixty Minute Father immediately made me
suspicious. Rather than give the author royalties on a book I thought
was going to be rubbish I ordered it from our local librarian, who came
up with the goods in just a few days.
Well, the book isn't rubbish. And anyway, it's only #4.99. The sixty
minutes refers to the time it would take to read it, not the time you
need per week, year or lifetime to be an effective father.
The views, ideals and advice to a busy father are sound. The objective
cannot be faulted. However, its one great failure is that it is serious,
grimly light-hearted, written by a zealot with the single-minded focus I
once had as a student evangelist on the streets of Birmingham. And it
similarly goes for the heart and the gut, rather than the brain.
Its style will probably put off as many punters as I did. This is a
pity because it should be the kind of book a
sick-to-death-of-absent-father mum could leave on the passenger seat of
his car for traffic jam use, having cut the cables to his car phone.
I would have preferred to have seen the title The Sixty Minute Working
Parent, because the same problems beset the career female. Back to that
survey on time spent with children: I wonder what the statistics are for
working mothers, particularly those in high-pressure, long-hours jobs or
professions? I mean time spent with the children, not spent doing the
household child-related chores. Better, certainly, but not necessarily
by very much.
What does it mean for the children? You have to be careful with
statistics such as those quoted in the report. I am finding that it is
less important whether you spend five, or 50, minutes with the kids --
but they have to be the five or 50 that the children want, not those
convenient to you. And this is likely to be an aggregate figure made up
of lots of smaller interactions like answering questions, helping with
the dictionary and so on. This can be a drag, frankly.
The Law of Unreasonableness decrees that halfway through preparing the
dinner, mowing the lawn, having a business discussion on the phone, the
wee lad will want help with his jigsaw. If you say to him ''Wait'', he
is unlikely to come back -- he'll find something else to do and will not
learn how to do the difficult bit of the jigsaw. Parsons reckons that
sooner or later the child will give up coming to you.
Then there is this notion of ''quality time'', a period of
concentrated interaction with the children -- usually to fit in with the
busy parent's schedule. Forcing the children to have ''quality time''
when you come home late in the evening may not be what they want, or
need. But they won't tell you, because something is better than the only
other apparent option: nothing.
The countless quotes in Parsons's book from regretful fathers about
what they should have done, and from their children saying likewise,
should bring up short anyone who seriously disputes that last notion.
Are we soon going to see similar quotes from and about mothers? As with
so many of these ''inner being'' issues one can only effectively preach
to the ready-to-be-converted, and for some that time will never come.

AN insurance worker got her firm to make #39,280 in bogus payments to
her friends. They put cheques from Scottish Provident into their
accounts and then gave cash to Alison Scott.
Scott, 25, and Leah Rae, 25, both of Rossie Place, Edinburgh, appeared
at Edinburgh Sheriff Court yesterday.
Scott had earlier admitted defrauding Scottish Provident at St Andrew
Square, Edinburgh, of the money between May 1991 and July 1993.
Rae had admitted passing on three of the 13 cheques. The cheques
totalled #9500 but she received only #2400.
She was sentenced to 200 hours community service by Sheriff Iain
Macphail, QC.
He deferred sentence on Scott until August 8. Scott had produced a
cheque for #11,000 to pay back to Scottish Provident and the sheriff
wanted to allow time for it to clear.
Solicitor Nigel Beaumont said that another person at the firm had been
involved and generous payments were made to the people who put the
cheques through their accounts.
He said that, after taking that into account, Scott had actually only
profited by #10,929.
She was, he added, prepared to help prosecute the other person at
Scottish Provident who was involved.
He said that Scott, a first offender, suffered from a depressive
condition which led to her committing the offences when she realised
that some funds at the firm were hard to attribute and that she could
get her hands on them.
Depute-fiscal Alastair Carmichael said that Scott's job included
processing claims for refunds of premiums. The firm found that some of
the claims which went through were not genuine and launched an
investigation.
Scott and another person were interviewed and suspended. Scott later
telephoned one of the managers at the firm and confessed.
Mr Carmichael said that Rae had no connection with Scottish Provident
and only became involved because she lived with Scott.
Rae's solicitor, Mr Ian Corbett, said that Rae had had a lesbian
relationship with Scott for about seven years.
He said she was contrite about what she had done and there was no
prospect of her getting in trouble again.

Will a woman who killed her two children go to the electric chair? Ros
Davidson reveals why the odds are against it
IF Susan Smith is sent to the electric chair in South Carolina for
drowning her sons, she would be only the second woman executed in
America in almost 20 years. Not since Velma Barfield, a 52-year-old
grandmother, was executed by lethal injection in 1984 in North Carolina
has a woman faced the ultimate penalty.
Even on death row, where prisoners can await capital punishment for
years, the 23-year-old mill secretary would join what might be called a
select group. There are an estimated 3000 death row inmates in America,
but only 42 are women.
Few women commit the vicious murders for which death is usually
imposed, say experts on US capital punishment. Juries are also less
likely to impose capital punishment on women for sexist reasons, they
add. Indeed, several of the few countries where the death penalty is
still routinely applied, such as Russia, specifically prohibit executing
women.
But for the next few days, jurors in the small town of Union in South
Carolina will consider the fate of Smith, convicted on Saturday of
double murder for plunging her sons into a lake in October. Smith, who
has a history of mental troubles, strapped Michael aged three and Alex
aged 14 months into their car-seats and rolled her Mazda into the water.
Her defence lawyers, including the prominent anti-death penalty
activist David Bruck, maintain Smith intended to kill herself as well,
but backed out at the last minute. Prosecutor Tommy Pope argued that she
calculatingly disposed of her children as they were not wanted by a
boyfriend.
The case rocketed to national attention when she pleaded on national
TV for the boys' return, lying that a black man had kidnapped them at
gun-point. She ultimately confessed.
If the nine-man, three-woman jury decides against electrocution, she
will be sentenced to life in prison. The jurors will hear fresh
testimony on aggravating factors, such as her victims' youth and that
Smith murdered two people. Jurors will weigh mitigating factors
including her emotional problems and her previously clean record.
The 42 women currently on death row are in 14 states from California
to Florida. But even since the days of burning witches at the stake,
executing women in the US has been rare. Of the approximately 19,000
confirmed executions since 1608, only 520 have been of women, or just
3%, says Professor Victor Streib of Cleveland State University, a
leading expert on capital punishment of women.
He explained: ''Women are seen as under more emotional distress, fewer
women have a criminal record, and they are often seen as going along
with a dominant male.''
Dick Deiter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information
Centre, also says there is also more reluctance to execute women for
sexist reasons. ''Especially in the South, the main area for the death
penalty, there is a sort of chivalry,'' he says.
Two women currently on death row have dates set for capital punishment
as early as September. Guinevere Garcia, 35, faces lethal injection in
Illinois for murdering her 60-year-old husband in 1991 when she was 19.
Pamela Perillo, 39, in Texas also faces lethal injection for robbery and
murder of a 26-year-old man in Houston in 1980, when she was aged 24.
Their execution dates, of course, may well be delayed.
Susan Smith's crime of murdering her children is especially rare.
Only three currently on death row killed offspring: Ana Cardona in
Florida who murdered her three-year-old son, Debra Milke in Arizona who
who murdered her four-year-old son, and Francis Newton in Texas, who
killed her two-year-old daughter and seven-year-old son as well as her
husband.
Indeed only eight or 7% of the 107 death sentences imposed on women
since 1973 have been for murdering their own children, says Professor
Streib.
Moreover, experts do not see Smith as especially likely to be
sentenced to death, athough the system of capital punishment, they
stress, is irrational. Barfield, for example, was not the most vicious
murderer. She was just the one who did not have her sentence reversed.
Smith is from a tightly knit religious community and has known
emotional problems. ''She's one of them,'' says Dieter. ''Can they fry
her? I don't think so.''

Peter Allen-Frost in Tel Aviv gauges the Israeli mood after another
outrage aimed at knocking the Mid-East peace talks off course
THE terrorist bomb which killed six people near Tel Aviv yesterday is
a serious threat to the peace talks with the Palestinians which have now
been put on hold for a few days. The overall dialogue will continue but
the Israeli public is increasingly, and more angrily, asking why it is
still the target of suicide bombers, why the Government is still
negotiating, still making concessions to Palestinians.
Grassroots Israelis hear the Prime Minister stating that to put an end
to the talks would be to give in to the rejectionists -- the hardline
Palestinians who want to destroy the talks -- but they are somewhat fed
up of having this same refrain every time there is a bomb blast, or a
Katyusha rocket attack.
Israel's President Ezer Weizman has come out firmly against the
resumption of the talks in the wake of this and other attacks. Weizman
expresses the feelings of many Israelis when he says: ''This state of
affairs simply cannot continue -- either talks or terror -- not both.''
Prime Minister Rabin is under increasing pressure from within his own
Labour party to halt the talks until some clear cut action can be taken
-- although within Labour, no-one knows just what action should be
taken.
The opposition Likud party believes it has the answer, to stop the
talks with the Palestinians and the Syrians and beef up settlements in
the West Bank and Golan Heights -- even though this might endanger the
signed peace treaties with the Egyptians and Jordanians and prove a
major setback to what might have been a promising peace process.
Cairo and Amman have made it clear they cannot sit by, more or less
honouring the peace treaties while the issue of the Palestinians and the
Syrians remains in the air.
Both the Palestinians and Israelis, having implemented several stages
of their agreement in principle, reached two years ago, had tentatively
agreed that today would be the target date for an agreement on
implementing the next phase of the Palestinian-Israeli accord.
However even without the delay caused by the bomb blast, it was clear
the two sides still have several crucial issues to settle: how and when
Israeli troops will be deployed prior to a Palestinian election, the
election procedure itself and, perhaps most importantly, deciding on the
allocation of water in subterranean aquifers under the West Bank.
Mr Uri Savir, director general of Israel's Foreign Ministry and chief
negotiator, was upbeat this week. He said: ''Ninety per cent of the
problems are already behind us.''
The problems left however, are core issues.
If Israeli troops pull out of major Palestinian population centres, as
the Palestinians demand, then the well-armed activists among the 130,000
Jewish settlers in the West Bank say they will simply move into
positions vacated by the Israeli Defence Forces. Representatives of the
settlers say they will not be left at the mercy of the Palestinian
Arabs.
This is one issue which could flare into armed conflict between the
settlers and the Israeli Army, say analysts in Israel. Just a few weeks
ago, an influential group of Israeli rabbis effectively called on
soldiers to disobey orders if told to vacate military positions or
settlements in the historic ''Land of Israel''. In a controversial
ruling, they said Jewish law forbids the handing it over to non-Jews.
Yehiel Leiter, spokesman for the West Bank Jewish settlements, said
armed clashes involving settlers, Palestinians and Israeli troops in the
West Bank are only a matter of time. ''It will begin with clashes
between Arabs and Arabs, it will escalate to clashes between Arabs and
Jews. Ultimately the result will be clashes between Jews and Jews,''
Leiter told a Radio Israel reporter.
While there were some months of relative quiet, with no major
terrorist attacks, the Israeli public was once more warming up to the
peace process with the Palestinians.
Now however, with the Monday bus attack, the mood may well change.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin is well aware that Israeli elections are
slated for 1996. He is also aware that the hard-line opposition Likud
party could well take over the Government. Likud leaders have made it
clear they will not automatically honour any agreement Rabin's
Government signs with the Palestinians.
The same applies to the negotiations with the Syrians. Just a few
weeks ago, Prime Minister Rabin and Foreign Minister Peres were
enthusiastic about peace talks on a Jerusalem-Damascus axis, talking of
''new tunes'' emanating from the Syrian capital. Now Syrian President
Hafez El Assad has broken off military talks with the Israelis, and even
pressure from Washington has not yet succeeded in breaking this latest
politcal logjam.
While the Rabin Government has made it clear it is willing to give up
most of the Golan Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War,
Israel, not at all trusting the Syrians' promise of peace, is insisting
that it retain some sort of early warning capability on the Golan Ridge.
President Assad balked at this when Syrian and Israeli chiefs of staff
met recently and called off further talks. Washington has made several
suggestions of alternative early warning systems, none of which meet
Israel's current security criteria.
Unless the Israeli negotiations with the Syrians and Palestinians are
soon concluded, they will become major issues in the 1996 elections and
could bring about the downfall of Yitzhak Rabin's Government.

A MOTHER'S CRUSADE
IN WEST Edinburgh, in a house solid with respectability, a polished
mahogany bureau contains all that is left of the evil which engulfed
Janet and her family.
In the third drawer down, bulging folders and yellowed cuttings chart
her daughter's descent into the Rajneesh cult and her own frantic
efforts to disentangle her. She rifles through the documents with
distaste. ''It was evil and if you deal with it too long I think you get
tarnished by it.''
Rajneesh is the cult run, until his death, by the Baghwan Shree
Rajneesh, the bearded Indian guru with a penchant for jewellery, women
and Rolls-Royces. The cult was started in 1969 but hit the headlines
most recently when two British women, former members of the group, were
deported to Oregon to stand trial for an alleged plot to kill a state
prosecutor. The Baghwan died in 1990 but the movement continues to
attract followers.
Janet had never heard of the man, nor his legion, but in a few years
this diminutive Edinburgh mother had set up her own anti-cult agency and
collected a global network of contacts and sources.
It had been an ordinary afternoon in early 1980 for the family when
their daughter, Jennifer, arrived at the door. A gifted artist with her
own glassworks shop in Edinburgh, she was a frequent caller to catch up
on family affairs. This time she brought news of her own.
''She was dressed in orange and she was high,'' says her mother in a
straight, even tone. ''At first I thought she was on drugs then I
realised she wasn't. She had just come from being initiated into it and
it was the most awful thing in the world, and, you know, I went cold. I
went icy cold. It was as if something really evil had touched me.''
Jennifer had just been through a divorce after marrying at 22 and now,
at 30, she was rootless, a little insecure and depressed.
''It was when she was in this in-betweeny stage that she met somebody
who was very much into Tai Chi and through him she was introduced to a
chap who was in Rajneesh,'' says Janet. ''She was in a state and that's
where they get them. She was very upset about her broken marriage. So
she went along to one meeting and was intrigued.''
That led to a weekend in Newcastle and a bizarre initiation process
where she and the others were told to strip and crawl around the floor
in the dark, touching each other. At the end she was given her mala, a
locket carrying a picture of the Baghwan, and a new name -- Ma Prem
Shakura.
''After she had been at the house I phoned the Citizens Advice Bureau
who knew nothing about it,'' says Janet. She was put in touch with a
Catholic support group which suggested she talk to another organisation.
''By the time I finally got a reply from them it was too late, she was
well in.''
Jennifer was told to help set up a commune in Edinburgh and gradually
started to drift away from her family. Janet and her husband, David,
subscribed to the cult newspaper to try and keep track of their daughter
and in one issue they saw a picture of Jennifer's glassworks shop with
the caption: ''Our first glass studio.''
Janet would arrange to meet her daughter occasionally and found her
underfed, haggard, and badly clothed. She was persuaded to spend one
Christmas with them and she turned up briefly with a friend from the
cult, took her presents and left.
Jennifer had always enjoyed a close relationship with her father and
Janet says he found it difficult to believe that his daughter had become
completely enslaved. He died shortly after she had broken free from the
cult.
When the cult ordered all the Scottish groups to sell up and move to a
big centre in Suffolk Jennifer was assured that she could use her
artistic talents for the group by practising photography, but she was
ordered to work a 14-hour day in the laundry. In the next few years, she
was shunted to cult bases around Europe and visited Oregon where the
Baghwan had set up an alternative headquarters.
Meanwhile, her mother, fearful that they would lose touch with her for
good, was drawing up a list of contacts world-wide. They eventually
heard about a German, a Rajneesh convert, who had left the cult and now
offered deprogramming for others who were showing signs of wanting out.
He agreed to try to speak to Jennifer, making an initial, albeit brief
and inconclusive, approach at a craft fair in Edinburgh.
In November 1985, the cult told Jennifer she was to go to Oregon to
stay at the main commune and she stopped off in Edinburgh to see her
family before she left.
At this point they persuaded her to go to a friend's cottage in the
Borders instead of returning immediately to the cult. They could sense
she was not happy and asked her if she would speak to the German
deprogrammer, Eckart. She reluctantly agreed. Janet managed to persuade
him to fly over from Munich.
Once he arrived, he told them to leave him alone with Jennifer in the
cottage for 13 hours. ''It was November and it was horrible, wet and
cold,'' said Janet. ''There was nothing for us to do so we just drove
around. When we got back she looked at us and said: 'Fill your glasses,
we will drink to reason'.'' She had been in the cult for five years.
Shortly afterwards, as Jennifer's strength increased, Janet drove her
to the post office in Edinburgh to send her mala back to the cult. It is
seen as a symbolic and final cutting of ties with the group.
''I watched as she stood at the pillar box for I don't know how long
before she finally put it in and it was gone.''
Janet insists she has no worries about Jennifer becoming embroiled in
the cult again but says she has changed irrevocably.
''For about four years afterwards she was not right. I would sometimes
get terrible blowouts from her.
''She is still not the person she was. She's a fabulous person but
she's not the person she was.'' Jennifer has now married Eckart and they
live in Germany.
Her mother, now 74, continued for a time to work with Cultists
Anonymous, the group she had set up to help other families going through
the same torment. She stopped the work some years ago because the
''evil'' had become too much to handle on a regular basis, but she is
still frustrated at the lack of help for families and young people in
Scotland.
What's left of the brochures, leaflets and information sheets are now
consigned to the smart mahogany cabinet, but Janet feels compelled to
continue to speak out about her own experience to offer comfort to
others who have found themselves in the same situation.
''If I could maybe help just one other person, or stop another child
from becoming involved, it's all to the better.''

A SURVIVOR'S TALE
To conclude this special report Kirsty Scott relates the stories of a
cult survivor and a woman who fought to save her daughter
ALASDAIR Mackay was to lose three and a half years of his life after a
chance meeting on a Wimbledon street on a muggy, thunder-threatening
afternoon in August 1987.
The man who approached him was a fellow Scot and they chatted about
home before he was invited to a Bible reading at a nearby flat that
night. Mackay, a committed Christian, was on his way back to Skye after
a short stay in the capital and couldn't hang about. The man said not to
worry and handed him a name and phone number if he was ever in London
again.
It was his first contact with the London Church of Christ, the cult
which was to draw him in, groom him for leadership and bring him, he
says, to the brink of financial collapse and a near nervous breakdown.
A week after the encounter Mackay was making his way back through
London, bound for North Africa and a Christian youth project, when he
found himself without a bed for the night.
''I didn't have anywhere to stay so I gave this Scottish guy a ring. I
suppose I was just stuck for a place to stay.
''I went along and I was quite impressed with them. They seemed very
committed and quite normal. I had intended just staying the night or
maybe a couple of days. I know now that once they get talking to you.
It's very overpowering and the pressure is always to get you to stay for
longer.
''The idea is to suck you in so that so many things are going on and
you have people around you all the time.
''I stayed for about a week, then two weeks and the time went by and
eventually I was there for three and a half years.''
Mackay was born on Skye into a close-knit and religious family. From
the age of 16 until he was 26, he travelled widely, working in the Far
East, Australia, Europe and Africa, returning to Skye when cash and
commitments allowed.
Dissecting his life at a small pavement cafe near Piccadilly Circus,
it's easy to see why the church was so keen to promote him. He has an
open, honest face and a manner so direct and free of guile that after 20
minutes in his company you, too, might sign your life away.
He reckons he recruited about 10 people for the cult during his
tenure. He was moved about London, passing through a series of dodgy,
overcrowded flats, attending bible study groups and going out on to the
streets each day to try and attract new members.
''The leaders would always encourage us to look for the sharp
people,'' he says: ''It comes down to a matter of the heart. If someone
in their heart of hearts wanted to do their best for God that's how they
can be manipulated. ''
At first glance, he explains, the church's aim of spreading the word
about God and Christ seemed laudable.
''But the way they go about it is very, very high pressure. It's
almost like selling God or Christ as opposed to giving people the chance
to get to know him. Like a lot of cults their interest is in numbers and
keeping the members faithful to the church.
''That's why so many people have such a lot of psychological problems
when they leave. Their bond is with the group of people. When they leave
the bond disappears and they have nothing left to hold on to.''
Mackay says the church's structure revolved around passing
responsibility for your life and decisions to a ''discipler,'' an older
member of the church.
He was eventually singled out for the early stages of leadership and
part of his role was to make sure that a steady supply of money was
coming in to the church.
''You were always encouraged to give, near the end of my time, at
least a 10th of your income.'' He claims he had to press other members
of his Bible group to stump up, or make up the shortfall from his own
pocket and an ever-growing overdraft.
After a couple of years the stress became intolerable. He was
attending classes to train as a tree surgeon and spending his spare time
working for the church. He thinks he was also starting to have major
doubts about the group and his role in it. He started having stomach
problems, and anxiety and stress was diagnosed.
In the spring of 1991 he and his then fiancee, a fellow cult member,
were asked to go into full-time ministry.
Mackay returned to Skye for a break and realised he did not want to be
promoted. ''In my heart of hearts I didn't think I was cut out to be a
full-time leader. That's really when the stuff hit the fan, that's
really when I started learning about pressure, how things work. I almost
had a breakdown.''
Despite turning down a chance at full-time leadership and with his
relationship in ruins, Mackay stayed in the church, but his doubts
increased and came to a head after he read a book by a cult
deprogrammer.
''I resisted reading the book. A lot of the leaders said this is
spiritual pornography, that's what they used to call it. Eventually I
gave in and I read the book and it blew my mind because it confirmed a
lot of the things that I really had come to believe myself.''
He met with church leaders to discuss his doubts, but after a series
of discussions decided that enough was enough. ''I just packed my
rucksack and I left for Skye. I knew I had to make a complete break with
the church because if I started saying I'm going to leave then they
would bring in all the leaders and get me into a room and basically try
and break down my will and discredit my views.''
For two years after he left Mackay refused to speak about the church
but says he will now talk publicly to warn others.
''It's a sad thing to say that I would ever warn anyone from coming to
know more about God but knowing what I know about how the church works .
. . I think I would definitely discourage people from getting involved
with this discipling movement, because of how people are hurt so much
psychologically.''

JAMES Kimberley, who at 17 became the youngest British sportsman to be
banned for a drugs offence, has won a fight to clear his name.
The International Modern Pentathlon Union Congress yesterday found
Kimberley guilty of having a prohibited substance in his urine. But
delegates, meeting in Basle, Switzerland, cleared him of cheating and
imposed no penalty. It means he is free to compete again.
Mike Goodall, vice-chairman of the Great Britain Association, said:
''The case has been brought to its rightful conclusion.''
Kimberley was banned for two years when a headache tablet given to him
by a British team manager at the World Youth Championships in Rome last
October was found to contain the substance.

DAVID Strang rescued Scottish men's athletics from humiliation
yesterday when he was among seven competitors named as late inclusions
to the world championship team.
Deference has been made to Sally Gunnell's status as grand slam 400m
hurdles gold medallist. Despite not having raced for 10 months, the
British women's captain, who damaged a thigh muscle on Sunday, has been
allowed additional time to prove she merits a relay place in Gothenburg,
and Andy Tulloch has fallen heir to the berth abdicated by hurdles king
Colin Jackson.
Scotland's Melanie Neef, the only Briton to have achieved the
individual women's 400m qualifying time, said: ''I hope Sally makes it.
With her in the quartet, we have a reasonable medal chance, but without
her I would guess the prospects are remote.''
The others named yesterday were: Adrian Patrick (400m), Kevin McKay
(1500m), Brendan Reilly (high jump), Mark Proctor (shot), and Simon
Shirley (decathlon).
Reilly's inclusion shuts the door on Scotland's Commonwealth bronze
medallist Geoff Parsons.
The Govan-born Strang, who leap-frogged Curtis Robb, the AAA champion,
to claim the top place in the UK 800m rankings in Oslo on Friday, is the
only Scotsman in the team, although five women had already been
selected.
In the past 91 years, only once (in 1956) has a Great Britain
athletics team gone to either Olympic or world championships without any
Scottish male representation -- and even then it could be argued that
the father of Gordon Pirie (eighth in the 10,000m) was a Scot.
In his darkest moments, the 26-year-old Strang worried that his career
was over. Last-place finishes in both the European and Commonwealth 1500
metres finals last summer conspired to destroy his confidence and
enthusiasm. But treatment in a darkened room has restored him, and a
fortnight today he hopes to be racing for a medal at the world final in
Gothenburg.
''I have tapes from a sports psychologist, and I play them last thing
at night, to help with relaxation and confidence-building,'' said
European indoor champion Strang yesterday.
The therapy has worked. ''It had got to the stage where I did not
enjoy running any more -- hence the switch to the 800 -- it's a hell of
a lot shorter. I am pumped up and excited, and believe I will be in
shape to run below 1min 45sec.
''Given that these last few races have been my first at 800m in three
years, I'm pretty happy. I don't wish to lay any more on myself by
looking beyond being in the first four in the Gothenburg semi-finals,
but if I can run as fast as that, then I believe I have medal
potential.''
Strang was disappointed with his slow run at Sheffield on Sunday, when
he finished third behind Curtis Robb. But crucially he was three
hundredths ahead of the only other UK contender, Craig Winrow, as well
as Paul Ruto, Kenya's reigning world 800m champion.
It was Strang's fourth race in eight days, the previous three having
been under the pressure of having to clock a world time. ''After doing
that (1-46.02) on Friday, Sheffield was rather anti-climactic.''
When Strang last made a championship appearance over two laps, it was
teaming up for Scotland with Tom McKean and Brian Whittle, at the 1990
Commonwealth Games where he won a silver medal with them and Mark
Davidson in the 4 x 400m relay. Now McKean and Whittle, after a decade
in UK teams, are absent.
The British team now numbers 77 -- 48 men and 29 women. Four other
athletes asked to prove their fitness will be monitored by head coach
Malcolm Arnold. They are: Jason John (100m), Peter Crampton (400m
hurdles), Jacqui Agyepong (100m hurdles) and triple jumper Ashia Hansen.
But further additions are not ruled out.
* EDINBURGH'S Douglas Walker is the only Scot selected to compete in
athletics at the World Student Games in Japan next month.
Walker, who took the British Universities 200m title with a wind aided
20.53sec. in May, joins one of the strongest student squads to contest
the athletics championship titles at world level in recent years with
eight of the national World Championships squad in the line-up announced
yesterday.
* YVONNE Murray, who missed the 2000 metres in the BUPA International
at Sheffield on Sunday, was back in training yesterday, her hopes for
the world championships undiminished.
Commonwealth 10,000 metres champion Murray had taken 48 hours off
because of a cold -- ''a precautionary measure,'' said her coach, Tom
Boyle. ''Yvonne would not have been training if she had raced, so in
effect she has missed nothing. It has no impact in terms of the
championships.
''It would have been a financial comfort zone for her -- Yvonne could
still have jogged round and taken the money, but she is not like that.''
The Musselburgh woman, who now runs for Motherwell, has decided there
will be no further race before the 10k heats in Gothenburg.

WORLD record try-scorer David Campese has again been left out of
Australia's squad for the Bledisloe Cup match against New Zealand on
Saturday despite an injury to Wallaby full back Matthew Burke.
Australia's selectors considered Campese but opted for a specialist
full back.
Many commentators believed Campese -- axed following a disappointing
World Cup campaign in South Africa -- would be recalled for the second
Test at the Sydney Football Stadium.
But uncapped Rodney Kafer has been put on stand-by to replace Burke,
who strained a hamstring during the Australians' 28-16 defeat in the
opening match of the series in Auckland at the weekend.
Burke was included in the starting XV named yesterday but he must pass
a fitness test tomorrow to secure his place.
Second-choice full back Matt Pini was not considered because of
injury.
Ewen McKenzie will take over from suspended prop Dan Crowley in the
only other change to the Australian side.
Crowley was banned for three matches after being found guilty of foul
play on Saturday.
He has decided not to appeal against the decision. Team:
M Burke (or R Kafer); D Smith, J Little, T Horan, J Roff; S Bowen, S
Merrick; M Hartill, P Kearns (captain), E McKenzie, W Waugh, J Eales, W
Ofahengaue, T Gavin, D Manu.
Replacements -- D Herbert, P Howard, G Gregan, D Wilson, R Harry, M
Foley.

NO, not unless the club was still in contact with the sand when the

GARY Venerus, of centenary club Biggar, compiled a flawless 61 to
equal the course record and claim one of the club's oldest trophies, the
Heavyside Shield which dates back to the original course located in the
Heavyside district of the town, writes Douglas Lowe.
The five-handicapper birdied four of the first five holes, a run
marred by a mere par at the third. There were further gains at the
twelfth and fifteenth in a bogey-free round for a score which gives him
a share of the record with clubmate Bryce Kerr.
The performance in fine but breezy conditions, converts to a
Parbusters score of minus five which tops the men's scratch section and
is only one off the pace in handicap, where three are tied on minus 11.
In women's scratch, Camperdown Ladies' Fiona Farquharson took a day
trip to play in the open day at Dunkeld and Birnam and came home not
only with the top scratch prize but also a new course record of 65 over
two laps of the nine-hole course, played latterly in torrential rain.
That was four under the standard scratch score and she now takes the
overall lead in that section with just three qualifying weeks to go.
In women's handicap, teenager Karen Murrie shot a 97 over Stirling --
less her handicap of 35 -- for a score of minus 12 to win the SLGA
Brooch and almost certainly earn a place in our Parbusters final.
The score also merits our bandit-of-the week title and has brought her
handicap tumbling to 30. This week's leading scores:

FORTHBANK, Stirling Albion's home, is to be the latest football
stadium to host a major rugby match.
Stirling County, the Scottish club rugby champions, are to play their
prestigious match against the Barbarians there on Tuesday, September 26,
as the capacity of almost 10,000 more than double the number the rugby
club could accommodate in their home ground, Bridgehaugh.
St Johnstone set the latest trend of rugby on football grounds when
Scotland A beat Italy at McDiarmid Park in January.
A second major rugby match will be played at the Perth stadium this
year when the Western Samoan touring team take on North and Midlands in
November.
* CARDIFF hooker Jonathan Humphreys, who won his first cap in the
World Cup this summer, will return to South Africa next month as the new
Welsh captain.
Wales, who will play South East Transvaal at Witbank on August 29 and
Francois Pienaar's world champions at Ellis Park on September 2, have
named a 24-strong squad which includes 15 of the 26 players who competed
in the World Cup. Squad:
Backs: W T Proctor, I C Evans, W J L Thomas (all Llanelli), A R
Harris, D A Williams, M Taylor (all Swansea), N R Jenkins, P John (both
Pontypridd), G Jones, G Thomas (both Bridgend), Andy P Moore (Cardiff).
Forwards: P Arnold, G R Jenkins, C D Loader, A P Moore (all Swansea),
A M Bennett, D Jones, J Humphreys (captain), E W Lewis (all Cardiff), J
D Davies (Neath), A Gibbs (Newbridge), R L Evans, S C John (both
Llanelli), Greg Prosser (Pontypridd).

THERE will be very few people in the city who view the haemorrhage of
talent from Glasgow clubs this summer with any real joy, club loyalties
not withstanding.
The Craig brothers, Mark, Richie, and James, have left West of
Scotland for Hawick, but an even greater disaster looks set to befall
GHK, second only to Stirling County as Glasgow District's top side.
Over the weekend it emerged that Aden Dow has signalled that he is to
leave for Edinburgh Academicals, back row forward Craig Brown is to go
to Gavin Hastings' Watsonians, and Shade Munro is considering a move to
Boroughmuir.
Munro currently works as a rugby development officer in the city, and
wishes to further his international career. Munro told me that he is, as
yet, undecided as to where his future lies.
However, it now transpires that far more of the club's players are
about to leave after what they consider to have been little consultation
with the players over who is to coach the team this season, and the
future ambitions of the club.
Andy Little, the former Glasgow player, has been appointed director of
rugby at GHK, but that news has been met with the fact that Tony Glasgow
is to leave to join his brother, Cameron, at Heriot's, young wing
forward Andrew Ness will sign for Watsonians, and Fergus Wallace, who
scored one of Scottish rugby's most famous tries in the Scotland A
team's victory over the Springboks, has intimated to the club that he
also is on the verge of leaving for Boroughmuir.
For the club's new captain, Steve Herini, a talented stand-off who
played for the New Zealand Maoris against Gavin Hastings' British Lions,
it has been a baptism of fire at the unsettled club.
''I am very concerned that so many players have told me that they are
unhappy, but I will be pushing to keep them at the club if I can,'' he
said.
''I know that it is in some ways the apparent lack of a top coach this
season that has worried the players who have said they are leaving. The
boys are concerned that Andy does not have a track record in modern
coaching, but I am sure that he can do the job successfully. He will be
helped, as and when available, by much respected forwards' coach Hugh
Campbell.
''There are lots of rumours that the guys are all leaving, and if they
do we are in trouble. I want them to stay. I think we have a big season
ahead of us if we do.''
GHK found themselves in the second division of the reorganised
national leagues at the end of last season, and the SRU reduced the
teams to eight, partly to encourage top players to change clubs to those
teams in the top league.
Towards the end of last season, coaches Brian Gilbert and Hugh
Hamilton were sacked after the players at the club gave them a vote of
no confidence, but club officials have struggled to entice top-level
coaches to Old Anniesland, and, thereby, employed Little to head their
coaching efforts.
Gilbert and Hamilton have returned to Glasgow's Southern, the club
that once was Clarkston, and they have been joined by Bay of Plenty and
New Zealand Air Force utility back James Dunlop, and Gavin Walsh, their
front row player.
Walsh will form a coaching triumvirate with GHK's former coaches.
As a result of the rapid exit of Glasgow players to clubs outside the
city, I understand that the Glasgow committee are to meet soon to
discuss whether to continue to allow players who play for clubs outside
the district to play for the Glasgow city team.

BUENOS AIRES: Six Lebanese men and a Brazilian woman suspected of
involvement in two anti-Jewish bomb attacks are to be questioned today.
A lawyer for the Lebanese group said they were being used as scapegoats
by the Argentine Government because no-one had been convicted in the
attack on a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires which killed 86
people a year ago.

THE lone figure hunched over a cluster of balls on the practice
putting green at Cawder is more likely than not to be the 26-year-old
assistant pro, Alan Tait.
Countless hours he has spent there attempting the mind-blowing drill
of holing 100 three-footers in succession -- and if you miss you start
again at one -- have already paid off handsomely this season, bringing
him the Scottish Assistants' title, four pro-am victories, and two more
course records to bring his total to four.
''It is probably the best run I've had since I took up the game, and
it is all down to my short game,'' said Tait, who in 1987, as an Irvine
Bogside member, achieved the rare amateur distinction of being capped at
boy, youth, and senior levels in the same season.
''It was only when I turned pro five years ago that I realised how
good the Tartan Tour players are from 60 yards in, and at putting. I
sometimes felt I was outclassing guys from tee to green yet they were
scoring 68s and 69s and I would be on 72. That was very frustrating.
''When I looked at the stats I was taking 34 or 35 putts per round
which is terrible by professional standards. Now it is down to 30 or 31
which is not brilliant but it is still three or four shots a round
better or at least 12 shots difference in a 72-holer.
''And when I do get the putter going and take 26 or 27 putts per round
that is when things have been happening.''
His hot putting stroke this season has brought him the course record
at Newmacher, a seven-under-par 65 en route to his assistants' crown,
and the new mark at Buchanan Castle, an eight-under-par 62 in a the
club's pro-am.
He also has a share of the records at the Queen's Course at Gleneagles
Hotel (five-under-par 63, a score equalled by Euan McIntosh) and
Carnoustie (eight-under-par 64), though the latter is not universally
recognised.
It was tied during the Scottish Open by Colin Montgomerie and because
the course had been altered, Montgomerie is the only holder by local
reckoning. Tait, however, also played in the Scottish Open -- his
European Tour debut as a result of finishing No.8 on last year's Tartan
Tour order of merit -- and took the opportunity to check out the status
of his score achieved during his triumph in last year's national pro-am.
He said his 64 is still recognised by the PGA, the European Tour, and
Monty, with whom he had a chat. ''He remembered me from the time we met
in the Scottish Amateur semi-final at Nairn in 1987, when he won, and he
was quite happy to call it a shared record. So, as far as I am
concerned, I have four records, two of them joint ones,'' said Tait.
Meanwhile, he is persisting with the putting practice, and explained:
''Spending so much time on short putts might be boring, tiring, and give
me a sore back, but it is working. It is not so much practising my
putting stroke as seeing the ball go in the hole so often that the
picture is etched on my mind so that when I am on the course I know am
going to do it there as well.''
So far, the new-found confidence has taken him this season to No.1 on
the assistants' order of merit -- 18 points ahead of Glasgow's John
Greaves -- No.2 behind Colin Gillies on Tartan Tour money list with
#11,704, but only No.14 on that order of merit having done better in
pro-ams, of which he has won five this season, than the ranking
72-holers.
It's all changed days from his first year-and-a-half as a pro when he
was stricken by hepatitis A which left him virtually bedridden. Now,
it's full-steam ahead.
''I would like to make it into the top nine which would give me a
place again in next year's Scottish Open,'' he said. ''I think I could
do better next time. I missed the cut by three strokes this year, but it
was a great experience especially when John Greaves and I played in
practice against Ben Crenshaw and Tiger Woods, who beat us at the last
hole.
''Off the tee I was pretty much the same as Ben, but Tiger Woods was
killing the ball -- he was 40 yards past us and straight -- and has a
solid all-round game. I said afterwards that when he turns pro I am
going to back him for every major and Ben agreed.''
In the immediate future, Tait, who also won the Scottish Under-25
championship last year at Murrayshall, has a visit to the Ryder Cup,
part of his Scottish Assistants' prize, courtesy of Titleist/Footjoy,
and he will be accompanied by fiancee Joyce, with whom he plans to tie
the knot within two years.
Then there is his third crack at the European Tour qualifying school
later this year, and he intends to persist in that direction for no more
than three or four years if need be plus, perhaps, a bash at the Nike
Tour in America, where he spent two years as an amateur at Paris Junior
College, Texas, winning 12 tournaments out of 35 played.
Should the opportunity to play full-time on the tour not arise he will
go for a club job, and to that end he has to complete his PGA exams
having failed one section -- club repairs -- on the oral examination.
''I had been worrying about the practical exam because I'm not exactly
Mr Nimble Fingers, but they caught me out on the questions. I was never
any good at subjects like woodwork and metalwork at school.''
Carving out and nailing down course records is obviously another
matter.

HOMELESSNESS is as common among teenagers in rural areas of Scotland
as among those in cities, according to a children's charity.
NCH Action for Children said its findings shattered commonly-held
assumptions about the homeless: half were young women, the majority were
aged between 16 and 18, and more than a third were willing to return
home.
The charity runs the Preparation for Life Project hostel in
Alexandria, in addition to two other stop-over hostels in Alloa and
Dundee. Its conclusions were drawn from the experiences of teenagers
given temporary accommodation in the Dunbartonshire hostel.
They were supported by the charity for the homeless, Shelter Scotland.
The organisation's Ms Kate Caskie said rural homelessness had been on
the increase for the last decade, and that around half of homeless
teenagers were female, half of whom were forced to leave home because of
violence or abuse.
Action for Children called for the reinstatement of full benefit for
16 to 18-year-olds and more Government funding for services for the
homeless in rural areas.
The report, published to mark the project's first year, said a large
number of those using temporary accommodation had slept rough and more
than two thirds were excluded from claiming benefits.
The charity's Scottish director of social work, Mr Reg McKay, said a
range of services, including long and short-stay accommodation and
supported flats, were needed in small towns.
He said that over the last year the Alexandria hostel had provided a
home for 60 young people, a third of whom returned home and 10 of whom
were awarded tenancies. The problems in Dunbartonshire, he added were
typical of most areas of Scotland.
''Socially and financially it makes sense to develop a policy of
providing a range of accommodation types. Our research proves that
homelessness is not just the preserve of big cities,'' Mr McKay said.

ALTHOUGH the term CD-ROM is still enough to strike fear in the heart
of techo-phobes, that may soon change. For the first time, a variety of
CD-ROMs of broad interest to adults are being published on both sides of
the Atlantic for home use.
Book publishers and other specialised companies are rushing to issue
new CD-ROMs based on popular how-to and self-help books. A
''general-interest adult market'' for CD-ROMs has finally emerged this
year, say experts. Babies, weddings, relationships and healing are
subjects on some of the multimedia disks published recently.
It is a vast change in the market, until now dominated by
entertainment, especially games for teenagers, and reference items such
as encyclopedias, or ''edutainment' for smaller children.
Self-help and how-to are obvious market segments -- videos can guide
viewers through activities that are hard to explain in print such as
gardening, or parenting -- while interaction provides a record of
progress and answers to questions.
''The computer market was originally for those people especially
interested in the technology -- the very techno-savvy consumers,'' says
Sharon Miller, marketing director at HarperCollins Interactive in New
York. ''Now CD-ROMs have become consumer goods, and we're seeing adult
interest titles.''
One of the most startling examples of the trend is The Baby Book, to
be released this autumn. The interactive paediatric guide has, for
example, video clips showing parents various skills, from changing
nappies and holding the baby, to breast-feeding and potty-training.
The Baby Book, based on the hugely popular print version by William
and Mary Sears, also discusses key issues from birth to age two. Parents
can answer diagnostic questions to determine how serious problems are
and what they should do. There are games to help parent-child bonding.
And of course a diary and customised calendars for recording the first
two years.
As recently as May 1993, Newsweek was still predicting that the main
market for CD-ROMs would remain entertainment and reference. But in the
past two years the potential CD-ROM market has exploded so much, that
companies are trying to carve out new markets.
Nowadays a personal computer can be upgraded to handle CD-ROMs for as
little as #190 while the disks themselves are retailing for about #18 to
#30 in the US. The speed of the medium is now also many times faster, a
vast improvement over the annoyingly slow drives previously available.
CD-ROMs are indeed becoming the norm in households that buy new
computers, although such householders are still a tiny minority of the
population. Even so, of the 2,000,000 computers shipped in the fourth
quarter of 1994 in the US, 1,850,000 had CD-ROM capability -- or more
than 92%, according to DataQuest, a market analysis firm in Silicon
Valley.
The race for market share is fast and furious. Apart from the
self-help and how-to titles that can be turned into CD-ROMs, books by
authors like Michael Crichton and Edgar Allan Poe, as well as by
lesser-known Neal Stephenson, a cult sci-fi writer, and American gay
journalist Randy Shilts, are also going on CD-ROM.
In fact the line between books and multi-media is becoming blurred.
While publishers are more and more turning print into pixels, CD-ROM
makers are doing the reverse -- spinning off books from successful
CD-ROMs.
So far, books turned into CD-ROMs tend to be adventure fiction, or
travel-oriented, as well as reference and how-to or self-help.
Crichton's Congo, about a team of scientists searching for diamonds in
the jungle, will be released by Viacom New Media this autumn as a CD-ROM
interactive adventure that the publisher says is game-like.
Print publishers in turn are fleshing out CD-ROMs to form books. The
mega-selling CD-ROM game Myst is to spawn a trilogy of books by
Hyperion, a unit of Disney Co. The first of the three, The Book of
Antrus, will be out this November.
Surprisingly, one of the most successful releases in the US is the
CD-ROM based on Randy Shilts's book Conduct Unbecoming: Gays and
Lesbians in the US Military. The award-winning journalist, who died of
Aids, first gained fame for his book attacking Aids policy in the Reagan
years.

THE Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art in Edinburgh will today
receive a #3m grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to help keep 26
important Dadaist and Surrealist paintings and drawings in Scotland.
Three other Scottish projects will also benefit from a total of #11m,
which will be shared out among 19 projects throughout the UK. Some
#400,000 will be allocated to help restore Pollokshields Burgh Hall and
Lodge in Maxwell Park, Glasgow, while the two other projects will be
announced today.
The 26 works of art have been bought from the collection of the late
Sir Roland Penrose, and include three Picassos, a collage by Max Ernst,
seven major paintings by Salvador Dali, Max Ernst, Rene Magritte, Andre
Masson, Man Ray, Yves Tanguy, and Paul Delvaux, and a rare portfolio of
15 Surrealist drawings.
The gallery's acquisition of the paintings and drawings follows more
than a decade of good relations with the Penrose family. With an open
market valuation of #5m a special purchase price of #4m has been agreed
with the gallery -- with #3m coming from the Heritage Lottery Fund,
#150,000 from the National Art Collections Fund, and the remainder being
put up by the gallery itself.
The chairman of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Lord Rothschild,
said last night: ''The Penrose collection is important at home and
internationally and the gallery richly deserves the funding we are able
to provide.
''It will now possess one of the most important collections of
Surrealist art in the world and the collection will form part of a major
centre for Surrealism in Scotland for the benefit of students,
schoolchildren, and the general public.
''Given that recent exhibitions of Surrealist art have attracted
record attendances, this collection will bring many tens of thousands of
visitors to Scotland.''
The keeper of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, Mr Richard
Calvocoressi, said: ''In 10 years, since the death of the painter,
writer, and exhibition organiser Sir Roland Penrose, we have assembled a
remarkable collection of outstanding works of art, as well as the
collector's library and archive, for public access and display.
''We are now poised to create a Dada and Surrealist Study Centre of
international merit with the generous assistance of the Penrose family,
the Heritage Lottery Fund, and the National Art Collections Fund.
''As has been proved by the spectacular success of recent exhibitions
in London, Picasso and Surrealism are now as popular as French
Impressionism.''
All the new works will be on public display from tomorrow.
Meanwhile, #400,000 is to be handed over today to Pollokshields Burgh
Hall Trust to pay for restoration and repairs that will help ensure the
hall's continued use by more than 24 community groups.
The hall and lodge, which are regarded as masterpieces of Scottish
renaissance-style architecture, were built between 1889 and 1891 for use
by the commissioners of Pollokshields burgh on grounds gifted by local
landowner Sir John Stirling Maxwell, Baronet of Pollok.
Built of Ballochmyle red freestone in a parkland setting and featuring
stained-glass windows, the grade A listed buildings have been saved from
vandalism and neglect in recent times by the Pollokshields Burgh Hall
Trust, which acquired them in 1986.
The hall plays host to activities as diverse as chess, amateur
operatics, keep-fit groups, and flower clubs while it is also used for
weddings and dances.
Mr Jack Steele, trust chairman, said: ''We very much appreciate the
grant and regard it as being the key to unlock other major funding
support. The realisation of our #900,000 restoration and redevelopment
project will be of great benefit to the Pollokshields community as well
as to those city-wide.''
Lord Rothschild said: ''The hall and lodge have provided a focus for
community life in this part of Glasgow for many years and we see them as
being an important and integral part of many people's lives.
''The grant, which will allow essential and urgent repairs, is a fine
example of the objectives of the Heritage Lottery Fund to preserve our
nation's heritage for the benefit of the people. May I wish
Pollokshields and all its community a long and happy future together.''

IT is gratifying to read the letter of Joyce Campbell and to know that
she is appreciative of the new ventures on the island of Arran (July
20).
However, she may have been unaware of a much more exciting project,
which it is hoped will make Arran the mecca for a broadly based arts
venue.
The National Lottery has awarded the Arran Festival Theatre #609,000
-- the largest single grant awarded to a Scottish project -- towards the
refurbishment of an old church in Lamlash into a theatre.
This theatre will cater for a wide variety of entertainment and
educational pursuits and it is hoped it will become a venue for visitors
not only from Scotland and England but from the Continent and elsewhere.
While on the island we have sought to offer the visitor -- on whom we
depend -- many day activities, the theatre will provide interest in the
evenings.
We hope the tourists will enjoy a galaxy of entertainment and with our
excellent all-year programme will be attracted for breaks throughout the
year.
That the National Lottery has recognised the excellence of our scheme
augurs well for the future and for the extra funding we hope to obtain
from the EU.

THE ambiguous and gutless decisions of the London Conference have
further encouraged the savage Serbs to continue with their ethnic
cleansing, massacres of innocent people, and rapes of defenceless women.
This outrageous aggression and genocide is being perpetrated on
European soil under the very eyes of the civilised world. While everyone
condemns these atrocities no-one is prepared or has shown the courage to
stop this barbarism.
The Serbs have overthrown the United Nations' safe areas and thus
declared war on this world body. The powers that be, however, simply sit
by and make empty noises.
The British Government has shown a total disregard for the territorial
integrity of the independent sovereign state of Bosnia Herzegovina or
the misery and suffering of its people. Its excuse that it does not want
to risk the lives of its soldiers (in order to save the lives and honour
of oppressed and defenceless people) is most selfish and specious.
Has it forgotten that many millions of soldiers, from various nations
and faiths, not only risked but sacrificed their lives in two world
wars, this century, to secure the freedom and honour of the British
people?
Are the Bosnians not as human as the British? Are Karadzic and his
Serbs not as vicious as, if not worse than, Hitler and his Nazis? Surely
the Bosnians have the same feelings and fears as the British and without
doubt the Serbs have surpassed the Nazis in their inhumanity.
One difference between the Bosnians and other Europeans is that the
majority of the former call themselves Muslims. One hopes that it is not
this difference of faith that affects the attitude of the British and
other Western nations towards the stricken Bosnians.
The pusillanimous attitude of the Western democracies so far has
encouraged the Serbs in their wanton aggression. It appears that the
Serbs will carry on with their barbaric conquests and ethnic cleansings
with impunity. This would confirm that might is right and indicate that
the new world order is based on injustice, prejudice, and disorder.

SO James Hann's highly-respected chairmanship of Scottish Nuclear has
reached its predictable and regrettable end. Brian Wilson's article and
your editorial say as much as is necessary about the loss of yet another
Scottish (and public) enterprise (July 21).
But indignation is not enough. The question is: ''What is to be done
about it?'' Parliamentary opposition means nothing as long as the
Government has a majority. A hide as thick as Ian Lang's is not to be
penetrated by rational argument.
Pre-emptive action is needed before it is too late.
Paradoxically, the people who could stop this infamous privatisation
are the prospective buyers. Not that we can rely on the fear of things
nuclear to put them off as it did before.
What the Government is now putting up for sale is the profitable bit
of the industry. Even that will have a limited life. No private investor
is going to build a new nuclear power station just because it is good
for the environment. They are ultimately buying a new slice of the
generating industry cake.
The name ''Nuclear'' doesn't matter. It could equally be ''Channel Six
plc'' or ''Write-Your-Own-Pay-Cheque plc.''
The City must none the less be convinced that it will not profit from
the sell-off. The Opposition parties must make it clear that with a
change of Government legal means will be found, or created if necessary,
to ensure that they will find their investment has earned them not a
penny.
Maybe they can think of other effective actions but pre-emptive action
there must be.

WHERE are all these estuaries coming from?
Describing the visit of the Tall Ships to the Forth, the newsreaders
at 6pm on Tuesday, July 18, mentioned the Forth estuary at least 10
times. It was not until the young lady came on with the Scottish weather
that we got the Firth of Forth.
Perhaps someone at the BBC realised this; in the 9 o'clock news
Michael Buerk spoke of the Firth.
When the powerboats were racing on the Tay we kept hearing of the Tay
estuary, never the Firth of Tay. Likewise, when pollution of the Clyde
was discussed some months ago, Arrochar and the lower Ayrshire beaches
were part of the estuary.
Are our Firths going the way of Strathspey? The tourist boards, who
should know better, insist on the Spey Valley. Is Glenrothes to become
Rothesvale and Ben Lomond Mount Lomond?
Can we be sure that our lochs are safe?

IT is regretted that your police correspondents, Messrs Yule and Tod,
refrain from constructive debate upon an issue of grave public concern
but confine themselves to senseless vituperation.
When invited, neither has reviewed the reasons for the Sheehy inquiry
nor advanced measures to be taken within their service to redress the
balance.
Furthermore, neither seems to realise that the long-term perspective
is inseparable from the short in that there must be some measure of
control by which to gauge the present.
Detached references to nostalgia and time-warps indicate an extremely
blinkered view.
In formally announcing his retirement from December 31 this year,
Strathclyde's Chief Constable, in his address to the police and fire
committee, voiced his disapprobation at the level of Government funding
made available to him (June 9).
If your correspondents' distaste for the past is to be logically
pursued they might well advocate the emasculation from cash-strapped
police-forces of such Victorian appendages as pipe bands, horses, and
even dogs, which in their limited operational use are somewhat less than
cost-effective and justified largely in the interests of public
relations.
A considered view would suggest that the present round of
correspondence has usefully illustrated one major facet of public
concern which gave rise to a need for the Sheehy inquiry -- the police
person's undoubted capacity for dissembling, prevarication, and
deviousness reflected in a number of well-publicised cases in which
convictions were reversed upon appeal.
It may well be on the curriculum at the police college.

I WAS pleased to read that Scotland's Chief Medical Officer, Dr Robert
Kendall, is keen to encourage breastfeeding (July 18).
In recent years we have seen report after report on the benefits of
natural feeding, but very little seems to have been said about why so
many women who begin to breastfeed give up at an early stage.
Most women will have reached a decision about how they will feed their
babies before delivery, and those who decide to give breastfeeding a go
will have read up on the subject and looked forward to nestling their
infants to their bosom in the perfect picture of mother/baby bonding.
So why does this ideal scenario so often pale so quickly?
Breastfeeding may once have been the most natural thing for a human
mother to do but years of civilisation and this century's bottlefeeding
boom have taken their toll. Breastfeeding is not as easy as it ought to
be and the conditions for a woman's first experiments are hardly ideal.
She may be in pain or exhausted after a long complicated labour, or
bruised and shocked after a fast delivery. Either way, her world is
abruptly turned upside down in a matter of hours. No amount of reading
can prepare a woman for the demands a small baby makes and in those
first shattering weeks of motherhood the principles of breastfeeding, so
clear before delivery, are now a jumble of ideas that the new baby may
simply refuse to accept.
The breastfeeding mother needs reassurance and help. She needs someone
to tell her it's normal for a baby to want to feed constantly at first,
to help her with properly positioning the baby, and to convince her that
this very important but very demanding stage will not last long.
There is no point in continually harping on about the benefits of
breastfeeding. We know breast is best. What is needed is practical help
for women who are actually struggling with the early stages of feeding
their babies.
We need properly trained breastfeeding councillors who would never
dream of advising a woman to clockwatch, or to have a bottle standing by
''just in case.''
Support groups should be a priority to give women a chance to discuss
their difficulties with other women in the same situation.
And we need more understanding by the public and health professionals
of what breastfeeding is all about.
I agree with Dr Kendall's proposal that breastfeeding should be
encouraged, and I hope that his methods are along more practical lines
than have been seen in the past.

SOME days it is hard to begin, while others, like this one, feel
impossible. All that weighty stuff upstairs on the page makes some load
to take on frail shoulders. Down here is about driving piles and pouring
concrete for foundations. Besides, there is that beam of a heading to
bear. Its span of eight columns should say it all.
My first boss in newspapers collected perfect headlines. His very
favourite was Parachute Fails To Open. Given a label like that, he was
fond of saying, readers had no need for more words underneath.
Even in lightest mood, a first sentence is a tricky ball to play.
Various masters of the trade had assorted ruses. For a kick-off James
Thurber used a crude private rule. ''Don't get it right, get it
written,'' he muttered to himself. Others phoned around their friends,
if any, to cuss them in an inflammatory manner in the hope that would
give them ignition.
For a starting handle Ian Mackay, essayist of the lamented News
Chronicle newspaper, went the length of offering to buy any colleague a
drink who could provide an opener. Under similar stress I have dangled
the bait of a whole sixpence. Such largesse never works.
In increasing desperation Ian Mackay would take hold of a quotation
from Shakespeare or Socrates or, best of all, from his granny. When
Alistair Cooke begins to erupt another radio letter, he whips himself
with the thought that this week he is going to be found out.
Lesser scribblers have no less problems. Most would rather do anything
than begin. Some would as lief pull up weeds as put down a first
sentence. Others find that polishing their every pair of shoes can help.
Fidgeting with paper clips is worth a try.
Fussing about paper provides further agreeable delay. Ian Mackay could
write only on white paper. For Damon Runyon's wrist to move at all, the
vellum had to be yellow. And Mackay found himself wordless unless the
ink in his fountain pen was blue.
''I can no longer write with a lead pencil as I did when I was an
honest reporter,'' he owned up in one essay on an especially sticky day.
Some gnarled reporters have never given up carrying a pencil because
only it works in rain. When the weather is wet, honest lead does not
smudge. It has indoor advantages forbye that I have gone back to.
Pencils need sharpening. They bring the boon and blessing of an extra
excuse for not getting started. For when a fellow is seen to be absorbed
with the nice business of putting fresh points on his working
implements, he cannot be accused of shirking. He is palpably doing
something. He has the job in hand.
But pencils attract office attention. Wiseacre colleagues wish to know
whether you will be going back into short trousers next. Endless are the
wheezes about remembering to make the up-strokes light and the down ones
heavy.
By way of answering back it is a help to know that tough guy Ernest
Hemingway preferred pencils. He bragged he could wear two to stumps when
his work was going well.
John Steinbeck, author of The Grapes of Wrath and other powerful
stuff, is another manly ally. When in a roar of creativity, he reckoned
he put through his mitts 60 pencils in one working session. He used
wands of different hardness to match his writing mood.
With such master craftsmen behind pencils, it is odd how little mark
they have made on written history. Although ancient Aztecs scrawled
graffiti with graphite, hardly anything about black lead has been put on
paper.
Modern pencils (it seems) have their roots in 1564 and in Cumbria.
Roots is the very word.
Legend has it that when an oak tree was upended by lightning, lots of
black stuff was found sticking to its underground parts. Until 160 years
or so ago Cumbria remained where the best pencils came from. About all
else inscribed on ancient tablets is that to rub out mistakes early
users used bread crumbs.
But whoever was the wizard who first thought to coffin a stick of
black lead inside a wooden cover, nobody seems to know. He appears not
so much to have been forgotten as never known.
Also hard to know is why literary types have had so little to the
point to say about pencils. All the time they have preferred to go on
about the pen and how mighty it is.
G K Chesterton, essayist, detective story writer, and manifold good
egg, is one of the few to have had a good word for a pencil. ''Lying in
bed (he wrote) would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if
only one had a coloured pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.''
The finest pencil story concerns Dorothy Parker when she was working
on New Yorker magazine, or rather not working. One afternoon she was
found improving office hours in the office speakeasy. It was in the lean
early days of the magazine when resources were scarce. Parker was
invited to explain why she was not at her desk. She sweetly replied:
''Somebody else is using the pencil.'' I wish I had said that, and now I
shall.

CELTIC manager Tommy Burns yesterday insisted that he had been above
board in every aspect of his attempt to sign Dundee United's Slav
defender, Gordan Petric, for #1.5m.
Burns had been criticised by United's chairman Jim McLean as details
of the deal emerged, but Burns insisted he had not been the source of an
information leak.
At his team's base in Germany, where they are in the middle of a
four-match tour, he maintained: ''I have too much respect for Jim McLean
and Billy Kirkwood to do anything behind their backs or unsettle their
players.
''We have done everything in a proper manner. I cannot help it if we
are constantly linked with top players, but I can categorically state we
did not leak our intentions to anyone.''
McLean, it seems, later conceded that Burns was not at fault.
Burns admitted that Celtic's barren years have made his task more
difficult in trying to acquire players. As he pointed out: ''Big names
are entitled to ask what is at Celtic Park to entice them there.
''Our plans will take time but nowhere is it written in stone that we
must turn years of neglect into success overnight. I aim to add quality
to our squad, but new names will not be brought in just for the sake of
it.
''For instance, when Celtic Park is completed it will be the best
stadium money can buy and we are going back there as Scottish Cup
holders. That is something I want to build on.
''We will be judged on results back home and not on what is happening
here.''
Celtic chairman Fergus McCann is flying out to Germany to finalise the
deal for Bayer Leverkusen striker Andreas Thom, who will also cost
#1.5m.
On the Petric affair, he was positive. ''Dundee United are a club that
Celtic respect, and we would appreciate it if this matter could be
resolved. Allegations have been made, and I have asked Mr McLean either
to prove what he has claimed is correct or publicly withdraw the remarks
if they cannot be substantiated.''
If there are no hitches in the Thom signing, the striker's arrival
will be welcomed by the Celtic fans, and by Pierre van Hooydonk, who
believes he will become a better player with Thom alongside him.
He explained: ''I'm not making excuses but I am the type of player who
thrives when others play well and need help to score goals. There has
been criticism that I do not get into the box often enough, but how many
chances do we create? We need more creativity and I look forward to the
moment when Thom puts his signature to a Celtic contract. He would be a
great signing for us.''
Tonight, Celtic meet Wilhemshaven in the third game of their tour, but
midfielder Peter Grant is doubtful because of injury.

* MIGUEL Indurain's reign as king of the Tour de France may be set to
run for some time yet, according to two of the riders whose record of
five victories he has now equalled.
Belgian Eddy Merckx and France's Bernard Hinault -- along with the
late Jacques Anquetil, the only other riders to have won the Tour five
times -- both said the 31-year-old Spaniard could add at least one more
Tour to his tally.
''I think he's set for a sixth or even a seventh Tour win,'' said
Merckx.
Hinault said: ''If he has no health or injury problems, he can go a
long way yet.'' Indurain, the only rider to have won five Tours in
succession, refused to be drawn on how many more he can add. ''I'm not
thinking about it at all,'' he said.
Indurain was yesterday awarded the Olympic Order by the International
Olympic Committee.

JANETTE Valentine's letter (Trapped in a cycle of hype, July 22) was a
powerful piece of writing commenting on the very real negative aspects
of the National Lottery.
I have no doubt of the efficiency of the Lottery in gathering in the
funds and in its insidious efficiency, like any form of gambling, in
drawing people who can least afford it further into a trap.
I am less convinced of a similar efficiency in the subsequent
distribution of the funds.
Alongside, the letter from Christine Hamilton, deputy director of the
Scottish Arts Council, was extolling the virtues of the Lottery in
''enhancing the lives of those who live in Scotland''. With one force
depressing lives and another enhancing them, which will win?
Christine Hamilton concludes with the hope that ''as further
announcements are made over the next few months the Scottish press will
examine how the proceeds from the Lottery are being used to enhance the
lives of those who live in Scotland''.
I hope the press rises to the challenge constructively.
If, as Janette Valentine says, the Lottery has become the 1990s opiate
of the masses, then the arts has a role to play in the way it comments
on society.
Where is the protest or are our artists being bought off as well?

A FATAL accident inquiry into the deaths of some of Britain's top
counter-terrorism experts in last year's Chinook helicopter crash on the
Mull of Kintyre is due to begin on October 16.
The public inquiry will be held at Paisley Sheriff Court and is
expected to last for up to two weeks.
A summary of the Defence Ministry's air accident investigation,
published last month, blamed pilot error.
The FAI, held under the Fatal Accidents and Sudden Deaths Inquiry
(Scotland) Act of 1976, will be presided over by the Sheriff Principal
for North Strathclyde, Robert Hay.
He is obliged to make findings about the cause of the deaths and
whether they could have been avoided, and also has the power to make
observations and recommendations.
A spokesperson at Paisley Sheriff Court said the inquiry is being held
there rather than at Campbeltown Sheriff Court, the nearest court to the
crash, for the convenience of witnesses.
The FAI is likely to be attended by many of the victims' relatives but
they do not expect it to reveal any significant new information.
Mr Aidan Canavan, a Belfast solicitor who represents 14 of the
families involved, said yesterday: ''We don't anticipate the FAI
revealing anything people haven't already been made aware of. However,
the families of the victims welcome the inquiry in that there might be
some personal matters that they want to have dealt with by the court.
''Some of them feel that the RAF inquiry, which dealt largely with
technical matters, perhaps did not answer what to you and I might not be
terribly important questions but are important to them.''
A spokesman for the Crown Office said that, despite the sensitive
nature of the work of some of the victims, he did not believe the
inquiry would be any different to any other FAI.
''Having said that, it would be for the Sheriff Principal to
dertermine on methods of procedure if any of the witnesses felt what
they were saying was confidential.''

WHILE the article, Aspects of
Galloway that make a visit worthwhile, by Andrew Douglas made pleasant
reading (July 17), I should like to point out, first, that the article
related to Dumfries and Galloway.
Secondly, the tourist was encouraged to travel from Castle Douglas to
Creetown along a busy A75 and ignore Gatehouse of Fleet -- a strange
omission as there has been much publicity about the bicentenary of the
town this year and Princess Anne was present to honour this event on
June 29.
A very important tourist attraction, The Mill on the Fleet, was
featured in your paper at its inauguration.
There would, in a day's schedule, be adequate opportunity to make a
short visit to this town and others, such as Kirkcudbright, in the area.

IT IS a rare and heartening sight for a Scottish company to swoop
across the border in an enormous takeover bid. Such movements seem too
often to be in the opposite direction. ScottishPower's attempt to take
over Manweb, one of the smaller English regional electricity companies,
will, if successful, create a very large energy-based business
headquartered in Glasgow, to complement the new nuclear electric
business which is to be run from Edinburgh. These locations can augur
nothing but good for the health of the Scottish economy and the morale
of its managers and workers. There was every chance that ScottishPower
itself might have been the object of predatory interest from a big
conglomerate, like Hanson, for example. The speed of its move, in the
aftermath of the Littlechild review of the English electricity
suppliers, suggests a management which knows its mind. There is a good
chance of success, and in spite of the premium every chance that
Scottish will be able to raise Manweb's efficiency to its own high
levels so justifying the price on offer. The price also suggests
Professor Littlechild's second bite at the cherry of electricity supply
profits was far from greedy, which has implications for the immediate
future of Northern Electric which is still being courted by Trafalgar
House and, indeed, for other of the supply companies, many of which are
now effectively ''in play''. The electricity industry will not return to
its old structure but it does look as if the number of companies within
it will shrink significantly. (How quickly that process develops may
depend on whether the Regulator refers this bid to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission.)
ScottishPower had to make some such domestic move as its future
profits are under pressure from movements it can neither control nor
avoid (the coming privatisation of Scottish Nuclear, for example, may
well have a deleterious impact on its profits). Its ambitions overseas
are important but long term, and its other initiatives, in areas like
telecommunications, also need time to prove themselves. Its stewardship
of Manweb, by contrast, should yield benefits from the beginning, though
one means to that end, more job losses, will not be universally popular.
These benefits will not be confined to shareholders; customers will
profit too, for whereas Manweb's costs are the highest in the country,
ScottishPower's are the lowest. Professor Littlechild will be keen to
see that any new equilibrium here benefits consumers at once, in
addition to the other benefits his latest review has already identified
and is in process of delivering to them. (He has had success on this
front in previous rationalising moves in north-eastern England and the
Midlands.)
The bid looks generous enough to succeed with little enhancement, but
much depends on others' assessments of Manweb's value, and the way in
which its interests dovetail with their own. In that respect this is not
a knockout offer but it is designed to be close to one. It remains to be
seen whether other bidders will emerge, or if a monopolies reference is
made as Labour would like, and on what grounds it would be advanced. In
short, it is all early days, but the excitement which the move has
generated across the sector is one measure of its significance, which
might not be confined to the electricity companies as many of the same
developments seem likely in the water utilities as well. Unfortunately
both are the very privatised companies whose corporate management, and
rewards, have already aroused much public resentment. How these feelings
will affect takeovers is still an unknown, and one of some importance.

* MICHAEL Schumacher has dashed hopes of an early end to his feud with
Damon Hill, blaming his British rival's ''moody'' personality.
But the world champion said he hoped German fans would give Hill a
good reception at this weekend's grand prix at Hockenheim.
Schumacher, whose contract with Benetton runs out at the end of the
season, also denied rumours that he was on the verge of a deal with
Italian team Ferrari for next season. The German driver admitted on that
he would be with one of four teams next season -- Benetton, Ferrari,
Williams or McLaren.
Schumacher, involved in a war of words with Hill before they crashed
at last week's British Grand Prix, said there was little point in
sitting down together to try to settle their personal differences. He
said: ''We could do if he was in the right mood.''

PETER Greenhough, chairman of the Royal and Ancient Club's
championship committee and the club secretary, Michael Bonallack, had
serious reservations about only one aspect of the conduct of the 124th
Open championship, also the twenty-fifth to be held on the Old Course --
the funereal pace of the play on the first two days.
Rounds took up to five-and-a-half hours to complete because of the
strength of the west wind bustling over the narrow fairways and seven
double greens. ''There were driveable par 4s, which in that sense makes
it a unique course,'' Bonallack explained, ''and when there are six
balls lying on the same fairway that takes time to sort out.''
Replying to the suggestion that a smaller field was the obvious way to
reduce congestion, no matter which course the Open was being played on,
Greenhough said: ''We would be reluctant to reduce the opportunities to
qualify and it would be hard to go back on the existing system of
exemptions.''
Bonallack responded to Nick Price's complaint that, as defending
champion, he should not have been out so late in the second round, by
insisting that the draw was fairly made and was attended by independent
observers representing both the European and the US Tours.
''For example,'' he said, ''Gordon Sherry's grouping with Tom Watson
and Greg Norman came out of the hat (or in this instance four boxes,
consisting respectively of European, American, and overseas seeds and
others). If three known to be particularly slow players come out
together we would make a minor adjustment, moving one of them a few
minutes either way.''
Although the attendance of 180,000 was some 20,000 fewer than at the
1990 Open, the corporate hospitality unit sales again held the level
achieved in 1992 which had declined from two years before. ''We were
well able to afford the #130,000 in additional prize-money the larger
than usual number of qualifiers costs us,'' said George Wilson the
deputy secretary.
Whether or not all these aspects were indeed satisfactory, John Daly's
victory meant that Americans have won all three of this season's major
titles so far. Last year they won none. In golf this is described as
''the cyclical effect'.' Unfortunately, and inescapably, this is a Ryder
Cup year and there is the knock-on aspect to consider.
The best a front-ranked European could achieve in the Masters was
equal fourteenth by Jose Maria Olazabal; in the US Open Ian Woosnam,
also equal fourteenth; and although, on Sunday, Costantino Rocca did the
cause as proud as he could, Sam Torrance excepted, there was little
other evidence to inspire confidence for the match against the United
States.
The Old Firm of major title winners was best, if remotely, represented
by Bernhard Langer at equal fourteenth with Nick Faldo, Severiano
Ballesteros, Woosnam, and Sandy Lyle at a distance so detached as to be
as good as invisible to the naked eye. Olazabal, equal thirtieth, best
represented the interim generation in the enforced absence of Colin
Montgomerie.
These last two cannot be expected constantly to carry the standard.
The cause for concern is the continuing inability of such players as
Barry Lane (fourteenth on the list), Peter Baker (twenty-first), and
Paul Broadhurst (twenty-second) to be other than almost anonymous. With
only five counting tournaments until the last, as usual played in
Germany where interest could hardly be less, opportunities are running
thin.
The enigma of Montgomerie was described last week by his coach, Bill
Ferguson. ''He's not taking his putting stroke from the practice green
out on to the course,'' the bluff Yorkshireman said as Montgomerie was
about to miss the cut at St Andrews, his third such Open failure in four
years.
''He has to keep his chin up and his head from going down when things
are against him,'' Ferguson added. ''He has to learn to be more
responsive, too, to the encouragement of spectators.''
The irritating fact is that whereas many others give the impression of
being indifferent, even hostile, to success Montgomerie is consumed by
the need for it.

THE discredited Monklands District Council was on the rack again last
night over a question on religion that appears on a council job
application form.
Not only does the council ask whether the applicant is a Christian,
but wants specifics about which version of Christianity he or she
adheres to.
Applicants are also asked to tick a box if he or she is Hindu, Jewish,
Muslim, Sikh, some other religion, or of no religion.
The revelation comes after the ''jobs for the boys'' allegations and
the damning report on council recruiting practices by Professor Robert
Black, QC.
Ironically, the question was framed on the advice of independent
consultants, Ashdown Milan, who in 1993 investigated allegations against
the council. The purpose of the question was to demonstrate that there
was no imbalance in recruitment along religious lines.
Unfortunately Monklands district's ecumenical approach appears to have
been misunderstood.
One applicant, Ms Frances McGlinchey, yesterday said she was shocked
to see the question on the form.
She said: ''I am a university business graduate and I have never seen
a question like this on a job application form.
''Although the section involved is voluntary, I believe most
applicants will feel under pressure to fill it in to create a good
impression.
''Asking a Christian to be specific can only mean finding out whether
a person is Catholic or Protestant.''
Catholic-born Ms McGlinchey, a 33-year-old married mother who suffers
from MS and is a former local Labour Party official in Glenboig, near
Airdrie, applied for a part-time post in the council's Library Service.
She said: ''Because I have a disability I always study equal
opportunities forms. But I could not believe this question.
''It is either, at best, insensitive or, at worst, blatant
discrimination.''
She is still waiting to hear if her application for the job was
successful.
A spokeswoman for the Equal Opportunities Commission in Glasgow said:
''Our view is that this is bad practice. It is certainly not normal for
a question like this to appear.
''Information like this for monitoring purposes should be kept
entirely separate from a job application, and the information should be
used for positive purposes.''
Professor Black's recently-published report found no evidence of
religious bias in recruitment. But it reported repeated allegations that
councillors on important committees were members of the Catholic
organisation, the Knights of St Columba.
The report's suggestion that councillor ''Knights'' did not declare
themselves when making decisions provoked an outcry from the
organisation's hierarchy.
At the council meeting to discuss the report, all Labour members
present denied they were ''Knights''.
The Black report highlighted a spending imbalance between Coatbridge,
which has a high proportion of Catholics, and the mainly Protestant
populated Airdrie.
Yesterday a council spokeswoman said: ''The question appears on the
form because of a recommendation from independent consultants Ashdown
Milan in 1993 who investigated allegations against the council.
''It is so we have information available to show clearly that there is
no imbalance in recruitment along religious lines.
''Our policy on recruitment has consistently been shown to be free of
any religious discrimination.''
The Ashdown Milan report said: ''If outside allegations persist, the
council must be able to provide clear evidence of fair treatment.
''If they decide to include a question on religion, the reasons for
this must be made absolutely clear.''

IF THE 60 or so years of Loch Long Class racing on the Clyde have
proved one thing, it is that there are no two days the same on the
estuary. That was firmly underlined as the second race of Loch Long Week
offered a stark contrast to Sunday's squally opener.
Only two legs of the course were completed yesterday, and even that
was after the patience of the 15-boat fleet was eventually rewarded when
the mirror calm was ruffled by a light westerly which allowed a start to
be made.
Hunter's Quay was the first turning mark. Those who opted for the
Gourock shore found even less breeze and drifted off course in the
ebbing tide towards Inverkip, while the leaders parked up at the
notoriously fluky Hunter's Quay buoy where the breeze disintegrated to
nil, the heavens opened, and misery descended with the blanket of mist.
It sent crews scrabbling for some hasty compass work to maintain some
kind of heading for the Baron's Point mark.
Only Graham Hutchinson was left with anything resembling a smile after
a thoroughly dreary drift as he coaxed Boomerang across the finish line
of the shortened course to win from Duncan Farquar in Sula in second,
and Arthur Black in Allegro third. Result:
1, Boomerang, G Hutchinson; 2, Sula, D Farquar; 3, Allegro, A Black;
4, Gaudeamus, A Maconochie; 5, Rose, A Mackie.

DUNDEE United chairman Jim McLean confirmed last night that the
Tannadice side are interested in Coventry City's ex-Ibrox pair Steven
Pressley and Sandy Robertson.
The two former Rangers players are being tipped for a #900,000 double
deal which will take them to Tannadice as United prepare their campaign
to climb out of the first division in one season.
McLean said: ''I admit we are keen on both players and that the
situation is ongoing. But I would add that we are anxious to make
signings and that these two players are among a number who are
interesting us.
''We believe it is important to bring in fresh faces but nothing is
imminent.''
McLean added that manager Billy Kirkwood would announce any signings
United do make, and he is out of the country until Friday with the squad
on their pre-season trip to Finland.
Robertson was close to signing for United last week but the deal hit a
snag, although Kirkwood did not rule out the chances of it being
completed eventually.
Scotland under-21 defender Pressley was one of the first players
targeted by Kirkwood after he took over from Ivan Golac as United
manager near the end of last season.
* HAMILTON and Airdrie, who are still poles apart regarding the
transfer value of Accies striker Peter Duffield, have until Thursday to
settle matters.
If no deal is reached by then the fee will be decided at a tribunal.
Meanwhile, Hamilton have arranged a friendly for Monday, August 7,
against junior side Arthurlie at Barrhead.

WORK has stopped on a #16m film being shot in Ireland, starring Marlon
Brando, because of cash problems.
Brando's involvement in Divine Rapture -- a black comedy co-starring
Debra Winger, Johnny Depp and John Hurt -- had moved him to contemplate
taking up Irish citizenship. The film began shooting in Ballycotton,
County Cork, earlier this month.
However, the producers said in a statement in Dublin yesterday: ''With
deep regret we have had to cease production of Divine Rapture. In spite
of continuing assurances of financial backing from our backer, the funds
have not been forthcoming.''

OPEN Championship streaker Mark Roberts yesterday vowed not to repeat
the stunt in Scotland after being fined #250 at a Fife court.
Englishman Roberts, 30, openly admitted after the hearing at Cupar
Sheriff Court that he had gone to the tournament at St Andrews on Sunday
with the intention of streaking across the 18th green of the
championship links course ''as a light-hearted joke''.
Thousands of golf fans, police, golf officials and players were
stunned when the six-foot unemployed pipe fitter climbed over security
fences to race on to the course -- seconds after American John Daly had
sunk his winning putt to carry off the Open prize -- bearing a painted
notice stating ''19th hole'' on his back, with an arrow pointing
downwards.
The crowds roared with laughter as Roberts was chased around the 18th
fairway by a policeman for some time before being rugby tackled to the
ground by another man, initially thought to be a steward.
It later emerged that the man was a friend of the accused, Freddie
Warrilow from Eastbourne.
He was in court yesterday to watch the proceedings and said
afterwards: ''I told Mark not to do it. It took me three or four minutes
to catch him and playfully slap him on the face after bringing him to
the ground.''
Following yesterday's court appearance, Roberts, of Prescott Road,
Liverpool, disclosed he is no stranger to streaking at some of the
world's top sporting events.
Speaking outside the court building he revealed that he had streaked
on the Richard and Judy ITV morning show, swimming out to the weather
map and baring all to millions of television viewers, in April.
He added: ''I also streaked during the Liverpool v. Arsenal match in
January and during a recent Merseyside derby.''
Roberts, who admitted causing a breach of the peace on the Old Course
by running naked across the 18th green, described the fine as ''a bit
harsh''.

Phone business can become a pleasure when there's a sporting flutter
to be had at work, as Sue Tranter finds out
ANYONE who enjoys a bit of a gamble would certainly be at home in the
CR Smith telesales office in Dunfermline. Visitors could be forgiven for
thinking they had wandered onto the set of a game show rather than an
office dedicated to selling double glazing and conservatories over the
phone.
To most people the idea of ringing randomly-selected householders to
ask if they would like to invest in home improvements might seem a
pretty thankless task. But the surprising truth is that it works, and as
a result CR Smith have increased their staff dramatically since they
decided to push into telecanvassing as a major sales initiative.
Instead of being the dreary slog it might be imagined, the staff seem
to enjoy their work. Watching them hard at it, there seems to be a whiff
of excitement about the place as the very next call could come up with a
customer. To make it more interesting, the company has even invented a
series of games where a successful canvasser can gamble a small
incentive payment once they have found a prospective client.
''Each time someone picks up a #5 payment they can keep it or take a
chance on increasing it by opening a box,'' says Craig McNaughton, lead
generation manager, pointing to a series of boxes at the side of the
room.
''They might just get #3 or they might double it up,'' he adds. Other
sales games include pitch and putt and a tombola wheel.
The philosophy of entertaining as well as looking after the staff
seems to have paid off for CR Smith. During May the company made
#800,000 through telecanvassing.
The system has been in place for three years, according to Gerard
Eadie, CR Smith chairman. He believes that it takes three essentials to
make it work so well.
''You need a good company name first and foremost,'' he says. ''Then
the approach has to be made in a polite manner, and finally you must
work a numbers game.''
''Our code is never to pretend. We say in the first few seconds who we
are and why we are calling. We emphasise the importance of knowledge
about the company when we are training staff.''
There is also a strong emphasis on ensuring that canvassers are as
content as possible.
Craig McNaughton finds that staff cannot work properly if they are
worried or their attitude is wrong. ''That's why we have supervisors who
will talk to people, encourage them and reassure them,'' he says.
''If you are going to do this job you must be able to take rejection
to do the work and make the calls. A good supervisor works with the
staff to get them to enjoy their work.''
One of the real plus points to the job are the hours. A shift begins
around six in the evening to nine at night. These hours prove
particularly popular with women managing families and also for men who
want to take on an extra job.
But students and school leavers are also among the staff in the three
centres at Dunfermline, Glasgow, and Dundee. They take a break each hour
if need be, and at Dunfermline a light, attractive eating area known as
the Bistro provides constant meals as well as a welcoming place to sit,
relax, and chat.
Not surprisingly, the motive for some women is social as well as
financial.
''For others it might be the first real recognition they have had of
their potential since giving up work and starting a family. Their first
sale might well be a real morale boost as well as a money earner,'' says
Craig.
''If they have been at home for some years they enjoy the buzz about
the place too.''
Wages are calculated on a basic hourly rate with an ability to improve
according to productivity. A good canvasser can earn around #120 for 9
to 12 hours a week.
''And most are likely to earn at least #8.50 an hour for the simple
reason that no one would stick around to do the job for less than that
if they weren't enjoying it and being successful,'' says Craig.
Muriel Herkes has a son of 23 and lives at Inverkeithing. She works at
the Dunfermline centre four nights a week from six until nine.
''When I started here four years ago, there were just 24 of us,'' she
says, looking round the room full of canvassers, sitting four to a
table.
''I enjoy the work and find that people often want to chat on the
phone.''
Tracy Thornton has been in the job for just four months since leaving
school. She works three nights a week and applied when a friend, who was
already a canvasser, said how much she enjoyed the atmosphere.
''I did get a bit anxious till I got my first positive response, and
then I was so excited I couldn't remember what to say,'' she laughs.
''When I was worried, the supervisor was really helpful and kept saying
don't get upset, it will happen, and she was right.
''No one puts pressure on you here, the only one who does that is
yourself.''
CR SMith aim to recruit at six-week intervals using newspaper adverts
to find their canvassers. Not surprisingly, a telephone interview is the
first step and anyone who sounds suitable is then invited to the office
for a face-to-face chat.
''We are looking for people with the right personality and manner,''
says Craig. Perhaps people who enjoy a bit of a gamble might also apply.

A LEADING Scottish psychiatric hospital, where four patients committed
suicide within eight weeks, last night admitted a special life-saving
device failed to prevent two of them taking their own lives.
The Royal Edinburgh Hospital admitted that special anti-suicide
measures installed around patients' beds had not worked. They said
emergency work was carried out yesterday afternoon and first thing this
morning to rectify the problem.
Edinburgh South MP Nigel Griffiths last night demanded an inquiry into
why curtain rails, designed to collapse under a weight of five stones or
more, had not done so and two patients had hung themselves from them.
A spokesman for Edinburgh Healthcare Trust, which runs the hospital,
said the victims had found a way round the safety device.
She added: ''We needed to find technical solutions to this and work
was carried out yesterday and today. We carried out our own tests on the
rails and they have been shown to collapse but the victims managed to
find a way round the safety measures.
The spokeswoman said the ''technical solutions'' would be put in place
in six wards at the hospital.
It is believed the second suicide, around eight weeks after the first,
was a copy-cat. Mr Griffiths said questions must be asked over whether
the second death could have been avoided if the ''technical solutions''
had been put into place earlier.
The other two suicides within the eight-week period were by patients
who had killed themselves while on passes from the hospital.
Mr Griffiths said he believed the poor conditions at the hospital and
the lack of adequate community back-up might have contributed to the
deaths.

Defence lawyer
The defence case, Eric Kennedy hears, is evidently very appealing
DAVID McCaig would have to plead guilty if asked whether he enjoys his
work. He has plenty of evidence to show that his day-to-day routine as a
criminal lawyer is a worthwhile and satisfying career.
He first wanted to become a lawyer in his fifth year at St Joseph's
Academy in Kilmarnock. ''I was looking at some brochures provided by the
guidance department,'' he recalls, ''and took a notion to try it out''.
The four-year honours course at Edinburgh University is a tough way to
try out anything. It takes a great deal of study and commitment and
parts of it, he admits, were difficult.
Other parts were more interesting: in particular the case studies and
criminal law. He also enjoyed delict, the area of civil law where people
sue others for wrongdoing such as assault or negligence.
He graduated LLB (Hons) in 1982 and then completed the year-long
Diploma in Legal Practice to become a solicitor.
After that came a two-year traineeship in a legal practice, working
with a firm in the centre of Glasgow and gaining expertise in civil law,
trusts and executries, conveyancing, and criminal court work.
He had worked for this firm for two summer periods as a student, and
had come to admire the criminal lawyers. ''I wanted to do it, too,'' he
says.
In his second year as a trainee he got his chance in a case at Ayr,
where he had to handle a straightforward guilty plea. He was hooked, and
at the end of his traineeship was offered a job with the company as an
assistant doing criminal court work.
Three years later he became a partner, and when the firm de-merged
some time later, he and a fellow partner formed their own company,
Doonan &amp; McCaig, specialising in court work.
''It is a hugely satisfying job,'' he says. ''For a start it is very
competitive. But more importantly, you are often dealing with people for
whom this is the first taste of the legal system.
''They don't know what to expect and need someone to guide them
through it. I should also say that many people are wrongly accused.''
A typical day sees him arrive at his Glasgow office about 9am, go
through the mail, then head for one of the sheriff or district courts in
the Central Belt where most of his work is concentrated, to represent a
client.
A case might take all day, or could be over in a matter of minutes.
Either way, he returns to his office to attend to paperwork and
interview clients.
He also visits prisons such as Barlinnie, the women's unit at Cornton
Vale, and the young offenders' institution at Longriggend near Airdrie.
The worst place he has seen was the solitary-confinement cages at
Peterhead which, he says, defied description.
All in all, however, he derives great satisfaction from what he does.
''Obviously I am working with the guilty as well as the innocent. But
the criminal lawyer fulfils a very important role.''

Distance learning and custom-built courses can translate into success
for British companies in Europe, as Geraldine Abrahams reports
SUMMER holidays in Europe often serve as a harsh reminder of British
reticence in learning the languages of our neighbours. Conversely, they
also tend to highlight the European enthusiasm for speaking English.
Not speaking the native language on holiday can be mildly irritating
to others, but when this is translated into the business arena, the
repercussions for British companies trying to operate in a European
marketplace can be drastic. Poor communication often results in lost
orders and shrinking markets.
There have been vigorous attempts to make Scottish companies more
aware of the importance of communicating in the languages of their
European counterparts in business, and the positive effects this can
have on their marketing efforts abroad.
The level of proficiency depends on the needs of individual companies,
but it is unlikely that many would find it necessary to advance beyond a
level in language skills which is relevant to their own business and
management requirements.
Strathclyde Languages for Business Unit, based at the University of
Strathclyde in Glasgow, is a major provider of business-language skills
and recently won the Arcadian International PLC, Sir Peter Parker Award
(DTI Languages for Export Awards).
The unit is managed by Josiane Wyper. As a French person living and
working in Scotland, Josiane realises better than most the kind of
difficulties that can arise in adapting to different cultures, and in
learning other languages. She has found this very helpful for
researching and defining the types of courses the unit should run.
The Language for Business Unit deals with large and small companies,
tailoring the courses to meet the specific needs of each. Josiane has
been delighted at the positive attitudes of the companies.
''They are all highly motivated, keen to work in and export to
Europe,'' she said. ''Those involved come from both senior-management
levels as well as exports and sales, in all types of manufacturing and
service industries.''
Josiane and her team study the needs of individual companies before
deciding on the format of the courses which should be offered.
Many choose distance-learning modules which make it possible to fit
the learning of another language into busy schedules with the minimum of
disruption. This type of learning vehicle also involves a series of
weekly tutorial sessions.
''Distance learning is very popular,'' said Josiane. ''It is a
training package which is studied at home, with practice once a week at
the unit -- a combination of open learning and tutorial.''
The modules are available in French, German, and Spanish and cover
everything from the basic introduction to the language, to mastering
telephone, social and business skills as well as information on business
dealings in that new language.
Alternatively there are one or two-week intensive courses designed for
companies whose employees or managers have an immediate need to learn
another language. They are on offer either at the companies' premises or
at the unit.
Because these courses have a direct purpose, they are customised to
meet each company's requirements and can include everything from basic
introductions, both formal and informal, to the practices of the
different countries, and to conducting successful business operations at
meetings and trade fairs.
Philips Communications Systems is one company that has used the
Languages for Business Unit successfully on two occasions. Initially the
course was run on-site, but most recently the company's need for
language training was so immediate those involved had to attend a very
intensive one-week crash course.
''A new development project had come on stream. It was a joint venture
between the plant at Airdrie and our sister plant at Nuremberg in
Germany, and it was starting almost immediately,'' said Ron Wright, head
of training at Philips in Airdrie.
''We had to prepare as best we could in the short time that was
available. We had used Strathclyde University before, although the
format was different. This time it was 9am to 5pm -- an intensive
training in German language and culture.
''There was an emphasis on basic survival skills in the German
environment because there were several families involved, but it also
had to be business-related, looking at the needs of our engineers going
over there. We were provided with a glossary of terms connected to
communications.''
Six months on, did such an intensive course work?
Ron says the engineers are still in Germany so he has not spoken to
them directly. But feedback suggests that it has worked well, especially
in vocabulary and they appear to have found the support course notes and
tapes they took with them particularly helpful.
Another aspect of the unit's work is cultural briefings where advice
on business and social etiquette is given, as well as information which
will help travellers understand the political and economic situation
within the country to be visited.
There are also refresher language courses offered on a single-day
basis or regularly over a longer period.
Wherever and however companies decide to learn languages, one thing is
very clear. Those organisations that fail to see the marketplace in a
wider European or world-based context are in danger of limiting their
options and finding themselves threatened, even on their own doorsteps.
It must be safe to assume that if Scottish companies are finding their
way into the European markets, their equivalents in France, Germany,
Spain, and Italy will also be looking to expand -- and most of the
people working in European companies speak perfect English.

THE Convention of Scottish Local Authorities has not feared a
Secretary of State for Scotland for some considerable time. Local
government in Scotland was, and is, wall-to-wall Labour in most areas
and the self-confidence engendered by this state of affairs was rarely
dented by the reactive Mr Lang or by his predecessors. It is likely that
this cosy state of affairs will change under Mr Michael Forsyth, indeed
the process has begun. For proof it was necessary only to view the
confused state of Cosla's finest yesterday after their first encounter
with Mr Forsyth. It may be a touch vulgar, but boxing terminology comes
irresistibly to mind, and particularly the phrase ''sucker-punch'' in
the sense of being lured on to a destructive blow. Cosla (Labour) is
understandably anxious that the reputation of local government in
Scotland be redeemed in the aftermath of the Monklands affair. There has
been considerable concern that damaging allegations could be made
repeatedly in Parliament while the Scottish Secretary insisted, as time
passed and the allegations multiplied, that he could do nothing without
proof of wrongdoing. Some mechanism to speed the examination of
allegations is clearly necessary, and when Mr Forsyth and Mr Kynoch met
Cosla yesterday they came bearing a superficially attractive solution.
Mr Forsyth's plan involves the establishment of a task force to
examine the rules which govern the manner in which councillors are
supposed to conduct their affairs. This is fine and reasonable and Cosla
signed up enthusiastically. What these experienced leaders of Scottish
local government did not do was to examine the small print which they
will learn is present in every one of Mr Fosyth's documents. Mr Kynoch
was good enough to enlighten them, by which time it was too late. The
task force to which Cosla has agreed is to conduct one of the most
far-reaching examinations of local government which it is possible to
undertake. According to Mr Kynoch it will involve an examination of the
Ombudsman, with the implication that his role can be strengthened, and a
searching look at the National Code of Local Government Conduct, the
Register of Pecuniary interests, the rules for appointing and sacking
senior staff, and the system of monitoring officers within councils.
This is weighty stuff which goes far beyond anything envisaged anywhere
else, including those tasks undertaken by the Nolan Committee.
There was, in truth, little Cosla could do about the trap set for it
by Mr Forsyth once it had wandered innocently into the jaws. To denounce
the remit of a task force to which it had earlier agreed would look
foolish. Mr Forsyth will be pleased. His aim of monitoring local
government so the highest standards can be followed is laudable and
there is little doubt he will pursue that aim energetically, invigorated
by its socialist nature. By widening the remit he can ensure a lengthy
period of public examination of the activities of Labour councillors,
with the promise of a report at the end of the process. Mr Forsyth
appears still on track towards the removal of capping of council budgets
and this, again, is mixed news for Cosla's Labour members. By removing
Government intervention in the form of budget capping Mr Forsyth may
tempt some councils into unwisely energetic spending which will affect
taxpayers, thereby allowing Tory activists propaganda opportunities.
Councils will still face continuing reductions in financial support from
government, but this will lack the demonising potential inherent in the
capping process. Mr Forsyth will be delighted with his work yesterday.
He is probably the most determinedly politicised Secretary of State we
have ever had and he has learned to combine this with a subtlety which
will enhance Scottish politics in the immediate future.

Tory MP George Walden has just announced that he will retire from
Parliament at the next election. Julia Langdon tells why it will be a
lesser place without him
ALL politicians are mad and most of them are liars. They have to be a
little barmy to want to go into politics in the first place and they
have to tell lies if they want to get on. These are simple facts about
the way the British political system works and need to be frequently
restated. The trouble is that usually no-one dares.
So we owe a big thank you to George Walden, the Tory MP for
Buckingham, who has just announced that he will retire from Parliament
at the next election and has told us why. He didn't give us any of the
usual guff. There were no platitudes or meaningless phrases about the
privilege and pleasure of playing a part in our great democratic
society.
Instead, just like the little boy in the fairy story, George Walden
baldly announced that the emperor was naked.
There are many who will disagree with his analysis on a number of
different counts. There were at least six highly controversial political
comments in his letter to his constituents -- a letter which should go
down in history and should certainly serve as a text for future A-level
students. But the joy is that he has been honest enough and brave enough
to break party ranks, to flout normal codes of political etiquette, and
to say what he thinks and believes. That, surely, is what politicians
ought always to do. That should be primarily the purpose for which we
elect them to Parliament.
Yet the problem, as Walden so accurately identified it, is that party
politics does not allow for free spirits and individual expression. As
he knows better than most. He himself resigned somewhat mysteriously,
for what was described at the time, in 1987, as private reasons, from
his job as an Education Minister.
It was assumed that possibly he needed to augment his income as an MP
-- as many do -- and could not do so while remaining in office. Now we
learn that he violently disapproves of this Government's education
policies, of the two-tier system, and what he described as the apartheid
that exists between public and private sectors.
And he has had the guts to say so. It is a pity, however, that he
could not have said it before, that our political system obliges our
politicians to dissemble in quite the fashion that they all do, that
indeed everyone must, if he or she is to keep the patronage offered by
the political structure. And, look, here is a quotation from George
Walden, the Minister, in 1985 saying that the Conservatives are the only
rational, coherent, and consistent party in Britain.
These are not failures confined to any one party. They are all at it.
Most of the time they do not mean to lie directly. They have the
intention of fulfilling their words or, at the very least, attempting to
fulfil them. Politicians may be mad, but only a very few of them are
bad; the vast majority are, on the contrary, well-intentioned men and
women who honestly seek to improve the public lot.
Even so there is much deception practised on the public, if not
necessarily for malign reasons. Every politician has to offer something
superior to the opposing parties in order to be elected, has to accept
the creed of the party manifesto handed down from on high to those who
would seek to stand for Parliament in its interest, even though everyone
involved is aware that promises are made that cannot be delivered. It is
the confrontational nature of our political system -- what Walden
described as the ''left-right compress'' -- which prescribes this
pretence that one brand of education policy washes whiter than the next,
that one party's taxation plans are tastier than any rival make.
And the inevitable consequence of all that, which Walden also
specified, is that politicians are increasingly held in contempt by the
general public. This, however, is not new. In George Bernard Shaw's play
Major Barbara there is the line: ''He knows nothing and thinks he knows
everything. That points clearly to a political career.''
Shaw had a marvellous talent for raising a laugh with a perception
that his audiences would share and appreciate. The public has always
suspected the truth about politicians and is not so easily hoodwinked as
some appear to believe may be possible. They know the MPs who are
convincing and tell the truth, as much as they can; they can spot the
phoneys. They know that they are peddled illusions. They would prefer it
otherwise, but the system does not allow for this.
There is another side to this, though. It is dangerous and patronising
to underestimate the intelligence of the public and it appears possible
that Walden could be doing this. His letter suggests that the nature of
the system that has caused him so much offence is insulting to the
electorate. ''If we have so little faith in the intelligence of the
electorate, I can see few reasons for being in politics . . .'' he
writes. But this is where the story becomes melancholy, for that comment
presupposes that the practice of politics is a waste of time. The sad
reality seems to be that George Walden has lost his faith, not only in
his party but in the way in which politics can serve the public good.
Dancing like a fly in the beam of public attention is, indeed, not a
challenging prospect for an intelligent politician. But while there are
those who do choose to use their political careers as an opportunity to
perform, to show off, there is also a desperate need for others who get
things done, who pursue the public interest of the greater number, who
perform in private -- people, in short, like George Walden. It is a
shame that he will not be in the next Parliament to dare to tell the
truth.
It will be a lesser place without him.

A 32-YEAR-old man sobbed at the High Court in Glasgow after charges of
shooting two brothers were found not proven.
Mr Angus Malavin had denied murdering Mr Allan MacDonald, 34, and
attempting to murder Mr Iain MacDonald, 30.
He went home to see his two-week-old twin sons for the first time. He
has three other young sons.
The court heard that a hooded gunman had ambushed the brothers as they
left the Orange Hall in Sandbank Street, Maryhill, on March 16.
Mr Allan MacDonald, of Sandbank Street, collapsed dying from a shotgun
blast to the back.
Iain, a former boxer, of Wynford Road, Maryhill, was chased round his
car before being shot in the right shoulder.
In court, he pointed to Mr Malavin, of Acre Drive, Maryhill, saying:
''That man shot me and my brother. He didn't give us a chance.''
The court heard that Iain MacDonald had accused Mr Malavin of having
an affair with his wife and had punched him in a snooker club last
November.
Then on January 2 in a public house in Maryhill Road, Iain MacDonald
claimed he went to shake hands with Mr Malavin but was hit on the head
with a bottle.
Asked how Mr Malavin had sustained wounds to his face, Mr MacDonald
said it could have happened when they struggled on the floor, which had
broken glass.
Mr Malavin, who claimed an alibi, said Iain MacDonald had accused him
of having an affair with his wife and refused to accept this was not
true.
Mr Paul Cullen, prosecuting, in his speech to the jury described Iain
MacDonald as a notorious Maryhill thug who regarded himself as a hard
man. He said Mr Malavin had taken the law into his own hands after being
left with horrifying face scars.
Mr Malavin had agreed he was proud of his appearance, but denied he
had wanted to take his own revenge and carried out the shooting.

Radio Clyde has been accused of allowing Scot FM to 'snatch' the
Scottish Football League contract for commentaries. Programme director
Alex Dickson says that nothing could be further from the truth
LAST season, we told the Scottish Football League that Radio Clyde
would no longer be interested in broadcasting commentaries, and
immediately began negotiating for other rights.
This is a euphemism for saying we had and have plans to improve and
update Super Scoreboard, to keep it fresh and out in front as Scotland's
most listened-to sports programme.
Everything else the programme has done has been copied by the
opposition and it is vital to innovate . . . even if we always know that
it will be doppelganged within weeks.
What do we want? Precisely what we bought from the SFA last year, and
what the league sold to Scot FM last season. Nothing more. We ask
ourselves, what is the problem?
In an attempt to improve our programme, we wish to change its shape.
As broadcasters, we believe we understand what is in the best interests
of listeners.
As an attraction for them, and tens of thousands of them follow our
advice and take their trannies to the game, the sad fact is that radio
commentary per se is in terminal decline.
It was inevitable when television moved in and we have recognised
this.
Has everyone who tunes into Super Scoreboard -- or who pays to go
through the turnstiles -- appreciated that there will be Saturdays with
only three premier matches being played, as TV cherrypicks what it wants
moved out?
Nobody should be in any doubt that those switched-date clashes will be
the ones television identifies as ''the best games''. In radio, we
understand and acknowledge that this makes sense for them.
But, inevitably, there is a diminished product.
The fact is that we never wanted to sign for commentary rights, and
made this clear to the Scottish Football League. The contract was on the
table last April. We declined to pick it up. We have been saying no
thanks since then.
In our view, the ball is on the slates as far as live commentary is
concerned.
Listeners should be aware of what is ahead on Saturdays.
Year on year, researched audiences shrank for second-half
commentaries. This comes from the industry's bible, RAJAR. Our figures
for September to December 1994 were down almost 25% on the previous
year. Significantly, this marked the expanded entry of BSkyB on to the
radio pitch and the beginning of Saturdays being chopped and changed
around.
Conversely, Super Scoreboard began with higher figures than the
previous year, and listeners came back after commentary for our Open
Line which has of course been poached by TV as well as most other radio
stations.
This season, BSkyB will pluck at least 17 games of their choice from
the Scottish card -- more if they want -- and have them played on
Sundays or week nights. Scottish Television will do the same with
another seven matches.
Then there's BBC Scotland with even more on the small screen.
Not all fans may yet realise that traditional Saturday afternoon
football is never going to be the same again.
Of course money is important, but has never been a deal-breaker in all
the years we have negotiated. Last season in Scotland, the BBC and
ourselves each paid four times what it cost one of Clyde's sister
stations to broadcast a commentary in England.
I nearly overlooked the subtle distinction . . . we were allowed five
minutes, and then the second half only. Below the Border, that fee
provided 90 minutes of live coverage.
Ernie Walker and his committee, called in to investigate what is wrong
with Scottish football, please note.
One of our plans for next season is to negotiate the right to bring
frequent updates from as many grounds as possible, moving quickly to
take listeners all over the country. The aim is to serve up the
immediacy of what is happening everywhere on Saturdays.
This, we believe, is the only way that radio can compete with
television. It will please more fans, not solely those supporting the
commentary teams, and offer real coverage from grounds which could be
squeezed off the agenda.
We do not want to be locked into what will be the one-out-of-four
fixtures, sometimes three, which frequently will constitute choice for
those who have not been perceptive enough to see the way ahead if radio
is to keep up with the times.
By dipping in and out of the available card, we will be able to
maintain the excitement and drama as only skilled professional
presenters can.
Some might say, as ever increasingly games are moved out of Saturday
afternoons, we will enhance elements of an overall picture which
television perhaps would not wish to reveal.
Our Saturday sports programme fills an important four hours for
listeners. Commentary occupies only 50 minutes of that time, which means
there is much more to putting together an award-winning show than
accepting what the SFL wished to will on us.
Only 10 days ago, an agreement was signed by the premiership in
England, allowing as many as 140 radio services, should they express
interest, to update from grounds. Rights to commentaries, if these are
wanted, are negotiated with, and paid to, stations' local clubs.
No radio station has to go near the governing bodies.
This works to the satisfaction of giants like Newcastle, Liverpool,
Manchester United, Arsenal, and Tottenham Hotspur, as well as the rest.
A harmonious relationship, with two kinds of understanding, working
together for the benefit of the game, and the fan.
So what is the problem in Scottish football?
Our relations with the clubs are excellent. Clyde has invested heavily
in Scottish football. Apart from reporting on our teams in Europe, and
following Scotland around the world, we have parted with more than #1m
to Scottish football bosses across the years.
It takes #30,000 to kit out just the premier grounds with broadcasting
equipment. On top of this, every week, there are expensive lines charges
to bring back the signals.
To have surrendered to the wishes of Scottish football, and picked up
a contract for something we no longer believe is pertinent, would have
meant our programming was determined and shaped from Park Gardens and
West Regent Street.
Clyde's desire is to stay one step ahead of television, not be held to
yesterday, for the rules of the game played by broadcasters have changed
and not by us.
Remember, we are asking for nothing more than what the SFL sold to our
competitors last season, and what the SFA also sold to us for 1994-1995.
That does not seem unreasonable to Clyde. It works in England. So
what's so different about our game or its bosses?

ROSYTH Dockyard is confident of clinching naval contracts worth #135m.
The yard, which earlier this week won contracts worth #53m from the
Ministry of Defence, is set to win two more major orders before the end
of the year, The Herald can reveal.
Outwith the promised programme of surface ship refitting after losing
out on the Trident submarine refits, won by Devonport yard at Plymouth,
the huge Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessels Sir Geraint and Sir Percival look
set to berth at Rosyth for major refits worth #135m.
This was revealed by the managing director of Babcock Rosyth Defence,
David Batty, last night, as the yard celebrated a new workload which, he
said, could provide stability to the end of the decade.
In upbeat mood, he confirmed that there was a new optimism at Rosyth
because it had won outside the programme of allocated work the refit of
the Type-22 frigate HMS Coventry, worth #10m.
Its main contender? Devonport.
The Mancunian, who claims he is a Scot because he has lived north of
the Border for 42 years, was speaking from his office overlooking the
yard, where despite the annual trades holiday, flexible working is still
operating on a number of projects.
Workers are eager to start on the refit of the Type-42 destroyer, HMS
Newcastle, which will begin almost immediately.
Mr Batty, originally a chief accountant with Babcock at Renfrew, who
switched to production at the insistence of his chairman, Allan Smith,
admitted that following the announcement that Rosyth would not be
awarded Trident submarine work, there was a natural disappointment in
the 3500 workforce.
The company, however, recognised at an early stage that there was an
opportunity to capitalise on surface ship refitting work.
He explained: ''What we see now in this latest tranche of orders is a
manifestation of the fact that we have established ourselves.
''It is important to recognise that a lot of these orders were
allocated, but it has been important that we have had them confirmed,
because we had to negotiate quite demanding prices with the Ministry of
Defence.''
What was more encouraging was the latest win in the competitive
programme, won on a ''head to head'' with Devonport.
He added that the yard management expected to see the MoD placing the
other two RFA orders -- it is already refitting the Sir Bedivere -- in
due course.

SCOTTISHPOWER is believed to be vying with the German electronics and
engineering group Siemens to buy the National Engineering Laboratory at
East Kilbride.
The Government, which is privatising NEL, yesterday again refused to
reveal the identities of organisations bidding to take over the centre,
but it is understood that there are two bidders and that these are the
ScottishPower technology division and Siemens.
The Scottish company's technology division is involved in engineering
projects, metallurgy, and the monitoring of rotating plant, and would
undoubtedly see the research centre as a valuable asset.
Following the results of a review of the Department of Trade and
Industry laboratories in April 1994, Mr Michael Heseltine, the then
President of the Board of Trade, described the centre as an important
national resource which played ''a significant role in ensuring the
competitiveness of British industry''.
A decision by the DTI on the preferred bidder for NEL, which carries
out research for Government departments and private industry and employs
225 people, is due to be announced shortly.
A DTI spokesman said yesterday: ''We have just written to staff
informing them that we are in discussion with bidders and expect to
announce the preferred bidder towards the end of the first week in
August. But I am unable to confirm any more than that.''
ScottishPower, which yesterday launched a bid for the regional
electricity company Manweb, also refused to confirm or deny it was
seeking to buy NEL.
A spokesman said: ''We have looked at NEL, as have a number of other
companies, and nothing more than that at the moment. Anything else is
just speculation.''
Meanwhile, the scientists' and engineers' trade union which represents
most of NEL's staff, yesterday criticised the DTI for consistently
refusing unions access to information about the sale and the bidders.
Ms Helen Stevens, of the Institution of Professionals, Managers, and
Specialists, said : ''Our members have the right to be involved in the
choice of their future employer. They are looking for assurances that
NEL has a secure future and they are seeking guarantees that their jobs,
pensions, and redundancy entitlements will be protected.''
A ballot of IPMS members in January showed that 97% were opposed to
privatisation of NEL.

THE new readiness of Muslim states to defy the United Nations and
supply arms to the Bosnian government has dramatically raised the stakes
and could even deal a final blow to the crumbling UN mission, according
to diplomats.
While most attention has been given to threats of Nato air strikes in
Bosnia, growing anger and resentment at Western inaction in the Muslim
world has reached boiling point with Bosnian Serb attacks on ''safe
areas'' and the fall of Srebrenica.
Foreign Ministers from Islamic Conference (OIC) states met in Geneva
on Friday and declared a UN arms embargo ''invalid'' for Bosnia, where
the Muslim-led government has appealed repeatedly for more weapons to
help it fight Serb rebels.
Iran said yesterday that Defence Ministers and military chiefs from
the same eight countries -- Turkey, Pakistan, Iran, Morocco, Saudi
Arabia, Senegal, Egypt, and Malaysia -- would meet soon to discuss the
next steps.
While US and other western officials have repeatedly accused Iran and
others of sending arms and even troops to Bosnia, it now seems that
others are prepared to get involved in systematic and open supply of
weapons.
Egypt, a key US ally in the Middle East, and Malaysia have both
signalled they are prepared to deliver weapons following the Geneva
meeting, which took place as Western allies and Russia debated possible
Nato action at a meeting in London.
''The moves in Islamic countries could have serious repercussions,''
said Mr Michael Williams, an expert on the war in former Yugoslavia with
the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.
''I believe many people will see the Geneva decision as more important
than the London meeting in retrospect.''
Western diplomats said their countries would be trying to convince
Egypt, Malaysia, and others to continue respecting the UN arms ban,
which applies to all of former Yugoslavia and was imposed in 1992 as the
federation broke up.
''This is now very worrying indeed,'' said one western diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
Anger in the Islamic world springs from a growing perception that
Western nations are morally bankrupt and unwilling to defend the values
of democracy, freedom, and human rights unless there are vital strategic
or financial interests at stake.
Arms would have to be smuggled in through Croatia and would need to
come in large numbers to have an impact on the war. What the Bosnian
government wants most is armour and artillery -- heavy items costly and
difficult to move.
However, diplomats say the main impact will be political. The US
Congress votes on whether to lift the arms ban this week and the
decision by Islamic states will strengthen the hand of those who have
argued for supplying the Bosnian government.
France and Britain, the main troop contributors to the UN force, have
made it clear they would withdraw from Bosnia and effectively end the
peacekeeping mission if the US was forced to lift the arms embargo by
Congress.
If that happens, Russia is expected to begin supplying the Serbs,
turning Bosnia into a proxy battleground for the major powers and for
gleeful arms dealers.--Reuter

MANWEB was a logical target for ScottishPower's long-awaited bid for
an English regional electricity company.
The company, whose distribution area covers Merseyside and North
Wales, is a high-cost operator offering plenty of scope for cost
reductions.
ScottishPower, on the other hand, has the lowest operating cost of any
UK power distributor and should be able to boost its profitability from
the acquisition quite quickly.
''It is an obvious target for them to go in and reduce costs,'' said
Mr Richard Andrews, an analyst with Edinburgh broker Bell, Lawrie,
White.
ScottishPower finance director Ian Russell has warned that
ScottishPower would order further cuts in Manweb's 4400 workforce, in
addition to 500 jobs that are already due to go under current plans.
Manweb is a smaller and less sophisticated company than ScottishPower
and offers good scope for diversification.
The Chester-based utility has only 1.32 million customers to
ScottishPower's 1.75 million. And while ScottishPower is a big producer
as well as distributor of electricity, Manweb buys in virtually all its
power.
ScottishPower has also diversified in other ways, branching out into
gas distribution, telecommunications, and retailing. It even bought a
chain of electrical stores from Manweb earlier this year.
But the Glasgow-based company may be in for a long hard battle before
it can seize and digest its prey. And Manweb may yet escape its
clutches.
Analysts say ScottishPower's #1043m bid is fair rather than generous
and will probably have to be raised. ''I think it's a very good opening
offer, but I suspect they might need to go a bit further,'' said Mr
Andrew Wright, an electricity analyst at Smith New Court in London.
''But not a huge amount, probably something of the order of about 950p
for cash and a bit more on the paper,'' he added.
The Manweb board promptly rejected ScottishPower's hostile offer of
915p per share cash or a cash-plus-shares alternative valued at 945p. It
described the offer as ''mean'' and ''nothing more than an opening
gambit''. But this implied that Manweb might look favourably on a more
generous proposal.
ScottishPower must also overcome possible opposition from the Office
of Electricity Regulation (Offer) and the Government.
If Offer and the Office of Fair Trading express reservations about the
bid, Mr Ian Lang, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, may
refer it to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC).
That would delay the bid and possibly lead to it being vetoed.
Professor Stephen Littlechild, the director general of Offer, is
expected to publish a consultation paper expressing his own views later
this week.
The bid for Manweb is the climax of a year during which ScottishPower
has cast its eye over several English regional electricity companies.
These included Northern Electric, which operates in North-east England
in an area that adjoins ScottishPower's own territory in southern and
central Scotland. But ScottishPower backed off after Trafalgar House
made its own bid for Northern in December.
Northern mounted a strong defence, offering its shareholders a
generous package of incentives to remain loyal. But this prompted
Professor Littlechild to conduct a fresh price review of the entire
industry and Trafalgar House let its offer lapse.
Trafalgar House is widely expected to make a second bid for Northern
soon following the publication of Professor Littlechild's lenient price
review earlier this month.
After dropping Northern from its sights, ScottishPower looked at
several other companies before eventually settling on Manweb.
Company officials said the bid had been in preparation for several
months, but its launch was delayed by the Offer price review.
''The review put everything on hold for a while,'' one said.
Professor Littlechild has threatened to revise certain regulations if
Trafalgar does take over Northern or if the US Southern Company succeeds
in its current bid for South West Electricity (SWEB).
But he has stopped short of recommending that either two bids be
vetoed.
ScottishPower's offer for Manweb is slightly different in that it is
the first instance of one UK electricity company bidding for another.
One major attraction of the deal from ScottishPower's point of view is
that the company would increase its very low level of borrowing and make
better use of shareholder funds.
ScottishPower's debt was equivalent to a paltry 8% of shareholders'
funds at the end of March. The bid, if successful, would raise this
gearing to 75% in the short term.
''They can gear up the balance sheet and make more efficient use of
shareholder funds,'' Mr Andrews said.
Analysts said ScottishPower was unlikely to face any rival bid for
Manweb, since there are 12 regional electricity companies in England and
Wales and plenty still left to choose from.

<HEADLINE>Selection procedure for road contracts altered</HEADLINE>

THE Scottish Office has changed its selection procedures for awarding
road building contracts after the debacle over an Italian consortium's
A74 upgrading.
The alterations are designed to ensure that only ''the most able and
competitive contractors are invited to tender and that completed schemes
represent best value for the public purse''.
Scottish Office Minister Lord James Douglas-Hamilton confirmed in a
letter to Labour Euro MP Alex Smith that ''a refining'' of tendering
procedures by the National Roads Directorate has taken place.
Mr Smith sought a review of tendering processes because of concerns
about the performance of Castelli Girola at a 1.4km section of motorway
at Annan, Dumfriesshire.
The 20-month contract was supposed to be completed last November but
is still being worked on. The Milan-based consortium -- by February
already facing a #1m bill for delays -- subsequently called in Morrison
Construction, of Edinburgh, to complete the outstanding works between
Eaglesfield and Kirkpatrick Fleming.
Lord James, in his letter, was adamant that the previous method of
selecting contractors had worked well for many years. He also insisted
Castelli Girola was thoroughly vetted to ensure it had the expertise,
resources, and financial capacity to undertake the works.
However, he acknowledged a greater element of ''design and build''
input will now be required of contractors bidding for work within lump
sum fixed price contracts.
In addition, firms must now go through a three-stage sifting process
aimed at identifying those with the expertise and resources to undertake
projects.
The first sift involves completing a prospectus and the second a
detailed questionnaire to illustrate their ''track record'', demonstrate
''competitiveness'', and detail management proposals and quality
assurance plans. The last stage involves an interview with the roads
directorate.
Mr Smith welcomed the changes as ''absolutely necessary''.
Excuses for the over-running by Castelli Girola -- which undercut UK
firms by #1m for the #23.4m contract -- have concentrated upon bad
weather.
Late completion penalties against Castelli Girola were reduced from
#250,000 a month to #150,000 a month on reassessment of a liquidated
damages clause.
Lord James, in a written Commons reply to Cathcart MP John Maxton, has
denied that delays in completing the upgrading have caused additional
public expenditure.

<HEADLINE>UN inquiry confirms atrocities against refugees</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UNITED Nations human rights envoy Tadeusz Mazowiecki said yesterday
separatist Serbs had engaged in ''barbaric acts'' against Muslims after
conquering the Bosnian Government enclave of Srebrenica on July 11.
He said witness accounts collected during a week-long inquiry in
Tuzla, where more than 6000 refugees fled after Serb forces seized the
so-called ''safe area'', left little doubt that atrocities had been
widespread.
MrMazowiecki said Bosnian Serbs had rebuffed repeated requests to
visit areas where thousands of Muslim males were believed detained.
Dutch peacekeepers, overwhelmed by the Serb onslaught, said after
returning to UN mission headquarters in Croatia that they'd witnessed
Serb soldiers executing and mutilating Muslims.
Two peacekeepers saw nine Muslim men hustled to a building for
interrogation and then heard gunfire. They later found and photographed
the corpses of nine men with bullet wounds in their backs, a senior
Dutch officer said.
The Bosnian Serbs have denied committing atrocities in Srebrenica, but
UN sources say that myriad and consistent accusations of summary
executions, rape, and other abuses appear credible.
Amira Mehmedovic last saw her husband in Bosnian Serb custody. She
heard the screams of women pulled by Serb soldiers off her refugee bus.
She saw the body of a young woman like her, who hanged herself from a
tree.
For the survivors of ''ethnic cleansing'', the horrors they have
witnessed make life almost too hard to bear.
For some, the burden becomes too great: suicide is the only release.
Relief workers say an unusually large number of suicides has been
reported among the survivors of Srebrenica.
''When people are pushed beyond the limits of endurance, it happens,''
said Mr Peter Heiberg, an official of the Danish Refugee Council, which
focuses on the psychological and social health of the refugees.
MrHeiberg said three people had taken their lives at the tent
encampment at Tuzla's airstrip. And refugees reported witnessing several
suicides on the trek from the enclave through Serb territory.
Doctors at the camp report sudden hysterical outbursts, collapses for
no apparent physiological reason, refusal to eat, and depression. The
summer heat, food shortage, and constant worry over the fate of missing
loved ones intensify the stress.
A short walk down the tarmac, animated children sat on blankets
painting with watercolours or drawing with felt-tipped markers.
Almost every picture was of a house, in bright yellows, reds, pinks,
blues and greens.
''It is a good sign,'' said Sadeta Malkic, a teacher working for the
Unicef program that provided the play centre. ''There is still some
spirit in them.''
But the happy pictures may not last.

THE acquisition of another power company is a natural and important
step for ScottishPower.
Since privatisation in 1991, it has cut costs to bring it into line
with the most efficient companies in the world. Now, to boost profits,
it must expand.
In its last financial year to end-March, ScottishPower's pre-tax
profits edged up 7% to #375m and the acquisition of Manweb is seen by
analysts as a way of ensuring profits continue on an upward path for the
foreseeable future.
Although ScottishPower has diversified into the telecommunications and
gas sectors, and substantially increased its electrical retailing
operations, these developments have been small in relation to the scale
of the group's core businesses.
ScottishPower, which bought five electrical superstores from
Chester-based Manweb for about #3m this spring, has been looking for a
major move for two years.
In May, ScottishPower was revealed as one of four preferred bidders
for United Energy, an electricity distribution company in the Australian
state of Victoria. If it ultimately wins the hand of Manweb, the
Glasgow-based company will drop its bid for United Energy, which is
thought to be worth up to #550m.
ScottishPower is much more of a corporate animal than it was during
its previous existence as the South of Scotland Electricity Board. Its
more aggressive style is perhaps more a result of the retirement of
former chief executive Dr Ian Preston, who had been with the company for
12 years, than the arrival on March 1 of his replacement, Ian Robinson,
from conglomerate Trafalgar House.
Kevin Lapwood, electricity analyst at London-based stockbroker Smith
New Court, said: ''I think Ian Robinson has reinforced the views of the
executives that were left. The departure of Ian Preston marked the end
of the old guard.''
The executive directors who perhaps best reflect the new acquisitive
style of ScottishPower are finance director Ian Russell, who came from
conglomerate Tomkins in April last year, and Michael Kinski, who joined
the company from Jaguar Cars in December 1992.
The proposed purchase of Manweb is seen as good news for
ScottishPower's shareholders, who did not benefit from the windfall
gains experienced when trading began in the shares of the 12 English and
Welsh regional electricity companies and the two English generators.
These companies were floated before ScottishPower and its northern
counterpart Hydro-Electric.
The success of ScottishPower's strategy is perhaps reflected in the
fact that it has the lowest distribution operating cost per customer out
of all the 12 English and Welsh RECs and the two Scottish companies.
A figure of #94.60 for ScottishPower compares with one of #145.30 for
Manweb, which has the third-highest operating cost per customer.

PRESIDENT Clinton will veto any attempt by Congress to lift the arms
embargo on Bosnia unilaterally, according to White House Chief of Staff
Leon Panetta.
While working to maintain support for the arms embargo at home, the
Clinton administration was yesterday seeking to project a tough stance.
Defence Secretary William Perry said that ''planes are ready to go on a
moment's notice for certain missions'' to counter Bosnian Serb
aggression.
Senior military officials of the US, Britain, and France delivered a
formal ultimatum on Sunday night to Bosnian Serb commander General Ratko
Mladic to underscore Nato's toughened stance after last Friday's London
conference.
Mr Perry said the allied delegation explained to the Serb commander
how the London statement ''applies to all the safe areas in Bosnia'' but
declined to elaborate on exactly what that explanation was.
With Nato allies moving towards a policy of air strikes, Mr Clinton
last week persuaded Senate leader Bob Dole to put off a vote on ending
the arms embargo. But Mr Dole has indicated he will bring up his
resolution, which has wide support in the Senate, today.
''I hope that the Senate and majority leader Bob Dole will take
another look at whether they ought to proceed here,'' Mr Panetta said.
Nato allies have agreed on decisive air power to counter the Serbs and
''we ought to give that a chance''.
The Clinton administration argues that unilaterally lifting the arms
embargo would ''Americanise'' the war.

A CYPRIOT state psychiatrist who examined three British soldiers
accused of killing a young Danish woman told the court today that at
least two of the defendants were regular drinkers.
Dr Kyriakos Veresies' testimony suggested that the prosecutors believe
the soldiers were under the influence of alcohol when they allegedly
killed 23-year-old Louise Jensen on the night of September 12-13.
Her naked and battered body was found in a shallow grave two days
later.
The psychiatrist said he examined the soldiers separately a couple of
days after their arrest and asked them about their drinking habits.
He said Private Alan Ford, 26, from Birmingham, told him that for
years he had been making use of alcohol.
Dr Veresies said Ford told him that in the last three years he ''was
making a systematic abuse of whisky which he consumed without any food,
only with Coca Cola, and that he frequently gets drunk''.
Private Justin Fowler, 26, from Falmouth, said he drank only at
weekends ''but enough to get drunk'', Dr Veresies added.
The youngest of the three, 23-year-old Private Jeff Parnell, of
Oldbury, West Midlands, claimed he was an occasional drinker.
The court also was shown photographs of the three Britons drinking at
a pub. The film was recovered by police from a camera found in the car
of the accused.
The defendants, members of the 1st Battalion of the Royal Green
Jackets Regiment serving at the British Army base at Dhekelia, have
denied charges of manslaughter, kidnapping, and conspiracy to rape.
The hearing continues.--AP.

By our Foreign Staff
SERB forces have pushed deep into the Bosnian government enclave of
Bihac in Bosnia's biggest offensive for many months. UN officials fear
they are intent on splitting it in two for easier conquest.
Despite the threat of Nato air strikes and face-to-face warnings for
the Bosnian Serb military leader, General Ratko Mladic, the onslaughts
continued with Bosnian Serb tanks and artillery pounding the southern
approaches to Zepa. Two villages outside the town were in flames, a
local ham radio operator reported.
UN officials also said Ukrainian peacekeepers inside the besieged
enclave of Zepa reported an apparent Serb infantry attack from the west
in the area of one of their former observation posts.
However, the situation at Bihac, which had been largely forgotten as
the world concentrated on Zepa and Gorazde, appeared the most
complicated. Rebel Serbs invading from Croatia have advanced around six
miles almost to the centre of the Bihac pocket and renegade Muslim
militiamen have been attacking from the north.
The artillery attacks by the Bosnian Serbs from the south and east may
presage a tank-backed infantry assault aimed at slicing the enclave in
two, isolating Bihac town.
UN observers said up to 2000 Muslim inhabitants were fleeing from the
centre of the north-western enclave near the important crossroads towns
of Cazin and Coralici, site of the main UN peacekeeping base.
''This co-ordinated, deliberate attack on all fronts represents
arguably the most considerable military action in Bosnia for many
months,'' said Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Vernon, a UN military spokesman.
Alexander Ivanko, civilian spokesman for the beleaguered UN mission in
Bosnia, described the invasion as an ''extraordinarily escalatory
step''.
''Such a flagrant violation of an international border is becoming a
trademark of the Croatian Serbs whose disregard for international law is
unprecedented,'' he said in Sarajevo.
The Bihac crisis could explode into a wider war in former Yugoslavia
as Croatian government troops are poised along UN truce lines near the
Adriatic to attack the Krajina Serbs if the Bosnian enclave looks like
falling.
Croatian troops have been spoiling for a knockout blow against the
Krajina Serbs after retaking a small rebel pocket in central Croatia two
months ago and could be unleashed if the Serbs sweep across Bihac.
Bihac, whose army has fended off Serb pressure since 1992, bestrides
the most direct road and rail links between breakaway Serb domains in
Croatia and Bosnia.
Tanks have already been widely used at Zepa. ''Houses are burning in
Vratar and Ribioc,'' said Zepa ham radio operator Fadil Heljic.
Ivanko said Ukrainian peacekeepers had radioed reports of a Serb
infantry assault on the town from the west. ''There are no reports of
them advancing into the town and, according to the Ukrainians,
government forces have destroyed, blocked, and mined stretches of the
road into Zepa from the west,'' he said. About 17,000 Muslims are
believed trapped in Zepa.
UN officials have been trying without success to mediate negotiations
between the Bosnian government and Serb authorities on the evacuation of
women, children, the elderly, and sick.
Foreign and Defence Ministers from 16 nations, who gathered in London
last week, warned Bosnian Serbs that offensive actions against the
neighbouring ''safe area'' of Gorazde would trigger a swift military
response from the UN and Nato.
That left the status of the ''safe areas'' of Zepa and Bihac, which
were under actual assault, ambiguous although since then there have been
statements from the Allies, particularly America, which suggested any
Serb attack would provoke an air strike response.
Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev backed Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic and called for the lifting of sanctions
against Belgrade as a key step to peace, according to Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug.
During the 16-nation meeting in London last Friday, Western countries
rejected a deal with Milosevic worked out by EU peace mediator Carl
Bildt to ease sanctions on Belgrade in return for recognition of Bosnia.
Russia has long sought to use its historic ties with its fellow
Orthodox Christian Serbs to help end the crisis and has regularly found
itself at odds with its partners in the five-nation Contact Group on
Yugoslavia.
''We are on the brink of either a big war or choosing a peaceful path.
Our position is the choice of a peaceful path both for the international
community and for the sides in the conflict,'' Kozyrev said before
leaving for Belgrade. He disapproves of air strikes to stop Serb
advances in Bosnia.

A SLIGHT recovery in the construction industry last year has been
followed by a plunge back into recession, according to the National
Council of Building Material Producers (BMP) which has called upon the
Government to act immediately to halt the decline by stimulating the
first-time buyer market and replacing the funds that it has taken from
the roads programme.
The call from the BMP, a confederation of associations, federations
and companies representing the collective interests of some 2000 firms
in the building materials industry, is just the latest of a string of
requests for action.
Earlier this month the Halifax, Britain's biggest building society,
suggested that there are now strong arguments for specific measures to
stimulate housing demand though, so far, the Government shows little
sign of responding.
The BMP confirms that of the affected sectors, housing is suffering
the greatest setback, with little in the Government's Housing White
Paper to suggest that a turn around is on the way.
Peter Jansen, president of the BMP, commented: ''1995 is proving to be
an exceptionally difficult period for construction activity, even
judging by the events of recent years. Far from catching up with the
remainder of the economy, the industry is not even able to maintain its
position.''
The BMP's forecast panel predicts that housing output will fall by 13%
as deep cuts in the housing corporations' budget, combined with
depressed private house buying, drag the construction industry back into
recession. And while the Housing White Paper incorporated many of BMP's
proposals for long-term reform, it does nothing, says the BMP, to
counteract the immediate impact of cuts in Miras and changes in income
support.
Mr Jansen said: ''The reduction in housing transactions has also had
serious repercussions on housing repair and maintenance. Given the
six-month lag between a house move and the related repair and
maintenance work, the slowing in the level of transactions occurring in
the latter half of last year and continuing into 1995, will cast a
shadow over workloads.
Infrastructure, too, is showing no sign of improvement. Roads and
rail, water and sewerage continue to be stifled by a lack of public
sector orders and confusion over private funds.
Mr Jansen said the Private Finance Initiative is still failing to get
off the ground. It is now feared that the situation has deteriorated so
far, that not only will the PFI not act in addition to public resources,
but it will not even be a substitute for them.
Of the growth sector, only industrial output is expanding more rapidly
than expected. The commercial sector, although growing, has faced a
substantial slowdown in recent months. Currently, growth occurring in
the construction sector is so heavily dependent on these two sectors
that any stagnation provides a serious cause for concern.
The BMP president adds: ''Even so, combined, they only represent 20%
of construction output. If the public sector will not provide direct
assistance in maintaining output and employment in the industry, it
should at least ensure that the private sector remains in a healthy
enough condition to take on the burden of a shift in responsibility.

THE Government is seeking a way out of the share option debacle which
threatens to punish employee shareholders along with the ''fat cat''
directors of recently privatised industries.
Chancellor Kenneth Clarke yesterday received robust telephone calls
from the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister telling him the
political embarrassment caused by his announcement last week is not
worth the #80m which the Treasury might save by taxing share options as
income rather than capital gains.
Today, the Chancellor has deputed his Financial Secretary, Mr Michael
Jack, to meet Sir Richard Greenbury and his team whose report on
directors' pay caused the furore.
The report, commissioned by the CBI, recommended the taxation change
on share options. However, Sir Richard promptly confessed to the Commons
Treasury Select Committee that they had made a mistake.
By this time, the Chancellor had announced he would remove the tax
relief on share options. More than 6000 companies have established these
schemes for their employees and managers.
Industry's outrage at the Chancellor's decision is matched by Tory
back benchers who are threatening to defeat the Government in the next
Finance Bill if necessary.
Yesterday, Mr Major was leaning on his Chancellor to find a way to
finesse the situation as a matter or urgency, even if it means a U-turn.
Mr Michael Heseltine told the Chancellor the political embarrassment
wrong-foots the new Cabinet's policy of trying to win back its natural
supporters.
On Thursday, the Government faces another crucial by-election in
Littleborough and Saddleworth where it is trying to hold on to a 4000
majority.
Mr Clarke has decided to duck the meeting which he called with Sir
Richard Greenbury today. This will be taken by Mr Jack, who was promoted
to the Treasury in the Government reconstruction.
It will be up to Mr Jack to find a graceful way out of this dilemma
for his Chancellor. The most likely resolution is that the Treasury will
use the November Budget to put a ceiling on share options which will
punish the ''fat cats'' who have made millions out of them, but absolve
ordinary people who have been encouraged to take share options as a work
incentive.

Manweb's five board members would share a profit of approximately
#800,000 if the privatised electricity company was to accept
ScottishPower's bid. This would leave each board member with a net
profit of about #160,000. The profit margin is based on the privatised
share value of #2.40, although the offer, amounting to #9.15 per share
cash or share plus cash of #9.45, also shows a considerable mark-up on
the close price of #7.30 per share.

PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin left hospital ''feeling well'' today after a
two-week stay for a heart problem and moved to a sanatorium outside
Moscow.
''Russian President Boris Yeltsin finished his course of treatment in
the Moscow Central Clinic Hospital today and has been discharged,'' said
the president's press secretary.
He said that Yeltsin, 64, had gone to the Barvikha sanatorium, west of
the capital, but did not say how long the president would remain there.
Citing doctors, Medvedev said: ''The president is feeling well.''
In a sign that Yeltsin is controlling affairs of state, the president
today appointed a loyal ally to head Russia's security service as part
of a reshuffle following a bloody Chechen guerrilla raid on the southern
town of Budennovsk last month.
He named Colonel-General Mikhail Barsukov, head of the security
service guarding top Kremlin leaders apart from Yeltsin, to succeed
Sergei Stepashin as head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), formerly
the KGB.
Russian media have portrayed Barsukov as a close ally of General
Alexander Korzhakov, the hard-line head of Yeltsin's personal security
guard.
Yeltsin was admitted to hospital on July 11 with an ischaemic heart
condition -- a blood supply problem -- and his condition renewed
specualtion about his fitness to rule the country of about 150 million
people.
Only a television appearance last Tuesday -- his first since he
suffered what he called a minor heart attack -- quelled rumours that his
condition was worse than his aides suggested in daily updates of his
health.

MANWEB is a small regional electricity company. Its franchise area
covers 12,000 square kilometres and takes in North Wales plus
Merseyside.
Although Merseyside forms only a small part of the Manweb area it
accounts for half of the three million domestic population, which in
total accounts for 27% of electricity demand. Much of the remainder of
Manweb's residents are scattered over North Wales.
The bulk of electricity distributed goes to industry, 54%,
particularly the chemicals sector, which is responsible for 21% of total
demand. The remaining 19% is taken by the commercial sector.
This high industrial and commercial volume makes Manweb less sensitive
to changes in the weather. Last year, Manweb saw a 2.5% increase in
total electricity units distributed, well above the national average of
1.2%, with a 5% increase in demand from industrial customers.
Manweb has managed to retain its image of being a strictly focused
company. The 1994/95 financial year saw a clear-out of the
non-performing businesses.
It withdrew from loss-making electrical retailing, selling its five
superstores to ScottishPower in April for #3m. The High Street shops
were converted into customer service centres. The exit from retailing
necessitated a provision of #16m, which should cover closure costs.
It has gas and contracting divisions but these are insignificant in
terms of profitability. The contracting division was fully restructured
in 1992/93 and now concentrates on negotiating for utility contracts
rather than tendering for competitive bids where margins are much
thinner. Less than 35% of its turnover is with Manweb Group.
Manweb's power generation interests are centred on wind power. There
are two wind farms in which it has a stake, Carland Cross and Coal
Clough, which reported a small profit last year. Manweb had signalled
its intention to build four more wind farms and has been investigating
the potential for a coal combined heat and power station.
Its electricity supply business is largely within its franchise area,
although it does have some outside customers.
The company's low profit margin in distribution and small proportion
of non-core earnings left it badly placed for the recent distribution
review. Given its position in joint second last place in the two
distribution reviews, Manweb faces a tough time matching the growth
rates of rival RECs.
Manweb's operational caution has been matched in the financial arena.
It repurchased just 3.5% of its shares last year -- well behind most of
the rest of the sector. However, dividend cover was already high.
The lower cash outflows meant that the company ended the year with
gearing of just 8.4%.

SCOTTISH doctor Richard McGown should know later this week whether
Zimbabwe's Supreme Court will give him leave to appeal against his
conviction and sentence for the culpable homicide of two children in his
care.
If the court decides he has no grounds for an appeal, the 58-year-old
anaesthetist will be taken to jail to serve a sentence of six months
with hard labour, imposed at the High Court in Harare in January.
Dr McGown was found guilty of causing the deaths of a 20-month-old boy
and a 10-year-old girl through excessive morphine doses and inadequate
post-operative care. After spending only one night in jail, he was
granted bail pending his appeal.
The doctor has always insisted he is innocent of the crimes, and has
denied claims by student protesters and other critics that he is a
racist who conducted experiments on black patients.
Born in India of Scots parents, Dr McGown was brought up in Scotland
and went to Glasgow Academy and later Edinburgh University where he
graduated in medicine. He trained as an anaesthetist in Sweden and moved
to the then Rhodesia in 1968 with his wife, Sheena, a nurse from
Aberdeen.
Yesterday, his lawyer, Mr Chris Andersen, told the Supreme Court in
Harare that the doctor's experience had not been taken into account when
he was found guilty of culpable homicide in January.
The doctor had administered morphine to more than 50,000 patients,
including 500 children, with no adverse effects and no criticism from
his colleagues. ''Plainly the experience was a significant factor and
was relevant,'' said the lawyer.
Mr Andersen criticised the prosecutor, Attorney-General Patrick
Chinamasa, for describing Dr McGown as a ''messenger of death stalking
the corridors of our hospitals'', saying the court might have been
influenced by adverse press reports.
The trial court had also failed to take into account the suffering Dr
McGown went through due to widespread press reports and demonstrations
against him by university students who labelled him a racist.
Opposing the application, Mr Chinamasa said Dr McGown should have used
his experience to provide better post-operative care for his patients.
At the trial, Dr McGown pleaded not guilty to culpable homicide and
was acquitted on three similar counts.
The case arose after a parliamentary committee alleged he had killed
patients between 1986 and 1992 while testing the side-effects of
spine-injected morphine doses on women and children.
However when the case went to trial, the prosecution said it had no
evidence that the doctor was experimenting when five of his patients,
three blacks and two Zimbabweans of Greek and Asian origin, died.
At the Supreme Court yesterday, Judge Ahmed Ibrahim said he would make
a decision on whether the doctor had grounds to appeal at the end of the
week.
The case has provoked racial tension in Zimbabwe and some student
leaders have threatened to mutilate white citizens if Dr McGown is not
punished to their satisfaction.

CIDER-maker Merrydown had two choices. Either seek a takeover from one
of the larger players in the industry, or perhaps a brewer, or else go
for a low-margin, high-volume business through a distribution agreement
with Whitbread.
That begins next month and will lead to Merrydown supplanting Bulmer's
Scrumpy Jack in Whitbread managed houses which in any case tend to have
a higher proportion of cider sales than those of the other major
brewers.
Although Whitbread will cream off most of the gross margin in return
for-providing the promotional support, at least the cash flow will help
Merrydown's other activities as it builds up its soft drinks such as
Shloer and new activities like Two Dogs Alcoholic Lemonade from
Australia. That has a strength of 4%.
It could be the foundation of a new drinks sub-sector or, as Merrydown
chairman Richard Purdey cautioned, just a flash in the pan.
The pressures in the cider market show no sign of abating with prices
back to 1985 levels although Merrydown has seen volume sales rise by 15%
or twice the industry average. That leaves it with a market share of
just 3.7% and in fifth position and with cider turnover down 5% to
#14.3m.
It has come through in Merrydown's full-year results which show a
pre-tax loss little changed at #2.70m (#2.79m). Admittedly this is after
hefty provisioning totalling #2.14m including a #1.85m on writing down
the value of cider stocks. But there was still a loss of #270,000 from
the continuing businesses and it may not be for perhaps a full year that
the benefits of the Whitbread link-up come through.
There is no final dividend but Mr Purdey is confident that one will be
paid for the current financial year despite gearing of 90%.
The shares eased 2p to 79p.

JURORS have heard more than enough evidence to prove that two British
members of a religious sect conspired to kill the US attorney for
Oregon, a prosecutor said today.
Scott Glick recapped the US Government case against Sally-Anne Croft
and Susan Hagan during today's closing arguments in the month-long
trial.
Croft and Hagan, who were followers of the late guru Baghwan Shree
Rajneesh, deny conspiring with others to kill Charles Turner in 1985. No
murder attempt was ever made.
Croft and Hagan, who were returned to the United States from Britain
to face trial, could face life in prison if convicted.
To win a guilty verdict, Glick said, the government had only to prove
that one ''overt'' act was committed to further a conspiracy. ''In this
case, we have at least 19 separate and distinct overt acts,'' he said.
The defence rested its case on Thursday after calling just one
witness.
Government witnesses said Croft, known as Ma Prem Savita at the Oregon
commune, managed its finances and supplied cash used illegally to buy
guns for the purpose of killing Turner.
Hagan, known as Ma Anand Su, gave a talk in support of the Turner
murder plot at a planning meeting, witnesses said.--AP.

LLOYD'S underwriters have been suffering from falling premium rates,
according to a new a survey from the insurance market. Premiums declined
in the last three months, according to 43% of underwriters in Lloyd's
latest quarterly trends poll.
Looking ahead to the next three months, only 8% expected premiums to
rise and 49% said they would stay the same.
Meanwhile, the capacity for the insurance market is set to be worth
#10.3bn for next year. This is a modest rise on this year's capacity of
#10.2bn, according to forecasts by Lloyd's professionals.
''Although competition has caused some reductions in premium rates, in
many areas they continue at a level which provides underwritiers with
good opportunities for profit,'' said Lloyd's chairman David Rowland.

ISRAEL'S Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin vowed that Israeli peace moves
with the PLO would go on despite today's attack by an Islamic suicide
bomber who blew up a bus, killing six people.
''There was a huge explosion,'' said a woman witness after the blast
in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat gan. ''Heads flew in the air and
everyone was on the ground . . .
Hands flew in the air and heads flew from the windows of the bus. It
was unbearable.''
Construction worker Shimon Danoni said: ''I saw a girl with her neck
completely cut open and she was screaming, 'I can't hear anything'.''
Israel reacted by barring the nearly two million Palestinians of the
West Bank and Gaza from entering Israel, but Rabin said the closure
would not last long.
Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, said a Palestinian from the
Israeli-occupied West Bank carried out the attack, but Hamas did not put
out a leaflet claiming responsibility, which it usually does.
The blast, which police said killed six people and wounded 32,
occurred on the eve of a deadline for a deal to expand 14-month-old
Palestinian rule beyond Gaza and Jericho into the West Bank. One of the
dead was apparently the bomber.
Rabin, protected by police from angry Israeli demonstrators who
besieged him during a visit to the bombing site, later went before
members of his Labour Party to announce that the talks would resume
after the funerals.
PLO chief negotiator Ahmed Korei said the talks would resume tomorrow
somewhere outside the Middle East.
''We will not negotiate under blackmail and pressures and
developments. The peace talks must continue in a far place away from
psychological and other pressures,'' said Korei.
In the Palestinian-ruled Gaza Strip, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
condemned the bombing as a ''terrorist'' act.
The two sides had set July 25 as the signing deadline for a deal
though negotiators said on Sunday they would miss it by at least a few
days.
Hundreds of Israelis, angry at the third suicide bus bombing in
central Israel in nine months, converged on the bombing site outside
Israel's 40-storey Diamond Exchange. Windows were shattered by the blast
and the building was pocked by shrapnel.
Demonstrators shouted: ''Rabin go home, Rabin the murderer, death to
the Arabs.'' They carried banners reading: ''Peace is killing us'' and
''This is not peace, this is terror''.
Rabin, however, urged Israelis to count Palestinians among
peace-lovers pained by the attack.
The bus was taking passengers from Ramat Gan, a middle-class suburb,
to Dizengoff, the main street of Tel Aviv where a Hamas suicide bomber
blew up a bus in October, killing 23 people.
Anat Ben-Tov, a 35-year-old working mother, survived both attacks and
found herself for the second time in Tel Aviv's Ichilov hospital.
''I've seen it all,'' Ben-Tov said as she lay in a hospital bed with
bandages covering her face, hands, and feet. ''I have no luck, or I have
all the luck. I'm not sure which it is.''
Islamic militant Palestinian groups opposed to Israeli-PLO peace moves
have killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings since the sealing of
a breakthrough accord in 1993.
Hamas sources, claiming responsibility, said: ''A youth from Hamas
from the Yehiya Ayyash group from the West Bank -- and not from the
areas of the Palestinian Authority -- carried out the attack.''
There had been a lull in attacks since April, when Arafat's
Palestinian Authority rounded up hundreds of Hamas and Islamic Jihad
activists in the largest crackdown since self-rule began in Gaza and
Jericho last year.--Reuter.

THE Ronson brand name is well known across the world for lighters but
increasingly its other giftware products such as watches are becoming as
popular.
Halkin Holdings, the consumer brand management and specialist
distribution group that owns the Ronson licence, is keen to capitalise
on the brand's high profile. So much so that the company's name is
changing to Ronson Plc.
Chief executive Howard Hodgson is anxious to develop Ronson into an
upmarket gentlemen's brand slightly below Alfred Dunhill, selling a
range of items such as pens. ''If Dunhill is Jaguar, Ronson is
MG/Rover,'' said Mr Hodgson.
Other brands in its portfolio include Pierre Cardin costume jewellery
and Pringle aftershave and watches. Its brands are distributed through a
number of channels including retail outlets worldwide and the GUS and
Littlewoods mail order catalogues.
It is the second-largest supplier to British Airways and has a growing
business with other airlines and at the terminals. It has recently
agreed to supply its Ronson and Pierre Cardin products to Allders
duty-free outlets.
A smaller but growing part of the business is in corporate promotions
and gifts such as mugs, pens and lighters. Eventually Halkin envisages
having its own mail order catalogue to sell surplus product.
The company is growing strongly. First-half profits increased by 16%
to #1.45m on turnover up 25% to #14.2m. Earnings per share were 2.43p.
Its best sellers include the Pierre Cardin six-earring caddy, the Ronson
Links watch and Ronson Super Comet lighter.
Gift purchases are highly susceptible to consumer confidence and the
general state of the economy. Strong growth in air travel coupled with
growing demand for tobacco products in the Far East and the possible
acquisition of other gift brands makes Halkin confident about its future
growth prospects.
This optimism is reflected in the company's decision to pay its first
interim dividend of 0.25p. Halkin's broker is forecasting profits of #5m
this year on sales of #36m.
Despite the good performance Halkin shares dipped 3p to 59p.

THE murder trial of Susan Smith, convicted of drowning her two sons,
moved today into the death-penalty phase in which jurors will decide
whether to send her to South Carolina's electric chair.
Smith, 23, was convicted of first-degree murder on Saturday for
drowning her sons -- three-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex -- in
a South Carolina lake on October 25. She initially blamed a carjacker,
prompting a nine-day national manhunt, but later admitted she rolled her
car into the lake with the boys strapped inside.
The nine men and three women who found her guilty must now decide,
after hearing new arguments and testimony, whether she should be given
the death penalty. Anything short of a unanimous verdict would mean life
in prison with no possibility of parole for 30 years.
The start of the penalty phase was delayed for two hours as Circuit
Judge William Howard considered whether to dismiss a juror who briefly
came in contact with the great-grandmother of the two young victims.
Howard emerged from discussions in his chambers to rule that the
encounter had been innocent in nature.
After the ruling, the court proceeded with a hearing on potential
evidence the prosecution wants to present to the jury, including
nationally televised interviews in which Smith pleaded for the return of
the two boys.
Prosecutor Tommy Pope wants to convince the jurors that Smith drowned
the boys when they became an obstacle to her romance with the son of a
wealthy textile executive. He hopes to show jurors a videotaped
re-enactment of the car rolling down the 70ft boat ramp, and photographs
of the boys' decomposing bodies.
The judge banned the gruesome photos earlier in the trial in case they
prejudiced the jury. They are expected to counter pictures presented by
the defence showing Smith in her childhood years.
The defence claims the murders resulted from a botched suicide attempt
by a woman who has had emotional problems since early adolescence and
was sexually molested by her stepfather, who may take the witness
stand.--Reuter.

THREE English footballers, including controversial goalkeeper Bruce
Grobbelaar and television presenter John Fashanu, were yesterday charged
with conspiring to fix football matches.
The charges followed an exhaustive nine-month corruption investigation
into the game south of the Border.
The allegations against Grobbelaar, Fashanu, Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans
Segars, and two others, cover four football seasons.
They are all accused of conspiring together, and with others known and
unknown, to give and corruptly accept gifts of money as inducements
improperly to influence the outcome of English football matches.
Southampton goalkeeper Grobbelaar faces four other charges, Aston
Villa and former England striker Fashanu two more, and Segers one.
Malyasian businessman Heng Suan Lim also faces two additional charges
and Fashanu's wife, Melissa, one more.
All five have been bailed to appear before Southampton magistrates on
October 11.
English football was shocked when allegations of bribery and
corruption in the premiership league were linked to gambling syndicates
in the Far East last year.
Grobbelaar yesterday arrived on foot at Southampton police station to
answer his bail. He appeared to be relaxed as he waited for his fixed
appointment with the senior investigating officers. But, within minutes
of his arrival, he was formally charged with five serious criminal
offences.
The two other players, who arrived at separate police stations in the
Southampton area, learned of their fate at the same time.
Segers was clearly shocked. ''I am disappointed, really
disappointed,'' he said. ''If going to court is the only way to prove my
innocence then I have got to do that.''
Fashanu, who presents the popular Gladiator's television programme,
left another police station in a chauffeur-driven BMW with darkened
windows.
It was left to the millionaire's legal representative, Mr Henri
Brandman, to pass on his reaction. He said: ''John Fashanu continues to
protest his innocence in the strongest possible terms. He looks forward
to clearing his name.''
Yesterday's turn of events do not affect another matter hanging over
the head of Fashanu. He is on bail and has to report to a Southampton
police station next month over an allegation that he attempted to
pervert the course of justice. That is a separate inquiry but is linked
to the bribery investigation.
The fact that the Crown is now prepared to take the matter to court
has surprised English football chiefs.
The Football League's own inquiries into the allegations were
immediately halted to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings.
Yesterday, Southampton FC secretary Brian Truscott said that, until
the relevant charges were admitted or proven, the club would continue to
support Grobbelaar.
A statement from Grobbelaar's solicitor last night confirmed he would
continue to keep goal for Southampton.
''From the outset, Bruce has denied any involvement whatsoever in any
criminal activity and he maintains that denial today as strongly as he
ever has,'' said Mr David Hewitt. ''These proceedings will be vigorously
defended. Bruce looks forward to the start of next season and resuming
his career with Southampton.''
Mr Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers'
Association, said last night: ''This case has cast a large shadow over
the game for a long time and will continue to do so until resolved.
''It is in everybody's interest for it to be sorted out as quickly as
possible. The charges, if proved, are clearly very damaging to football.
They go to the very root of the game. All sport needs to be open and
fair and particularly professional sport.''

CUTBACKS in financial support for Europe's livestock and cereal
producers are needed to help save threatened peat bogs, according to
botanist and conservationist Dr David Bellamy.
On the first day of an international conference on peatlands he told
200 delegates from 20 countries: ''There is a need for a EU plan for
ecology. Without the support that is given we would not be growing
cereals on former bogs.''
And he added: ''We cannot challenge people over threatened tropical
rain forests when we cannot protect our peat bogs.''
He said that vast areas of bogs had disappeared and if something was
not done soon ''a unique part of the world will disappear''.
He later explained that there was an urgent need for the EU and the UK
Government to produce strategies that would redevelop peatlands as well
as conserving those that still remain.
''I want to keep British farming,'' he said. ''However, our farmers
should consider what has happened to the fenlands of East Anglia.
''In Scotland we have too many sheep and too many deer on fragile
uplands.''
He said that set-aside programmes should be made more permanent if
they were not to be a waste of taxpayers' money.
''Farmers should be getting contracts for land management not for
producing something that is not suitable land use.''
Dr Bellamy said that the public should be encouraged to eat more game
-- venison, grouse, partridge and even rabbits -- which were the
products of ''rational, traditional'' land use.
He said that too few people were aware of the threat to peatlands
which provide unique ecosystems in which nutrient retention and
efficient recycling were the key to survival.
Dr Alastair Sommerville of the Scottish Wildlife Trust, organisers of
the convention and managers of 10 special raised bogs, said he hoped the
four-day gathering would produce a dynamic lead towards solving the
threatened peatlands.
It is estimated that of the original 27,000 hectares in Scotland, less
than 10% is in a near-natural state. Afforestation and commercial peat
extraction were among the causes of damage but the greatest loss has
been to reclamation for agriculture.

THE Government was last night accused of wilfully ignoring deep
discontent at the way monopoly investigations are being handled, in a
strongly-worded report by the powerful Commons Trade and Industry Select
Committee.
It warns that the Government's repeated assurances that it is ready to
reform competition legislation are ''wearing thin''. The committee
intends to recall industry Ministers to answer further questions when
the Commons returns in October.
The all-party committee criticises the Government's response to its
initial report on the UK's monopoly policy as inadequate. ''There has
been substantial debate outside Parliament on the need for changes such
as those we have advocated. We consider it a matter of concern that the
Government declines to join this debate,'' it concludes.
The report is particularly scathing over the Government's refusal to
acknowledge widespread unease at the way the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission handles inquiries into monopolies. ''No answer is given to
the charges against the current system made by those who have undergone
MMC investigations. Their deep discontent is ignored.''
And it is sceptical about the chances of any fundamental reforms. ''We
do not consider that the Government's response adequately addresses our
recommendations and the evidence and arguments on which they are based.
The repeated pledge to reform acknowledged weaknesses in competition
legislation when parliamentary time allows is wearing thin.''
Yesterday, Labour attributed the Government's lack of interest in
monopoly reform to Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, who was
President of the Board of Trade until a fortnight ago.
Trade and industry spokesman Brian Wilson said: ''The problem is that
the Government doesn't actually believe in competition. Michael
Heseltine is a fully paid up corporatist and that is reflected in
Government policy.
''The whole monopoly investigation structure is weak and confusing.
There is really no culture of enforcing competition in this country.''

Christopher Sims analyses how ScottishPower chief Ian Robinson, above,
can make the deal work
JUST five months into the job of chief executive of ScottishPower Ian
Robinson has launched the biggest takeover bid by a Scottish group for
an English company in corporate history.
If the hostile #1000m bid for Manweb, the English electricity
distribution company which covers the Liverpool area and North Wales,
succeeds -- and Manweb intends to fight -- then ScottishPower will
emerge as one of Scotland's largest business concerns.
Mr Robinson and his top managers have been eyeing Manweb for some time
as they clearly think it is the weakest of the dozen English electricity
distributors. The proposed deal is a ''logical'' step which will add
value for shareholders. The bottom line is that it will enhance the
long-term aim of increasing dividends by 5%-6% in real terms.
Yet the way he describes his target makes one wonder why Mr Robinson
wants to have anything to do with the company.
He points out that Manweb has high operating costs, the second highest
standard domestic tariff and has lost much of its potential business in
the unregulated commercial market. Oh, and its share price has
significantly underperformed the average for its sector.
The answer, as ever, is that ScottishPower thinks it can run Manweb
much better than its existing management, largely through cutting costs.
This has been the mantra of all the privatised customers: cut costs,
largely through reducing manpower, and so beat the price caps which are
applied to domestic tariffs.
Mr Robinson is good at blowing the trumpet for his company, pointing
out that it is the lowest cost electricity distributor and its operating
profits performance is near the top of the league table. Only recently
it announced the axeing of a further 350 jobs as it centralised its
customer service centres.
The group is proud of the way it has used the latest management fad,
benchmarking, which means making comparisons with other similar
companies both here and abroad and drawing conclusions over how
operations can be improved. The company reckons it is now up there with
the most efficient, leaving staff available to carry out the same
process on Manweb.
Clearly functions like billing and head office facilities could be cut
back significantly, particularly given ScottishPower's proposed hi-tech
customer service centre at Cathcart. Yet Mr Robinson says he is aware of
the regional sensibilities, as of course a Scottish company should be
given the corporate history of the lack of English regard to Scotland's
sensibilities.
So the Welsh language will be retained and Manweb will keep a
scaled-down head office in its native Chester. Yet redundancies will
bias some customers against Scottish ownership of their electricity
company unless they can see benefits in price and improved service. Mr
Robinson intends to move fast once he gets into Manweb to achieve these
objectives. He says his management team has laid its plans and is all
ready to move into Manweb as soon as the bid succeeds. But he would not
give an estimate of job losses.
ScottishPower's top managers are following corporate fashion with
benchmarking, but is unfashionable in its overall strategy of having a
number of operations such as electrical retailing, telecommunications
and even gas supply. The corporate trend is the other way --
concentration on the core activity, which is just what Manweb does.
Mr Robinson agrees that this is perfectly sound strategy, but then you
have to aim to be the best in that core business and Manweb manifestly
is not.
The takeover of any company does not just depend on the target
company's shareholders. The Office of Fair Trading looks on if
competition issues are involved and in the case of utilities, the
industry regulator also investigates.
So the Manweb bid could yet come to nothing, though ScottishPower can
see no reason why it should be turned down. The group has a tiny share
of the total UK electricity market while surely electricity regulator
Professor Stephen Littlechild wants to promote greater efficiency for
the benefit of consumers.
Mr Robinson will be presiding over a worsening of ScottishPower's
financial position as the bill for Manweb comes in, for it will raise
borrowings to 75% of shareholders' funds in the company which is a high
level. But he insists shareholders will get a better return through
having a sensible level of financial gearing in the business, in
ScottishPower's case 50%, at which it is expected to level out within a
few years.
Utilities have a reliable cashflow from captive customers which theory
suggests enables them safely to support higher levels of debt than
companies operating in more volatile areas.
The ScottishPower chief executive makes a good case against Manweb's
management but they will not roll over and die without a fight. It is
surprising what the advisers of companies under siege can pull out of
the hat when pressed. So he may have quite a fight on his hands before
he can break open the champagne on Scotland's biggest corporate foray
south of the Border.

THE weather forecast is set fair for most of the week and the combine
harvesters have now set about the 1995 cereal harvest.
Last year arable farmers enjoyed their best year in two decades but
the early indications are that this year could be even better.
The facts are quite clear -- principally that the cereal price of
today is considerably in excess of that predicted three years ago when
the MacSharry Reforms of the CAP were concluded. Then it was confidently
forecast that come 1995 feed wheat would be worth less than #90 per
tonne. The market is however now suggesting values of close on #120 per
tonne.
The underlying reasons for this upturn can be found in the fact that
the world cereal supply situation has fallen below even the most
optimistic forecasts of three years ago because of some below-average
harvests, particularly in China which has now entered the world market
as a major importer -- and one that is willing to pay cash.
In America yields have been seriously revised downwards, putting the
carry-over stocks at their lowest level since 1974. Maize production in
the US is likely to be 20% below last year's crop while in the EU the
effects of set-aside will see output reduced by around 10%.
Meanwhile, intervention stocks in the EU stand at a mere 7.8 million
tonnes as compared to 17.6 million tonnes just 12 months ago. With an
average harvest and the usual export trade this will see the
intervention stores virtually empty by the end of 1996.

<HEADLINE>Muslims allowed to donate organs</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>5</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>977223900</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Muslims were told yesterday they can donate organs for
transplant without breaking the laws of their religion.
The Department of Health welcomed the ruling, issued by Muslim
scholars.
Transplants are generally more successful when donor and recipient are
from the same ethnic group, and Asians were having to wait longer for
such operations because many Muslims believe their religion forbids them
to donate organs.
Available transplant organs such as kidneys are always given to the
patients they match best for instance, therefore a kidney from a white
donor is more likely to go to a white patient.
The situation is made worse by the fact that Britain's Asians are more
prone to diabetes, and three times more likely to suffer kidney failure.
Asians in Birmingham last year were waiting on average a year longer
than white patients for transplants.
The new ruling was issued by the Muslim Law (Shariah) Council which
consists of scholars from all the major branches of Islam in Britain. It
followed a series of meetings involving Muslim leaders, lawyers and
health officials, the last of which took place in September.
The council issued a fatwa, or decree, saying it supported organ
transplant ''as a means of alleviating pain or saving life on the basis
of the rules of Shariah''.
It also said Muslims could carry donor cards and a dead Muslim's
relatives may give permission for his or her organs to be used for
life-saving transplants.
West Midlands transplant co-ordinator Anthony Hooker led the talks
with community leaders which brought about the council ruling.
He said: ''In the West Midlands Asians account for 9.7% of the
population, but 18.75% of patients on the new kidney waiting list are
Asian. Effectively we have a zero organ donation rate from the Asian
ethnic community.
''There has never been a ruling which says donating organs is against
their religion, but a lot of Muslims believed it was.
''The situation has now been clarified with a fatwa that has the
agreement of both the Sunni and Shia branches of Islam.''

Coward was no social revolutionary, but he was far from accepting of
the death toll of the Great War.
Conjuring the decadence and the despair, the delights and the daring
of Britain in wartime, Noel Coward has a unique reputation as the
archetypical English playwright and raconteur -- two of his plays,
Cavalcade and Private Lives are showing in Edinburgh, providing a
glimpse of different aspects of Coward, the entertainer and social
commentator, as Mark Fisher explains
THEY really couldn't have timed it better. A matter of days after the
opening of Noel Coward's Private Lives at Edinburgh's Royal Lyceum, the
Edinburgh Festival Theatre is opening Coward's Cavalcade. It's not that
the plays have a lot in common -- in fact, the very opposite is true,
they couldn't be more different, and for Coward completists to see them
so close together will be a fascinating demonstration of the diversity
this actor-director-playwright-composer was capable of.
There was a time, in the 1920s, when Coward was known chiefly for his
musical revues. Now we know him for his elegant, witty, gently satirical
English comedies, of which Private Lives, a four-hander, is a prime
example. But versatility was a constant characteristic of his, and it
was while performing in Private Lives opposite Gertrude Lawrence in 1930
that Coward started to yearn to stretch his muse in yet another
direction.
''I felt the urge to test my production powers on a large scale,'' he
later recalled, and the result, Cavalcade, was a 30-year
autobiographical epic, spanning a key period of British history from the
Boer War in 1899 to the Armistice night of the First World War and on to
1930, with a cast of over 300 and a production that demanded everything
of the theatre technology of the day.
With this in mind, it's not surprising that Cavalcade rarely gets
revived. Now that it is being brought back to life, what's most
surprising is that the production company should be London's King's
Head, based in a theatre with an audience capacity of just 125. With
upwards of 200 amateur extras being drafted in to join the 15
professionals at each venue on the show's tour, you can quickly
calculate that the full cast could barely fit in the building, let alone
perform there.
''It's 50 years since VE-Day and 25 years that I've been at the King's
Head,'' laughs director Dan Crawford. ''So it seemed like it was time to
embark on a large project. I wasn't out to prove anything. I liked the
play and thought it had something important to say. And I enormously
liked the idea of having local people participate.''
Despite its tremendously popular debut in 1931, when most of the royal
family turned up to one performance, Cavalcade has had only four
full-scale British revivals -- and the last time it toured was in 1933.
Appropriately, that tour took it to the Edinburgh Empire (the Festival
Theatre as was) and given that the only complaint made by the Scotsman's
critic of the day was that the show was too big for the theatre, it will
be intriguing to see how well it goes down 62 years later, on what has
grown to be the country's biggest stage.
What will also be interesting is to see how well Coward's vision has
stood the test of time. Its first production opened only a fortnight
before a General Election, at a time when the Depression was starting to
hit, and its investigation into the nature of patriotism was often taken
at face value as patriotism itself.
Only last week, Paul Iles, the general manager of the Festival
Theatre, saw another production of the play in Canada where a section of
the audience gave an enthusiastic cheer to the rendition of the National
Anthem. Coward's intention was rather more subtle, however. He was no
social revolutionary, but he was far from accepting of the death toll of
the Great War and of the kind of blind loyalty that allowed it to
happen.
''The anti-war slant on it is very contemporary,'' says Crawford.
''It's about the twentieth century replacing the nineteenth, and since
Coward is more modern than the century, it's still a very relevant
piece. It has some patriotism to it, but it also deals with roots --
very basic things like who we are and why we're here, it goes further
than surface patriotism. That, counterpointed with an anti-war stance,
makes it a very interesting and unique piece.''
The great political events of Cavalcade are told through the lives of
the upstairs Marryots and the downstairs Bridges (Coward's play was the
inspiration for the TV series Upstairs Downstairs). According to the
Empire Theatre programme of 1933, the upper middle-class characters had
a ''special appeal because they approximate so closely to the experience
of very many thousands similarly placed''.
Clearly the influence of Brecht was a long way off. But although
Coward is associated with the high life, he made a big effort in
Cavalcade to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, most notably in
his use of the popular songs of the day. After all, the events that he
was describing, such as the death of Queen Victoria and the sinking of
the Titanic, really did make a big impression on the whole population.
In this production Gabrielle Drake, of Crossroads fame, plays Jane
Marryot, opposite Jeremy Clyde's Robert Marryot, though whether or not
they'll be visible behind the massed ranks of Edinburgh locals remains
to be seen. The locals will have had only a week to rehearse, and only
one day together with the professionals, but Dan Crawford is confident
that the whole thing will be seamlessly integrated on the night.
''It's a marvellous show and I love the idea of a spectacle,'' he
says. ''It's a show that I've wanted to do for a very long time and the
only way you could do it is by recruiting amateurs. It's been an
absolute treat with the locals so far.''
* Cavalcade opens tonight at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre and runs
until Saturday.

A 32-YEAR-OLD Drumchapel mother-of-four is the first winner of an
award recognising Scotland's unsung heroes and heroines.
The award from charity Scottish Education and Action for Development
(Sead) is the second honour for Ms Loraine Houston -- she was also
recently runner-up in a contest to find Drumchapel's top volunteer.
Ms Houston was nominated for her many campaigning achievements
including her dedicated work with the Drumchapel Community Health
Project.
She was also involved in the Concrete Action group to make play areas
in Drumchapel safe for youngsters, the Drumchapel Safe Kids Loan Scheme,
which loans child safety equipment for the home to parents who cannot
afford to buy it, and with groups linked to the Women's Health Network,
covering subjects such as agoraphobia, tranquillisers, and weight
problems.
She said her work had been part of an overall aim to make Drumchapel a
better place for her four youngsters to grow up in.
''When Sead telephoned to let me know that I was the overall winner,
words could not express how I felt. To be appreciated by my own
community is one thing, but to be appreciated outwith Drumchapel is
something else,'' she said.
Along with the award comes a #1000 cheque which Loraine plans to spend
on a family holiday at Butlin's in Ayr.
Sead's director, Mrs Linda Gray, said Ms Houston was a worthy winner.
''At a time when the public is sick of seeing the wealthy lining their
pockets, Loraine's award is a refreshing reminder that there are sectors
of society which share an altogether different, less self-interested set
of values,'' she said.
The charity, which challenges underdevelopment, links communities, and
promotes participation in Scotland and the Third World, plans to present
the new award annually.
Herald writer Ruth Wishart last night presented Ms Houston with her
award at a reception in Edinburgh's City Chambers.

EDINBURGH Zoo yesterday unveiled its latest arrival -- a five-week-old
Californian sea lion pup named Coral.
She is the second pup born to 11-year-old Kelpie, and her mate,
six-year-old Dylan, who regularly entertain visitors to the zoo. Born in
a special nursery enclosure and kept there for a few weeks, Coral, who
has doubled her birthweight of 2.5kg, is now with the rest of the group,
including brother Murdo, in the main pool.
Californian sea lions are found on the Pacific coasts from British

BRITISH Nuclear Fuels was fined #15,000 yesterday after a court found
safety rules were breached during the transport of radioactive fuel at
its Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant.
A flask containing uranium rods was allowed to be transported across
the complex in Cumbria without being submerged in water to prevent the
possibility of fire, Whitehaven magistrates in Cumbria were told.
A warning alarm was also ignored as the flask made its half-mile rail
journey inside the site, said Mr Tim Holroyde, prosecuting.
He added a ''host of records'' relating to the operation was not
properly completed.
State-owned BNFL pled guilty to five breaches of safety rules and
keeping inadequate records. Each charge carried a maximum #5000 fine.
The company was ordered to pay costs of #1600.
After hearing that workers contravened at least six different
regulations when they allowed the flask to make its journey, presiding
magistrate Ms Gillian Kerrush told the company that safety rules were
there to protect the public and the workforce.
''There seems to have been a certain amount of complacency that an
alarm has been ignored or considered to be false and authorisations were
not completed,'' she said. ''We treat these breaches as very serious.''
Mr Gerard McDermott, for BNFL, said even if a fire had occurred there
would have been no injury to the public or the Sellafield workforce.
''That having been said, BNFL take this incident very seriously.''
He stressed there had been no release of radiation and no injury. The
possibility of a small release of radioactivity had been ''very
remote''.
BNFL's director of magnox reprocessing, Mr Richard Mrowicki, said the
shift manager and five workers had been reprimanded but no-one had lost
their job.
He denied there had been complacency over breaching the rules, adding:
''It arose from a wish to get the job done and to ensure the flask was
removed as quickly as possible.''

Belfast
BRITISH and Irish Ministers met in Hillsborough Castle near Belfast
last night in an attempt to break the impasse over the Northern Ireland
peace process.
Northern Ireland Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew and junior Minister
Michael Ancram met the Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring amid
speculation that a deal involving the decommissioning of terrorist
weapons was on the table, along with plans for the early release of
prisoners and the future role of the security forces in the province.
After the meeting, both sides spoke of their hopes that an end to the
deadlock on arms decommissioning was in sight. Sir Patrick and Mr Spring
said they believed the weapons issue could be resolved.
Sir Patrick said: ''There are sensible grounds for being hopeful it
can be resolved.''
Sinn Fein has made it clear, however, that decommissioning cannot
begin in advance of any overall political settlement, but with the first
anniversary of the ceasefire just more than a month away, both
Governments are under pressure to find some sort of formula to end the
deadlock.
The peace process is virtually at a standstill, but after the meeting
officials on both sides, particularly the Irish, said the talks had gone
well on weapons and the issue of republican and loyalist demands for the
early release of prisoners.
Mr Spring said: ''An international commission is one of the options we
have been looking at. We have not arrived at firm conclusions yet and it
would not be wise to elaborate.
''But we have to look at all possibilities of what is a very complex
and difficult subject and one which we have not got a very great deal of
experience of dealing with in the past. We have got to find ways of
dealing with the modalities of decommissioning of arms.''
Commenting on the meeting, Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the
only way to consolidate the peace process was to anchor it firmly
through dialogue and all-party talks.
The British Government knew that, the Irish Government knew that, and
there was an onerous responsibility on both at this crucial time, he
said.
''The Irish Government has a primary role and responsibility to
advance the peace process. The British Government must accept the
democratic principles which assert Sinn Fein's right to represent our
electorate on the same basis as all other parties,'' Mr Adams said.
But Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis repeated his claim that violence
in Northern Ireland was about to resume, and said his view was widely
shared there.
''Now there is very clearly an acknowledgement that the peace process,
as it is called, is coming to an end,'' he told Channel 4 News.
''The reality is that there are a lot of evil people in the
paramilitary organisations who recognise that they represent in real
terms about 5% of the electorate. There's no advantage for them to move
into the democratic process,'' he said.
Sir Patrick defended his secret meeting last week with Mr Adams,
details of which leaked out at the weekend. Unionists, angered at the
revelation, were watching last night's developments at Hillsborough for
any sign of a weakening of the Government's position on the arms issue.
There was intense speculation in Belfast that some form of
international commission, possibly linked to Canada, would be agreed to
oversee the future decommissioning of terrorist weapons. The Irish
Government believes that Sinn Fein must be included in all-party talks
as soon as possible, but London is holding out on any possibility of
this, pointing out that unionists will not take part unless the IRA
hands over some or all of its weapons.
British and Irish officials have been working behind the scenes trying
to broker some form of compromise, while an Irish-American delegation
has been in Northern Ireland at the weekend adding further pressure for
an end to the deadlock.
Government sources have argued that if the IRA showed some intent to
decommission weapons, particularly explosives, there could be reciprocal
gestures, such as the rapid withdrawal of soldiers from Northern
Ireland.
Earlier, Irish parliamentarians warned that conditions in which IRA
prisoners were being held at Whitemoor jail could derail the peace
process.
Two prisoners -- Martin McGonagle and Liam Heffernan -- came off a
dirty protest specifically to meet the four-man delegation and would
remain off it while taking stock of the situation, said the leader of
the delegation, Deputy Joe Costello.

Lesley Stevenson in praise of the latest work from new talent in the
design business
THE new designers exhibition -- now in its ninth year -- provides a
showcase for current design graduates from colleges and universities
across the UK to present their work to the public. It also focuses the
attention of industry on the new talent in the Business Design Centre in
Islington, London.
The show for textiles, fashion, and graphics, which had a strong
representation from Scottish colleges, saw prizes awarded to Alison
Gourlay and Hilary Young of Edinburgh College of Art.
Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen has a small but select group display.
Brian Proudfoot's two-legged collapsible stool fulfils the brief for
pleasing useful and economic design which could easily be mass-produced.
Martin Doyle's articulated lighting and Jane Morrell's illuminated resin
and perspex mirrors are functional and fun. Carla De Freitas's work in
PVC has produced well-designed jewellery and some wonderful hi-tech
shoes with aluminium heels.
The work from Duncan of Jordanstone College in Dundee is strong in
jewellery and ceramics. Christopher Trollen's jewellery with its clean
lines and deceptive simplicity is influenced by natural forms. The
ceramics tend to be non-functional but of high quality. Louise Vyse and
Rachel Rogers both show works apparently influenced by vegetable matter
which are closer to sculpture than pots.
The displays by Edinburgh College of Art are particularly impressive
and work well as a group. Kirsty Brooks is exhibiting what she describes
as architectural glass. Highly original works made from reclaimed
windows, treated glass and fairy lights which have been blown up and
enlarged to create new and disquieting objects.
The Frog Seat by Ross Haxton is inspired by a hump-backed frog and he
has created a well thought out flexible seating system for a public
space. William Micklethwaite's simple chairs made from a single piece of
laminated plywood with two metal legs is an object lesson in good
design, functional, practical and made with the minimum of fuss.
Other works more self-consciously bridge the gap between art and
craft. Amellali Gonzalez Konig has created lamps from paper and clothes
pegs inscribed with poems which only properly reveal themselves when
illuminated.
It will come as no great surprise that Staffordshire College, located
at the heart of the Potteries, swept the board in the ceramic section,
writes Anne Ellis. What was breathtaking was the breadth of their range,
from the purely functional to the dazzlingly decorative. And the glass
(for which there is no prize -- what has happened to Britain's glass
industry?) was simply superb. Louise Thomas turns out vases with cool,
sensuous shapes almost too good to put flowers in. The Glass
Department's senior tutor, Elizabeth Swinburne of Glasgow, is rightly
proud of her students' efforts.
There are chairs made from everything from tennis balls to the most
exotic and expensive woods. Inflatables, deflatables, bio-degradables --
they are all there, including the most comfortable chair you could ever
sit on designed and made by Edinburgh School of Art's Neil T. Robinson.
This biomorphic, skeletal design betrays the influence of time spent
with that master of organic form, Tim Stead.
Interior design, product design, combined in a display of dazzling
virtuosity -- hoovers so snazzy that they must eternally be left out to
gather dust; kitchen utensils sophisticated enough for the most elegant
dining-room; and plastics which for tactile quality and shiny reflected
surfaces put crystal to shame.
But it was the light fittings which were the stars. For quirkiness and
sheer invention they undoubtedly took the prize. Staffordshire student
Angela Beevers may have won the EMESS Lighting Award, and deservedly so,
but an example of all that was best and most amusing, came from
Aberdeen's Gray's School of Art. A design by Martin Doyle which combined
engineering precocity with the polished elegance of articulated
aluminium to produce a ''Candle-abracadabra'' bringing an entirely new
connotation to the notion of a candlelit dinner.

MICHAEL FRAYN is one of the major farceurs of the past 20 years. In
Now You Know, however, Frayn the comic writer seems seriously at
loggerheads with Frayn the well-meaning liberal who obviously wanted to
write a play about integrity and private and personal secrecy, but
failed to satisfy either.
Now You Know, Frayn has said, started as a play, changed to a novel
and has now reverted back to the stage. The same kind of confusion seems
to reign throughout in a piece that doesn't know whether it's an office
farce, social satire, or morality play and is, at times, distasteful
with it.
Taking its cue from the case of the young civil servant Sarah Hogg,
who blew the whistle on her employers and went to prison for it, Frayn's
main protagonist is a working-class hero whose battles for public
accountability and freedom of information don't seem to stretch to his
own private life. Apart from being the lover of Jacqui, his office
manager -- an odious Home Counties type -- Terry also seduces a young
Home Office civil servant, Hilary. Inspired by his principles, she
spills the beans on her employer, resigns her job and leaks to Terry the
document of a Home Office case.
There is a topical, well-observed idea struggling to get out about
attraction and morality. Unfortunately, despite an explosively erotic
performance from House of Elliott's Louise Lombard as the troubled and
besotted Hilary, director Michael Blakemore and Frayn are done no
favours by the casting of Adam Faith as Terry who simply repeats the
rough sympathy of his Love Hurts TV character, but to far less effect.

MULTIPLE sclerosis is essentially incurable, and such treatments as
are available have proved to be of no more than marginal benefit for
most patients.
However, the course and severity of the disease can vary widely --
certainly enough to justify the optimistic approach being taken by Brian
Irvine's medical advisers.
Although it is known to strike one person in a thousand, Mr David
Harrison, spokesman for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, said yesterday:
''There are probably people walking about with MS in some form who will
never have reason to know about it.''
Normally emerging in young adulthood, the outlook can consist of short
periods of symptoms followed by long periods of remission; either steady
or rapid progress through mild symptoms to severe disability; or, in
some cases, apparent disappearance of the disease after the initial
attack.
Only time will tell if the confidence being shown in Irvine's recovery
is justified, but there are ample psychological reasons for taking the
positive approach.
''There is no doubt that a lot of people with MS regard the business
of mind over matter as being an important part of their lives. There is
no point in this young man having a Sword of Damocles hanging over his
head,'' said Mr Harrison.
''There is no reason to suppose that the continued exertion of playing
football will exacerbate his condition. His doctors will have advised
him about that.''
MS is the most common non-congenital disease of the nervous system in
young adults. It is thought to be an auto-immune disorder in which the
protein sheathing covering the nerves, myelin, is regarded as hostile by
the body's defence mechanism.
As a result the myelin is stripped off and the scar tissue that grows
in its place precludes the transmission of impulses by the nerve fibres
to the cells.
Any part of the white matter of the brain and spinal cord may be
damaged, affecting vision, speech, sensation, co-ordination and balance,
walking and bladder control, and causing tingling or pain.
Only a minority suffer the rapid progress from onset to disability and
death that struck down the cellist Jaqueline du Pre; MS itself does not
kill, but those who are severely disabled are more prone to potentially
fatal illnesses like pneumonia.
Dr Richard Knight, a consultant neurologist at Aberdeen Royal
Hospitals Trust, said: ''In general people with MS are advised to carry
on life as normally as possible. There is no established evidence that
physical exertion is intrinsically harmful.''
MS is more common the further one gets from the Equator, and Dr Knight
said that although it was difficult to be precise, the rate in the
North-east could be as high as 1:500, twice the UK average. (This may be
incidental to Brian Irvine's case -- he was born and raised in
Lanarkshire when the disease was probably taking root.)
Although there is no definitive treatment for MS itself, Dr Knight
said there were various drugs that could ease specific symptoms like
incontinence or limb stiffness.
''People try other things, like dietary modification -- it is
suggested that a diet low in animal fat and high in polyunsaturates is
beneficial,'' he said. ''How scientific that is is doubtful.
''Others persist with hyperbaric oxygen therapy, but scientific trials
have shown it has no fundamental part to play.
''The trouble with MS is that its erratic course of remission and
relapse make it hard to separate real benefit from something that might
have happened anyway.''

A LABOUR Euro-MP has demanded an immediate inquiry into military
aircraft activity over Scotland after it was revealed two Italian jets
invaded the airspace of an aircraft carrying the Queen and Duke of
Edinburgh.
The incident took place during a flight earlier this month from
Prestwick to Glasgow.
The Ministry of Defence is also considering a formal complaint to the
Italian Air Force.
Last night, a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Authority confirmed the
infringement of the so-called purple airspace exclusion zone took place
at about 2.10pm on July 5.
The Herald understands that the jets were part of a detachment of six
Italian Tornadoes, based at Cottesmore, Rutland, undertaking military
training over Scotland as part of Nato preparations for activity in
Bosnia-Herzogovina.
Asked if there would have been any danger to the Queen's plane as a
result of the incursion, the CAA spokesman replied: ''It was a technical
infringement within the airspace.''
However, a formal complaint is likely as this is only the third
occasion in 35 years that a royal flight exclusion zone has been
breached.
Purple airspace is set out on a daily basis in notices to all relevant
airfields.
Strathclyde West Euro-MP Hugh McMahon last night called for an
immediate inquiry into military aircraft activity over Scotland.
He added: ''It is a particularly worrying scenario with the military
taking over a lot of air lanes, causing delay and danger to civilian
flights.''
''Part of the peace dividend should not involve greater military
aircraft activity over the west of Scotland where there are two major
civilian airfields.
''Maybe this incident will persuade the Government to look at this
problem in greater detail.''

ARTICULATE, sophisticated, and coolly self possessed in person, Angus
Wright is none the less often convincingly gawky, garrulous, and
downright half-witted on stage and screen. The towering actor, 6ft 3in
his stocking soles, has turned his self-confessed ''beanpole stature''
to his advantage and, while he cut his acting teeth on meaty roles
during a two-year tenure at the Royal Shakespeare Company, he relishes
characters which allow him to explore physical comedy.
He's currently doing just that, impressing audiences and critics as
Victor in the Royal Lyceum Theatre Company's acclaimed production of
Noel Coward's Private Lives, which also features glittering performances
from husband-and-wife team Briony McRoberts and David Robb as the
irascible Amanda and Elyot and Katy Brittain as the other unfortunate
spouse, Sybil.
His inspired interpretation of Victor is best summed up in the
exasperated description, ''well, he wears his father's suits!''. He has
a fondness for the character however. ''What I like about him is the
fact that he doesn't give up. He's too thick skinned to realise that
Amanda is out of his grasp entirely. He's like one of those faithful
dogs who will keep going because that's the only thing he can do. Mind
you, he's incredibly judgmental; he'd probably be dangerous if he wasn't
so unintelligent.''
Wright's dim-as-dishwater routine gets another outing on the big
screen, during an appearance in the Sean Connery vehicle, the Arthurian
action adventure First Knight. ''I play third marauder,'' he says self
deprecatingly, reflecting that for dignity's sake he should probably
name his character. ''Perhaps Clive?''
''The best thing about the part was a scene with Julia Ormond, who
plays Guinevere and Richard Gere who is Lancelot. I grab Guinevere round
the neck but Lancelot convinces me that he's after her as well and we
can molest her together. That confuses my slow mind so he out-tricks me,
allowing her to shoot me. So I end up with a crossbow in the groin from
Julia Ormond.'' I wince, but Wright's broad grin indicates his delight
at being brought to such a bloody end by one of the hottest actresses
around.
Fleeting roles in film have given him the chance to work with big
names, like Robert De Niro on Frankenstein, on which he got a small role
after writing to Kenneth Branagh, whom he had worked with on Hamlet at
the RSC. ''Branagh is a genuinely fantastic guy, one of those people who
talks to anyone. He treats everyone absolutely equally and is very, very
funny.''
Despite the name and a tertiary education at Edinburgh University
where he studied art history before deciding that he had to tread the
boards, Wright is not Scottish, a fact he is quick to make clear,
fearful of being thought of as ''that hated of creatures -- the
Anglicised Scot''.
In fact he is quite rootless, born in Washington DC of English parents
who worked for the Foreign Office, and spending his childhood in Cairo,
Bahrain, and Syria. ''I had a very privileged background with a lot of
travel which I love and which has been part of the attraction of this
job, I love touring.''
And so far the travel has been somewhat more exciting than tours
around England's repertory theatres. His most recent job involves
extensive sojourns in Malta and Thailand, in the Geena Davies' pirate
epic Cut-throat Island due for cinematic release at Christmas.
''When I auditioned for the part it was only two lines long,'' he
explains. ''I play an English officer Captain Trotter, who is the
sidekick of Patrick Malahide, who plays the island Governor. We're
chasing the pirates who are chasing the treasure and I'm a typical
incompetent who tries hard but can't get anything right.''
He laughs wryly. ''Trotter changes throughout the film but at the end
he's still the underdog.'' Unlike Wright who looks set to be a top dog
in his chosen field.

STRIKES by train drivers were called off last night after a proposed
settlement was reached which would cut their working week by two hours.
Aslef leaders decided to suspend Thursday's threatened strike and to
ballot the union's 12,000 members after the breakthrough, which followed
eight hours of peace talks in London.
General secretary Mr Lew Adams denied that the outcome was a defeat
and said the union had negotiated an ''achievement''.
However, British Rail stressed it had stood by its final pay offer of
3% and maintained that the offer to cut hours had been on the table two
years ago. Mr Adams said: ''If the board had made this offer three weeks
ago, we would not have been in dispute.''
There will also be talks today aimed at averting a series of one-day
stoppages by London Tube workers, due to begin from tomorrow night.
Train drivers currently earn around #215 a week basic salary, rising
to #416 with nine hours' overtime. Mr Adams maintained that a two-hour
reduction in the 39-hour working week, due to be introduced by May 1997,
would be worth between 5% and 6% on top of BR's 3% ''final'' offer for
this year.
BR personnel director Mr Paul Watkinson declared himself delighted
with the deal. The 3% remained final and any impact on pay and
conditions through restructuring talks would be self-financing.
Drivers' hours and conditions will be negotiated with 25 operating
companies from next year after the industry is privatised.
The proposed deal will be put to a ballot of the BR drivers over the
next few weeks without recommendation.
This morning, Aslef and the Rail, Maritime, and Transport union will
attend talks with London Underground which, now that BR appears to be on
the way to a 3% settlement, may well be prepared to improve on its
''final'' 2.75% pay offer to avert damaging stoppages.

<HEADLINE>Father pulls out of custody battle</HEADLINE>

A FATHER whose case had been on television yesterday pulled out of a
bitter custody wrangle to spare his family.
The man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, gave up the fight for
access to his 10-year-old son.
''I did not want to put myself, my son and his elder brother through
the emotional hell that a continued court battle would cause,'' he said.
The man also said he felt the pursuit of custody was ''futile'' given
that the sheriff had already turned down a number of motions for access
to the boy.
The case was highlighted on BBC television in May when the boy was
seen being dragged kicking and screaming from his father's home in
Aberdeen by sheriff officers.
The boy's father had been seeking full custody since his wife left the
family home in August last year, but Aberdeen Sheriff Court was told
yesterday he no longer wished to pursue either custody of the boy or
access to him.
The mother's lawyer, Mr Douglas Watson, said the boy was happy living
with her near Aberdeen. ''He has settled in and is enjoying his summer
holidays,'' said Mr Watson.
Earlier, at a final custody hearing, the court heard claims that the
boy's mother made him wear dresses and make-up because she had always
wanted a daughter.
''My wife dressed him in girl's clothing, let him carry handbags and
this sort of behaviour,'' claimed the boy's 45-year-old father. ''She
put his hair up in different types of girl's styles and put make-up on
his eyes.''
The claims were supported by the estranged couple's other son, a
16-year-old who lives with his father. He told the hearing that his
45-year-old mother had tried to brainwash his little brother.
Yesterday, Mr Watson explained to the court that the question of
custody had been settled by the two parties. ''The father no longer
wishes to insist on the question of access. Hopefully at some time in
the future it can be resolved,'' he said.
Sheriff Alexander Jessop said: ''All along I have been very anxious to
ensure that the child was happy and that the child's best interests were
considered.''

MANY Scottish estates will not open the grouse season on the Glorious
Twelfth this year, due to dwindling numbers of birds. And some may have
no shooting at all this season.
As August 12 approaches, a report on the grouse population looks set
to make grim reading for many lairds. Blood-sucking ticks and
traditional predators, such as foxes, crows and hen-harriers, have
decimated numbers.
The situation is not much better in England, where an outbreak of
strongylosis, caused by parasitic worms, has been identified in
Yorkshire.
In Scotland, the Perth-based estate agents Finlayson Hughes say they
have already sold out of available sporting holidays, due to the lack of
birds.
Spokesman Robert Rattray said: ''There is a huge demand out there for
grouse-shooting, but there is simply less sport available this season.
''Some Highland estates rely on income from grouse-shooting and stand
to lose revenue worth up to #100,000 this year, because of the shortage
of birds.''
Researchers at the Game Conservancy Council, at Crubenmore Lodge, near
Newtonmore, Inverness-shire, are compiling a report on this year's
grouse population.
Author Dr Peter Robertson said: ''The birds are being attacked on a
number of fronts, which is causing problems. We have not yet completed
our count of birds in Scotland, so it is too early to say exactly what
the situation is like on a country-wide basis.''
Yesterday, Moya Taylor, at the Welbeck Estates, of Berriedale,
Caithness, said: ''We have too few grouse here to be able to shoot any
this season. The problem has been caused by the warm weather, which has
meant thousands of ticks infesting the birds, and they have been dying
of anaemia.''
Grouse-shooting became the ''in thing'' for the upper classes after
Queen Victoria bought Balmoral in 1852 and started hunting the birds on
her grounds.

PJ &amp; DUNCAN, known as Ant'n'Dec to those who care, and sometimes even
''the cheeriest men in pop'' to those who know no better, started their
so far short showbiz career as two pals in a children's television soap
opera set in Newcastle.
Aye, canny lads they were. They cut a record on the show as the
characters PJ &amp; Duncan, released it to the unsuspecting public, and were
an instant hit.
''Their'' music is best described as harmless pop-hip-hop. They have a
combined age of less than 40. The average age of their fans is likely to
be less than 12. They do look like your little cousins, but they can
sing better, they probably have more money, and at least they can tell
their grandkids they were once pop stars. And yes, girls, they ARE
available at the moment.
The hour-long show (not counting the three support acts) kicked off
with the classic Our Radio Rocks, and into the timeless Why Me?. I could
have sworn they came in with hilarious quips in between but aside from
not being able to see or breathe, the roar of the adolescents deafened
even the hardiest of concert-trained ears.
After sweating out a couple of soft-rap numbers, the boys threatened
to perform the next one with no clothes on, proceeding then to enter
looking just like Bill and Ben in a take-off (hopefully) of the American
rap genre. Bill'n'Ben. Ant'n'Dec. Has a ring to it, n'est-ce pas?
Ant'n'Dec are to rap what Gazza is to Celtic. But as crowd pleasers
they score a perfect 10 in my book, and if anyone has any complaints,
what ye gonna do about it, like? Come on, even us over-21s at the back
were trying to do The Rhumble. And no, you don't have to know what it

I WAS in my late teens before I saw, with my own eyes, any other part
of Europe for the first time. Childhood holidays were spent with
relatives in Northern Ireland. Or on Ayrshire's sandy beaches. Or at BB
camps around Scotland, from Burghead in the north to Eyemouth in the
south. France came much later.
With some student earnings from diverse London employments in our
pockets, a slightly bigger world suddenly opened up. There were those
agonising late summer bus and ferry trips from London to Paris, after
weeks earning the wherewithal squirting oil into the gearboxes of
electric motors, stamping out leather insoles for Dr Scholl, or carrying
frozen New Zealand lamb around the fringes of Smithfield meat market.
France, and the delights of Paris in particular, was the annual reward
before studies resumed. Getting there by road and sea was an endurable
but painful prelude to grasping that prize. Once we shortened the
process by taking a Channel air hop from a bumpy field outside Ashford
in Kent to somewhere near Arras. But buses still had to finish the
protracted job.
Europe has shrunk in the past three decades. In the past three weeks
the Young family, thanks to a rented camper van and a determinedly ad
lib approach to route planning, has dropped in on nine European
countries. Nine, that is, if you include lunch in Lichtenstein and a
swift north-south traverse of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg.
Largely prompted by Ewan and Jamie's appetite for country bagging, we
managed to look in on France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria, Italy,
and Switzerland as well. They urged the Czech Republic and Slovenia too.
But this driver has his limits.
Thanks to superb infrastructure almost everywhere -- apart from a
nightmarish traffic-clogged B road linking Menaggio on Lake Como with
Lugano in Switzerland -- our physical path could not have been smoother.
On my reckoning we crossed national borders some 15 or 16 times on our
journey. Not that you would have noticed. Most border posts are deserted
relics. Sometimes, as with the crossing from Belgium into the Dutch town
of Maastricht, only the dominant form of car registration plate gives
the game away. Even on our three entries into and exits from Switzerland
-- not yet a member of the European Union -- checks were perfunctory.
Only on returning to Dover did anyone ask a question. ''Are your
children on your passports?'' demanded the official. We were almost
tempted to say: No.
The major downside to a multi-country holiday is money. Not just
paying for the hire of the shell, as our home for three weeks was
affectionately christened, or her prodigious thirst. But constantly
having to switch from this currency to that as the days rolled by and
country followed country and avoid being left with mountains of
redundant coinage as the next border was crossed.
One day we found ourselves at the toll plaza at the end of a long
tunnel on the Tyrol without a single Austrian schilling to pay for the
privilege. they readily took sterling, although we later discovered that
some Austrian banks insist on a discounted exchange rate for Scottish
notes.
That enraged our kids in the same way that, in my own youth, despite
260 years of political union on a smaller, island canvas, occasional
encounters with a sniffy southern reluctance to accept the issue of the
Scottish banks at face value infuriated me.
There is no single European currency. Yet. But on our sort of jaunt,
deliberately designed with minimal pre-planning, plastic becomes a de
facto common currency, producing marks on demand in Baden-Baden, lire in
the evening heat of Chiavenna, Swiss francs after a traverse of the
Susten Pass.
The unfailing willingness of these ubiquitous holes-in-walls to fund
our progress was one surprise for Ewan and Jamie. But the constant
juggling with exchange rates prompted our boys to wrestle with something
else, the concept of strong and weak currencies and what their relative
strength tells you about the economies concerned.
As we talked their questions through, I thought back to my own early
encounters with the rest of Europe when a pound would buy you twice as
many French francs as it will now, or six or seven times as many German
marks.
The reasons for sterling's decline over the decades against many of
the other European currencies, both major and minor, are complex. But a
journey such as ours, across the heart of the continent, offers one
major physical clue. Down the Rhine, on Italy's Lombardy plain, up
through Basle into north-eastern France, Europe still manufactures a
diverse range of products and boasts some globally significant corporate
names. Too few of these names are now British. Our relative economic
performance has been mediocre for far too long.
The increasingly free movement of goods and people across the member
states of the EU will inevitably raise pressure for more currency
harmonisation across the Union. Too many people are making easy margins
from the process of currency exchange, too many others -- tourists and
companies alike -- face the daily frustration of moving from this one
into that one, for present arrangements to be sustainable for ever.
On a continent where the physical paraphernalia of national boundaries
is already a thing of the past, talk of a common or single currency
inspires little of the suspicion and hostility aroused here in Britain.
The Euro-sceptical tendency on the Tory back benches may be temporarily
silenced, but the mood it represents is built on a boundary which even a
tunnel link cannot extinguish -- the waters of the North Sea and the
English Channel which mean that over there will always be over there.
As we completed our modestly grand tour and I reflected on 30 odd
years of visiting ''over there'', I turned to thinking how these issues
will resolve themselves for Ewan and Jamie's generation. On present
evidence, it is hard to see beyond Britain being further marginalised in
the European experiment and having to cope with the consequences of even
more relative economic decline.

THE Government last night announced a public consultation on plans to
ban the prescription drug Temazepam, two months after the head of the
Scottish Police Federation called for action to stem the west of
Scotland's drugs wars.
The announcement came as the BBC current affairs programme Panorama
screened a hard-hitting documentary on the violence surrounding
Temazepam abuse in Paisley.
In April, Scottish Office Minister Lord Fraser told the Police
Federation conference in Peebles that abuse of Temazepam was the key
drugs issue in Scotland.
He said a rescheduling of the drug would make it harder for misusers
to obtain, adding: ''We are carefully examining the rescheduling of the
drug and hope to reach a decision soon.''
His promise followed a call for the ''killer'' drug to be outlawed by
federation chairman Mr Jim Fraser.
Mr Leslie Sharp, Chief Constable of Strathclyde Police, has estimated
that there are about 10,000 drug abusers in Glasgow, of whom two-thirds
are thought to be addicted to Temazepam.
Last night's Government announcement came amid concern that the drug
makes abusers aggressive and led to 50 deaths last year in Glasgow
alone, and has been responsible for escalating violence and a series of
murders in Paisley.
Mr John Bowis, parliamentary secretary at the Department of Health,
launched a public consultation exercise on the proposed ban on
prescription of the soft gel-filled capsules by general practitioners.
He said: ''The scale of the misuse of Temazepam requires action. The
misuse . . . by injecting drug users has given rise to extremely serious
health problems for them.
''If a decision to ban were taken, it would be part of a package of
measures designed to reduce misuse which would include increasing safe
custody controls on all formulations of Temazepam in manufacturers'
premises and warehouses.
''The tablet and elixir formulations of Temazepam would remain
available on NHS prescription in order to meet all clinical need. There
would be no question of this proposal disadvantaging patients in any
way, and patients would continue to receive the medicines they need.''
The announcement came as BBC1's Panorama programme reported that the
drug has led to murders, machete attacks, shootings and a firebombing in
Paisley.
Street demand for Temazepam is so strong that criminal gangs fight
pitched battles for control of the lucrative black market in the drug.
Mr Ken Mitchell, a surgeon at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley
told the programme he treated children as young as 13 who had been
involved in taking Temazapam, for whom taking the drug had become
socially acceptable.
''There's obviously a vendetta going on, there's some sort of warfare
going on,'' he added.
He said he had seen ''stab wounds through the neck, going in one side,
out the other side, right through the vocal cord area''.

GLASGOW Licensing Board continues to be successful in curbing the
late-night coffee-drinking habits of the populace.
Readers may recall our story about the Insomnia Cafe and Gallery in
Woodlands Road, Charing Cross, which announced it would stay open 24
hours a day selling coffee and snacks. It would allow those in what used
to be culture city who didn't want to go home at midnight a place to
hang about.
Then the Glasgow licensing authorities, in the shape of two policemen,
turned up and informed the owner, Mark Norris, that he needed a licence
to sell coffee and snacks after 11pm. So, plans to stay open round the
clock have been shelved while his application to sell coffee and snacks
is heard by the Glasgow Licensing Board.
Meanwhile, Glasgow polis have been making spot checks to make sure the
Insomnia Cafe is not selling coffee and snacks after 11pm. (Hands up all
those who think the time of Glasgow's finest might be better spent?)
Mark Norris is increasingly gobsmacked by the complexity of the
licensing laws as interpreted by the Glasgow city fathers. He now learns
that while he cannot use his expensive and smart machine to make
espressos and cappuccinos for his customers after 11pm, he can instal a
machine to dispense immensely inferior coffee in plastic cups. This
would be perfectly legal.
While he cannot lop a few slices off his leg of Parma ham and sell it
after 11pm to a waiting populace, he could offer them pre-packed
sandwiches. This is also legal within the licensing laws. Apparently,
while you can sell pre-prepared food and drink after the outrageously
late hour of 11pm, it must not be freshly crafted by human hand.
Mind you, the licensing board and the police might be right. We've all
seen the misery that coffee and snacks can cause, especially consumed
late at night.
It starts with the odd cup of Birds Mellow instant and before you know
it, you've got a six-cups-of-espresso-a-day habit. How often have you
seen cappuccino-crazed youths careering down Sauchiehall Street
attempting to slash the lieges with slices of razor-sharp pizza?
Before we know it, the people of Glasgow will be sitting in cafes till
all hours eating quiche and getting inflamed on that Earl Grey tea.
Green in his eye
THE Open Golf champion looked somewhat bemused and at a loss for words
when called upon to make his wee speech at St Andrews on Sunday. He did
quite well really in his American way, saying how awesome it all was.
The Diary was quite surprised to see him coming back for a second
speech.
The reason for Mr Daly's return to the microphone was that an official
of the Royal and Ancient buttonholed him and told him he had to do the
speech of thanks. It is traditional that the champion thanks the
organisers, the green-keepers, and others who make sure the Open goes so
smoothly.
Mr Daly didn't quite catch the drift. He proceeded to thank his wife,
his agents, and his family.
Sagely graduates
IT is hard enough for Scotland's new universities to develop an august
image without misprints by those who should be on their side. We are
talking about our dear chums at Paisley University. In the window of a
local photographic shop there are photographs of proud graduates in all
their finery. Pity that the sign in the window refers to an institution
called the University of Parsley.
Damned drinkers
BLAME Donald Grant of Oldhall, Paisley, for the Diary's return to the
subject of American translations of the Bible.
He sends this comparison of some words as found in the King James
Authorised Version and in the Living Bible, a US update:
Isaiah 5,11: Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that
they may follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
inflame them. Woe to you drunken bums.
Isaiah 5,14: Therefore hell hath enlarged herself and opened her mouth
without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp,
and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it. Hell is licking its lips
in anticipation of this delicious morsel.
See American Bibles? See finger-lickin good?
The Name Game
THE man who owns the ice-cream shop in Millport is a Mr Cool. Director
of a forthcoming Channel 4 series, Over the Rainbow, on what it's like
to be homosexual in America, is an Arthur Dong. And from San Francisco
we hear of a pub called Mary's Backside. It is not thus named because of
that part of the proprietrix's anatomy, simply that the entrance is to
the rear of the building.
French intrigue
THE 700th anniversary of Scotland's friendship with France rears its
head again, this time in an Edinburgh Festival Fringe context. The
Edinburgh Renaissance Band are doing two shows of ancient music called
Auld Alliance and The Viol Rackett Show at St Cecilia's Hall.
The bumf for the shows asks intriguingly: ''Where do you wear a pair
of nakers? Is it safe to play a serpent? What did Parisians think of
Scottish drinking habits in 1295?''
We were going to inquire on your behalf (or should that be behalves?)
but then again we thought the questions might be more interesting than
the answers.

ON SATURDAY, in the steamy Bible Belt town of Union, South Carolina,
US, a jury took less than three hours to convict Susan Smith of
murdering her two little sons. Last October, after police destroyed her
cock-and-bull tale of their kidnap by a bad black man, Smith confessed
that she, herself, had strapped the boys into her car and set it rolling
into a deep lake.
For the next week the 12-strong jury must debate whether Smith should
merely be imprisoned for life, or be put to death in the electric chair.
The facts of the case are not in dispute. Smith's mental state at the
time of the atrocity is the issue, and already red herrings, sob
stories, and general sensationalism are dividing the nation.
This sort of farce does little for America's standing in the world.
The trial of O J Simpson, a travesty of meaningful justice, has made a
laughing stock of her legal system. And, since the death penalty was
revived in 1976, the appalling inconsistencies and red tape surrounding
the execution of capital offenders chills the soul. It typically takes
12 years, no less, after sentence before the murderer is dispatched.
Most of that time is swallowed up by lawyers, by a hundred pettifogging
petitions and objections, and all the cumbersome machinery of state and
federal judiciary.
Two aspects of America's penal system must disturb us. One is the
absolute liberty put on the First Amendment to the constitution,
granting free speech. So the US has no effective law of sub judice.
Accused, witnesses, and lawyers may freely discuss the case with
journalists, or spin their lines on national television. It was on TV
that Smith herself spun her abduction tale, later dismantled by police.
O J Simpson's famous car chase was watched -- live -- by millions of
Americans. Jury selection, witness credibility, and the very soundness
of justice itself are greatly strained by such shenanigans.
Worse, however, are the unbelievably barbaric means the executing
states of the US employ to kill people. The electric chair, the gas
chamber, the lethal injection are unreliable, agonising, ugly ways to
end a life. It is hard to see why Americans are so reluctant to deploy
drop-hanging -- the traditional, instant British method -- or even the
guillotine, which is messy but indubitably effective.
A man gassed with hydrogen cyanide may convulse and writhe for many
minutes. The lethal injection sometimes fails and has to be
readministered. The electric chair is perhaps the worst of all. Its
victim may take 20 minutes to die, paralysed by current, conscious but
unable to scream or move. On occasion, hair has caught fire and eyeballs
have exploded. Men die more easily under Islamic law.
The Smith trial is over; the farce now begins. Her former husband
leads those clamouring for her death. (He turned up for the verdict with
a photo of his wee sons to dangle by the TV cameras.) In South Carolina
-- a bloodthirsty state, keen on executions -- killing more than one
person, and killing a child under the age of 11, is considered
peculiarly heinous in law. Then there is the Myra Hindley syndrome: the
irrational horror we all feel for women who kill children, and
especially their own.
Against this stands the sob story in all its weepy detail. Smith's
father killed himself when she was only seven years old. Her stepfather
(allegedly) subjected the girl to sexual abuse. Smith's doctors and
friends have detailed her history of mental illness: depressions,
obsessions, anxiety-states. During trial, defence lawyers argued Smith
had been intent on killing herself as well as her sons. The prosecution
countered that she ruthlessly drowned the children because they were an
obstacle to future romance.
Quite apart from its inherent drama -- she drowned her own children!
-- the Smith case enthralls America because of the unwonted glamour of
the accused. Most Americans on Death Row are poor, black, illiterate,
and disadvantaged. Susan Smith is white and was respectable in a
respectable community.
There is much that could be said about all this, about the American
legal system and the American media. But let us focus, for now, on the
issue of the death penalty. Opinion polls show a majority of countrymen
want it restored. Evangelical Christians, especially, often clamour for
the return of the rope and appeal to ''Biblical'' notions of justice.
I agree -- in principle. It is my own view that murderers and rapists
should be executed -- in theory. The trouble starts when you apply such
a concept to the messy realities of life. Rape is a crime notoriously
hard to prove, especially when our law allows at present no shades of
meaning between ''date rape'' and some vicious assault by a stranger in
an alley. And murder, under the Mosaic law of the Old Testament
dispensation, could not be proved without two sworn eye-witnesses to the
act.
Recent British experience of capital punishment lends little
encouragement. In this century, and especially after the Second World
War, execution became increasingly arbitrary and political. Timothy
Evans was quite innocent of the murder for which he was hanged. So,
almost certainly, was James Hanratty. The disgusting execution of the
retarded Derek Bentley -- who had not even fired the fatal shot; Chris
Craig, who did, is still alive -- did much to hasten the rope's demise.
If capital punishment is to be used at all, it is to be used
consistently.
Those on the Tory benches who still agitate for a return to execution
betray such illogical thinking. Recent Bills for the restoration of the
death penalty sought it for the killers of policemen and prison wardens,
and for terrorists. It is hard to see why the lives of soldiers,
policemen, and prison officers should be set at higher value than those
of the rest of us. In addition, proof of guilt in such a case is hard to
establish. Could any credible witness be produced after a prison riot?
Most of all, perhaps, we should think of the effect of executions on
those required to supervise and inflict them. I have known one creepy
clergyman who declared that ''the executioner's calling is honoured of
God''; and would have happily tugged the lever himself. But many
would-be hangmen -- read the memoirs of the late Syd Dernley --
performed once, and could never do it again. Some hysterical or botched
executions, here and in the US, have scarred for life all involved.
For my own money, Susan Smith should not be put to death: by
definition, any mother who did what she did must have been
pathologically insane. I hope, however, that the circus unfolding in
South Carolina will put an end to much vengeful and simplistic thought
on our own side of the pond.

SCOTTISH Secretary Michael Forsyth yesterday seized the initiative at
his first meeting with local authority leaders by inviting them to join
him in forming a task force to examine the rules governing the conduct
of councillors.
He also published new guidance on the decentralisation of council
decision-making, which he claimed was the kind of devolution that really
mattered.
His unexpected move over the task force comes in the wake of the Black
investigation into the running of Monklands District Council, a Scottish
Office inquiry over the use of public funds in Ferguslie Park, and
persistent allegations of ''jobs for the boys'' over some appointments
to the new unitary councils.
The task force will not examine specific complaints but will look at
the existing controls and see if they need to be strengthened.
Cosla representatives agreed to join the task force of officials but
afterwards seemed taken aback by the wide-ranging nature of the proposed
investigation set out by the Scottish Office in a written statement.
The statement said the task force would be expected to look at the
powers of the Ombudsman, the National Code of Local Government Conduct,
the Register of Pecuniary Interests, the arrangements for appointing and
dismissing senior staff, and the system of Monitoring Officers.
Answering questions later, Mr Forsyth said it was possible that the
powers of the Ombudsman could be increased.
However, Cosla's Labour president, Ms Rosemary McKenna, insisted that
no terms of reference for the task force had been discussed with Mr
Forsyth. It was ''extremely disturbing'' if anything else was being
suggested.
What Cosla was concerned about was the time it took to investigate
allegations about councillors' conduct.
Clearly referring to the activities of Monklands District Council, she
said there was great concern about the length of time allegations could
be bandied about, for example in the House of Commons.
''We agreed it was time we looked at ways of making sure that what I
would call the festering sore aspect of accusations against councils and
councillors could be dealt with. That is what we have agreed to and that
is what was offered.''
Scottish Local Government Minister George Kynoch seemed to envisage a
wider remit, referring to recent ''jobs for the boys'' allegations about
some appointments to the new unitary councils when discussing the task
force.
Mr Kynoch has recently insisted the staff commission should crack down
on councils over the way they handle the filling of jobs on the new
authorities, and new guidelines are expected very soon.
It was important, the Minister stressed yesterday, that the new
unitary authorities should hold the respect of the public from day one.
The task force would look into the effectiveness of current safeguards
on the conduct of local government.
Mr Forsyth said that concern had been expressed about the checks and
balances in local government and the ability to ensure prompt and
effective investigations were undertaken where allegations of improper
conduct had been made.
''What is at issue here is -- can we find means that, when
allegations, often unfounded, are made, they can be looked at, someone
can take responsibility for them, the air can be cleared if there is
nothing behind them, and, if there is something behind them, effective
action can be taken?''
The apparent non-meeting of minds over the activities of the task
force took a little of the after-gloss off what otherwise was hailed by
both sides as a very positive encounter.
The Scottish Secretary kept up his recent charm offensive by stressing
the meeting had been ''good humoured, enjoyable, positive, and
constructive''.
Cosla leaders agreed the meeting had been a positive one but were more
cautious, saying Mr Forsyth was ''on probation'' and ''actions speak
louder than words''.
The Scottish Secretary's remarks also suggested that an end to the
capping of council budgets was still very much on the cards.
On decentralisation, Mr Forsyth said the aim was to give local people
the chance to make a difference to the running of their towns, villages,
and cities. He hoped the new councils would create meaningful systems of
delegating decision-making closer to the point of service delivery.
He also announced that the Scottish Office has agreed to double to
#12m the amount of capital spending councils could incur mainly over
property matters during reorganisation.

THIS is a world of violent echoes now. In Europe, the Middle East, and
Asia, in Africa and the United States racism lies in the psyche not just
as a residual sickness but something which, however marginal, has dared
to activate its poisons once again.
In Germany thousands of Jewish memorials are desecrated and Turkish
labourers attacked by neo-Nazi gangs. In southern Italy vigilantes
ambush Albanians in their futile trek for work. In Britain Asian and
West Indian youths rampage against the police, accusing them of routine
vicious smears. In France, where Jean-Marie Le Pen campaigns on a
blatant immigrant-hate ticket, the National Front now commands
unprecedented influence in the country's social affairs. And in the
United States, where a white mother murders her children then pretends
the missing babes were stolen by a black, white supremacists gather
beneath the tall, graceful pines of Hayden Lake in Idaho, to shout sieg
heil and unfurl a swastika banner from the tower of a church.
Revelling in notoriety since the Oklahoma bombing, the church's
pastor, Richard Butler, 78, parades his anti-Semitism unhindered by the
police department. A soldier in the last world war, he tells a weekend
rally: ''I fought on the wrong side because I fought against my own
people.'' And those whites who criticise him he calls traitors, ''white
outside, black inside, with Jewish minds''.
It is simple to dismiss such rage as madness, but there are never easy
answers to racism, although for many post-war decades we in Europe chose
to pretend it was the exclusive scourge of America. Then, as if
communism were demanding revenge for its collapse, its last gift to its
clapped-out empire was the growth of ultra right-wing nationalism, a
malignancy which has added two hideous words to the world's everyday
vocabulary.
Ethnic cleansing is not the by-product of an incomprehensible war. It
is the goal of that war, just as the Holocaust was the Nazis' goal when
contempt for certain human beings made others feel healthy, vital,
alert.
Today hatred is so confident of its potency it acts like a tonic at
different levels for all sorts of people -- Westminster's mischievous
Euro-barmies sneering and resentful of any landscape other than their
own; the media academic peddling malice for money and attention; the
nonsensical murderer who opens fire in a supermarket; the racist at the
fashionable dinner table.
In Paris, youths so distanced from civility by unemployment kick a
poor Algerian migrant into the Seine, while in the English Midlands
their brother bullies set about and maim a Bangladeshi student.
Commemorations of the last war, reports on Rwandan brutality, or the
routine disappearance of Muslim men in Bosnia, and their women's
systematic rape . . . these incidents always raise the enigma of how
such barbarism can occur. By communist standards Yugoslavia enjoyed
relative sophistication: in all community sections it had a professional
class, a mercantile tradition, and vigorous intelligentsia.
So, are there certain people born to heinous cruelty, or are torturers
made from others, just like you and me? Up goes the protest: not you,
not me. Yet from Bosnia to Northern Ireland, from Israel to Angola and
Iraq, the evidence is universal. Beneath society's veneer there is a
tribalism which, if manipulated, leads even ordinary folk to rationalise
premeditated killing and hate.
How could a nation with all the brilliance it had imparted to science,
literature, and music become so corrupted by Hitler? What fury drove
Susan Smith to pin the tragedy of her drowned sons on a fictitious black
carjacker? She did so because in a racist country that lie at first
seemed plausible. Months later, when America suffered the raw ease of
terrorism at Oklahoma, its initial instinct was to blame a foreigner,
never contemplating the guilty one might be its own.
In 1944 Gunner Myrdal published the first extensive study of America's
racial problems and the findings were appalling. Even so, Myrdal was
hopeful because he said Americans were worried: ''It is on their minds
and on their consciences.'' Is racism on their consciences still? The
horror of this century, there and here, is that individuals can be
brought so readily to perceive their neighbours as non-persons, targets
to be annihilated without an anguished thought.
Maybe we cannot make people better than they are, but at the first
word of hate -- racist or otherwise -- we can heed the warning. When
talk is of hate, crime follows randomly and with terrifying speed. And
the wisdom so shamingly learned from the Holocaust is shamelessly
betrayed.

IT seemed to be the biggest mismatch since David and Goliath, with the
result just as astonishing.
In the red corner, bell-jingling and collection can carrying Hare
Krishna monks. Their opponents, the rugged souls of Campbeltown. The
contest was not over territory but another age-old issue of contention
-- money.
The West Highlands had it. The shaven-headed monks wanted it.
In more douce areas, coins of the realm would change hands in return
for the sensory satisfaction of the tinkle of a bell -- an integral part
of the Hare Krishna collection company.
But the monks have been accused of adopting more persuasive tactics
and harassing the public in Campbeltown and Rothesay.
District councillors are considering banning the vegan monks from
collecting in Dunoon.
A spokesman for Argyll and Bute District Council said: ''There
certainly have been complaints about the Krishnas from members of the
public in Cambeltown and, I believe, Rothesay.
''If door-to-door or other collections cause inconvenience, we are
duty bound under the Civic Government Scotland Act to refuse further
applications from the organisation.
''In this case, it appears the quasi-religious organisation has been
over-stepping the mark considerably. We have been told they have been
intimidating and hassling passers-by.''
The latest application, for a collection in Dunoon, is almost certain
to be refused, he revealed.
One Cambeltown shopkeeper, who did not wish to be named, claimed he
had been troubled by two Hare Krishna monks.
He said: ''They behaved more like skinheads than members of a
religious group. They came into my shop and said I had promised #25. It
took me some time to get rid of them. I had promised nothing of the
sort.''
Krishnas are more commonly seen collecting in Glasgow, Edinburgh, and
Dundee.
They hand out vegan cookbooks and other publications with spiritual
messages promoting Krishna consciousness and commonly ask members of the
public to say Gouranga -- the Krishna name for their god who is said to
have come to India 500 years ago.
Mr Graham McTurk, a spokesman for the Hare Krishna temple at
Lesmahagow, said he was not aware of disciples using aggressive street
collection tactics. ''Our disciples are generally well-mannered people
with respect for others, he added. ''I haven't heard of problems in
Argyll but we can look into it.''

SCOTTISH international defender Brian Irvine yesterday showed the
courage and determination with which he has won the hearts of Aberdeen
supporters over the past decade when he announced he was suffering from
multiple sclerosis.
Following a back injury suffered in the close season Irvine, who
played a key role in ensuring Aberdeen's premier division survival, was
referred to a specialist and at the end of last week MS was diagnosed.
However, 30-year-old Irvine and his medical advisers are confident
that he will make a full recovery from the current attack of the disease
and will be able to resume and complete his playing career.
Irvine, the 6ft 2in, 13-stone central defender, who has enjoyed some
of the best form of his career in recent seasons, and has been capped
nine times for Scotland, issued a statement at the club yesterday.
''During the close season I became unwell and had some tests in
hospital which highlighted a very mild form of MS,'' he said.
''It seems MS covers a large number of complaints and nobody would be
able to say exactly what the prognosis is for any individual sufferer.
However, I have been assured by the medical experts that my recovery
will be complete and I will be able to resume training shortly and be
back to full fitness and playing very soon thereafter.
''This has been a difficult time for my family and myself and I am
indebted to Aberdeen Football Club and all those in the medical world
who have been so helpful and understanding.''
Irvine, a Christian who participated when Billy Graham visited
Pittodrie Stadium for a series of rallies, added: ''I am so grateful for
my faith in the living God at this time.''
Irvine appealed for peace and privacy to continue with his recovery to
enable him to get back to the game as soon as possible.
Later, he posed for photographs outside his Aberdeen home where he
lives with wife Donna and their two daughters Hannah, four, and
Christina, 10 months, and said: ''I am in a positive frame of mind and I
am in the recovery process.''
Clearly emotional, he apologised for being unable to raise a smile but
said: ''I hope you will all be there to cheer me when I come back for my
first game.''
Irvine signed a new two-year contract with Aberdeen in June, 10 years
after he joined the club from Falkirk, and at the start of his
testimonial season.
''I accepted the first offer on the table because I have no desire to
play for any other club,'' he said.
He was unable to take part in any of the pre-season build up because
of what was thought to be a trapped nerve, but has now been diagnosed as
MS.
Club doctor Derek Gray said he was confident Irvine would recover to
complete his career.
''MS is a disease which has a very wide spectrum from very mild to
very aggressive. An attack is followed by remission which can last many
months or years, and sometimes another attack never comes. I have
patients who have had one attack 20 years ago and no more. Who is to say
that is not full recovery.
''Brian had problems with his back and was referred to the relevant
specialist a few weeks ago, and the diagnosis was confirmed within the
last few days.
''I am hopeful and confident Brian will recover to allow him to go on
and play to the end of his career.''
Aberdeen Chairman Ian Donald said: ''We all feel for Brian and his
family but we are confident he will be able to resume his playing
career. Brian is a big, fit lad and it will be a challenge, but if
anyone can do it Brian can.''
Irvine was a key player at the end of last season as Aberdeen battled
for premier division survival under new manager Roy Aitken, who said
yesterday: ''Everyone concerned with the club, and I am sure I speak for
the supporters, will be 100% behind Brian's rehabilitation programme.
''I am confident Brian will make a full recovery and he will be given
every support and assistance. Brian has been very positive about this
and we are approaching it with that type of attitude.''
Irvine was brought to Pittodrie as understudy to Willie Miller and
Alex McLeish, and yesterday Miller said he was devastated by the news.
''It is shattering and unbelievable and not something you expect from
someone as fit and clean living as Brian. I have always had respect for
the big man,'' he said.

BRITISH soldiers were digging in last night on Mount Igman,
overlooking the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
The 500-strong Task Force Alpha is completing emplacements for the
dozen 105mm guns which will be used to protect 5000 peacekeepers in
Sarajevo and UN convoys using the mountain route into the capital.
So far, there was no sign of reaction from the Bosnian Serb Army
laying siege to the city. However, British Army spokesman Colonel Barry
Hawgood, speaking from Vitez, warned: ''If they open fire, they know we
will respond.''
As the British troops consolidated their position, Nato military
planners were meeting in Brussels amid division between the 16-member
alliance and the United Nations over the UN's right to veto air strikes,
writes European Editor Murray Ritchie.
One report said the meeting of Nato ambassadors had ended ''abruptly''
ahead of schedule. It had been in session since Saturday to assess the
implications of last week's London summit which threatened air strikes
against the Serbs if they made hostile moves against the UN enclave of
Gorazde.
Nato officials did little to conceal an apparent rift about the
so-called ''dual-key'' mechanism for military strikes.
This is an arrangement under which both Nato and the UN must agree to
strikes. It is also one which has caused frustration among Nato
planners, suspicious of the UN's power which is, in effect, a veto.
There is a further school of thought, supported last year by US
President Bill Clinton at the Nato summit, which is that, once the UN
commanders on the ground have agreed in principle to empowering Nato to
make strikes, there is no further detailed permission required. The
decision to send in bombers could be taken by a group of governments
representing troops contributors.
In Brussels last night, Nato officials suggested this was too free an
interpretation.
''But Nato would like the UN to be a little more liberal about turning
its key,'' a spokesman said. ''This matter has to be sorted out. As
things stand, it is rather damaging to the reputation of both
organisations.''
Ambassadors will meet again this morning to consider a report from the
military committee which is drawing up detailed technical plans for
potential targets and troop movements in and around the ''safe'' areas
of Bosnia.
The plan is to give force to the London summit's pledge of
''decisive'' strikes if the Serbs attack Gorazde and, possibly, other
enclaves.
Defence Secretary Michael Portillo yesterday warned the Bosnian Serbs
that they faced ''very substantial'' air attacks if they pressed ahead
with an assault on Gorazde.
He stressed: ''We are moving away, if this happens, from the mere
tit-for-tat response. We are moving into something bigger and would
unfold over a period of time if that attack against Gorazde were
sustained.''
British Captain Colin Armstrong-Bell, another Vitez-based spokesman,
said Task Force Alpha included gunners from the Royal Artillery's 19
field regiment, one company of the Devon and Dorset Regiment in Warrior
armoured personnel carriers, and a detachment of engineers.
A further company of the Devon and Dorsets and a squadron of the
Household Cavalry were in reserve with their vehicles a few miles away
in Kiseljak, he said.
The British troops on the mountain have been joined by the first of
500 French Foreign Legionnaires backed by light tanks.
They were deployed on Sunday after Bosnian Serbs killed two French
peacekeepers and wounded three others and a Dane in attacks on Saturday.
The total mission now comprises 1300 British troops, 500 French, and
nearly 200 Dutch soldiers with heavy mortars.
As the soldiers were taking up their positions overlooking Sarajevo,
Bosnian Serb tanks and artillery pounded the southern approaches to the
Bosnian government enclave of Zepa.
UN officials said Ukrainian peacekeepers in the besieged enclave
reported an apparent Serb infantry attack from the west of Zepa, where
around 17,000 Muslims are believed trapped.
The renewed assault followed reports of substantial gains by Croatian
Serbs in the Bosnian government pocket of Bihac in north-west Bosnia.
Meanwhile, 12 RAF Harrier GR7 aircraft left their base in Germany
yesterday to begin duties on Nato's Operation Deny Flight.
A Ministry of Defence spokesman said some of the Harriers, from Number
IV (Army Co-operation) Squadron, at Laarbruch, had already arrived at
the Italian Air Force base at Gioia del Colle, near Taranto, and would
formally take over duties from RAF Jaguar aircraft on August 1.
Their mission will include the provision of protective air cover for
UN ground forces.

A MAN was jailed for life yesterday for the shotgun murder of his
former wife on Christmas Day.
Phillip Manning, 42, had been released on parole two months
previously, after an earlier attempt to kill Margaret Whitcombe, a
mother-of-three and his wife for 20 years.
Obsessively jealous, he waited in jail with ''extreme bitterness in
his heart and, undoubtedly, murder on his mind,'' Mr Gerard Elias, QC,
prosecuting, told Cardiff Crown Court.
Manning, of Abertillery, Gwent, was released on licence last October
on condition that he did not see his ex-wife. But he obtained a sawn-off
shotgun and knife and ambushed her in the garden as she came home late
on Christmas Eve with her boyfriend, Mr Neil Jones.
After attacking Mr Jones with the knife, Manning fired twice at
point-blank range at his ex-wife. The former lorry driver then became a
fugitive for a month until he was arrested in London after he strapped a
home-made nail-bomb to himself.
Manning had been released on parole after being given a
four-and-a-half-year sentence for the attempted murder of his wife in
1992, when he repeatedly stabbed her and tried to strangle her.
Throughout that attack, he was shouting: ''You are going to die.''
Mrs Whitcombe, also 42, was shot after Mr Jones had been beaten to the
ground and hacked with a 12-inch knife, which left him needing plastic
surgery and a plate in his skull.
After making threats against the rest of the family, Manning fled.
Sentencing Manning to two terms of life imprisonment to run
concurrently, for the murder of Mrs Whitcombe and the wounding of Mr
Jones, Mr Justice Jowitt said he should not be considered for release
while there was any risk of his becoming involved in an emotional
relationship.
Outside court, Detective Superintendent Ian Johnston, of Gwent CID,
said: ''Fortunately, the rules on releasing violent prisoners have been
changed, and the police and victims have to be consulted before such a
move is made.
''Manning was undoubtedly a very dangerous man.''

<HEADLINE>MPs express fears at ScottishPower's move as English company rejects #1bn takeover. Electricity storm over Scots bid</HEADLINE>

THE #1000m takeover bid by ScottishPower for an English electricity
company faces a long battle and severe political criticism, even from
within Scotland.
The bid was swiftly rejected yesterday by Manweb, which said the offer
was ''mean'' and ''fundamentally undervalued'' its prospects under the
existing management.
It was the first bid by a British electricity company to buy another.
If successful, ScottishPower's customer base will jump from 1,700,000 to
three million and its electricity sales will rise by 86%. But although
it would create one of Scotland's biggest quoted companies, political
reaction in Scotland was less than welcoming.
Opposition MPs said concerns about prices, safeguards for jobs, and
the future of the electricity industry still stood, irrespective of
where the bids emanated from.
Both Labour and Scottish Liberal Democrats called for the bid to be
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Even the Scottish National Party was not entirely gung-ho about a
Scottish company attempting a raid on England. Leader Mr Alex Salmond
sought assurances that prices would not rise in Scotland if the bid were
successful in order to harmonise them with higher prices paid in the
Manweb area.
However, Mr Ian Robinson, who became chief executive of the Scottish
group in March, described the move as a logical step in its strategy for
growing the core electricity business. It is expected to enhance its
earnings per share in the first full year following the acquisition.
Shareholders of Manweb, which operates in North Wales and the
Liverpool area, are offered a mixture of ScottishPower shares and cash
worth 945p a share or a full cash alternative of 915p. The price
represents a premium of 30% over the price at which Manweb shares were
trading last week.
Yesterday, ScottishPower secured a launching platform for its bid by
buying 7,800,000 Manweb shares in the stock market, 7.3% of the total.
Manweb shares closed in the market at 917p, up 187p, while its attacker
shed 7p to 310p.
Mr Salmond said: ''Rather than dabbling in expensive electricity south
of the Border, the priority in Scotland should be developing a
competitive advantage for the Scottish economy which our low-cost
domestic energy base gives us the chance of.'' He feared there might be
a defensive aspect to the move with ScottishPower feeling it had to take
over a company before it itself was taken over.
Labour trade spokesman Mr Brian Wilson said there were concerns for
consumers if electricity companies were building up multi-million pound
war chests either to mount, or defend themselves against, unwelcome
bids, as they would have to be paid for by overcharging customers.
As to whether a Scottish company should be welcomed for attempting to
expand, Mr Wilson said: ''You cannot tailor your approach because it's a
Scottish bid for an English company. The basic question is whether there
should be this huge casino dealing in privatised utilities.
''There should be minimum safeguards for consumers and employees in
any part of Britain which is why a case by case referral to the MMC is
required.''
He warned that a ''totally unwanted free-for-all'' had been created
among the regional electricity firms.
The Scottish Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, Mr Malcolm
Bruce, also calling for an MMC referral, said the implications for
competition and for jobs needed to be examined.
''The electricity industry is an artificial market, created because of
the desire for more competition. There needs to be a clear policy as to
what kind of structure is now being sought for the industry,'' he said.
The bid follows the latest review of English electricity prices by the
regulator, Professor Stephen Littlechild, which was considered not tough
enough to prevent the companies from raising profits.
The English distributors have attracted the interest of predators as a
result of their steady and reliable profitability whatever the state of
the economy. A bid battle in the electricity sector is already raging,
with South Western having rejected an offer from an American utility and
more bids in the sector are forecast.
ScottishPower has long wanted to expand south of the Border and has
had its eye on Manweb for some time as it believes it offers the most
scope for improving profits through cost-cutting and merging certain
functions with its own. Already earmarked for job reductions are
Manweb's head office in Chester and its billing and administration
centres.
The Scottish company's new Cathcart customer service centre will have
the capacity to handle more than just its own customers. ScottishPower's
workforce would not be affected by the takeover.
Mr Robinson claimed Manweb had limited potential. It was a relatively
small company with high operating costs per customer and its domestic
customers currently paid the second highest tariff in the UK. It had
lost market share in the commercial market, which is subject to
competition.
ScottishPower, in contrast, was the lowest cost distributor of
electricity in the UK and it was intended to apply its methods to Manweb
to improve efficiency.
''We are confident that our expertise in best practice and cost
control programmes can be used to run Manweb more efficiently for the
benefit of both shareholders and customers,'' chairman Murray Stuart
said.
The Manweb chief executive, Mr John Roberts, rejected Mr Robinson's
criticisms, saying his company had focused on its core activity and had
cut costs as much as possible. There were 500 job losses last September
and a further 380 in March.
The Chester-based company is said to be similar to ScottishPower's
profile in supplying some major cities while also having many rural
customers. So it is thought to be a good fit.
No attempt was made to discuss the terms with Manweb beforehand.
ScottishPower did have contacts with Manweb recently when it bought five
superstores from it for its electricity retailing operation, which would
benefit from the marketing opportunities offered by a combined customer
base.
Reaction from financial analysts to the bid was mixed, with some
saying it offered full value for Manweb.
A spokesman at the Scottish Office said the bid was entirely a matter
for the companies concerned.

TWO men out hunting foxes late one night in March came ''by sheer
chance'' upon a man attempting to poison himself and two children with
exhaust fumes, the High Court in Aberdeen heard yesterday.
The two had been driving along a forest road when they found their
path blocked by a Ford Capri which pulled in to allow them to pass. As
they drove by, they saw a hosepipe leading from the exhaust through the
vehicle's tailgate.
Yesterday businessman Michael Canale-Parola, 43, was ordered to be
detained in a mental hospital without limit of time when he admitted
poisoning the two children, aged eight and six, to the danger of their
lives.
Canale-Parola had originally been charged with attempted murder but
Advocate-depute Alan Turnbull told Lord Johnston he was prepared to
accept a guilty plea to the reduced charge because medical reports
indicated the accused was of diminished responsibility at the time of
the offence.
The poisoning happened after Canale-Parola had an argument with the
mother of the two children. He drove them to the forest near the A95
Aberdeen-Stonehaven road where they were spotted by the two fox hunters.
On realising the danger, the two men went immediately to a nearby
restaurant, called police and returned to the scene. When they arrived,
the car had disappeared but they searched the area and eventually found
it in the restaurant car park.
Canale-Parola handed over the keys to one of the men before the police
arrived.
There was a smell of exhaust fumes in the car and the two children,
who were in the car, were barely conscious. Canale-Parola was drowsy and
having difficulty concentrating.
He told police: ''I was waiting to die and I was going to do it in my
car.'' Two lengthy, apparent suicide notes were subsequently found in
the car.
The children and Canale-Parola required emergency oxygen en route to
hospital and were later transferred to a special hyperbaric unit for
treatment. All three were discharged the next day.
Dr Andrew Wells, 34, a consultant psychiatrist at the Royal Cornhill
Hospital, said Canale-Parola continued to suffer from mental illness
and, although he was improving with treatment, he required further
treatment.
He believed an order under the Mental Health Act would benefit the
management of his treatment and, in view of the possible danger he posed
to the children, a restriction order would be appropriate.
Lord Johnston ordered that Canale-Parola be detained at the Royal
Cornhill Hospital and imposed a restriction order without limit of time.
