There's a whole range of cruises available to suit every taste says
Patricia Fenn who has advice for those attracted to a holiday at sea.
GETTING the first cruise right can mean lifelong addiction or
aversion. The options multiply yearly. New ships, bigger if not
necessarily better, are launched with unparalleled confidence. The
average passenger age, once said to be ''deceased'', drops steadily (now
47), as the brochures reach the parts that previous sales pitches failed
to reach. The market is the fastest-growing segment of the tourist
industry. But are first-timers in this bewildering proliferation -- more
than 150 ships to choose from -- getting it right? With luck and without
a good deal of help.
There is a handful of good-deed specialist cruise experts in the world
of tour operators (see recommendations) but generally the first contact
between customer and ship is through a High Street agent who has little
or no personal experience of matching the two components. Do not trust
him if only a few choices are offered, persist in believing that there
is a dream cruise with your name on it, ask lots of questions and if the
answers are unsatisfactory look elsewhere. Start with an agent
displaying a PSARA. (Passenger Shipping Association Retail Agent) sign
and you've got a head start.
Type of cruise
You can work out some basic cruising facts for yourself. Predictably
the more expensive and lengthy the cruise, the older will be the
passengers -- money and time to spare. The general descent of the
average age is attributable to the Caribbean fun-runs, some only three
days, some two weeks, where prices are pared to cut-throat level and
hardly anyone aboard has paid the brochure price.
If you can leave the booking until the last minute you'll undoubtedly
get a bargain, but make sure it's one you'll enjoy. Be prepared for
non-stop jollity, non-stop pop, and non-stop consumption of the
hamburger persuasion. Lectures will be concerned with where to buy the
cheapest rum and tax-free jewellery rather than with the region's
culture and economics.
Some of the cruises barely bother to dock at all, finding it more
profitable to keep their customers near the ships' shops, bars, and
casinos. For those who prefer bopping all night to sightseeing all day
they are great value. Bully your agent to get the best deal.
These temptingly discounted Caribbean representatives are for many
people a first introduction to cruising and, for the ill-matched, often
the last. Better by far to invest in a little more and get it right.
Which is more important to you, the ship or the destination? Some
passengers look forward to a different port every day. Don't dismiss
this idea as entirely superficial. The ship will sail at night, allowing
a full day in harbour. With advance planning, you can see a fair bit in
that time, or at least enough to decide whether you do or do not want to
return. Others prefer the days at sea. You would have to be terminally
bored to find nothing to do.
When the hyperactive have exhausted the possibilities of the swimming
pool, gym, deck games and jogging, they can check in their daily
programmes for dancing lessons, ping-pong championships and clay pigeon
shooting. The less hearty can sunbathe, watch videos, use the library,
gamble and profit from the beauty treatments. And of course there is
always eating. Study itineraries meticulously to get the balance right.
Type of ship
Think big, like the new jumbos carrying upwards of 2000 passengers and
on the credit side will be a wider choice of activities, like golf
simulators, tennis courts, spas, Broadway-style shows, glitzier public
rooms. The main debit is the sheer time it takes to get anywhere.
Traversing the length of three football pitches from cabin to pool,
waiting for crowded lifts to scale 12 decks, queueing for tenders ashore
(and the larger the ship the more anchoring-off) can try the patience.
Managing to carry more than 1000 passengers in the height of luxury
and good taste is Crystal Harmony (and sister ship Symphony), which
offers all the amenities of a superb hotel resort, boasting a waterfall
in her atrium, a street of chic boutiques and a choice of restaurants.
You get a butler thrown in, to pour out the free champagne to sip in
your private Jacuzzi. Two thousand passengers can sail in the newly
launched Oriana, the first cruise ship built expressly for the British
market. The joy of sailing out of a British port, free of airport hassle
is a huge bonus.
The Boutique cruisers
You are clearly more likely to get acquainted with your fellow
passengers on a smaller ship. Whether that is a good thing or not I
leave you to decide. At the top end of the scale you can expect
sumptuousness rather than mere luxury. This is where the champagne flows
without let (bottles constantly restocked), or hindrance (no question of
paying for them).
Your stateroom (not cabin please note) will compare well with a top
hotel bedroom, the bathroom will be marble, the bath full-sized if not
double; a Jacuzzi is possible, a balcony increasingly probable. And
anyone who's experienced the satisfaction of reclining in towelling
robe, sipping something fizzy, with personal wall-to-wall scenery
featuring polar bears or desert islands rolling past, will know that
life afloat without a verandah will never be the same again.
The seriously small ships, like Cunard's Sea Goddesses, which carry a
mere 124 pampered guests, aim at the private yacht ambiance, with
Turkish rugs on polished floors and vases of expensive flowers on the
grand piano (black of course -- nothing so vulgar as white).
Do not expect 24-hour entertainment on these upmarket examples. The
reasoning goes that anyone who has accumulated enough dosh to buy a
ticket should be bright enough to amuse himself with only sun, sea,
elegant companions, lobster and Krug for diversion.
Destinations
After the surfeited Caribbean the second most popular destination and
surprise success story is Alaska. Highly to be recommended, but choose
ship and itinerary particularly carefully. Only a limited number of
vessels are allowed into the fragile environment of Glacier Bay. A
sturdy ship like Cunard's Sagafiord, with hull strengthened against the
ice, can penetrate far nearer the glaciers than the flimsy modern
skyscrapers and spends two weeks heading north from Vancouver (fly home
from Anchorage) rather than one week up and one week down.
Appealing new destinations are constantly being projected.
Up-and-coming are Antarctica, Vietnam and the South Pacific. The more
remote and undeveloped the area, the more appreciated becomes your
floating base. There's nothing like the prospect of air-conditioning and
a good dinner hot/sticky, freezing/wet excursion bearable.
If the prospect of visiting Australasia appeals, consider a cruise in
that direction for great value. You can cover most of the high spots
from the coast before deciding where to stay on later. Having travelled
across the world it would be a great pit not to get your money's worth,
so check which lines have the best deals for add-ons. Orient Line's
traditionally styled, refitted, medium-sized Marco Polo specialises in
cruising these waters, with some imaginative Antarctica routes too.
Considerations
Theme cruises are growing in popularity, lines bying to dream up
idiosyncratic variations. Those interested in golf, Scottish dancing,
wine, music, archaeology or bird-watching will benefit from sailing with
like minded enthusiasts. P&amp;O Cruises have a long list of options.
Honeymoon cruises, gay cruises, family cruises, even nudist cruises are
all on the speciality lists, but most ships carry guest lecturers,
invited to discourse on subjects relevant to the cruise, according to
passengers' likely IQ.
Cruises have long been regarded as an agreeable holiday for singles
and some lines are particularly accommodating. Royal Cruise Line were
pioneers in introducing a team of carefully vetted retired ''hosts'',
whose role (unpaid) is to dance with, talk to, help out (but not romance
with) single ladies.
If you feel that modern cruisers look more like floating apartment
blocks than the ship of your dreams, consider a sail cruiser, where the
romance of sail is combined with the latest labour-saving technology.
The sighting of these elegant vessels, like the three four-masted
Windson, whips which include a magical Polynesian island itinerary in
their routes, always invokes a flutter of approval and a clicking of
camera shutters.
Futuristic fanciers get their thrills by choosing a ship that looks
twenty-first century, like the Princess Lines' glitzy Crown, Regal and
Star, designed to look like dolphins; traditionalists will choose a ship
that looks like a ship of which the QE2 is still the best-looker afloat.
How much?

Oriana -- 12 nights to Atlantic Islands: from #1199.
Carnival Line -- eight nights Caribbean from #1159.
Sagafiord -- 12 nights Alaska from #2395.

Newsview: How a mining community rose from the pits to top of the heap
FOR nearly a century, the Midlothian village of Newtongrange was the
jewel in Scotland's coal mining crown.
Hundreds of miners worked the rich seams of the village's pits,
enjoying a quiet pint in the Dean Tavern after enduring eight hours of
darkness, dust and danger underground, before returning to their homes
in Scotland's largest mining village.
In its 1950s heyday, 4000 men worked in the mines in and around
Newtongrange. The village grew from the turn of the century as the coal
industry north of the border thrived.
The spirit which linked the men in their work spread out into the
community among their families in their stone-built cottages, never far
from the thick coal dust darkness that ruled their lives.
Built by the Lothian Coal Company, the owners of the pits until
privatisation after the Second World War, the rows were named from First
Street, to Tenth Street, with a new row being built as the workforce
extended.
For generations, families lived in fear of tyrannical pit bosses who
evicted workers at whim, further uniting the villagers.
Sons followed fathers down the pit to chip away the black gold that
had been mined in Midlothian since the 13th century.
Originally a farm steading in the early 19th century, Newtongrange did
not experience any real growth until the Lady Victoria Colliery, the
village's biggest pit, was established in 1896.
In the 1920s, the village population grew to an estimated 6500,
fuelled by the growing demand for coal.
Until the 1960s, ''Nitten'' was a thriving, bustling community. But a
generation later, it was dying on its feet.
The three-day week and miners' strike of the 1970s, coupled with a
drop in the market following the discovery of oil in the North Sea,
prompted the National Coal Board to tighten its belt, leaving scores of
Victorian mining cottages run down and neglected.
Ultimately, only one pit was left in the village.
By 1981, the closure of ''The Lady'', a symbol for nearly 90 years of
the village's proud heritage, sounded the death knell for mining in
Newtongrange.
By the time the village's biggest and only remaining pit closed, it
employed only 570 men.
A second miners' strike, from 1984 to 1985, posed a new crisis and
brought the impoverished community to its knees.
Reeling from the aftermath and bitterness of the dispute, Newtongrange
10 years ago was a place many were desperate to leave, with many homes
boarded up and rat infested. One prominent local politican suggested the
only solution was to bring in bulldozers and flatten Newtongrange.
But the world did not reckon on the sheer determination of the
villagers.
As ''The Lady'' found new life as a museum to the industry, the proud
community vowed not to be beaten and began a long battle to regain its
former glory.
A decade on, the transformation is complete. The new generation of
Newtongrange is no longer ruled by coal. It has become a commuter-belt
village within easy reach of the large finance and insurance houses in
Edinburgh.
The large engineering plant in nearby Loanhead is another big
employer.
The rows of pit houses have been overhauled and are now part of a
conservation area. A partnership between Midlothian District Council and
Castle Rock Housing Association has seen the cottages revamped and
preserved. More than #1m has been spent on environmental improvements.
Developers have created homes on the site of a former pit bing,
prompting youngsters to stay around to enjoy the rebirth that has taken
a decade to evolve.
From a near all-time low roll in the mid '80s, the local primary
school now boasts an ever-increasing number of pupils, now standing at a
healthy 230. Newtongrange's population is now at a steady 2000.
The village's famous junior football team, Newtongrange Star, also has
a new ground and clubhouse.
Young people have also pledged their future to the village, quelling
fears thatNewtongrange would be left to wither as the years passed.
Twenty-two-year-old Grant O'Connor grew up in Newtongrange and
remained in the village while he studied for his law degree and diploma
at Edinburgh University. He is a member of the village's silver band,
following in dad Dave's footsteps.
Next month he joins the scores of commuters who make the daily trip to
the capital when he takes up a post with an Edinburgh law firm.
''Newtongrange is certainly different these days. There have been a
lot of incomers and a lot of new faces. Most of them are travelling to
work in Edinburgh every day.
''Most of my local friends work in the city because there's virtually
no work in the village and everyone has to travel,'' he said.
Kevin Smith, 23, moved to Newtongrange in 1988, from nearby Mayfield.
He works with Lothian region's street lighting section at Bonnyrigg.
''I wouldn't have lived in Newtongrange 10 years ago. These days it's
been modernised. The housing is better and the swimming pool has been
upgraded. Newtongrange is a lot better and bigger. I'd like to stay
here.''
The village's silver band, formed over a century ago with its roots
firmly in the local pit, is still thriving, according to Mr David
O'Connor.
''We've got about 30 members ageing from 16 to 60 and we're now
supported by the community. We went through a bad spell during the
miners' strike and the closure of the pits, but with a good youth policy
and new houses being built, bringing new people in, we're doing fine.''
Midlothian District Council plans to celebrate the dramatic
turnaround. It is considering a series of suggestions, including plans
for a TV documentary, an exhibition, and a special video to mark the
resurgence of the village.
Mr Jim Green, an English teacher at Newbattle High School in Dalkeith,
has spent most of his life in Newtongrange, and his five grown-up
children all live locally.
He worked for 15 years at the Lady Victoria Colliery and was elected
to Midlothian District Council in 1984.
He said: ''The most significant change over the last 10 years has been
in housing. In Newtongrange at the beginning of the 1980s we had more
than 1000 Coal Board houses. Around 110 of them were boarded up. Many
were rat-infested. The Coal Board was running them down.
''Now nearly all of them have either been rehabilitated while the
council has also embarked on environmental improvements.''
''There is no longer the dereliction and decay there was. It has been
replaced by a spirit of optimism.
''Newtongrange is one of those extraordinary communities, where many
organisations that blossomed and grew up at the beginning of the century
are still here today and this has contributed to the feeling that the
village and its strong community should not die.
''When I first came on to the district council, there was a queue of
people wanting to leave, especially younger people. The trend has been
reversed.''
At the heart of the mining community was its pub, formerly owned and
managed by pit bosses. The Dean Tavern was set up to ensure any workers'
wages spent on alcohol returned to the coffers of their employers.
The pub is now run by an independent trust, which ploughs profits back
into the business.
Mr Willie Yuill ran the bar for 45 years until his retirement last
October and has watched as new life was breathed back into the village.
Originally from Lanarkshire, the 64-year-old described the difference
in a decade in his adopted home.
''Ten years ago it was dying. Now you wouldn't think it was the same
village.
Retired Tommy Laing, 68, was the NUM delegate at ''The Lady'' in the
1970s and has lived in Newtongrange for nearly 40 years.
''The bulk of the change has been in housing, but there has also been
a number of cultural changes. The swimming pool has been revamped, along
with the library. They have brought new life back to the village.''
Like the Lady Victoria Colliery, which has found new life as a
memorial to the industry which was for so long Newtongrange's lifeblood,
the village has also discovered it has a future.

New Zealand 145, Japan 17
NEW Zealand rewrote the record books yesterday when they humiliated
Japan in their final pool C match in Bloemfontein.
The All Blacks' total was both a national and World Cup record,
eclipsing Scotland's 89-0 victory in their opening World Cup match
against Ivory Coast.
Centre Marc Ellis scored a world-record six tries while fly-half Simon
Culhane -- playing in his first international -- broke Scot Gavin
Hastings' world-record points tally of 44 scored against Ivory Coast
with 20 conversions and a try.
Culhane, who ended with 45 points, failed with only one kick at goal.
The lopsided win, in which the All Blacks scored 21 tries, was New
Zealand's third straight pool win. They topped the group and now play
Scotland in the quarter finals.
Wings Jeff Wilson and Eric Rush scored three tries apiece for the All
Blacks, while lock Robin Brooke and full back Glen Osborne got two each.
Centre Alama Ieremia, props Richard Loe and Craig Dowd, and flanker Paul
Handerson also crossed the line.
The New Zealanders, World Cup winners in 1987, simply overwhelmed the
smaller Japanese players with their relentless power and pace. They led
84-3 by half-time and shortly after eclipsed Scotland's total against
Ivory Coast.
The All Blacks also bettered the record for the most tries in one
World Cup match. Their amazing total of 21 easily bettered the previous
record of 13 shared by Scotland and France.
Culhane's 20 conversions shattered the previous mark of 12 conversions
set by New Zealand's Grant Fox.
''He's always been an extremely talented goalkicker and that's one of
the reasons that he is here,'' said All Black coach Laurie Mains.
''But to see him confirm that in a Test match is just superb. I
thought that he played extremely well throughout. He kept the ball
moving well and he served the team rather than himself.''
Culhane said: ''I was nervous and so I was just really happy when the
first couple of kicks went over. And things just went well from there.''
The coach added: ''Our team had a lot of reserve players in who worked
hard during the season for a place in the team.
''Today these players were out to prove themselves and I felt sorry
for Japan for being on the receiving end of these aspiring youngsters.
''The Japanese, however, showed good potential and scored two
beautiful tries.''
''I was proud as punch,'' said stand-in New Zealand captain Henderson.
''It was beyond our wildest dreams. The guys just went out there and
exploded.''
The New Zealanders fell just short of the record win in any rugby
international -- Hong Kong's 164-13 win over Singapore in a World Cup
qualifying match last year.
''This game was won where we needed to boost player-confidence, and as
such it served us well,'' said New Zealand coach Laurie Mains. ''If we
had allowed it to get untidy, it would not have served us well. But we
kept to the game plan and maintained our discipline.''
A small crowd of about 14,000 in the 36,538-capacity Free State
Stadium cheered loudly any time the Japanese made a decisive tackle or
attacking surge -- but such moments were rare.
''We thought we were well prepared and tried our best, but we could
not match their speed or power,'' said Japanese captain Masahiro Kunda.
''It was so different to our other games and their control was so good
we could not compete.''
Japan lost all three of its matches during the tournament but did
score two tries in the second half through flanker Hiroyuki Kajihara.
Fly half Keiji Hirose kicked a penalty and two conversions. Scorers:
New Zealand: Tries -- Marc Ellis (6), Eric Rush (3), Richard Loe,
Robin Brooke (2), Glen Osborne (2), Alama Ieremia, Simon Culhane, Jeff
Wilson (3), Craig Dowd, Paul Henderson; Conversions -- Culhane (20).
Japan: Tries -- Hiroyuki Kajihara (2). Penalties -- Keiji Hirose.
Conversions: Hirose (2).

Scotland 19, France 22
THE blow, when it came, was like a switch-blade through the heart.
Scotland were never behind until the fourth minute of injury time, when
Emile N'Tamack scorched through for the try which epitomised that lethal
streak of French flair which always threatened to be Scotland's undoing.
By the time Thierry Lacroix had steered home the conversion it was all
over bar the crying. The final whistle came as soon as the ball soared
through the uprights and Scotland were left in despair and pondering the
injustice of it all.
For 20 minutes in the opening period the Scots had taken the game and
the French by the scruff of the neck, and it was in that opening
quarter, not in the dying moments, that the game was lost.
Possession and territorial advantage count for nothing if points are
not put on the board and this the Scots failed to do.
Then, late in the second half, when Scotland were 19-15 ahead having
played some rugby which was out of this world, the French were allowed
to come back with wave after wave of attacks on the Scottish line. The
Scots put in a barrage of heroic tackles, but there was always the fear
that, eventually, some Frenchman or other would slip through the net.
In that final five minutes of nerve-racking rugby Scotland needed
someone -- a Dean Richards, say -- who could kill the game stone dead.
They didn't, and they couldn't, and paid a catastrophic price.
But Scotland didn't deserve to lose. The pack played as well as any
Scottish pack has ever done. Profiting from a rock solid performance
from the front five, the back row of Wainwright, Morrison and Peters
were a host unto themselves.
Rob Wainwright has never played a better game in a blue shirt. His
cover-tackling and work-rate around the paddock were awesome, his try
just providing tangible reward for inestimable service to the Scottish
cause.
The back-row trio contributed in spades to the high turnover rate
which made a mockery of the official statistics of one apiece to
Scotland and France.
Bryan Redpath, who on Friday said the game would be the biggest of his
life, played just that -- the biggest game of his life, and then some.
His play was virtually error-free, only a miscued kick from a lineout on
the Scottish 10-yard line coming to mind on the debit side.
Olivier Roumat and the burly Merle shaded the lineout, but Doddie Weir
still took some priceless touchline ball, his second-row partner Damian
Cronin looking by the end as if he was feeling the effects of the marked
lack of rugby since the arm injury sustained during that win over the
Tricolors in Paris back in February.
The Scottish back division was undoubtedly disrupted by the injury to
Graham Shiel. The Melrose centre sufferd a nasty crack on the nose --
cartilage damage being suspected -- and he came off to be replaced by
Ian Jardine after 19 minutes.
Once the flow of blood had been stemmed, Shiel returned to the fray at
half-time, but within six minutes he was off again, for good. With him
gone, the threequarters were bereft of the flair which could have won
the game.
Scott Hastings and Ian Jardine performed with thunderous aggression in
the midfield, Hastings in particular logging at least three try-saving
tackles, but with Shiel in the dressing room, the capacity for invention
and positive action was undoubtedly diminished.
Craig Chalmers had a mixed game, falling short of the tremendous form
he has displayed throughout this season of rejuvenated Scottish
fortunes. However, he has played such a central role in that renaissance
that it would be churlish to say j'accuse.
Wingers Kenny Logan and Craig Joiner were given little opportunity to
sparkle, but both featured in cover defence.
Gavin Hastings missed three penalty goals and by the law of averages
it was ever going to be thus. Would Scotland have won if he had put them
over? That is a question which can never be answered but there is no
doubt that had the kicks flown straight and true then the Scottish cause
would have been aided immeasurably.
Otherwise, the old warrior -- emotionally drained and shell-shocked by
the cruel nature of defeat (shades here of the 1994 Calcutta Cup and the
1991 World Cup semi-final against England) -- was as inspirational as he
has been all season.
It was his devastating touchline run which set up Wainwright's try,
and he did have four successful penalty attempts and a conversion to
take his tournament tally to 89 points in three games. In any other
circumstances than this it would have been a record to applaud. And it
still is.
The bruising nature of the contest was evidenced by the fact that
France lost two men, Benetton and Accoceberry, with broken arms while
Scotland were forced to replace Peter Wright due to bruised ribs and
Shiel with the nose damage.
Scotland began with purposeful intent and rattled the Frenchmen before
Hastings was off-target with his first penalty attempt in 20 minutes,
the ball striking an upright.
For fully half an hour the Scots had the upper-hand and would later
rue the fact that this advantage had not been turned into points.
It was 37 minutes before the first points appeared on the board,
Hastings kicking a penalty.
Lacroix, bald and bearded, levelled with a penalty goal three minutes
later, but within a minute Scotland were back in front with another
Hastings penalty.
Then came a purple patch when Redpath sent Hastings off on a
barnstorming run from the French 10-metre line. Wainwright was at his
shoulder and the flanker brushed aside attempted tackles by N'Tamack and
Deylaud to touch down for the try. Hastings convered and Scotland were
13-3 up at the turn.
Ideally, the Scots should have taken up where they had left off but
the traditional French ability to conjure something from nothing began
to pay dividends and, soon, the Scots found themselves under severe
pressure.
A missed Hastings penalty goal would have provided breathing space for
the Scots but it was the French who put points on the board, a harsh
late-tackle decision against Weir on Hueber allowing Lacroix to make it
13-6.
Lacroix closed the gap to four points five minutes later -- Jardine
this time adjudged to have committed a late tackle, but again it was a
hairline decision -- with another priceless penalty.
Scotland drew away again with another Hastings penalty but France came
back again with another Lacroix penalty, a fine kick from 45-metre
range, only for Scotland to counter with a Hastings penalty.
France continued to look dangerous and four minutes from the end of
regulation time Lacroix kicked France back to within four points with
yet another penalty goal.
Scotland were only seconds away from a quarter-final berth against, as
it turned out, Ireland when France were awarded a free kick. Hueber fed
Benazzi who set up a ruck, allowing Sadourny to send N'Tamack over for
the heartbreaking try in spite of Scott Hastings' last-ditch tackle.
Lacroix steered the ball between the uprights for the conversion and
the look of despairing disbelief on the faces of the Scottish players,
as Wayne Erickson blew for no-side, more than told the whole story.
Scotland did not deserve to lose but France had done just enough to win.

Tonga 29, Ivory Coast 11
TONGA recorded their first victory in a Rugby World Cup match on
Saturday with a 29-11 win over Ivory Coast in their final Pool D match.
But the match was marred by an injury to Ivory Coast winger Max Brito,
who was stretchered off after only two minutes with what turned out to
be a serious neck injury. He was later reported to be paralysed in both
legs and one arm, although the spine was not believed to be broken.
Both teams, neither of whom have qualified for the quarter-finals,
tried to run the ball in what was their final match of the tournament,
but frequent errors and some ill-tempered exchanges prevented the match
from flowing and American referee Don Reardon awarded a string of
penalties as well as warning several players from both sides for rough
play.
Ivory Coast launched three attacks on the Tongan line in the first
half and were unlucky not to put points on the board. Flanker Alfred
Okou was the best of the African forwards, playing a prominent part in a
drive that ended in a line-out 10 metres from the Tongan line after 13
minutes.
Okou gathered the ball at the back of the line but knocked on and an
almost certain try went begging.
The No.7 made amends in the second half when he scored his side's only
try six minutes from time, seizing another opportunity from a line out
on the Tongan line and diving over in the left-hand corner.
The final scoreline flattered Tonga who had most of the possession
during the game but failed to capitalise on it.
Tonga opened the scoring after 10 minutes with a penalty by full back
Sateki Tuipulotu, who scored a total of 17 points including a try.
His try in the second half followed a Tongan drive from the halfway
line during which most of the team handled before lock Pouvalu Latukefu
flung him the final pass in the left corner.
Tonga were awarded a penalty try in the first half and captain Mana
Otai and Latukefu also dotted down.
Three Tongan players received warnings for dirty play during the
match. Tongan flank Feleti Mahoni was the first player sent off during
the tournament, having been dismissed for trampling on an opponents face
during the match against France.
Ivory Coast put plenty of pressure on Tonga during the second half but
had few scoring chances due to a plethora of handling errors and the
failure of support players to arrive at the breakdown in time.

BOLTON striker John McGinlay could become a target for Celtic, with
centre half Tony Mowbray going south in an exchange deal, writes Ken
Gallacher.
McGinlay admits that he will have talks with his manager, Bruce Rioch,
on his return from the Scotland game in the Faroe islands this week, and
former Scotland captain Rioch has never hidden his admiration for the
Parkhead defender who was with him when he was in charge at
Middlesbrough.
The deal would suit both clubs -- Celtic would add another Scot to
their striking force and Bolton would have a player who has experienced
the game at the top level in England.
McGinlay will play a crucial role for Scotland in this week's European
Championship clash.
Manager Craig Brown pointed out: ''John is hot just now because he has
just won promotion with his club in the play-offs. We will be looking to
him to get goals and I am sure he will oblige.''
Says McGinlay: ''I am obviously feeling well pleased with things after
winning that play-off game and I'm sure my mate, Duncan Shearer, will
feel the same.
''The bonus for me is that people can't point the finger any longer
and say that I'm a first division player. Wee Pat Nevin will have to
handle that one on his own!
''This game won't be easy, but what we have to do is get a result. It
is not about anything else here. If we can get past this one with all
its special little problems, then we have three games at home and these
can take us to the finals.
''I believe that we will get there. All the lads do. What I want is to
be a part of all of that. First of all, though, we have to try to win
this one. What we have to do is be really professional. We got a little
bit of stick after the San Marino game, but we won that one and we want
to do the same here.''
McGinlay will play and the only doubt Brown had yesterday was over
Chelsea midfielder Craig Burley, who has a thigh injury which may keep
him out of the action.

PAUL Gascoigne appeared in the Blue Room at Ibrox yesterday and
confirmed that he would be joining Rangers next month.
The England internationalist had flown north on Saturday after
England's victory over Japan at Wembley, and with chairman David Murray
by his side, the midfield player talked of the brave new world he sees
waiting for him in Glasgow.
Gascoigne made it plain that he shares the vision of Murray and
manager Walter Smith of a successful season in Europe once he settles
into the Rangers' team.
Said Gascoigne: ''One of the attractions of coming here was the
opportunity to play in the European Champions' Cup -- although the sheer
size of Rangers as a club was the major thought in my mind.
''I would want to see the club qualifying for the Champions' League,
if not go on to win the cup itself. With the players who are here
already that has to be the aim.
''I have looked around now and sorted out one or two little details
with the chairman and I will sign a three-year contract with the club in
July. I won't be doing it before then for personal reasons, which I
don't want to go into at the moment. But everything has now been
settled.
''I didn't take a lot of persuading, because I know just how massive
this club is. Take a look at that stadium and you know what Rangers are
all about.''
Murray said: ''We have agreed a fee of #4.3m and the talks with Paul's
club, Lazio, were over in a matter of minutes. It took a little longer
when we met Paul's advisers, but now everything has been worked out and
Paul will sign on the dotted line in the first week in July and then
start pre-season training with the remainder of the players.''
Gascoigne looked in peak condition yesterday and he had refreshing
views on appearing in Scottish football for the first time. It won't
bother me at all,'' he grinned. ''If you were born in Gateshead, then
you don't have to worry about where you play the game. In any case, I
think there are times when people downgrade the game in this country.
''I don't think that's right. Celtic are a big club, other clubs are
well-known, and Rangers are just massive.
''The fans have already given me a welcome and I know how passionate
they are. All I want to do is get out there and play football. There are
good players here, lads like Brian Laudrup, and I am looking forward to
teaming up with them and finding even more success for this club.''
That is what manager Smith and chairman Murray want too . . .
especially a run of success in the European Cup. Said Murray: ''We want
to get back to these Champions' League nights we enjoyed three seasons
ago. We all want that.
''We want it for this club, but we also want it for the whole country,
because we want to raise the standard of the game in Scotland.
''Celtic are talking about major signings too, so the Scottish game is
looking healthy -- and we have not finished.''
It now looks certain that Aberdeen defender Stephen Wright will be at
Ibrox next season, and Romanian Florian Raducioiu could also join the
Scottish champions. The Ibrox side have agreed a #2.5m deal with his
Spanish club, Espanol, and Murray hinted yesterday that the deal could
be concluded next week.

THE Scottish management were still waiting to hear last night if their
appeal against eviction from the team-base hotel in Pretoria has been
upheld, writes Derek Douglas.
The Scottish squad has stayed in the Holiday Inn since arrival in
South Africa almost three weeks ago.
However, New Zealand and Ireland are today due to move into the
Scottish hotel, so it seems unlikely that Scotland will be allowed to
remain.
They have been told by the tournament organisers and the South African
Rugby Football Union that they must now vacate the premises and move to
an inferior hotel six blocks away.
Team-manager Duncan Paterson has been protesting the accommodation
schedule since September, and on Friday invoked the official tournament
disputes procedure.
The disputes committee convened yesterday and heard evidence from
Paterson, SARFU, and the Southern Sun hotel chain which is the provider
of official RWC accommodation.
The Scots have learned that rates in their current hotel are 50% more
than the one they have been ordered to move to.
Brian Meek, the SRU media liaison officer, said last night that it was
utterly illogical to reward quarter-final qualifiers by ordering them to
move to a team base which did not have the requisite facilities.
''The hotel we are being told to go to is a business hotel which just
cannot cope with the demands of a 30-plus strong touring party.''
The disputes' committee, which comprised a SARFU representative who is
the son-in-law of SARFU chief Louis Luyt, Welsh president Vernon Pugh,
and Syd Millar, from the IRFU, had still not told the Scots the outcome
of their deliberations six hours after the meeting ended.

A POISED Greg Norman putted brilliantly over the closing holes to
clinch a four-stroke victory at the $1.7m Memorial Tournament in
Columbus, Ohio, yesterday.
Norman, in his first event after a six-week break, made testing putts
at the remaining four holes to end a 14-month drought.
After crucial par-saving putts at the fifteenth and sixteenth, he
birdied the final two holes for a flawless six-under-par 66 on the
saturated Muirfield Village course.
Norman finished at 19-under-par 269 to stamp himself as a favourite
for the US Open in a fortnight's time.
The 40-year-old two-time Open champion collects $306,000 for his
thirteenth victory on the US Tour.
Fellow Australian Steve Elkington (67) and Americans Mark Calcavecchia
(67) and David Duval (68) tied for second place 273.
''When you pick the right tournament and focus in, you can put on your
best performance,'' Norman said after having secured his second Memorial
victory.
Norman took a one-stroke lead into the final round after the
rain-delayed third finally was completed earlier in the day.
After briefly falling behind Calcavecchia, he fought back to open a
two-stroke lead with four holes to play.
The par-5 fifteenth is the easiest hole on the course, but Norman
butchered it. He pulled his drive into the rough, hacked across the
fairway into another poor lie, then threaded his third shot between two
trees and just short of the green.
He chipped to five-feet and sank a testing par putt to stay in front.
Then at the par-three sixteenth, he sank an even longer putt, from 10
feet, for another par.
Those two putts, in retrospect, won Norman the tournament, but he
finished in style with birdies from eight feet at each of the final two
holes.
Nick Faldo, who tied for thirteenth, nine strokes behind after a
four-under 68, was delighted with his ball-striking, although he had
trouble reading the greens.
Faldo's next event is the US Open starting at Shinnecock Hills on
Thursday week. Final scores (U.S. unless stated)
269 -- Greg Norman (Australia) 66, 70, 67, 66.
273 -- Steve Elkington (Australia) 69, 68, 69, 67; Mark Calcavecchia
69, 71, 66, 67; David Duval 70, 71, 64, 68.

Peter Jacobsen 68, 68, 70, 72; Bruce Lietzke 69, 67, 70, 72.
* PAM Wright finished her #400,000 Oldsmobile Classic campaign in
Michigan with a level-par 72 for a final seven-under-par total of 281.
She was seven shots behind American winner Dale Eggeling, who led
throughout and finished at 14-under 274, two strokes ahead of Meg
Mallon, Elaine Crosby, and Swede Annika Sorenstam.
Wright's fellow Scot Kathryn Marshall had a final 72 for 286.
* BRITAIN'S Tony Jacklin shot a par third-round 72 at the #700,000
Bruno's Memorial Classic in Birmingham, Alabama, for a one-under-par
total of 215, 14 shots behind Australia's Graham Marsh, who leads the
field by five strokes.

SCOTLAND might be said to have lost two sporting events in injury time
this weekend. After that agonising defeat against France in the rugby
World Cup, Philip Walton yesterday beat Colin Montgomerie, the holder,
at the second hole of a sudden death play-off to become the first Irish
winner of the Murphys English Open and the #108,330 first prize.
Having started the final round at the Forest of Arden Club tied at 12
under, and playing together for the second successive round, both had
scores of 70 and totals of 274, 14 under par, the same as that with
which Montgomerie won the event 10 months ago -- no mean performance
considering the strength and coolness of a blustery wind.
At the first extra hole, the 210 yard eighteenth, the pattern
developed over the afternoon was continued. Just as he had lipped five
holeable putts, so Montgomerie's chip from a rough cuppy lie spun from
the hole and Walton, whose first putt had been of cricket pitch length,
halved from eight feet using the long handled putter with which he did
not once three putt during the tournament.
Last summer, Montgomerie won the event with a birdie two at the
seventy-second, and his narrow failure to make his first successful
defence of a tournament also was to cost him his first victory of this
season. He could not live with Walton's pitch almost dead for a birdie
four at the 511 yard seventeenth and #72,210 was not much consolation to
one for whom winning is paramount.
Montgomerie, who declared he could be disappointed not to win after he
had taken a three stroke lead with his record second round of 63,
admitted: ''It was my own fault not to win after already being 12 under
for the first two rounds. I felt somehow it was not to be my day and
those missed chances simply confirmed that.''
''But there is nothing wrong with my game,'' added Montgomerie, soon
to be 32 and whose fourth play-off loss in as many attempts this was,
after defeats by Severiano Ballesteros and Sandy Lyle in the Volvo PGA
and Masters tournaments respectively and in last year's US Open.
''But I'm confident approaching this US Open, and after only seven
tournaments I'm leading the Order of Merit again.''
Walton, 33, who lost the 1989 Irish Open in a play-off to Ian Woosnam
before he defeated Bernhard Langer in another to win the 1990 French
title, had been without a victory since then until the Catalonia Open in
April. Two weeks ago he won the Irish Professional Championship and now
this, his third European Tournament. A transformation indeed.
Hoarser than usual from a throat infection, Walton allowed he had
played his best golf for years over these last two rounds. ''If Monty
had made birdie putts at the eleventh and twelfth he would have beaten
me,'' he admitted. ''But somehow they failed to drop and I could see he
was getting frustrated.''
Montgomerie, on the evidence closely presented to him, considered that
Walton, despite having expressed a little mild aversion to the pressures
of the Ryder Cup, would be ''a great asset'' to the European team. After
all, to all intents and purposes this was a match play contest between
strokeplay partners and Walton never backed off.
Of the six other Scots who survived the cut, Dean Robertson achieved
most to promote his cause in his first season on the Tour. On a day when
such a luminary as David Feherty had an 80 to finish last of the 67
players and Gary Orr, having turned in 33, took 40 home, Robertson
returned 66, the lowest score of the round by two strokes, to finish
equal tenth.
Two combat the onset of flu, Robertson on Saturday night dozed himself
with paracetamol and two brandies. Far from feeling any hangover effect,
Robertson opened with a No.9 iron to four feet and in the course of
adding five more birdies did not drop a stroke. With this finish, to add
to three others in the first 10, his primary objective, to retain his
card, seems secure.
Sam Torrance, whose wife is expecting their third child a fortnight
today, gave the baby's head a wetting well in advance with his 68, also
free of loss to the card. His partner Andrew Coltart had a less than
inspired 73, and although Sandy Lyle's 72 might appear nondescript the
score was his sixth of par or better in seven rounds.
(GB and Ireland unless stated)
274 -- P Walton 65, 70, 69, 70; C Montgomerie 69, 63, 72, 70 (Walton
won at 2nd play-off hole. Walton wins #108,330, Montgomerie #72,210).

FRANK Bruno can count on the moral and practical support of Nigel Benn
in his bid to bring the WBC heavyweight title back to Britain.
Millions of television viewers saw Bruno on his feet coaxing and
cheering Benn to victory in his last -- though ill-fated -- defence
against Gerald McClellan.
Now Benn, with the experience of 11 world championship bouts behind
him, is ready to return the favour.
The ''B'' men will share centre stage at Wembley Stadium on July 22
with Bruno challenging Oliver McCall and Benn making the next defence of
his WBC super-middleweight crown in a show which will break the
#20million barrier in purses and overheads.
Wembley is being prepared to house a 65,000 crowd, although Benn has
yet to decide who he will fight.
Benn, who has offered Bruno the chance to join his Tenerife training
camp, said: ''I think I can help Frank enough to bring the title back to
this country.''
Benn has pledged that this will be his last year in boxing and wants
he to sign off with a mega-unification fight against the IBF holder Roy
Jones.
After such a demanding and exhausting battle with McClellan, Benn
could have been excused for taking a longer break from the toughest of
sports.
He finished with a fractured nose and damaged jaw which meant that he
could only drink soup on the day after the explosive fight at the London
Arena in February.
But Benn said: ''I wanted to fight, I am getting bored. I love being
in the ring I feel very comfortable there, when I don't fight I start to
feel aggressive.
''I like the fear element and someone like Roy Jones, a class act and
in my estimation the No 1, will put the fear of God into me.''
Bruno will be returning to Wembley Stadium nine years and three days
after his first trip -- which ended an 11th round stoppage against WBA
champion Tim Witherspoon.
Bruno hired McCall as a sparring partner back in 1987, and he said:
''I know him well, I know him back to front, I know him better than he
knows himself.
''I am stronger, heavier, better balanced, more focused than I was
when I first fought for the title.
''The dream of a world title still drives me on more than anything
else and keeps me going.''
* STIRLING super-featherweight Hugh Collins is not the superstitious
type, so the fact that he faces his thirteenth professional contest at
the St. Andrew's Sporting Club in Glasgow tonight will not weigh on his
mind.
Collins, beaten only once -- on a cut eye decision -- takes on
Nottingham's Wayne Rigby and, although he is not noted as a heavy
puncher, the Scot could well force a stoppage. If not then he is an
overwhelming favourite to win on points.
Three unbeaten young Scots also feature on tonight's bill, including
light middleweight Billy Collins,Hugh's older brother. Billy has won all
five of his professional contests and he should complete a family double
by beating Ernie Loveridge, of Stourport.
At featherweight, Coatbridge's Paul Watson, who has won his first two
paid bouts inside the distance, should again not test the referee's
arithmetic when he faces Colin Innes, of Newcastle, while fellow
townsman Robert Hay, also a feather, meets another Scot, Kirkcaldy's
Gary Burrell.

FORMER Hearts chairman Wallace Mercer last night called for an end to
political infighting at Tynecastle, in favour of the best interests of
the club.
Property magnate Jim Glass began a week of intense interest in Hearts,
by putting forward a takeover proposal that involved an immediate #2m
cash injection for new players.
But Mercer, speaking from his home in the South of France, is
concerned that warnings of his non-existent future involvement, are
stifling much-needed debate.
On Friday, the Hearts Shareholders Association, led by their chairman
Alex Knight, called for the spectre of Mercer's presence to be removed
once and for all.
But the former chairman of the Dunedin Property Group last night tried
to push every interested party down the path of an objective appraisal
of the Glass plan.
''I'm disappointed that the Shareholders Association should produce
such a swift, kneejerk reaction to proposals that are only a week old,''
stressed Mercer.
''There appears to be some politicking going on because I have no
intention of becoming involved in Hearts again, on a day-to-day basis.
''But I do have 25% of the equity in the club, which contrasts, I
think, with the 5% of the 121 members the Shareholders Association
represent.
''I have so far deliberately kept out of the debate so that the Jim
Glass plan can be evenly aired, but others seem determined to involve me
anyway.
''I was delighted that Jim and Chris Robinson have called for the
proposals to be fully considered by the board and that process should be
broadened out.
''Not only should the committee of the Shareholders Association
discuss them, as they did last week, but their complete membership
should also be consulted.
''And of course it is crucial that the Supporters Association, with 55
clubs and around 3000 members, should also be brought into the forum.
''Only when that process is complete should people give a reaction.
''To produce premature statements without the facts, simply
mischievously, muddies the waters.''
Although Glass and Robinson met on Thursday night, the Tynecastle
board has not yet had the opportunity of a full presentation, given the
brief timescale.
With debts of #4m, and a Mercer-approved #1m bank guarantee in place
meantime, the ambitious Glass blueprint is clearly crucial to the club's
future wellbeing.
''My company, Cosmopolitan, holds around a quarter of the shares and
we would call for a full open debate so that everyone can take a final
view,'' added Mercer.
''This is a real crossroads for Hearts. As a major shareholder can I
suggest that personalities be placed to one side and proposals become
paramount.''
If Mercer's wish is observed it's likely that the Bank of Scotland,
who underwrite the club's overdraft, will now become involved in the
discussions.
* ROBERTO Baggio may become the world's most expensive player if he
agrees a #14m transfer to Japan's J League.
A new club, backed by the might of car-makers Toyota and Nissan, have
targeted the unhappy Juventus striker as the first high-profile signing
for next season.
Baggio has been offered #3m to sign a one-year deal which would make
him the highest-paid player in the world.

SO that's the hors d'oevres over with, and it's time to look back over
what I think has been a strange Rugby World Cup tournament so far, with
the gloomy spectres of horrific injury and mindless violence always
there to give you nagging doubts as to our game's place at the table of
world sports.
Even ministers doubt their faith sometimes, you know, and hopefully
that questioning brings you closer to the thing you love.
The referees, I think, have been appalling wimps so far.
''The referees are turning rugby into a game for cissies,'' said Natal
scrum half Robert du Preez.
How on earth they justify all of the meetings, seminars, and
statements that they have and then let bodies lie around the ground so
often is a mystery to me. Mind you, the refs would argue that it's the
players who break the laws.
Violence reared its ugly head in the South African game against the
Canadians. The South Africans do have a macho side to them that oozes
out of players like Kobus Wiese, Joost van der Westhuizen, James Small,
and the man sent from the field on Saturday night, James Dalton. They
also have a drug culture, too, and there are kids of 16 in South Africa
on steroids because of the body beautiful culture.
I just hope that the authorities stick to their guns and ensure that
nobody now gets let off the hook after what was a disgraceful brawl.
Players will always tend to violence, and administrators have to
realise that it is the strength with which they deal with these offences
that determines whether they happen often or seldom.
Dalton may or may not have been the only guilty party, or he might not
have been guilty at all, but he must now be banned from the rest of the
tournament.
But perhaps the most depressing thing about the whole tournament so
far is that no-one is playing earth moving rugby.
Some games are exciting, and I will never forget the opening day as
long as I live, Western Samoa have been a revelation, France have had
the odd moment of Gallic flair, and I've enjoyed the Canadians, but
apart from that it has all been the same.
Can you imagine it? What has struck me is that almost every country is
now playing the same style of rugby, whether it's New Zealand, England,
Ireland or even Japan. There seem to be a set of rules now for winning
rugby that mean that you take the ball a couple of times through the
forwards first, then hoist the ball, and then spread it after trying to
make some ground midfield. I have been staggered to see even teams like
Ivory Coast trying to play stereotype rugby.
Perhaps the New Zealanders have been a bit special, in that they do
things designed to win but can make them look menacing and almost artful
-- well to me it looks that way -- but some of the other teams, like
England, for instance, have ''played to a pattern.''
I remember Jim Telfer telling me once that the SRU have miles of video
tape on England and that you now know exactly what England will do in
set situations -- it's just figuring out why that's the difficult bit.
Anyway, the real stuff gets under way soon, and some of the teams will
have tried not to give too much away. That was the look back, it's now
time to look ahead to the rest of the competition and dribble in
anticipation.

IT WAS black Sunday for the big names at the French Open yesterday,
with Boris Becker, Jim Courier, and Mary Pierce all crashing out of a
tournament which is rapidly becoming a graveyard for the seeded players.
Becker's loss to Romanian qualifier Adrian Voinea, the defeat of
American Courier by unfancied Spaniard Alberto Costa, and Pierce's tame
surrender to Croatia's Iva Majoli were stunning results.
Becker, already two sets down to world No.128 Voinea before rain held
the match over to yesterday, was finished off by Voinea without ever
showing his best.
The German world No.3 complained about the way organisers had forced
him to play in poor conditions but had to accept a 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 7-5
defeat in the only grand slam event which he has not won.
''We got out. It was dark. The court was completely wet. The balls
were brown after five minutes. They just don't care about the players,
you know,'' he said of the decision to start the match after a rain
interval.
Courier, seeded only No.13 but the champion in 1991 and 1992, made too
many errors in his 6-4, 1-6, 7-6, 6-4 reverse to the 19-year-old Costa,
who had gone out in the first round of his three previous grand slam
tournaments.
For the crowd, the biggest disappointment of all was third seed
Pierce's abject 6-2, 6-3 defeat at the hands of twelfth-seeded Majoli on
centre court, ending all home interest in the men's and women's singles.
Like Becker, Pierce had her excuses ready, blaming a thigh injury
which had not been too obvious on court.
''I don't like to make excuses when I lose, but the injury did not
help,'' she said. ''I felt pain when I served and pain when I was
running wide. It was kind of tough.''
An elated Majoli, dubbed the most impressive newcomer on the circuit
in 1993, said: ''It's the third time I play the French Open and I always
lost in the fourth round here. I told myself the third time would be the
right one.''
Meanwhile, top seed Andre Agassi and defending champion Sergi Bruguera
both marched through to the quarter-finals, while Thomas Muster, the
form man of the moment on clay, had a sensational victory.
The fifth-seeded Austrian extended his unbeaten run on the surface to
32 matches with an astounding 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 win over Ukrainian clay
expert Andrei Medvedev.
An unhappy Medvedev blamed a hand injury picked up in his previous win
over last year's finalist Alberto Berasategui of Spain.
Agassi, who is on course to complete a full collection of grand-slam
titles, is having the most comfortable of rides through the draw and was
untroubled as he downed Moroccan qualifier Younes El Aynaoui 6-4, 6-2,
6-2 to set up a last-eight match with Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov. The
Russian, seeded ninth, beat Spain's Alex Corretja 6-3, 6-2, 6-2.
At the end of a first week which has left only four of the top eight
seeds in both the men's and women's draw, many believe that this year's
winners could come from Spain.
Apart from Bruguera, last year's women's champion Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario moved smoothly into the last eight, along with fellow-Catalan
Conchita Martinez.
Bruguera, bidding for a third successive French title, eased past New
Zealander Brett Steven 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 in a match which had been halted by
rain.
And it took fourth seed Martinez only 38 minutes to dismiss Adriana
Serra-Zanetti of Italy 6-0, 6-1.
Sanchez Vicario, the title-holder, made it to the quarter-finals at
the expense of Israel's Anna Smashnova 6-4, 6-0.
American Chanda Rubin, who stopped fifth seed Jana Novotna in the
previous round, beat Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-2, 1-6, 6-2, while
Argentina's Gabriela Sabatini crushed another Japanese, Kyoko Nagatsuka,
6-3, 6-0.

A GOAL by striker Marco Delvecchio in the last minute gave Inter-Milan
a 2-1 win over Padova yesterday and a passport to Europe.
The victory ensured Inter of sixth place in the table and
qualification for the UEFA Cup, but it was a cruel blow for Padova, who
now face a relegation play-off against Genoa.
To make matters worse, they had striker Giuseppe Galderisi dismissed
for dissent in injury time.
Padova took the lead after 20 minutes when winger Filippo Maniero sent
a diving header past keeper Gianluca Pagliuca. Inter, without Dutchmen
Dennis Bergkamp and Wim Jonk who are away on international duty,
levelled in the sixty-fifth minute when a shot from midfielder Pierluigi
Orlandini squeezed past keeper Adriano Bonaiuti.
Champions Juventus finished the season in style, beating Cagliari 3-1
with goals from Alessandro Del Piero, Gianluca Vialli, and Fabrizio
Ravanelli.
AC Milan, champions for the last three years, finished fourth after
ending the season with a 2-1 win over Fiorentina.
* REAL Madrid clinched their first Spanish league title for five years
when they beat Deportivo Coruna 2-1 in the Santiago Bernabeu stadium on
Saturday.
Goals by Jose Amavisca in the first half and Chilean striker Ivan
Zamorano five minutes from time were enough to halt arch-rivals
Barcelona's run of league titles at four and bring the men in the famous
all-white strip the twenty-sixth championship of their history.
The victory gave Madrid 53 points and hoisted them six clear of
Deportivo with two games left.
The Madrid triumph was put in doubt early in the second half when
Deportivo's Brazilian striker, Bebeto, levelled the scores with a fierce
right-foot shot. But Zamarano settled the issue. Results:
European Championship. Group 6 -- Portugal 3, Latvia 2; Liechtenstein
0, Republic of Ireland 0.
Umbro Cup -- England 2 (Anderton, Platt pen.), Japan 1 (Ihara); Brazil
1 (Edmundo), Sweden 0.
Spain -- Real Madrid 2, Deportivo Coruna 1; Espanol 5, Valencia 0.
Italy -- Bari 1, Sampdoria 2; Cremonese 2, Roma 5; Fiorentina 1, AC
Milan 2; Genoa 1, Torino 0; Inter 2, Padova 1; Juventus 3, Cagliari 1;

THE International Boxing Federation on Saturday ordered heavyweight
champion George Foreman to fight a rematch against Germany's Axel Schulz
within 120 days or forfeit his IBF title.
Foreman won a controversial majority decision over Schulz in a title
defence in Las Vegas on April 22. Many ringside observers at the time
felt the German had won the fight against the 46-year-old Foreman.
Promoter Bob Arum suggested a Foreman-Schulz rematch would be held in
Germany and predicted that Foreman could make close to $20m for the
bout.

JOHN Whitaker jumped the only double clear with Nations Cup newcomer
Welham to lead Britain to a resounding team win at Hickstead yesterday.
The 39-year-old Whitaker was well supported Geoff Billington and
William Funnell -- both making their Nations Cup home debuts -- as
Britain, with a 12-faults total, finished 20 ahead of the United States.
Emma Jane Mac, the other member of the starting quartet, had a
two-round disaster with the lively Diamond and was the discard each
time.
Whitaker clinched victory in style, going clear effortlessly with a
13-year-old he was partnering in a Nations Cup for the first time.
Billington, from Cheshire, who was getting his first home chance after
around 20 appearances abroad, had just one fence down each time on It's
Otto. Funnell, from Surrey, started with a clear on Comex and hit only
the second obstacle going again.
Team manager Ronnie Massarella, who had been faced with selection
problems when Michael Whitaker dropped out with a lame Elton, said:
''We've not only won convincingly, but shown we have quite a number of
horses with real potential for the European Championships in
September.''
John Whitaker began the day by winning the ENZA Royal Gala
fault-and-out on Roddy's Revenge -- his only individual win of the
four-day show.
Braeburn British Nations Cup: 1, Great Britain, 12 faults (It's Otto,
G Billington, 4-4; Comex, W Funnell, 0-4; Diamond, E-J Mac, 24-ret;
Welham, J Whitaker, 0-0); 2, USA 32; 3, Holland 40; 4, France 44; 5,
Germany 48; 6, Ireland 52.
Royal Gala fault-and-out: 1, Roddy's Revenge (J Whitaker) 65.01sec; 2,

TONY Rominger became one of the oldest and fastest winners of the Giro
d'Italia, which ended in Milan yesterday.
The Swiss rider crossed the line at the Parco Sempione in the pink
leader's jersey which he had worn since the second day of a 22-day race
he described as ''too dangerous.''
Rominger, 34, claimed that there was not enough emphasis on the
riders' safety, particularly when they had to go through unlit road
tunnels.
He beat last year's winner, Russian Evgeny Berzin, by four minutes 13
seconds with Berzin's Latvian team-mate, Piotr Ugrumov third, after more
than 2375 miles.
Yesterday's stage was won by Italian Giovanni Lombardi from
compatriots Mario Manzoni and Silvio Martinello. It was Italy's tenth
stage win.
Rominger gave Switzerland their third victory in 78 Giros and first
for 41 years. His average speed of 23.9mph was the fastest since Italy's
Francesco Moser won 11 years ago with 24.1mph.
He said: ''I had only one difficult day. I suffered a reaction from
some antibiotics which I'd taken to clear a bout of bronchitis. My
condition now could not be better, and I have to keep this level of form
for next month's Tour de France.
''I don't know if Miguel Indurain is in the same shape as he was when
he won his fourth Tour last year. If so, he will take some beating.''
Results:
Final stage: 1, G Lombardi 3hr 32min 53sec; 2, M Manzoni; 3, S
Martinello; 4, R Pelliconi; 5, G Citterio; 6, G Fidanza (all Italy); 7,
A Kappes (Germany); 8, R Pagnin (Italy); 9, B Hamburger (Denmark); 10, B
Thibout (France), all same time.
Final overall standings: 1, T Rominger (Switzerland) 97hr 39min 50sec;
2, E Berzin (Russia) 4min 13sec behind; 3, P Ugrumov (Latvia) 4-55; 4, C
Chiappucci (Italy) 9-23; 5, O Rincon (Colombia) 10-03.

HOLDERS Linlithgowshire got back to winning ways following last week's
defeat from Edinburgh and Leith when they battled to a 112-108 win over
East Lothian in Saturday's CIS Insurance Counties championship East
Section clash.
That victory lifts Linlithgowshire into third place on the table, two
points behind Edinburgh and Leith and second-placed Borders.
The capital city side stayed out in front on shots aggregate after a

Stonehaven. All six Aberdeen and Kincardine rinks finished in front.
Northern Counties kept in touch in second place when they returned
from Lochee with a 122-102 win over Angus.
Lanarkshire South also kept intact their two-point lead in the South
Section beating Dumfriesshire 118-105 at Gretna while Ayrshire stayed in
second spot after a battling 120-113 win over Dunbartonshire East at
Cumbernauld.
Lanarkshire West took full advantage of leaders Dunbartonshire West's

THE David Lloyd Club took a step closer to retaining the men's
Scottish inter-club cup they won at their first attempt last year when
they edged past 1988 champions Cults in Saturday's quarter-finals.
The Renfrew side, led by Ross Matheson in their first-round win over
last year's runners-up, Stirling University, were without the Scottish
No.1 for the trip to Aberdeen and found themselves locked at 3-3 after
the second round.
Former national champion Donald Watt and Martin Kilday established a
4-3 lead for the David Lloyd Club when they survived four set points on
their way to a 7-6, 6-4 win over Stewart Reid and Neil Rayner before the
winning rubber was clinched by Blane Dodds and Jimmy Wood.
The champions now face Giffnock, who completed a rain-delayed 6-0
victory over Inverness yesterday, while Broomhill, winners 14 times
between 1979 and 1993, trounced Waverley 6-0 to set up a clash with
Newlands, who defeated Broughty Ferry by the same margin.
Dunfermline women, bidding for an eighth successive women's crown,
wasted little time in overcoming Peebles 6-0 and will meet Waverley, 5-4
victors over an under-strength Newlands in the last four on June 18.
Former Scottish No.1 Karen Ross led 1986 champions Cults to a 6-0 win
over Dyvours to earn a tilt at Western, who beat Whitecraigs 5-1.
Results:
Men -- Broughty Ferry 0, Newlands 6; Broomhill 6, Waverley 0;
Inverness 0, Giffnock 6; Cults 3, David Lloyd Club 5.
Women -- Dunfermline 6, Peebles 0; Newlands 4, Waverley 5; Western 5,
Whitecraigs 1; Cults 6, Dyvours 0.

IAN Law, of the new Lake of Menteith club, had a successful day at the
St Andrew Regatta, held at Strathclyde Park on Saturday.
He beat Douglas MacFarlane, of Clydesdale, to take the Veteran A
sculls event before going on to land a double by winning the open
singles sculls event over the full 2000 metres course later in the
afternoon.
A women's squad from Thames Tradesmen made their long trip from London
worthwhile by taking three events -- women's restricted eights, double
sculls, and pairs, while the hosts also had a handful of wins, including
men's open fours and veteran fours.
Commonwealth team members Krystna Krassowska (Edinburgh University)
and Glasgow University's Katherine Lee won the open pairs event ahead of
the Clyde/Glasgow University composite of Catriona Maccallum and Claire
McIntosh with what eventually became a comfortable win after a
hard-fought battle in which the crews raced together virtually level for
most of the length of the course.

RECENT rain has eased the ground at Epsom where the Derby will be run
on Saturday.
Going at the track is officially good, despite a controversial
programme of watering -- which contributed to Celtic Swing's switch to
run in the French Derby.
''We have had a lot of rain -- getting on for half an inch over the
weekend -- and the ground is now good,'' said clerk of the course course
Andrew Cooper.
''There is a mixed forecast for this week with the possibility of
showers.''
Cooper is encouraged by the way ticket sales have been going for the
three-day meeting, which includes racing on a Sunday for the first time.
* JIMMY Quinn will partner Sonic Boy in Friday's Diomed Stakes at
Epsom. He was replaced by Pat Eddery at York last month, but Quinn was
back on board when Sonic Boy won by six lengths at Haydock a week later.

IT'S a far cry from the splendour of the French Derby meeting at
Chantilly to racing at Hamilton Park on a Monday afternoon, but such is
life for a top jockey in the quest for winners.
Kevin Darley, his back probably still sore after all the slaps he
received after Celtic Swing yesterday, today makes for deepest
Lanarkshire, and the popular rider should not return south empty handed.
Darley partners Satellite Star in the conditions race (3.0), and
against rivals who do not appear to be much, can take the race at a nice
price.
Scottish trainer Donal Nolan appears to have found another opportunity
for his Lord Advocate in the last.
Caught close home last time out, the expected ease in ground
conditions should suit Lord Advocate, who could be followed home by
Arian Spirit.
Wentbridge Lad appears to have been struck down by a touch of
seconditis, but opposed a moderate-looking lot in the opener, should get
backers off and running.

CELTIC Swing silenced his critics at Chantilly yesterday to capture
the Prix du Jockey-Club.
The colt justified the decision to miss Epsom classic as he clinched
only the third British triumph in the history of the big French.
Attacked by some for turning his back on a re-match with 2000 Guineas
conqueror Pennekamp in the Derby on Saturday, owner Peter Savill let his
horse do the talking.
Celtic Swing, touted as another Nijinsky in some quarters, did not let
him down with a courageous, if not spectacular, display.
Well placed throughout the race by French Derby debutant Kevin Darley,
he was sent to the front two-and-a-half-furlongs out and stayed on right
to the line.
Poliglote finished second with Winged Love third, with two other
British challengers, Classic Cliche and Flemensfirth, fourth and fifth.
For Savill, who had talked of a Triple Crown challenge last year only
to go back on his original plans, victory was a relief. ''I'm
ecstatic,'' he said. ''It is a fantastic thrill. Those are the longest
three furlongs I can remember. In the last hundred yards I was not
worried, I was petrified.
''Kevin rode a beautiful race and gave him a great ride to keep him in
front. This horse is very lazy. Kevin looked all out but he knew exactly
what was going on.
''This vindicates our decision to run here. We've won the French Derby
but I'm not going to second guess whether he would have won at Epsom.
''I was upset by some of the comments in the press but the track and
going here suited him and it was in the best interests of the horse to
come here.''
A tilt at the Epsom classic, for which Pennekamp has hardened to 5-4
favourite, is unlikely though Savill would not rule it out.
''I just want to enjoy today. I don't like making supposition and what
ifs but the Irish Derby is definitely on the agenda,'' he added.
The intermittent showers that fell during the afternoon produced
ground on the soft side of good, on which connections were able to
witness the real Celtic Swing.
For it later emerged that the build-up to the big race had not gone to
plan with Celtic Swing failing to sparkle in a secret gallop at Ian
Balding's Kingsclere base 10 days ago.

PETER Savill, owner of Celtic Swing, unveiled another talented
discovery at Ayr on Saturday when Zalotti trotted up on her racecourse
debut.
She led after the first furlong and was never headed, Kevin Darley
driving the filly home clear of Sheikh Mohammed's Mask Flower in the
maiden race.
Celtic Swing made his racecourse debut at Ayr in July, devastating the
field in another maiden event to win by four lengths.
Savill, who bred Zalottti, sent her to the sales as a yearling and
bought her back for 17,000 guineas. Her next appearance will be at Royal
Ascot, where she will run in either the Queen Mary or Windsor Castle
Stakes.
Kevin Darley was in good form at Ayr, completing a 24-1 double when he
brought Rich Glow with a nice late run to snatch victory in the last
strides of the Kilwinning Handicap Stakes.
He might have had a treble but for Flyaway Blues's reluctance to leave
the stalls in the last. The favourite made up a lot of ground but could
not catch Nordic Breeze, the subject of a gamble.
What's The Verdict made all in the claimer. Mark Johnston praised
jockey Peter Robinson for the way he kept the head-strong three-year-old
under control. ''He made the most difficult horse in my yard look
easy.''
Apprentice Robert Havlin, born in Saltcoats, returned north home from
his Marlborough base to ride a winner for Peter Chapple-Hyam, bringing
Silvicolous home by four lengths.

AILEEN McGillivray, the Scottish champion, produced the class
performance yesterday at Greenock, winning the 100 metres for East of
Scotland in the women's inter-district match with a time of 11.62sec --
faster than any legal time she recorded last year, writes Doug Gillon.
But that, and a sterling relay leg, could not prevent West taking the
trophy overall. And unfortunately, as there were no batteries for the
wind guage at the Ravenscraig stadium, staging its first representative
match, the real merit of her 100m will remain a mystery.
Several under-20 competitors surpassed the performances of the senior
winners, reaffirming the view that the future of the sport is less bleak
than the Jonahs would have us believe.
Among those to do so was Sinead Dudgeon, in the 200m, Lisa Brown, who
cleared 1.75m in the high jump and also won the under-20 long jump, and
national schools team captain Kristina Gormley who sprinted home in the
1500m just ahead of national age-group cross-country champion Sheila
Fairweather -- both juniors beating the seniors.
Helen McCreadie, just 20, set a championship record of 44.14m to win
the hammer, and 18-year-old Pamela Anderson broke the triple-jump
championship mark with 11.68m. That moved her to third on the senior
all-time list -- but that missing wind guage robbed her of a Scottish
under-20 record. Senior (bold type) and under-20 winners.

SCOTLAND'S leading two men's clubs, Edinburgh Southern Harriers and
Edinburgh Athletic Club, face compelling arguments for amalgamation
after a weekend which saw both remain firmly anchored at the bottom of
their respective divisions of the Guardian Insurance British Athletics
League.
Southern were second-last in their division-two match at Meadowbank,
while EAC were last in division four at Wakefield.
Recent talks between the clubs have focused on both a merger and
ambitious development plans with the assistance of Edinburgh District
Council.
Faced with relegation to the third and fifth divisions, negotiators
believe amalgamation could be concluded by the end of the year. This
would allow the new club to take Southern's place in GIBAL next summer.
Southern athletes have already unanimously voted in favour, while the
EAC executive will discuss merger proposals tomorrow.
Twenty years ago both clubs were a UK force -- and a merger was as
improbable as a Rangers-Celtic marriage. In 1976, Southern were second
in division one, while in 1980 EAC were fourth -- the highest placings
by either of Scotland's only two representatives in the five-division UK
league.
But since the league's inception in 1969, the two clubs have spent
only 14 years between them (11 by ESH) in the top flight, illustrating
both the intensity of competition and yo-yo years of struggle.
Southern's treasurer, Ian McKenzie, a member of the negotiating team,
believes amalgamation is the only viable future for the sport in the
capital. ''Without it, we are doomed,'' he says. ''If we fall into the
lower divisions, the best athletes from both clubs will join English
teams to get higher-quality competition.''
His views are echoed by EAC counterpart Ian Cunningham, who confirmed
yesterday his personal belief that a merger should go ahead, though this
has yet to put to the membership.
The initiative is complicated by the success of the Southern women's
club, Woollen Mill, which continues to enjoy separate sponsorship and
whose athletes will certainly vote to stay independent.
''But all our male athletes are in favour of a merger,'' confirms
McKenzie.
On Saturday, on home territory, Southern could manage just one A
string success -- Ian Steele (steeplechase, 9-26.13). James Gilbert
(long jump, 6.62m) and George Mathison (steeplechase, 9-43.50) were
their only B winners. It was Mathison's final race -- the fifty-third UK
league appearance for the 33-year-old Scottish internationalist and his
128th steeplechase in 15 years.
Even the emergence from retirement of Elliot Bunney, though only in
the relay -- the event in which he won Olympic silver -- could not stem
the flood of points, though Bunney showed his departure to be premature
with a fine opening leg.
European and Commonwealth silver medallist Steve Smith, back in action
thanks to successful treatment by Liz McColgan's physio in the USA, set
a division record in the high jump (2.16m) and took second in the long
jump (7.03m), while Neil Buckfield cleared 5.45m, a division pole-vault
best.
The case for capital amalgamation was advanced by individual EAC
performances at Wakefield. Though his club placed last, Darren Ritchie
won the Man of the Match award for his winning long jump of 7.46m. Steph
Hayward won the A shot and took second in the A discus (14.31/44.38m),
Neil Elliot won the B shot and discus (13.26/39.52m), and Alan Murray
the B 400m (49.5sec). The net effect of the points gained for these
performances, had they been achieved for Southern, would have seen them
finish a clear third.
Ritchie's was the second-best legal effort by a Briton this year,
catapulting the 20-year-old Fifer to joint-seventh on the Scottish
all-time list. Meadowbank A string winners and leading ESH placings:
100 metres: P Maitland (Swansea) 10.42sec; 4, J Henderson 10.79 (wind

Brazil 1, Sweden 0
WORLD champions Brazil produced a scintillating display yesterday at
Villa Park against Sweden to put a bleak perspective on England's Umbro
Cup flop against Japan just 24 hours earlier.
Wonderboy Ronaldo, the predatory Edmundo, the surgical Dunga, and
mighty midget Juninho delivered the perfect, joyful antidote to the
Wembley woes. But how one fears for Terry Venables' men when they bring
down the curtain on this four-cornered tournament against Mario Zagalo's
side next Sunday.
Brazil had only four survivors from the team which lifted the World
Cup in Los Angeles a year ago -- no Romario, Bebeto, Branco, or Taffarel
-- but, if anything, they are now more vibrant than ever.
Dunga's immaculate delivery and Edmundo's sublime flick off his heel
gave Juninho the chance to launch the victory after only three minutes.
But goalkeeper Bengt Andersson, whose debut delays Thomas Ravelli's
126th appearance to break Peter Shilton's record until Thursday's game
against England at Leeds, stood up well and saved.
Then, after 43 minutes, came the move that brought Villa Park to its
feet.
Dunga threaded a great ball on for Zinho, who delivered it to the feet
of Roberto Carlos angling in from the left.
By the time he slipped it across Andersson, the Swedish defence had
melted and Edmundo had a simple right foot tap-in for his third goal for
his country.
Jorghino looped a left-footer over the bar, and then an intricate
passing maze produced another chance that was blocked as Brazil dropped
a gear in the second-half.
Ronaldo evoked the Maracana with a swerving, dipping 20-yard shot that
dropped over the Swedish bar.
The snarl beneath the samba smile bared itself when Dahlin caught
Cesar Sampaio late and low after 77 minutes, incurring the
shirt-grabbing rage of Aldair, who completely lost control and was
booked as his team-mate was stretchered off.
* TERRY Venables must be beginning to understand the unique pressure
his predecessor Graham Taylor had to work under, as press and public
cool towards yet another well-meaning England coach.
He may be unbeaten in eight completed games, but Venables is
struggling to convince even his close supporters that performances like
Saturday's are positive steps along the road to European Championship
glory in 12 months' time.
Only a typical rescue act from skipper David Platt, converting an
eighty-eighth minute penalty his determination helped earn, secured the
2-1 win which keeps England's Umbro Cup hopes alive before the much
sterner challenge of Sweden and Brazil.

PAUL Ince yesterday insisted that he will only join Inter-Milan if
Manchester United want to sell him.
The England midfield player, a #7m target for the Italian giants,
wants to stay at Old Trafford rather than try his luck on the Continent.
United manager Alex Ferguson, however, is keen to strengthen his squad
after failing to land a major trophy this season and has been told he
must sell to raise funds for new players.
But Ince is quoted in yesterday's national newspapers as saying: ''I
love United and I expect to start next season with them and help them
win back the championship.
''All I know about Inter-Milan's reported interest is what I have read
in the papers -- it is up to the chairman and manager and they are still
away on holiday.''
United have scheduled a board meeting for tomorrow and both Ferguson
and chairman Martin Edwards are expected to cut short their trips abroad
to attend and discuss Ince's situation.
Inter president Massimo Moratti, the ninth richest man in Italy, has
made no secret of his admiration for Ince, describing him as ''the new
Frank Rijkaard.''
If United accept Inter's offer, they are expected to make a #4m bid
for Leicester's highly rated midfield player Mark Draper.
* WARREN Barton is poised for a #4.5m transfer to Newcastle -- making
him Britain's costliest defender.
Newspaper reports yesterday claim that the Wimbledon and England
player is flying to the north-east for talks with St James' Park manager
Kevin Keegan and is expected to sign today.
''I'm delighted that everything has all been sorted out and that the
deal is going through,'' Barton is quoted as saying. ''I just have to
iron out a few details over the weekend.''
Former Wimbledon team-mate John Scales' #3.5m transfer to Liverpool
was the previous transfer record for a defender, but Newcastle were
happy to smash that with #6m to spend from Andy Cole's sale last season.
Wimbledon's owner Sam Hammam, who had been trying to persuade the
defender to stay with the unfashionable Dons, admitted: ''Obviously, we
are very sad to lose Warren but the move will be a magical one for him
and we wish him luck.
''We are proud he has come so far with Wimbledon and we know he can go
even further.''
Barton will earn Wimbledon another #750,000 if he goes on to make an
agreed number of appearances or helps Newcastle land some silverware and
manager Joe Kinnear said: ''It's a wonderful deal for the club.
''We have smashed the transfer record for a defender again, just as we
did with Keith Curle, Terry Phelan, and John Scales.''
* CONTROVERSIAL Southampton goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar is among 10
players facing disciplinary action by the Zimbabwe Football Association
for refusing to play in a crucial African Nations Cup qualifier
yesterday in Zaire.
The players, mostly overseas-based, were branded ''mercenaries'' by
ZIFA chairman Leo Mugabe after saying they would not travel to Kinshasa
because of fears over the deadly Ebola virus in Zaire.
Grobbelaar, under investigation by police over match-rigging
allegations, told the association on arrival from England on Friday that
he would not go to Kinshasa on advice from British medical authorities.
Turkish-based Norman Mapeza said he would jeopardise his contract with
his club if he went to Zaire.
Assurances from World Health Organisation officials in Harare and the
health ministry that they were in no danger of contracting the virus
failed to change their minds.

Toulon
SCOTLAND must be prepared for a battle against Mexico tonight as when
they launch their bid to win the Toulon under-21 international
tournament.
Team manager Tommy Craig will warn his players to expect a night of
provocation and violence against the fiery South Americans.
He insisted last night as the buoyant Scottish party jetted into the
millionaire's playground in the South of France: ''Mexico have shown in
the past that they can be a volatile outfit.
''They had three players sent off against England here before when
their temperament snapped.
''We cannot afford to get caught up in such a situation. We are very
proud and very conscious of our disciplinary record and the players must
handle anything that's thrown at them.
''While we are aiming to win this event, it is very much a learning
process for the players.
''I will be stressing to them just how important it is to deal with
any problems which emerge.
''We are here to play attacking, entertaining football and advance our
preparations for the European Championships. Nothing must deflect from
that purpose.''
Scotland are optimistic about winning this prestigious event for the
first time despite the quality of opposition which includes France,
Brazil, and England.
Craig underlined the prevailing mood of confidence when he added:
''The core of our team is vastly experienced. Most of the lads have been
together for a couple of years and are ready to fulfil their undoubted
potential.
''Keeper Derek Stillie is highly regarded at Aberdeen, Steven Pressley
and Christian Dailly have been a highly effective pairing in defence,
David Hannah is the ball-winner in midfield, and Stevie Crawford has
been a prolific scorer for Raith Rovers this season.
''The team is very strong and the experienced players will be able to
help out the newcomers, such as Stephen Glass and Duncan Jupp.
''Really, though, the key to our success is Brian McLaughlin. He is a
natural winger and, having worked with him at Parkhead, I know what a
contribution he can make. He is a player who can relieve pressure on our
defence and inflict damage on the opposition.
''I want him to be positive in everything he does and get behind and
hurt defences. He certainly has the capacity to fill this demanding
role.
''Despite the quality of the teams here, I believe that at our best we
can go all the way.
''But the first step is to reach the semi-finals then the rest will
take care of itself. However, it is vital to our ambitions that we make
the right start against the Mexicans no matter what happens.''
Meanwhile, Christian Dailly could not care less about creating a world
record tonight if Scotland do not account for Mexico to launch their
challenge for the Toulon tournament.
The versatile Dundee United youngster will become the first player in
the history of the game to win 25 caps at under-21 level when he lines
up against the South Americans.
There will be a special award from the SFA to mark the occasion but
Dailly revealed last night: ''I don't feel as if this is a personal
achievement.
''I suppose when my career is over I'll look back with pride. It will
be nice to have the record because I feel as if I have been part of the
team for years.
''Our strength is our team spirit. It is more like a club and better
than any international squad I have ever been involved with.
''A conscious decision was made two years ago to prepare a team for
this tournament and the European Championships.
Then, we were more or less an under-19 team but we have all grown up
together.
''A year ago we had an obvious chance to win in France but blew it in
typically Scottish fashion against a poor Belgian team.
''The key to any success this time will be our game with the host
nation. France are always an excellent side but the pressure is firmly
on them to live up to expectations.
''We managed to defeat Mexico here two years ago quite comfortably and
another win would set us up nicely. We want to go all the way and
believe we can do just that.''
If Dailly's prediction comes true then it will compensate for being
relegated with his club, Dundee United.
He added: ''The fact that this happened will not affect me or David
Hannah. That is in the past and there is not point in dwelling on it.
''We are both confident that the new management team at Tannadice will
take the club back into the premier division next season.
''Right now, all my thoughts are focused on Toulon. While winning here
would be wonderful after so many unsuccessful attempts, the main
priority is still the European Championships.''

* HAMPSHIRE defied the showers at Cardiff to wrap up an eight-wicket
victory over Glamorgan as Saturday's Britannic Assurance County
Championship action was all but wrecked by rain.
Hampshire wasted no time taking the last four wickets in 75 minutes as
the home side added just 49 runs to their overnight 155 for six to
finish on 204.
Tony Cottey was the Welsh county's mainstay, occupying the crease for
more than three hours and hitting nine boundaries to top-score with 62,
while Zimbabwean Test seamer Heath Streak was the pick of Hampshire's
bowlers, finishing with three for 41.
Hampshire, chasing a victory target of just 55, lost openers Sean
Morris and Paul Terry cheaply but Robin Smith (30 not out) John
Stephenson (14 not out) knocked off the runs.

ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND QUAICH
HE was the Central character in more ways than one. David Orr was on
his home patch at Boghall, had taken four for 29 for West Lothian last
week against Perthshire, but on Saturday was made redundant by the rain.
Twenty-four hours later, he turned out for Central against South --
the one remaining Royal Bank of Scotland Quaich match. And he caused
absolute mayhem with a hat trick with the first three balls in his first
over as Central won by seven wickets.
South's first loss was the toss, and they asked to bat on a wicket
that favoured the bowler. Openers Dougie Wilson and Ralph Laing made a
reasonable start, until they disagreed over a second run and both
finished at the same end -- Laing being run out for 12. With wickets
going down and bowlers being changed, Orr was brought on as fourth
choice on his home track.
His first ball was played by Malcolm Lauder into the waiting hands of
Scott Gourlay. The next was snicked by Ray Nichol and snapped up by
wicketkeeper Aslam Raza. The third -- to Scott Thomson -- also ended in
the keeper's gloves. And Orr wasn't finished, taking two more wickets --
one of them again courtesy of keeper Aslam, and he ended with figures of
five for 9 from just four overs.
Another bowler to remember the game will be Fife's 17-year-old spin
prospect Ross Mitchinson, who has broken into the Central team this
season as well as figuring for Scotland's under-19s. Again he was helped
by Raza -- this time a stumping -- when he took the wicket of Selkirk's
Australian professional Brad Bannister, who had made 4, and whom South
are allowed to include to bolster their efforts.
With a late flurry of boundaries from No.9 batsman Malcolm Scott (27
not out), South pushed their final total to 85 from 25 overs. Central
openers, Raza and Robbie Birrell, went to the wicket, which was now
drying out before lunch, and the latter lived dangerously with an edge
which the visitors thought had reached the slips.
Raza, who had scored 73 for Fifeshire on Saturday, continued his
excellent form. He was eventually run out for the game's top individual
total of 41, looking for a second run, as Central moved smoothly to a
winning 86 for three.
The weather made sure play did not get going at Myreside, where
joint-leaders Edinburgh were due to take on Strathclyde West, and the
same fate befell the other leaders, North, who were due to face
Strathclyde East at Lochside Park, Forfar.

WORCESTERSHIRE cruised to a nine-wicket destruction of Surrey
yesterday to make it a three-way tie at the top of the Sunday League.
Tom Moody (73 n.o.) and Graeme Hick (51 n.o.) produced a match-winning
second-wicket stand of 128 at New Road as Worcestershire made it fours
straight wins by ending Surrey's perfect start.
Gavin Haynes laid the victory foundations by sending back the first
four Surrey batsmen, finishing with career-best figures of four for 21
while Parvaz Mirza also set a Sunday best of three for 27.
Glamorgan set-up a top-of-the-table shoot-out with unbeaten Lancashire
next week after a crushing 113-run victory over Hampshire, who were left
still searching for their first points in the competition.
The Welsh county's 238 for two was their highest total against
Hampshire with all their batsmen scoring, spearheaded by Steve James
(87), Matthew Maynard (58 n.o.) and skipper Hugh Morris (42).
Robin Smith marked his England call-up by making just seven as
Hampshire slumped to 28 for four before being dismissed for 125.
Graham Gooch became the first batsmen to top 8000 runs in Sunday
League cricket as he inspired Essex to a 112-run victory over
Nottinghamshire. Gooch hit 55 in 37 balls.

THE FIRST TEST
ROBIN Smith returns to the scene of his Test debut this week with
another career to launch -- and plenty of points to prove.
Smith was England's great new hope when he walked out at Headingley
seven years ago for his debut against West Indies.
Come Thursday, he will try to resurrect an international career many
people thought was over, prove himself technically and mentally equipped
for opening -- and save the selectors from a barrage of early-season
criticism.
As it is, Ray Illingworth and Co. should brace themselves for a whole
range of unflattering comments in the run-up to this week's first Test
at Leeds.
Their decision to recall not only Smith, but also fellow 31-year-old
Richard Illingworth hardly can be called progressive. And by handing
Alec Stewart the keeping gloves once again, thereby interrupting their
vice-captain's successful opening partnership with skipper Mike
Atherton, they can be accused of meddling with something that isn't
broken.
But chairman Illingworth has finally achieved his top priority -- a
five-man attack that just might give England a winning start to this
summer's battle with the West Indies.
''We've made such a mess of the first Test of a series so often in
recent years,'' said Illingworth. ''It's vital we get off to a good
start.''
Had the selectors been able to find an all-rounder to play at No.6,
Stewart would still be opening, a ''specialist'' would be keeping
wicket, and Smith, dropped halfway through last summer, would have
remained in the wilderness.
But Craig White, Dominic Cork, and Adam Hollioake, to name just three,
are not yet genuine articles and have rightly been overlooked.
The only solution, therefore, was to ask Stewart to double up while
casting around for another batsman. With all due respect to the likes of
Trevor Ward and Jason Gallian, surely Smith is as sound a bet as they
can get.
True, he has opened in only two of his 53 Tests -- and then against
the undemanding seam attacks of India and Sri Lanka three winters ago.
But, as Illingworth points out: ''Robin is experienced, he's always
been a good player of fast bowling, and he's generally done well against
the West Indies quicks.''
The figures support that statement with Smith having averaged nearly
45 from his 15 Test meetings with Curtly Ambrose and Co. And his form
for Hampshire this season -- 407 runs from eight completed first-class
innings -- suggests the old sparkle is back.
Stewart, typically, has taken his latest change of direction
stoically, though secretly he must rue his ability to keep wicket so
effectively.
In 13 Tests as a keeper, Stewart averages just 25 with the bat --
barely half his return from 32 appearances as a batsman only.
But can he now expect a long spell in the middle order and behind the
stumps to correct that imbalance? ''A lot depends on whether we can get
an all-rounder to come through for the No.6 spot,'' said Illingworth.
''We had to decide first who should keep wicket because that dictated
whether or not we could play five bowlers. It's not just me who wanted
to field a five-man attack, Mike is keen as well.''
Darren Gough, Devon Malcolm, Phillip DeFreitas, Angus Fraser and Peter
Martin -- after his impressive Texaco Trophy performances -- more or
less picked themselves in a 12-man squad.
But Worcestershire left-arm spinner Illingworth (no relation to Ray)
was a real surprise package. With one of the seamers sure to be omitted
on Thursday morning, Illingworth is now guaranteed a third Test cap --
four years after making two appearances against the 1991 West Indians.
The squad, with ages and Test appearances, is:
M A Atherton (Lancashire), captain, age 27, Tests 45; R A Smith
(Hampshire) 31, 53; G A Hick (Worcestershire) 29, 32; A J Stewart
(Surrey, wicketkeeper) 32, 45; G P Thorpe (Surrey) 25, 15; M R
Ramprakash (Middlesex) 25, 15; P A J DeFreitas (Derbyshire) 29, 43; D
Gough (Yorkshire) 24, 7; P J Martin (Lancashire) 26, 0; R K Illingworth
(Worcestershire) 31, 2; A R C Fraser (Middlesex) 29, 24; D E Malcolm
(Derbyshire) 32, 32.

WESTERN UNION:
THERE are some afternoons when being an idle cricketer can work in
your favour, and other days when not losing can actually work against
you. Saturday one one such example for the players of Kelburne and
Poloc.
Not a run was ran at Glenpark, Langloan or at Whitehaugh. Both
surviving south-side Glasgow games, nevertheless, had a considerable
effect on the DM Hall Western Union table.
Poloc began the day second in the league. However, by the end of 100
overs against West of Scotland, they had failed to gain a positive
result, so enabling Kelburne -- whose game against Uddingston lost out
to the rain -- to move second in the standings.
Mark Harper dominated the West innings, and proceedings in general,
though several home players gave him a helping hand.
West piled up 203 for six, Harper smashing 122, assisted considerably
by the fact he was dropped four times. David Hyndmarsh fumbled a
regulation slip catch when Harper was on 47. With just one more run
added to his total, Stephen Sirman let a skied shot slip through his
fingers. When Harper had progressed to 70, Hyndmarsh couldn't cling on
to a very difficult chance at mid-wicket. And on 78, Harper survived
once again when Neil Sheridan spilled a dolly at deep backward square.
Harper took full advantage to make his ton, with Scotland captain
Alistair Storie making the second-top knock, 28 off 104 balls, before he
was out in the thirty-first over.
Poloc openers David James and Charlie McBride added 39 together, and
together they departed with the score on that total. West seamer Craig
Wright accounted for the latter, with wicketkeeper Alan Williamson
taking the catch.
That combine was responsible for the next two Poloc wickets to fall,
with first Keith Sheridan, then the dangerous Sajid Ali sent packing.
After Wright's intervention, Poloc shut up shop and accepted the draw
points.
Meanwhile at Titwood, leaders Clydesdale kept up their winning ways
against Kilmarnock NK, the eventual margin of victory being 33 runs.
Rennie Keith and Donald Orr posted 64 for the hosts' first wicket,
Keith going on to make 65 out of a Clydesdale tally of 164-6.
To their credit, Kilmarnock chased throughout, even when Aamir Hanif
was helping himself to a wicket or two. It was only when last man David
McCaig came to the middle that Killie thought about holding out for the
draw. However, Kilmarnock's resistance was ended in the forty-fourth
over, Aamir finishing with 5-40 to keep Clydesdale out in front.

IT was unusual enough to see a cricket match at all on Saturday, more
unusual for it to finish with the scores exactly tied on 174 for six,
and definitely out of the ordinary to see a wicketkeeper start as an
opening bowler.
Fifeshire and Stirling County certainly served up plenty of drama in
the only Caley 80/- Scottish Counties game which survived the weather.
The keeper with the eye for bowling is Azlam Raza, a 24-year-old from
Pakistan who disarmingly admits to being a bit temperamental on the
field. And thereby lies his tale.
He began his cricket career in Pakistan as a bowler, but then changed
over to wicketkeeping ''for five or six seasons.'' He reasoned that he
was playing ''in a higher class of cricket'' by going behind the stumps
instead of swinging his arm over them.
When he came to Fifeshire two seasons ago from Corstorphine after a
spell in England, he asked if he could perform the dual role. For a man
whose colleagues even admit works really hard at nets, his next remark
hinted at the self-confessed temperament problem. ''After a while, I get
fed up behind the wicket, and I ask the skipper if I can have a bowl.''
Against Stirling, Graeme Buick and Ker Henderson fell to Raza with
only 24 runs on the board. That little job done, he donned the gloves
until near the end when it looked as though Stirling would pass the
Fifeshire total.
Their professional, Kyle Wealleans and former pro Bruce Russell had
formed a dangerous partnership, leaving the Fifers in no doubt that they
were going for the total instead of settling for a draw in the gathering
gloom.
The gloves came off literally when Mr Raza again took centre stage,
dismissing Russell for a fine 33, and nailing George McGuire next ball.
A hat trick was on, with a debutant batsman in the shape of 23-year-old
Willie Anderson to face it. He survived, and in a hectic finish with
Wealleans, Stirling needed four runs off the last two balls. They got
three off the last one to finish exactly level on 174 for six.
The unbeaten Wealleans made 83, and Anderson had made eight -- despite
being interrupted during the height of the drama by his Golden Labrador
paying him a visit at the wicket. She had slipped her lead after having
been perfectly behaved all day, and sedately trotted out to see her
master.
Fifeshire had been put in when Stirling won the toss, and despite
losing Ewan Ogilvie lbw to Russell for nine with the score on 27, seemed
to be heading for around the 200 mark when that man Raza and
professional Ashok Malhotra built up a 100-plus partnership.
There was one major problem, though. Despite Stirling's excellent over
rate of more than 20 an hour, the batsmen -- particularly Malhotra --
were scoring too slowly. Raza's 73 included eight 4s, but Malhotra's 72
included only three 4s and 31 singles.
Stirling can take some of the credit for that. Russell bowled right
through taking three for 63 in 27 overs, backed up by George McGuire,
who had two for 69 in 20.
Fifeshire skipper Wayne Sullivan could only fret as the Raza-Malhotra
partnership ground on by 121 runs until, with the score on 148, Raza
departed. Sullivan, obviously keen to step up the pace, fell quickly to
McGuire with the score on 155 -- which did not alter as Steven Reid was
run out and Paul Norman was bowled by Russell.
The 174 total was reckoned by Sullivan to be defendable, but it's not
often a skipper can thank his wicketkeeper for bowling over the
opposition.

WHEN a certain John McKane emigrated to Canada from the Dunfermline
area in 1879, he left a large patch of ground in the hands of trustees,
writes Hugh McKinlay. Wherever his soul was on Saturday, it must have
been gladdened watching a combination of modern technology, relatively
ancient machinery, and sheer hard work in action.
The end result was one of the few games of cricket anywhere in
Scotland when Fifeshire were able to take the field against Stirling
County.
Cricket's curse -- that's rain to the uninitiated, not a
professional's reaction to an lbw decision -- had wreaked its usual
havoc the night before a match. In clubs all around the country,
groundsmen turned up, turned away, and turned down any plaintive cries
that games might just be possible.
Not Jim Stark. Full-time profession -- local newspaper editor.
Part-time profession -- groundsman, McKane Park, Dunfermline.
The honours list for Saturday morning's effort includes Fifeshire
president Tom Gibson, assistant groundsman George Keir, and one of the
umpires for the match, Eric Spreng, who just happens to live ''over the
dyke'' next to the ground, and who threatened me with dire consequences
if I did not also mention the fact that he is the Fife match secretary.
Stark described Operation Mop-Up. ''We went down to a local tool-hire
company and got an Aquavac, and used it to soak up all the surface water
round about the square. There were hundreds of gallons of it after the
heavy rain. We've got good covers, so the wicket itself was dry.
''Then we got blankets and the heavy roller out to squeeze more water
from the ground, and despite a couple of showers, at 2.15pm what had
been the most dangerous areas were semi-playable. The captains had a
look and decided to play.''
The game finished just before 9pm -- that's 12[1/2] hours on site,
with still the covers to be put back on and equipment tidied up -- and
all for nothing in terms of cash reward. The hire of the Aquavac, by the
way, cost #16.
Speaking of money, the thought occurred about just how much it costs
to run the ground. Stark reeled off approximate figures with ease.
''Every year, we call in Souters of Stirling (they've handled a few
famous football surfaces in their time) to dress the pitch, which costs
around #1200.''
Diesel for the tractor, petrol for the mowers, paint to mark out the
pitch were just three other items which slipped off the tongue with a
total cost of more than #150. All this and more has to come from
subscriptions and sponsorship. No-one pays to watch cricket up here . .
. and let's have no comedians, please.
New equipment also has to be in short supply. The roller is about 40
years old, the tractor hails from 1966, and one of the lawnmowers is
only three years younger. Stark did add with a wry smile: ''At the least
the mower we use to cut the wicket is only a couple of years old.''
Yet there were no happier men at McKane Park in the twilight hours as
the game finished. A win for Fifeshire would have put the icing on the
cake, but at least they didn't lose.

THE bricks, mortar, and steel girders continue to reach up almost
defiantly towards the skyline in Glasgow's east end. The structure which
will form Celtic's massive new stand will exist as a monument to
resilience and it should also be a reminder that this football club is
much stronger and more important than individuals.
Celtic Park, which was a reminder of the negligence of a past regime,
is being transformed into something spectacular, perhaps even inspiring,
yet the club has not rid itself of internal disorder, even if Fergus
McCann and Tommy Burns have agreed to work together towards a common
goal. Machiavellian methods die hard.
The truce announced at the end of a long and anxious day for
supporters who should have been celebrating a rare cup triumph instead
of gathering again at Celtic's front door waiting for news from within
is an uneasy one. It is unstable despite any bulletins or pronouncements
which may have been made.
Two powerful forces, two headstrong men who have both still to
discover and master all of the intricacies of the football game, have
collided, and something may have to give. Perhaps not this week, but
maybe some time in the future.
With the Scottish Cup, Celtic's first trophy in six years, under an
arm, Burns felt powerful enough to voice his disapproval of the
interference from upstairs, but if anything he is now in an even weaker
position than before.
If you back someone into a corner you must be prepared to stand your
ground, because giving way, as he most certainly did according to the
statement issued after a meeting with his employers in which he
apologised, undermines what might have been a strong position.
Burns challenged authority and, although he may be given one or two
concessions, he did not gain anything. In fact, he was patronised, with
McCann saying the manager could take Celtic on to become even stronger
with the right guidance, support, and resources.
With the right guidance? Roll it around a little. Digest it. Makes you
wonder, doesn't it? In fact, if I were Burns it would make me worried.
I would be asking what is meant by ''the right guidance,'' and who
exactly is to provide it.
Will it be one of the directors, such as Willie Haughey, who it is
said will form part of a buffer zone between Burns and McCann? Or will
the managing director himself offer the manager advice on how to improve
his contribution to the business?
It seems to me Burns would not be so presumptious as to dare suggest
how McCann should restructure the club's financial systems, but when it
comes to football management there isn't much anyone within the Celtic
Park boardroom can teach the manager, and not because he knows it all.
He is feeling his way at the sharp end also, but if Burns needs
assistance he will seek it from others, men who have been through the
managerial mill and not a group of businessmen who form a board of
directors but who themselves may not all be as one even if they try to
tell their public otherwise.
Burns might be given a new and extended contract, but he should
understand one thing. He has distanced himself from his employer because
McCann is not the sort who welcomes challenges to his authority and we
can all forget the calm and measured public response to the controversy
created by the manager's need to speak out about his working conditions.
McCann would not have appreciated that.
Having put up the money which held the bank at bay last year, McCann
probably believes he is entitled to more respect and that his word
should be final. His way is the way forward and his law is not to be
usurped.
If Brian Dempsey, the consummate diplomat, felt he couldn't work with
McCann then who could? Burns now finds himself trying, but there could
be no doubting the tone of the joint statement issued last week when he
had to back off. However, he would be foolish to believe for one second
his apology means the matter has been forgotten.
Let us transport this club six months down the line, to the turn of
the year when Rangers are opening up a gap at the top of the premier
division and earning millions through playing in the Champions' League.
Celtic, out of the European Cup-winners' Cup, are struggling to match
the pace being set by their rivals and the fans are uneasy.
They are encouraged to look at the new Celtic Park and then they
examine the quality of the football, the return for their admission
money. They study and compare the results of the men who were in
conflict last week.
The support the fans gave Burns then will dwindle if results are poor,
while McCann again could become the hero having delivered the stadium.
What then? Who could stop McCann from acting, from settling an old score
if he so wished?
Cynicism is not required in liberal measures to realise such a
scenario could be the final scene for Burns, who might then be made to
pay for his boldness of last week. McCann could move at such a time and
insist on a change of manager, confident that his decisions would not
incur the fans' wrath.
Until Burns failed to resist the urge to tell the outside world what
was going on the question some were asking was: How long will McCann
last? Now, it is legitimate to ask how long does Burns have?
The manager may have cut short his term of office either because he
was influenced by voices within Celtic Park or he may have acted
entirely independently, but the reasons for his determination to bring
into the open some of the difficulties he has encountered since
succeeding Lou Macari have set him up. He either delivers in the new
season or he may be shown the door.
Under normal circumstances his Scottish Cup success would have bought
him more time, but his work now is bound to be scrutinised even more
closely and if he wishes to remain as manager of Celtic he will have to
win again. Yet, if he does not buy in the proper reinforcements Celtic
will find it almost impossible to undermine Rangers' dominance in
Scottish football, and the Ibrox club's state of well-being is the
barometer by which everyone else must be judged.
Burns sounds and acts to me like a man who generally knows his own
mind and he has done enough to suggest he has what it takes to become a
successful manager. He is capable of learning from mistakes and he also
has an integrity which is important in a world becoming ever more
corrupt and deceitful and anyone who has that quality should be
protected.
However, only silverware will protect Burns now that he has spoken out
but it might have helped his cause had he reminded everyone of something
McCann said before the hugely successful share issue. He didn't, but I
will.
McCann said his manager would be given the lion's share of the money
raised to strengthen the team and we were told the issue generated #14m.
Where is the lion's share of that money?
Burns really has to ask for his allocation in full and McCann must
provide it. Only then will Burns have a decent chance of keeping his
job, and if he remains as manager, it will mean Celtic are vibrant and
winning.

The players get sore heads from being hit by the sticks. The
supporters suffer similarly through over-indulgence in the whisky tent
TO Oban for the Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup final between Kingussie and
Oban Camanachd. It was an opportunity to embark upon a shinty learning
curve. Or a learning caman. The sport is named after the caman, or
curve, in the shinty stick.
But why is it called shinty, I asked Iain Thorburn, a learned man from
Tighnabruaich who was at the Mossfield park in Oban despite the absence
of Kyles Athletic from the final.
''It could be because of the damage inflicted on the players' shins,''
he replied. ''Or because it rhymes with intae, as in 'Get Right Intae
Them!' ''
Among the other facts gleaned on the shinty learning caman:
* Shinty and whisky gang the gither, as Rabbie Burns might have said
if he was a Hielanman. The players get sore heads from being hit by the
sticks. The supporters suffer similarly through over-indulgence at the
whisky tent in the corner of the ground.
This eighty-eighth Camanachd Cup final was a game of three haufs. The
first-half when Oban dominated and scored two goals. The second when
Kingussie regained their swagger and scored three. And the large hauf
from sponsors Glenmorangie during the interval.
Glenmorangie are pulling their cash out after 18 years of support.
Their new managing director wants to concentrate marketing efforts on
the growing whisky market in the Pacific Rim.
The Camanachd Association could retaliate by approaching Suntory, the
Japanese whisky makers, renaming the trophy the Samurai Cup, and holding
the final in Kuala Lumpur.
* Ronald Ross, Kingussie's full forward and highest-scoring player in
shinty this year, leads the line in a manner reminiscent of soccer's
Duncan Ferguson. But he's not as good with the head.
The lanky 21-year-old cannot use his height to fullest advantage
because of the modern rule in shinty which forbids heading the ball.
Hardy players of yore would put their napper to the equivalent of a
stone travelling at 90 miles per hour.
At last that's what my shinty adviser, Mr Thorburn, of Tighnabruaich,
told me.
* As befits the aristocrats of shinty, heading off to celebrate their
sixth Camanachd Cup in nine years, the Kingussie strip bears the
sponsor's name The Tipsy Laird.
* Shinty fans have no fewer than five men in black on whom to shower
abuse -- one ref, two linesmen, and two goal judges.
There was no sign of Saturday's referee, D A Fraser, of Inverness,
when he was asked to come forward after the game to collect his
commemorative medal.
''He'll be in the Kingussie dressing-room taking off that
blue-and-white shirt under his uniform,'' said a disgruntled Oban fan.
* The most vocal, vociferous, even passionate fan at Mossfield was a
petite blonde, Mary Mackenzie, from Benderloch.
In ringing tones, she urged Oban to greater and greater efforts. Which
they did, partly through pride and partly because they didn't want to
take the sporting equivalent of a broken pay-packet back to Mary
Mackenzie.
Mary, I am sorry to report, was moved at one point to tell D A, the
ref, to ''get tae hell.''
Her disappointment on the day was tempered by the fact that Lochnell,
her local school, won the Bank of Scotland Cup for best primary team in
Scotland.
* Shinty remains marvellously Hielan', despite the professionalism
which is creeping in.
The young man who came up to collect the Peter English trophy for best
juvenile team was rewarded merely with a handshake and told he would get
the cup as soon as it was found.
Last year's winners, Jordanhill School, appear to have lost it.
* Oban Camanachd may literally have their name on the Camanachd Cup
but the Kingussie captain Dallas Young had his great-grandfather on it.
John Cameron Dallas, who played for Kingussie in the first final in
1896, was the model for the figure of the shinty player which decorates
the lid of the Camanachd trophy.
* Kingussie are so entrenched as shinty's top team that the Oban
bookie was offering only 6-1 on. The local side were 3-1 against.
The Oban bookie goes by the splendid name of Aldo Lopez. His father
was Spanish and mother a mixture of Neapolitan-German.
Aldo Lopez is #5 richer this weekend due to a rash investment on my
part on Oban Camanachd.
* On the evidence of this Camanachd final, shinty is an exhilarating
sport. Fast, furious, and skilful with the participants exhibiting
remarkable hand and eye co-ordination. And great bravery. Only
half-a-dozen of the players chose to wear the protective red helmets.
Why is that, I asked Thorburn, the Tighnabruaich Sage.
''Some players believe the helmet only gives opponents something to
aim at,'' he said.

QUEEN of the South and Juventus are twins. Hard to believe? How can
the Dumfries team, languishing in the Scottish second division, possibly
have anything in common with the Italian champions?
The answer lies in sponsorship. The Doonhamers' shirts are sponsored
by Fiat while the heroes of Serie A come from Turin in the heart of
Fiatland.
Maybe the car makers are hopeful of another team of champions. They're
likely to be disappointed.
A glance through the sponsors of Scottish football teams reveals a
somewhat eclectic collection of interests, from double glazing firms to
radio stations, and from building companies to toffee manufacturers, and
even a pop group.
In the headlong rush for more cash some clubs change their shirts
nearly as often as ''my heart is with Rangers'' Gazza changes his
hairstyle and, sadly, sometimes with as much taste.
Even Scottish Cup finalists Airdrie had a new strip for their day in
the sun. But some designers seem to take their ideas from Andre Agassi's
grunge look and certainly Rod Stewart's LA Exiles should have brought
sunglasses with them to counter the glare from their opponents' strips
when they played at Newlandsfield last week.
Nearly men Airdrie are sponsored by a local bakery firm, Dalziel,
which seems keen to be even-handed in the Monklands area for it also has
a role to play at lowly Albion Rovers.
However, at one time the players at Dalziel amateurs must have been
eager to move on as the firm's motto ''A good roll does satisfy'' was
emblazoned across their chests.
How they must have longed for the anonymity of a sponsor who didn't
give rise to so much banter.
Ayr United, who have had their share of travails, have What Everyone
Wants emblazoned on their shirts.
A good deal of improvement must be the riposte the fans are eager to
shout.
Struggling Stranraer, who have had an up and now back down again
season, are sponsored by a ferry company, presumably so that they can
make a quick exit if the fans get any more restless, and transport has a
part to play at Dundee United who are motoring down to the first
division for the first time in many years but hoping for a return
journey next season.
Many teams are sponsored by brewing interests which should make a lot
of Scottish players feel at home and many local bars and hotels have got
in on the act.
The Windmill Hotel has taken Arbroath under its wing. ''Tilting at''
are the words that come to mind.
Raith Rovers have a local nightclub, Jackie O's, on their chests and
it was the scene of much celebration after their momentous win over
Celtic last November.
Wet Wet Wet, at present on a sell-out European tour, have not
forgotten their roots and Clydebank can be grateful for their support
but perhaps it's just as well there isn't room for Dreadful Dreadful
Dreadful on some clubs' tops.
There are always companies on the lookout for sponsorship
opportunities but sometimes these can backfire.
Some years ago a French fashion house planned to sponsor a Russian
women's athletics team.
Unfortunately, the scheme fell down at the fittings stage.
But for those still seeking useful links here are some that appear to
have been overlooked.
Diet food manufacturers should be beating a path to Nigel Mansell's
door or even Colin Montgomerie's, Duncan Goodhew could be signed up by
Brylcreem and the impresario Cameron McIntosh might take an interest in
pantomime favourites Frank Bruno or Ian Botham for a West End
production. That would stop any more talk of Botham joining the
professional golf tour.
But, without doubt, Marvel Comics should be on the phone to Big Gav
for, despite Saturday's disappointment against France in South Africa,
he's perfect for a superstar role.

TUMULT is, of course, the very essence of the Junior footy game and
there was enough tumult on Saturday at Newlandsfield Park, the Pollok
Juniors ground, to satisfy a Bosnian.
Pollok had been host to five football games in eight days, including
the Davie Cooper charity match last Thursday at which six thousand
spectators attended.
To Pollok's credit (admittedly a wealthy club in the Junior league,
but what of that), they charged nothing at all for the elect select
which stamped their studs across the green sward of Newlandsfield Park.
But let us not make mention of the astonishing quality of the pitch
itself. Anybody who has seen Hampden's meadow since Celtic took it over
will tell you that there is more sand in the hallowed ground of the home
of Scottish football than you will dicover in the Gobi Desert. But
Pollock's pitch was as green and leafy as an ode by a Georgian poet.
Much of this -- all of this really -- was due to the efforts of
near-octogenarian Jimmy Duncan, ground convenor of Pollok, and his four
helpers, all of them pensioners.
The Famous Five had spent years re-sowing the grass and taking turf
fae the back and putting it in the front and doing it all for nothing.
After the Davie Cooper match it took three hours to burn the rubbish
left behind. The auld fellas did it all for nothing, or alternatively
the love of the game. But I will tell you this; their pitch was
splendid.
Which is more than can be said for the football.
This was the Centenary Final of the Evening Times Trophy, the cup
final of the two top teams in the Central League.
In this case, it bestowed upon us all the less than civilised sight of
the two top clubs, Arthurlie from Barrhead, (the holders), and
Petershill, from Springburn, an area hardly any longer in existence.
Considering Petershill's style of play, the club should perhaps have
fallen into the same level of desuetude as the area, from which it
springs (burns).
For not only did the morons, sorry, maroons, of Petershill lose 3-1,
they had three players sent off in a disgraceful display of petulance by
quite elderly players who should have known better considering that
there were lots of wives, girlfriends, little children, and journalists
who blush at every sweary word.
This is a cup final, first set up, by the Evening Times no less, in
1895: it should have been an example to everybody in sport.
Instead there was a display of footballing inadequacy, and an
exhibition of toddler-style tantrums.
The first goal seemed to have upset everybody on both sides; a soft
one from Arthurlie's Steve Convery early in the first half.
Incidentally, Steve's brother was present at Newlandsfield with his wee
six-year-old Lyndsay, clutching a doll. Her pal, also called Lyndsay,
aged seven, was equally more interested in her dolly than in the
football, and in the first half, nae wonder.
What neither of the wee sweethearts were needing was the comments of
Petershill veteran Ross Findlay, an ex-Scottish Junior international,
when he was sent off for a blatant trip on Arthurlie's Jo-Jo Gardiner.
Actually Ross, a player of some subtlety when he doesn't let his
temper get the better of him, was really sent off by referee and
schoolteacher Eddie Mack for dissent. Ross, you are, or were, a very
good player; mind the language in front of weans, even in front of
journalists.
But Arthurlie were going in for the kill and Petershill knew it.
Despite an equaliser early in the second half from the Springurn side
from Kennedy, the Barrheid boys came back with a stormer of a lob from
fifty yards from Tony McDonald, and later a lovely low drive from Steve
Bulloch past Gerry McLaughlin in the Petershill goal.
By now, the Glasgow team had lost the place.
Findlay was joined in the early bath by Meechan after a truly dreadful
late tackle and later still by ex-internationalist Stevie Walker, who
put an unwelcome elbow into the coupon of Steve Nugent of Arthurlie.
It was a bad-tempered game with little football to write about which
is why I am not writing much about it at all.
That is a great pity: this is one of the oldest trophies in Scottish
football and is, in fact, a lovely piece of silverware.
Another pity is that some of the fans don't seem to recognise the
notion of sportsmanship.
The referee and the linesmen were treated to a torrent of obscenity
and abuse which embarrassed Petershill manager Bobby McCulloch, himself
a fine sportsman, no end.
Referee Eddie Mack was jostled, in fact, at the end of the match by
halfwits from what was once the epicentre of working-class decency where
the locomotives were made, and linesman Kevin Toner -- who in fact
officiated at last week's Junior cup final as referee -- came in for
heavy stick.
This is disgraceful, for the after-match entertainment with both
clubs, and indeed Pollok FC as well, not to mention the heavy presence
of many of my own colleagues from wur wee sister The Evening Times, was
a delight.
Don't forget the history of these two clubs. I seem to remember that
the great Torry Gillick of the Rangers came originally from Petershill,
not to mention Benny Rooney of the Celtic (maybe we had better leave
Benny out of it).
But better still, think on this. Half the players of both teams have
at one time or another played for -- them both. Aye, think on.

WHEN Alan Simonsen, one-time European Footballer of the Year, took
over as the manager of the Faroe Islands national side two years ago,
the little Dane experienced a culture shock.
Since then, however, Simonsen has begun to stamp his own image on the
part-time players who spend their working life in the islands' fish
factories and turn to football for relaxation.
That attitude has been altered by Simonsen to some extent. The men who
will face Scotland this week still play the game mostly for pleasure,
but a degree of professionalism has been added and that is what must
worry Craig Brown as he takes his European Championship squad there this
morning.
Brown had the Faroese watched the other week, when they defeated the
other minnows of the qualifying group, San Marino, 3-0 to give Simonsen
his first victory since he took on the job.
The difference in their play between that result and in their visit to
Hampden at the start of the season, when they lost 5-1, emphasises the
Simonsen factor.
Brown muses: ''They use this man-for-man marking system, and they use
it well, and that is always a problem for our players. But, unlike San
Marino, they are the kind of team who will attack us. They won't just
sit back, they will come out.
''San Marino are different altogether. Even when they go behind, they
still defend. The Faroes are not like that at all.''
Simonsen underlines that when he starts to talk about the thankless
job he accepted last summer. He knew then that the Faroese did not
expect a string of victories in the group, but he learned quickly that
his employers did look for improvement in the side and it was his job to
provide that. He believes that he has done so, in a limited sense, in
the season he has had available to him so far.
''No-one said the job would be an easy one,'' he laughs. ''Equally, I
did not expect it to be as difficult as it has been in some ways. What I
had to do here was to change the outlook of the players.
''They were going into games against professional teams, but were
doing so as amateurs. That was no use and that is what I have worked
upon.
''I have tried to tell them how they should eat and how they should
train when they are away from the national team. It has not been easy,
but I believe that I have been able to add a little bit of
professionalism to the team.
''No-one really expects us to qualify, or even to win games against
nations which are rated so much higher than we are, but we want to
continue improving steadily and then, maybe, we could shock some other
countries.''
Certainly, the men in charge at the Faroes FA have been impressed by
what Simonsen has done up to now. A spokesman said last week: ''We were
being ambitious when we decided to go for a name as big as Alan Simonsen
and we did not know if we would be successful. But we were and Alan has
been able to add a professional touch.
''That is what we needed. We had to have someone who would be able to
guide the players in the right direction. All we want is to have a team
we can be proud of and that victory against San Marino gave us something
to celebrate. Now we would like a bigger scalp.''
The problem for Scotland and Craig Brown is that they are on next and,
with our propensity to flop at the worst times, this is not exactly when
we should be travelling to this tiny group of islands in the North
Atlantic.
Forty-three-year-old Simonsen tells us that Scotland will win. He is
ready to stress that his team are still learning the kind of
professionalism which our players pick up as part of their education at
club level.
He insists: ''I do not have a single player who would get into your
squad, let alone your team. There is no one as good as any of the
Scottish players.
''I believe that the Scots will qualify for the European Championship
finals. The fact that their games after they play us are all at home is
very, very important.
''All they must do is win home games and if they do that then they
will be in England next summer. I know that they will come here without
Gary McAllister and Paul McStay, but there are so many reserves who can
come in that I doubt if that will make any difference to the result.
''We are better than we were when we played in Glasgow, but I don't
believe we have improved enough to win this game.
''No, I see Scotland as near certainties to be in the finals. I know
that some people are looking at the Finland results and saying that they
now have a chance to get one of the two places, but I do not believe
that.
''The Finns are not good enough. It has always been, for me, a
three-way fight and the result the Scots gained in Moscow makes me
believe that they will win against Greece in Glasgow and that will carry
them to one of the qualifying places.
''We are not a barrier for them. We do not have enough good players to
seriously trouble Scotland. I wish we did.''
Craig Brown, meanwhile, hopes his opposite number is accurate in his
pre-match assessment. If Simonsen is trying a con trick then Brown must
beware, because we have suffered too many embarrassments to face another
this week.

ONCE again ITV have proved that they are incapable of delivering
quality when covering big events like the Rugby World Cup. Adverts
squeezed in as often as possible destroy continuity and atmosphere.
Ill-informed commentators stumble through their questions and look
positively uncomfortable when talking about rugby.
Thankfully, that well-known rugby commentator Trevor Macdonald has
gone home but do we really need Jim White?
Do we really need comment from the English camp every five minutes --
I for one do not want to watch dear old Will having breakfast. As for
Mark and Mary on the highlights programme we would be better off with
George and Jim from the Beechgrove Garden. They at least were
interesting and entertaining. In fact, they probably know more about
rugby than the present incumbents.
Of course, it is money that talks and I fear this is only the thin
edge of the wedge with Sky television waiting in the background.
I hope in future the rugby authorities will resist offers from
commercial stations and revert their coverage to the BBC who may be the
establishment but at least they have the expertise. Thank goodness we
have Bill McLaren on the radio.

THE media hype for English rugby has backfired on them, as it
obviously would.
The Rugby Union must regret not having ''bit the bullet'' and bombed
Will Carling out.
As a captain, he has made boredom and cynicism into an art form. He
isn't all that good a player anyway. Brian Moore must be the most
universally hated rugby player in the world -- ''Nobody likes us, we
don't care!'' Quite true!
One wonders why Ian Robertson ''bums them up'' so much: just to keep
himself in a job perhaps?
The players are so patently over-rated, conceited, and money
orientated.
They discredit an amateur game which should be played for enjoyment.
Have a safe trip back to earth lads -- welcome to the real world. Easy
group? A team such as Argentina can improve, and provide an effective
game plan. QED.

BBC television in Scotland behaves in a fair manner to racing,
football, athletics, snooker, boxing, golf, and rugby enthusiasts.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that there are more cricket clubs than
rugby clubs in Scotland, the BBC chooses to ignore the wishes of cricket
lovers. I trust the powers that be at Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow,
will change policy and give viewers uninterrupted coverage of future
Test matches.
Unlike other sports, the cricket season is short. However, the BBC
controllers in Scotland behave in a different fashion from their
counterparts, south of the Border. They give viewers in this area only
limited coverage of Test matches. Perhaps they do not realise that they
are fortunate to have the franchise.
Nevertheless, if they continue to use this franchise in a cavalier
fashion, perhaps other independent Scottish television companies should
be given the opportunity to cover Test matches.
There is nothing more infuriating than to have enjoyed one-and-a-half
days exciting coverage of a Test match, only to be swiftly moved on to
watching several days of another sport which can be viewed throughout
the year.
Frank Bruno often says ''that's cricket.'' In this sad situation in
Scotland, I believe the phrase ''it's just not cricket'' would be apt.

E BAIRD (''Questions of standards and quality'' -- Herald 29.5.95)
makes numerous forceful points about the state of Scottish football
which are both appallingly misconstrued and, in many cases,
self-contradictory.
One moment the idea of enlarging the top division is foolish as it
would require the admission of clubs ''worse than Partick Thistle'' so
lowering the standard of a division that is, according to the author,
''not too cut-throat.''
However, the lower division from where these poorer clubs originate is
actually a ''worthwhile competition in its own right'' only perceived as
negative, lacking in skill and sophistication by ''journalists and
pundits'' who are, naturally, their own worst enemies.
What a load of nonsense. The malaise in the domestic game stems from
two things: fear and familiarity.
The fear is essentially financial in that clubs tremble at the thought
of dropping a division and experiencing the unavoidable loss of revenue.
Clubs want to play the teams that make the tills ring -- playing Rangers
and Celtic six or eight times a year would be financial heaven for every
domestic club in Scotland.
Clubs, therefore, do anything to preserve their stake in this
increasingly inequitable honeypot.
Consequently, boredom seeps into both play and spectating. Competing
against the same teams four or possibly five times a year does not
encourage experimentation or usher in innovation and sophistication in
play. It merely stagnates the game.
An enlarged league would convince teams that, while they may not have
a realistic chance of winning the championship, they can consolidate
their position within the top league, push for a European place, and
free themselves from the interminable dogfight that, for many, starts in
August.
One glance around Europe would suggest that an enlarged league might
just be an idea worth pursuing. If we consider nations such as France,
the Netherlands, or even Romania we find premier leagues of between 16
and 20 teams.
These nations consistently out-perform us on both the European club
and international stage while in virtually every case their league
championship is won by the same two or three clubs.
Are we really to believe that teams such as Gloria Bistrita, Bastia,
and Heerenveen are significantly better than Dunfermline, Falkirk,
Dundee, or Raith Rovers? I think not.
They do, however, come from a markedly different footballing culture
that allows for skill over strength and innovation over stagnation
because more teams play at a higher level for a longer period of time.
That in itself is a self-perpetuating system of improvement and a
simple equation that the ''mandarins'' at Park Gardens and elsewhere
would do well to recognise.

SCOTLAND claimed a tenuous victory in the St Rule Trophy at St Andrews
yesterday as Swede Maria Hjorth produced a display of controlled golf to
win by two strokes.
The blonde 21-year-old, who won the Helen Holm event earlier in the
season, returned an eight-under-par total of 220, to pip her
countrywoman and fellow Stirling student Anna Berg along with the home
hopefuls Alison Rose and Janice Moodie.
Hjorth, based at Stirling University, started the final round one
stroke adrift of Stirling bank clerk Rose -- who had led from the off --
but by the turn, the gap had been closed thanks to a blistering outward
half of four-under-par 34.
The turning point of the contest came at the 377-yard thirteenth,
played as a par-5 for women, where Hjorth took the lead for the first
time.
On the green in two, the Swede almost holed her eagle putt from 20
feet while Rose found sand from the tee and followed that with an
approach into a bush from where she struggled to a bogey 6.
US college sensation Moodie, who started the final round two strokes
adrift of Rose, looked poised for a charge when she birdied the second
hole, but she could not keep the momentum going. Leading scores (from,
respectively, New, Old, and Old course):
0
220 -- M Hjorth (Stirling University) 74, 74, 72.

McMAHON Kelburne and Western Klick Photopoint both will be playing for
bronze today in the European Club Championships.
But Kelburne looked set for a point against Racing Club of France at
Linwood on Saturday, and a place in the final.
With the score at 1-1 five minutes from time, keeper Graeme Mutton
''lost sight of the ball'' at a penalty corner as College hit the target
to regain the lead for the Parisiennes, who put the game beyond recall
in the dying seconds when Van Wersch scored his second goal of the game.
Kelburne yesterday beat Whitchurch 5-1 in their final group match,
after Mark Lewis had opened for the Welsh in the second minute. Kelburne
replied through David Ralph, Michael Starling, Billy Anderson, David
McKay and Colin Bryce, and now play Grammarians from Gibraltar in a
repeat of the 1992 final in Gibraltar when Kelburne took gold in a
penalty shoot-out.
The bronze match will start at 1.30, with Minsk meeting Racing Club in
the final at 3.45.
At Utrecht in Holland, Western had beaten Swansea 4-0 on Saturday,
when Susan MacDonald hit a hat trick, and still had the final in their
sights yesterday when they played their hosts, Kampong.
Western lost a controversial early goal when the ball rebounded in off
a defender. Western protested, in vain, that no Dutch stick had come in
contact with the ball.
This setback, according to player-coach Wendy Fraser, ''helped to
settle our jitters. We fought back but despite some good raids, we just
couldn't penetrate their defence.'' The Dutch went on to extend their
lead to 3-0 but 13 minutes from time Jacqui McLaughlin, with a straight
strike at a penalty corner, secured a consolation for the Glasgow team.
They will now play Lithuanians Siauliai in the battle for bronze
while, in the match to decide the gold medal, Kampong will take on
Berlin. Results:
Saturday. Men: Group A -- Stockholm 3, Whitchurch 2; McMahon Kelburne
1, Racing Club of France 3. Group B -- Minsk 4, Hostivar 1; Wien Cobra

THE fiftieth Scottish Rally lived up to its international status with
foreign drivers filling the first four places. Sweden's Thomas
Abrahamsson, navigated by Mike Kidd from Cambridgeshire, emerged a
surprise winner after leader Malcolm Wilson retired following a bizarre
incident during yesterday's final leg.
Abrahamsson, celebrating his first international rally win, said: ''I
had settled for second place at the end of Saturday's second leg in
Dumfries. Malcolm was over two minutes ahead at that point and the
quickest driver. I am very sad for him but very pleased for myself and
the team.''
Reigning British Rally champion Wilson, driving the Michelin Pilot
Ford Escort, had led from Friday's opening special stage in Craigvinean
near Dunkeld and was more than three minutes ahead when he was
confronted by a closed metal gate in Knockycoid Forest near Newton
Stewart.
The incident near the end of the thirteenth of the rally's 19 timed
special stages left the 39-year-old Cumbrian shocked and upset. He
explained: ''When I saw the closed gate I put the car into a ditch on
the inside of the bend to try to scrub off some speed. I nudged the gate
with the front of the car to see if it would open and when it did we
continued to the end of the stage.
''Driving into the ditch had broken the radiator and, although the
mechanics replaced it at the end of the stage, the engine had
overheated. We stopped with head gasket failure midway through the next
stage.
''I have been rallying for 20 years and that's something I have never
seen before nor want to see again. I find it very hard to believe the
gate closed on its own and it appears that someone may have closed it
deliberately. If they did I hope they get a lot of pleasure for causing
my retirement.''
Second place and, more importantly, maximum points in the Mobil 1/Top
Gear British Rally Championship went to Finland's Jarmo Kytolehto
driving a British-built Vauxhall Astra. This result on his first visit
to the Perth Scottish Rally moves him into second place in the British
championship on equal points with Lanark's Alister McRae and Belgian
Gregoire De Mevius, who brought his Nissan Sunny back to Perth in third
place.
Frenchman Alain Oreille, driving a Reanult Clio Williams, claimed a
trouble-free fourth place on his first attempt at the Perth Scottish and
moved into a three-point lead in the British Rally Championship.
Philip Young had the distinction of being the first British driver
among the 44 finishers. The Belfast man, in a Ford Escort, repeated his
1994 result of fifth overall and first in the category for production
cars. Kelso's Dominic Buckley was the highest-placed Scot in eighth
place.
Alford's Gordon Smith recorded a personal best with tenth place
overall in his Ford escort. Tealing's Mallock Nicholl was thirteenth
overall and fourth in the Group N production category in a Ford Escort.
Final results:
1, T Abrahamsson/M Kidd (Ford Escort) 2hr 38min 27sec; 2, J
Kytolehto/A Kapanen (Vauxhall Astra) 2-40-40; 3, G De Mevius/JM Fortin

P Young/R Philpott (Ford Escort) 2-46-53; 6, D Higgins/M Park (Ford
Escort) 2-47-05.
Mobil 1/Top Gear British Rally Championship (positions after three of
five rounds) -- 1, A Oreille 49 points; 2 (equal), A McRae, G De Mevius,

THE Amateur Championship tees off today across the links of Royal
Liverpool Golf Club in Hoylake with the opening qualifying round, so
neatly rounding off a century of amateur golf's blue riband event at the
venue where it was conceived and, eventually, born in 1885.
There could hardly exist a more appropriate setting for the one
hundredth tournament than Hoylake, where club secretary Thomas Owen
Potter initiated a tournament to determine the champion amateur golfer.
Even today the 7128-yard linksland presents a formidable challenge to
288 of the world's finest golfers.
Gordon Sherry, beaten finalist last year and arguably Great Britain's
most consistent amateur this season, said after a practice round: ''You
would be as well just picking a name out of the hat to see who will do
well this week. I can easily see myself going out there and shooting two
rounds of 85 and not making the cut in these conditions. My only
priority at this stage is to make it through to the matchplay stages.''
Sherry, of Kilmarnock Barassie, is a member of the 22-strong Walker
Cup training squad, and all but two of his Great Britain and Ireland
team-mates will vie for the attentions of selectors this week.
Aong them is Cochrane Castle's Barclay Howard who has not displayed
the prodigious form of recent seasons. Yet the beefy 43-year-old has
since recorded a fourth place finish in the Brabazon Trophy and was
third in last week's prestigous St Andrew's Links Trophy.
''If I am perfectly honest with myself I think perhaps I was trying a
little bit too hard,'' he admitted yesterday. ''I have tried to relax a
bit more and concentrated on enjoying myself over the past few
tournaments. It has worked wonders.''
Bathgate's Stephen Gallacher has already landed the Lytham Trophy this
season and is another keen to make amends for last season's showing. He
crashed out in the first round at the twentieth hole having comfortably
led the qualifying.

''WE stole it,'' was Kingussie manager Iain Ross's immediate reaction
as he surveyed the immediate aftermath of his side's eighth win in the
Glenmorangie Camanachd Cup final in the last 12 years, by 3-2 against
Oban Camanachd.
The match, watched by 3000 hardy souls who had braved unseasonal
dampness at Oban's Mossfield Park, will go down as one of the finest in
recent years.
Within 11 minutes of the start of this eighty-eighth final, Oban were
two goals ahead in an opening burst which caught Kingussie, and the
assembled masses, by surprise.
Dougie MacIntyre, whose contribution to the Oban cause in the opening
45 minutes was immense, created the opening for deadly Dave McCuish.
Within three minutes the Argyll side were further ahead, MacIntyre this
time the finisher with a stunning drive from an angle, which left
Kingussie's keeper Ian Anderson stranded.
Kingussie gradually clawed their way back into the game. They forced a
string of corners and with the Oban defence under the cosh, it looked as
if the predicted rout might soon be on the cards.
The Oban defenders, however, stood firm and to a man produced a
display of accomplished defending which left their more illustrious
opponents baffled.
Even 62-goal Ronald Ross, the finest finisher in the game, was forced
to snatch at his shots as Gordon MacIntyre snapped as his heels. As the
half wore on, Oban began to look more and more like aspiring champions.
Ian Anderson in the Kingussie goal was by far the busier of the two
custodians and in the minutes leading up to half-time, he produced a
string of top quality saves which were, in the end, to prove crucial.
His effort from Dave McCuish three minutes from the interval, may, in
hindsight, have won Kingussie the cup. McCuish perhaps realised the
significance of the save as he was booked within minutes, his
frustration for once causing him to lose control.
Oban headed for the dressing room knowing that they had exceeded all
expectations. The aficionados who had seen Kingussie come from two goals
in arrears in 1987 wondered what the second period might hold.
Kingussie manager Ross demanded a huge effort from his charges at the
interval. Ally Borthwick responded almost immediately and on his
back-hand, drove home Kingussie's first.
It took them until the sixty-third minute to get level as the Oban
defence continued to thwart the fast Kingussie forwards. Michael Clark,
who had earlier suffered a gash to the chin set off on a mazy dribble
which ended with Oban keeper MacGregor deflecting the ball almost
outwith his reach. Clark however, threw himself full-length, and with
great agility, guided the ball into the net.
Gradually, Kingussie's dedication and preparation, which has seen them
dominate the sport for the last 12 years, began to tell. Oban's midfield
effort waned slightly and Kingussie's forwards began to see more of the
ball. They found more space than they had seen all through the first
half and it was only the brilliance of keeper MacGregor which prevented
them scoring on several occasions, two in particular from Ronald Ross.
With just six minutes remaining Ally Borthwick broke the Oban players'
hearts when he netted the winner.
The Kingussie manager was magnanimous in what could be his last game
in charge. ''Oban gave us a wonderful game and we had to dig very deep
to pull that one back. It's a tremendous win in the circumstances,'' he
said.
Oban were disconsolate. Defender Nonnie MacInnes, for the second time
in two years, was selected as man of the match and awarded the coveted
Albert Smith Memorial medal. For the second time though, Kingussie
denied him a winners' medal.
Kingussie -- I Anderson, M Thain, David Borthwick, Stephen Borthwick,

Scottish Claymores 24, Frankfurt Galaxy 37
THE Scottish Claymores' hopes of recording a face-saving win in front
of their long-suffering home support in their final match of the season
at Murrayfield were blown away yesterday by Frankfurt Galaxy, despite
the Scots getting off to a great start with the fastest recorded
touchdown in World League history.
Frankfurt, who won the game by virtue of scoring 24 unanswered points
in the second quarter, now look the most likely team to face Amsterdam
Admirals in the World Bowl in two weeks' time.
The game exploded into life on the Claymores' first play from
scrimmage. Quarterback Matt Blundin wasted no time firing a deep
sideline pass from his 35-yard line in the direction of wide receiver
Allen DeGraffenreid.
The Kansas City import made a textbook catch, outrunning Frankfurt's
top cornerback Jack Kellogg to record the World League's fastest ever
touchdown with only 20 seconds played. Sean Conley made good the extra
point and the Claymores were ahead 7-0.
The Germans were dealt another blow on their first offensive play when
they lost league leading quarterback Paul Justin with a sprained ankle.
Back-up passer Brad Bretz replaced Justin and guided Galaxy to the
Claymores' 39. Bretz went on to get his team back on level terms
throwing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Mario Bailey. Galaxy kicker Daron
Alcorn kicked Frankfurt level.
Galaxy mounted another drive at the end of the first quarter, with
running back Nate Bolton making most of the ground. However, the Scots'
defence held firm, forcing Galaxy kicker Alcorn to attempt a field goal,
but play was brought back when Claymores' cornerback James Williams
fouled Alcorn and gave the Germans another chance to go for the
touchdown at the Claymores' six.
Despite being foiled three times by the Scots, Bolton finally swept
into the end-zone.
The Claymores were still in the game but controversial refereeing
decisions, which have dogged the Scots all season, were to play a part
yet again.
From 14 yards out Bretz found Bobby Olive at the Claymores' three-yard
line. The receiver then tried to reach the ball into the end-zone but
dropped it in the process. However, instead of ruling a touchback, where
the Claymores would have gained position at their 20, the officials
ruled a forward pass and gave Frankfurt the ball back at the Claymores'
five-yard line.
On the next play, Bretz fired a quick pass to Mike Bellamy, who ran
into the end-zone untouched.
Just before the end of the half, Bretz evaded three Claymores rushers
and fired an end-zone pass to tight end Bob Brasher.
Frankfurt got another chance to score before the break when the Scots
couldn't move the ball and seemed to lose their discipline on defence,
with tackle Troy Ridgely ordered off after a personal foul. That moved
Galaxy into scoring range and Alcorn hit a 25-yard field goal.
The Claymores got back into the game midway through the third quarter
when back-up quarterback Terry Karg threw a 35-yard touchdown pass to
receiver Darrell Mitchell after George Coghill intercepted, giving the
Claymores the ball at Frankfurt's 42-yard line. But Karg threw an
incomplete pass on the two-point conversion attempt.
Gutsy play from the diminutive Karg, scrambling to the Frankfurt 15,
kept the next Claymores' drive alive but the Scots had to settle for a
27-yard Conley field goal.
The Claymores' defence battled on but Bolton sealed the victory,
breaking open at Frankfurt's 48-yard line running down to the Claymores'
12. On the next play, German national player Ingo Seibert powered his
way into the end-zone to make it 37-16. The Scots got a consolation with
seconds remaining when newly signed quarterback Jim Ballard threw a
touchdown pass to Harris and then completed to tight end Dwayne Chandler
for two points to end the game with a more respectable score of 37-24.
The Scots can now look forward to a final season game on Saturday
against London's Monarchs.

South Africa 20, Canada 0
AS South Africa appealed yesterday against the suspension of hooker
James Dalton following the triple sending off in Saturday's Pool A match
against Canada, the rugby authorities announced that a further two
players are in trouble over the incident.
Peter Hendriks, a tryscoring hero for South Africa when they kicked
off the World Cup by beating Australia, was last night cited by the
tournament's authorities for his part in the punch-up in Port Elizabeth.
The three dismissed players have already been suspended for 30 days
for fighting and punching but last night both Hendriks and Canada's
Scott Stewart also found themselves in trouble. A statement issued by
the Rugby World Cup directors said: ''We believe that the violence at
the Boet Erasmus Stadium has brought the game into disrepute and in view
of the gravity of the incidents, and after viewing video tape of the
game, have decided to cite the following players: Scott Stewart of
Canada for punching and being the originator of the incident, and Peter
Hendriks of South Africa for kicking.''
Ray Williams will act as commissioner for the citing procedure, which
will take place within 24 hours.
Meanwhile, the South African RFU have appealed against the suspension
of hooker Dalton who, along with Canadian pair Gareth Rees and Rod Snow,
were sent off by Irish referee David McHugh after a mass brawl which
marred the Springboks' 20-0 triumph.
All three players were found guilty of punching and given 30-day
suspensions by a disciplinary hearing chaired by Welsh match
commissioner Ray Williams -- effectively ruling Dalton, South Africa's
first-choice hooker, out of the tournament.
''We have appealed against the decision,'' confirmed Edward Griffiths,
chief executive of the South African Rugby Football Union.
Canada, who were eliminated from the tournament after their second
successive defeat, have not appealed against the suspensions of Rees and
Snow, with a team spokesman saying: ''As far as we are concerned, the
whole incident is closed.
A statement issued after the disciplinary hearing said: ''James Dalton
and Gareth Rees were sent off for fighting. The hearing supported the
referee's report, and Dalton and Rees have been suspended from playing
rugby for a period of 30 days.
''Snow was accused of eye-gouging but exonerated. But by his own
admission, and the evidence submitted by a fellow Canadian player, he
was found guilty of punching.
South African captain Francois Pienaar maintained Dalton's innocence,
claiming: ''James went into the fight as a peacemaker. He never threw a
punch. He's innocent and I'm sure he'll get off.''
It was the first time three players had been sent off in an
international and it increased the total for the tournament up to four
following the dismissal of Tongan flanker Feleti Mahoni during his
side's opening match against France for stamping.
Television replays showed several others players involved in the
brawl, which left Springbok lock Hannes Strydom badly cut around his
left eye.
Griffiths said hooker Naka Drotske, who won a cap for South Africa on
a tour of Argentina two years ago, was on stand-by to join the squad
should Dalton's appeal, which is expected to be heard today, fail.
Television replays showed Winston Stanley rushing in and swinging a
punch at Springbok winger Pieter Hendricks, which led to a protracted
brawl involving several players on both sides.
''Replays will show we did not start the fight. Dalton was sent off
unfairly,'' said Christie.
Canadian captain Rees said he had no idea why he had been sent off but
admitted he was involved in the fight.
Pienaar said his team came away from the match ''a bit scared and
shaken.''
Christie added that winger Gavin Johnson's suspected concussion may
lead to Chester Williams returning to the team for the quarter-final.

SHOULD the Aussies continue to have any more problems -- poor
goal-kicking and the disappointing form of Michael Lynagh being a couple
-- then one radical solution would be to drop Lynagh, bring in young
stand-off Scott Bowen, who played so well in Australia's defeat of
Romania on Saturday, and give the goal-kicking duties to John Eales.
Eales, one of his country's successes in the World Cup so far at
second row, astonished everyone at the picturesque and historic Danie
Craven stadium in Stellenbosch when he banged over four conversions in a
row, the first one to add the points to his own try, and took a ream of
useable lineout ball.
At 6ft 8in and 116kg, he has been a powerhouse at the touchlines, even
allowing for the fact that, as Aussie forward coach Bob Templeton says,
his pack will not lift jumpers like the South Africans do.
''We play by the rules, and we always will,'' said Templeton.
Eales, stretching his long legs in rest after the Stellenbosch win,
added: ''We want to win by playing with skill and getting control of
games.
''The problem with the opening game against the South Africans was
that we couldn't get control and we made silly mistakes, but things have
been getting steadily better. There's no doubt that as a team we have, a
bit like England, been slow starters, but the win over the Romanians
showed that we are getting into our stride.''
Like his coaches, Eales is dismayed that his team has not been allowed
to ruck and that so many sides have been allowed to ruin possession by
lying on the ball on the ground.
The Aussies have been so concerned at this form of cheating that they
have changed their style of rucking completely. The first Australian
forward at breakdown dives in to get his head in between his own man and
the opposition player trying to go over the ball, and the next forward
drives his team-mate so that the opponent is popped up like a champagne
cork. I wonder if Templeton knows that's against the rules.
''It completely spoils the game when teams try to stop the ball,''
said Eales. ''When we play rugby we want quick possession from open
play, and then we want to release our back division. We have some big
guys who can run, and at the moment all that is happening is that the
ball takes time to come back, if at all. And if we raise a foot to ruck
it's a penalty.''
The Aussies, for all that they appear to be struggling, are, along
with the French and New Zealanders, one of the teams that I would like
to see win, because they play rugby as it should be played. They also
have a slick PR machine. One of their latest feats has been to have an
announcement printed in the Cape Town papers telling the local
population what a lovely city they have and how friendly they have been.
''Back home, we aren't the sort of superstars in our country that the
South Africans are in their own,'' said Eales. ''So, we do actually
appreciate the attention.''
The Springboks don't, their bus goes on to the tarmac at every airport
to whisk them off to their next hotel, leaving hordes of
autograph-hunting youngsters unhappy.
But one of the facets of this World Cup is that it is in the world's
most rugby-mad country, and players are constantly in the public gaze.
Roy Laidlaw and I took Templeton out to dinner on Friday, and he told us
that he and Glen Ella have some of the younger Wallabies wide-eyed in
disbelief with stories of what used to happen on rugby tours, and modern
players wouldn't dare be seen out enjoying themselves mid-tour, despite
the fact that the Aussies have no restrictions placed on them by the
management.
For instance, the extent of the Wallaby celebration after beating
Romania was a private karaoke night. Wow!
The irrepressible David Campese, however, is alleged to have been
stuck in town and jumped into a car to try to get a lift back to the
hotel.
''What on earth are you doing?'' shouted the young mum he had
hi-jacked.
''I'm David Campese,'' replied our hero. ''I'd like a lift to my
hotel.''
''And I'm Brigitte Bardot,'' replied the female. ''Get out of my
car.'' He did, sheepishly.
Eales says that this World Cup has been by far the hardest, and an
indication of that was the resting of the jaded Lynagh and Campese for
the Romanian game, the first World Cup game the pair had missed since
1987.
''You never have to play so many Test matches back to back anywhere
else,'' he said. ''I have found it very taxing. Most of us train in the
gym every day if we can, but now it's good to have a few days rest
before next weekend's games. But I'll keep practising the goal
kicking.''
So the Aussies went. Some of them for a helicopter trip round Cape
Town's famous mountain, others for a trip to South Africa's best-known
jail on Robin Island. And after their rest it's on to the
quarter-finals.
Eales, if his selectors see fit, may, after all, be one Wallaby that
has a kick that's worse than his bite.

Zimbabwe 23, Scotland XV 39
FERGUS Wallace, the GHK flanker and captain of the Scotland XV, will
fly home this evening from Zimbabwe after sustaining a broken ankle on
Saturday in the Test match against the host country at Bulawayo.
Wallace was stretchered off the field halfway through the second half,
but it was only later on Saturday night that the tour party got
confirmation of his injury. The Scotland tour management immediately
requested a replacement player from Scotland, the result of which is
that Derek Turnbull, the 15-times capped flanker from Hawick, will
arrive in Harare today.
A successor to the tour captaincy has yet to be named but it is
expected that the manager, Arthur Hastie, will announce tomorrow the
player who will take over from Wallace to lead the Scotland tourists for
the remainder of their stay in Zimbabwe.
The injury to Wallace -- the first casualty on this current tour --
lessened the joy from winning the first Test against Zimbabwe on
Saturday when the Scots triumphed 39-23. But while there was evident
satisfaction that Scotland scored five tries, David Johnston, the tour
coach, was disappointed by the performance of his side in the second
half.
The Scots had built up a first-half lead of 32-6 after playing quality
running rugby that brought four tries, two of these by Derek Stark and
one apiece by Hugh Gilmour and his Heriot's clubmate Graham Dall.
Stark's first score was achieved in the opening minute from a simple
setpiece move off a scrum. But his second try was much the more
spectacular, the Scotland wing using his immense pace to win the
touchdown from Scott Nichol's deftly placed kick ahead.
Scotland, however, could not maintain the momentum of the first half
and, in a disappointing display after the break, allowed Zimbabwe to
come back into the game, forcing the Scots on to the defensive. ''We
failed to get back in numbers behind the ball and were also slow at
arriving at the breakdown points,'' commented Johnstone who was also
critical of some of the decisions of the Zimbabwe referee Marty Wild,
who refused to allow the Scots to contest the lineouts and who failed to
penalise the Zimbabwe players for persistently coming over the top.
The Scots forwards were thus denied the chance to play their rucking
game and when they attempted to do so they were twice penalised for
stamping.
Yesterday, coaches David Johnston and Hugh Campbell confirmed that
they will meet on Thursday with Wild, who is to be in charge of the
second Test in Harare on Saturday. Clearly it is imperative that the
Scotland coaches clarify Wild's different interpretation of the laws in
the crucial areas of lineout and tackle.
This, of course, was just the tourists' second match in Zimbabwe and
it is perhaps asking a lot that some of the players who have not played
for a couple of months will produce a perfect performance in Test
conditions. On the positive side, the Scotland forwards scrummaged
powerfully and in the first half linked creatively with the backs.
Behind the scrum Scotland worked some clever moves and even in the
second half still contrived to move the ball.
Their one score after the interval came from a pre-planned penalty
move, scrum half Graeme Burns delivering a long pass to full back Rowen
Shepherd for a touchdown under the posts.
Scotland's other points came from stand-off Stuart Laing, who kicked
four conversions, a penalty goal and a dropped goal to bring his tour
total to 31 points. Team:
Scotland XV -- R Shepherd (Edinburgh Academicals); H Gilmour (Heriot's
FP), S Nichol (Selkirk), R Eriksson (London Scottish), D Stark
(Boroughmuir); S Laing (Instonians), G Burns (Stewart's-Melville); A
Watt (GHK), M Scott (Orrell), S Paul (Heriot's FP), I Elliot (Hawick), R
Scott (London Scottish), F Wallace (GHK) captain, S Reid (Boroughmuir),
G Dall (Heriot's FP). Replacement G Flockhart (Stirling County) 64 mins
for Wallace.

England 44, Western Samoa 22
ENGLAND survived the threat of 17 points in 12 minutes by Western
Samoa -- and the need to bring on five replacements -- to take top spot
in pool B and book a quarter-final clash with Australia in Cape Town on
Sunday.
Rory Underwood scored two tries during England's early and late
periods of dominance.
But after being 21-0 up at half-time the game went badly wrong for
England, who had to produce a recovery act as Western Samoa -- who also
go through to the quarter-finals -- put themselves in contention at
24-17 down.
In the end, it was a statistically comfortable win for England, who
because of injuries brought Damien Hopley and John Mallett off the bench
for their first caps. Captain Will Carling, Tim Rodber, Dean Richards,
Graham Rowntree and Neil Back were the men to go off, with a variety of
problems.
England scored heavily in bursts, but the disruption to the team along
with the spirited Western Samoan fightback made it an intriguing Test.
Carling was influential early on in command of a team that fielded
only five of the squad that took the grand slam last winter. England,
however, conceded far too many penalties and were never sure of lineout
possession.
Neil Back scored England's opening try after just 100 seconds and
Jonathan Callard began a sound kicking display with a penalty in rthe
sixteenth minute.
Mike Catt landed a drop goal and Rory Underwood swept over, with
Callard converting and adding a penalty in the first-half injury time.
The interval advantage promised dominance for the rest of the match,
but Western Samoa's replacement stand-off, Fata Sini, came on to score
two tries from free kicks. Tupo Faamasino converted one and landed a
penalty.
In between Callard kicked a penalty before England regained mastery.
Western Samoa conceded a penalty try and Rory Underwood took his
international tally to 45. Callard kicked a couple of penalties and
converted both scores before Mike Umaga ended an all-action match with
an injury-time try.
England -- J Callard (Bath); I Hunter (Northampton), W Carling
(Harlequins), captain, P de Glanville (Bath), R Underwood (Leicester); M
Catt (Bath), C Morris (Orrell); G Rowntree (Leicester), R Dawe (Bath), V
Ubogu (Bath), M Johnson (Leicester), R West (Gloucester), S Ojomoh
(Bath), D Richards (Leicester), N Back (Leicester).
Western Samoa -- M Umaga; B Lima, T Vaega, T Fa'amasino, G Leaupepe; E
Puleitu, T Nu'ualiitia; M Mika, T Leiasamaivao, G Latu, D Williams, L
Falaniko, P Leavasa, P Lam (captain), M Iupeli.
Referee -- P Robin (France).

Pretoria, Sunday
THAT was hard to take. Even now, nearly 24 hours later, I still can't
believe that we lost and, to be honest, I find it difficult even to talk
about.
I was last off the Loftus Versfeld pitch and as I made my way back to
the dressing-room, my mind was swirling as to where it all went wrong.
I've been around for a while and I have never, ever, seen players so
devastated by a result. Usually, I can pick myself up and just get on
with life but that try four minutes into injury time hurt so badly. In
the dressing-room, the look on the players' faces was one of absolute
shock. We were gutted by what had happened.
In a sense, we got a taste of what the French had experienced at Parc
des Princes in February, when we won with a late try. But at least then
the French had the opportunity to come back at us. That chance was
denied us on Saturday night.
I knew as soon as N'Tamack scored that it was over. There was a clock
behind the far posts. I glanced at it and it was reading -2 minutes. The
next time I looked we had played three minutes of overtime and everybody
knew that the try and conversion would be the last act of the game.
Maybe we should have made better use of the possession that we had in
the first 20 or 30 minutes and maybe we should have played a wider game
throughout, but all of that is with the benefit of hindsight. If the
match hadn't run to four minutes of injury time and we had won 19-15,
then everbody would have said what a great game it had been. But that's
not the way that it turned out and we now have to focus on New Zealand.
There's a lot of character in this Scottish side and one thing is for
sure. We don't fear the All Blacks. Since the turn of the year we've got
used to winning. We've played 10 internationals since January and lost
only twice. There's a feeling in the side now that maybe wasn't there
last year, when we were going through that bad spell. That feeling is
that losing hurts.
There's a huge incentive for us to do something that no Scottish side
has ever done and that is to beat the All Blacks.
It's the World Cup and we desperately want to remain in the
tournament. Perhaps even more importantly, we don't want Gavin to retire
on a losing note. He is hanging up his boots when this is all over and,
for someone like him, who has given so much to Scottish rugby, defeat
would not be a fitting way in which to leave the international stage.
The World Cup isn't over for us yet but there's no denying that it is
going to get harder. We have just traded one route for another, more
difficult one.
Our fate lies in our own hands over 80 minutes back at Loftus on
Sunday. And, hopefully, it will be 80 minutes this time! Despite their
record-breaking performance against Japan today, the All Blacks aren't
unbeatable and the feeling within the squad is that, if anybody can do
it, then it just has to be us.
Things in perspective
WHAT happened to us against France was, in a sporting sense, a tragedy
but in the real world it wasn't.
As I'm putting this together we hear that the Ivory Coast winger Max
Brito is lying paralysed from the neck down in a Pretoria hospital bed.
Brito was hurt playing against Tonga on Saturday afternoon. He faces the
rest of his life in a wheelchair. That is a genuine tragedy and it puts
into perspective the feelings of gloom that we have over the defeat by
France.

FRANCE have called up scrum-half Fabien Galthie and No 8 Albert
Cigagna as replacements to their World Cup squad following injuries to
Guy Accoceberry and Philippe Benetton.
Accoceberry and Benetton both suffered arm fractures in France's
dramatic 22-19 victory over Scotland in Saturday's final Pool D match in
Pretoria.
Benetton, who has a broken right arm and will need to undergo surgery,
will return to France today.
Accoceberry's left arm fracture is less serious and squad officials
were hoping the French Federation would allow him to stay with the squad
for the remainder of the tournament.
Galthie, the 26-year-old captain of French club Colomiers, has
appeared 14 times for his country and is currently playing for a South
African club.
Cicagna, 34, plays for French champions Toulouse and has been regarded
for many years as one of the best No 8s never to have played
international rugby.
* ENGLAND A's late fightback during their Australian tour failed to
save them crashing to their third successive defeat, 28-23 against New
South Wales County at Grahame Park, Gosford yesterday.
Trailing 28-11 with just three minutes remaining, England bounced back
to grab two tries and a conversion and narrowly fail to end their losing
run.
Rookie Andrew Harding, who has never represented the Illawarra region,
caused constant problems with his place kicks and ran proficiently to
earn the man-of-the-match award while wingers Ian Tonkin and Nathan
Friss put the hosts on top with a try apiece in the first half to give
County a 15-8 interval advantage.
England A fought back in the closing stages of the half but only had a
try from prop Kevin Yates and a penalty from acting skipper Paul Grayson
to show for their efforts.
Inside centre Tim Eddy grabbed three penalties after the break, while
second row forward Gordon McQueen touched down to give County a 28-11
lead with just three minutes remaining.
But England rallied at the finale and flanker Derek Evens crossed and
Grayson narrowed the margin to five points by converting a fine solo try
by winger Steve Hackney.

Ireland 24, Wales 23
IRELAND will play France in the World Cup quarter-finals while Wales
will fly home to face fresh recriminations and soul-searching after a
patchy display.
Welsh passion emerged only late in the second half and Ireland's two
tries in the first 13 minutes ultimately proved decisive.
Shoddy defensive work allowed Ireland their early tries and for the
first hour, Wales' play was littered with elementary mistakes.
Irish fly half Eric Elwood, erratic in defeat against New Zealand and
sidelined against Japan, missed a chance to put his team ahead in the
first minute with a wide penalty from 23 yards -- one of his three
missed penalties on the night.
But a pinpoint 50-yard touch kick to within a yard of the Welsh
try-line set up an Irish lineout win. Prop Nick Popplewell powered over
from the resultant maul and Elwood converted to give Ireland a 7-0 lead
after five minutes.
Irish flank Denis McBride then ripped away a lineout from Wales a few
minutes later and sprinted 40 yards -- falling once and regaining his
feet -- to score Ireland's second try, again converted by Elwood.
With a 14-0 lead after only eight minutes, Ireland were always in the
driving seat and although they were under increasing pressure, they held
the whip hand until the end.
Wales' late rally brought a seventy-second minute score by hooker
Jonathan Humphreys and finally -- deep in injury time -- a second try
from flanker Hemi Taylor from a tap penalty.
But Neil Jenkins' conversion was the last kick of the match and, with
the Welsh players sinking to their knees in despair, the Irish set off
on a jubilant lap of the ground.
Fly half Elwood's seventy-seventh minute penalty had given them an
eight-point advantage following Humphrey's try and Taylor's effort --
spirited though it was -- did not really matter.
Why the Welsh took so long to raise themselves in what was such a
vital match will long remain a mystery.
The Welsh management has constantly built up their players before and
during this tournament but now, after defeats against both New Zealand
and Ireland, Welsh rugby faces yet another period of self-analysis.
Ireland were gifted their flying start by unbelievably poor work by
the Welsh defence.
First prop Popplewell was driven over on the peel after Neil Francis
had claimed a lineout.
Then McBride, taking the ball unopposed at the tail of a lineout,
first drove on into the Welsh midfield and then, after first falling on
to one knee as a tackle came in, promptly got back up to sprint through
a huge hole in the Welsh ranks to touch down beneath the posts.
Neil Jenkins, usually so dependable with the boot, seemed to sum up
the Welsh malaise by slicing horribly a fifteenth minute penalty.
But at least he was successful with his next effort, in the
twenty-eighth minute, and on the stroke of half-time, fly half Adrian
Davies dropped a goal from 30 yards.
Then, in the fifty-first minute, a second Jenkins penalty cut
Ireland's lead further to 14-9 -- and the Irish were stung into raising
their game again.
Eddie Halvey, who came on after 64 minutes to replace McBride, claimed
the third Irish try five minutes later after a series of drives. Elwood
converted and at 21-9 the match seemed over.
But then, incongruously, came Wales's big effort -- and it became a
classic case of too little too late.
The result was a particular disappointment for Robert Jones, who won
his fifty-third cap to overtake Gareth Edwards as Wales's most-capped
scrum-half.
Wales, semi finalists in 1987, suffered their second defeat in three
matches and will return home. They also failed to make it past the first
round in 1991.
''We've only got ourselves to blame,'' said Jones. ''In the first 20
minutes, particularly, we didn't compete.''
The Irish maintained their record of having qualified for the quarter
finals at all three World Cup tournaments.
''The lads really deserved the win,'' said Irish captain Terry
Kingston. ''It could be one of the most important games Ireland has ever
played. It was one we had to win.''
For the Irish, it made up for a narrow defeat by Wales in the 1987
World Cup but they will need to raise their game markedly to upset the
French in Durban on Saturday. Scorers:
Ireland: Tries -- Nick Popplewell, Denis McBride, Eddie Halvey;
Conversions -- Eric Elwood (3); Penalty -- Elwood.
Wales: Tries -- Jonathan Humphreys, Hemi Taylor; Conversions -- Neil
Jenkins (2); Penalties -- Neil Jenkins (2); Dropped goals -- Adrian
Davies.

Italy 31, Argentina 25
FLY half Diego Dominguez scored 21 points, including a late try off an
Argentina mistake, to lead Italy to a 31-25 victory yesterday over the
Pumas in the Rugby World Cup finale for both sides.
Both sides were winless going into their last pool B match and had no
chance of making the quarter-finals, but hard play and some inspired
running by the Italians made for a spirited game.
''We proved we can play rugby at a high level,'' said Italian captain
Massimo Cuttitta, tossing another hint of Italy's wish to join the Five
Nations championship that currently involves England, France, Ireland,
Scotland, and Wales.
The first half ended at 12-12, with Argentinian-born but long-time
Italian resident Dominguez kicking four penalties in four attempts for
Italy while Argentina scored two tries, including a penalty try awarded
by referee Clayton Thomas of Wales, and one of two conversions by Jose
Cilley. Flank Rolando Martin scored the other try from a maul near the
Italian line.
Cilley also missed a penalty as the powerful Argentine forwards
repeatedly secured possession and pushed into Italian territory. Italy
used deep kicks and running pressure to force Argentine penalties
exploited by the accurate booting of Dominguez.
In the second half, Italy scored tries by Paulo Vaccari and Mario
Gerosa to gain a 12-point lead, but Argentina came back on tries by
Matias Corral and Cilley and a Cilley penalty to lead 25-24 in the
closing minutes.
Then a handling error deep in the Argentine zone allowed Dominguez to
dive over for a final try that he converted, sealing the victory.
The only kick Dominguez, winning his twenty-fifth Italian cap, missed
was with the conversion of a try by Mario Gerosa, another of Italy's
Argentine-born players.
Cilley missed three conversions and a penalty that would have given a
victory to Argentina, who lost two of their three matches in the final
minutes and were also victimized by poor kicking in an opening 24-18
defeat by England.
About 12,000 people, including vocal supporters of both sides who
waved flags and sang, attended the final World Cup match at
15,447-capacity Basil Kenyon Stadium.

Australia 42, Romania 3
TEENAGE winger Joe Roff scored twice as Australia thrashed Romania
42-3 in their final World Cup pool A match in Stellenbosch on Saturday.
The defending champions were again not entirely convincing in the
early exchanges but picked up the pace in the second-half after leading
14-3 at the break.
Wallaby stalwarts Michael Lynagh, David Campese, Phil Kearns and Jason
Little will all be back for the more serious action when Australia
contest their quarter-final at Newlands in a week's time, but coach Bob
Dwyer is still waiting for his team to live up to their undoubted
potential.
Romania took the lead after 13 minutes, a drop goal by Ilie Ivanciuc
capping an impressive spell of pressure, and they continued to play the
better rugby until Australia's forwards belatedly got their act
together.
Hooker Michael Foley, starting a Test for the first time, barged over
for the opening try in the twenty-eighth minute before the Wallaby backs
conjured a try several notches up from the team's overall performance.
Roff's opening try came after a searing break by centre Daniel
Herbert, who threw an overhead basketball-style pass to let the
19-year-old in for his second try of the tournament.
Roff's second score, the third in two Tests for the 19-year-old from
Canberra, came when he powered past a clutch of defenders to touch down
in the corner.
Full back Matthew Burke, wing Damien Smith and flanker David Wilson
scored tries late in the match as the Australians took control and the
kicking of forward John Eales ensured Romania finished their World Cup
campaign well beaten.
Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer admitted that his side was short of confidence
and would delay selecting his quarter-final side to assess all his
possible options.
Dwyer concedes the world champions have played only in fits and starts
since arriving in South Africa as pre-tournament favourites.
''We're playing like a team without a great deal of confidence. We're
feeling our way and hoping things will go well, but there haven't been
too many 80-minute performances from anyone in the tournament yet.''

NEW Zealand broke records galore yesterday in their 145-17 success
against Japan, but what they did not break was the resolve of Scotland,
their opponents in the quarter-final of the Rugby World Cup.
The All Blacks gorged themselves against the hapless Japanese, scoring
a record 21 trys, but the size of the victory came as no surprise to the
Scottish camp, and merely served to underline everything that they knew
about the World Cup favourites.
New Zealand showed the clinical ruthlessness against Japan which has,
thus far, been missing from their performances in this tournament.
''It was impressive but it wasn't unexpected,'' said Scotland
assistant-coach Richie Dixon. ''Japan didn't tackle and they didn't have
any possession and in circumstances like that, the New Zealanders are
very difficult to stop.
''It doesn't tell us anything about our game. Japan never really had
the ball and, let's be honest, they never got into a contest. There were
a number of New Zealanders making their first appearances and they will
have been desperate to put themselves into the frame for future
selection.''
Dixon added: ''We have to be realistic and accept that next Sunday
will be a tough assignment, but if Scotland can play as well as we did
against France, there is no reasosn to think that the All Blacks are
unbeatable.''
New Zealand will decide Scotland's destiny in the tournament at the
Loftus Versfeld stadium in Pretoria. But even in the immediate aftermath
of Saturday night's defeat by a French side which was full of guile and
character, the Scottish high command refused to countenance the thought
that their World Cup is over.
The captain, Gavin Hastings, coach Dougie Morgan, and manager Duncan
Paterson, had the bitter legacy of that last-second defeat etched on
every line of their drawn faces as they trooped in to face the world's
media after the match.
Hastings, who was too upset to give the instant post-match interview,
has been here before, Jonathan Callard having kicked the stuffing out of
the Scots in the last moment of the 1994 Calcutta Cup encounter.
The captain was asked how he felt. No reply was necessary but answer
he did: ''I've felt better. We are very shell-shocked. I still can't
believe that we've lost the game but that shows the capability of the
French team to score tries, and I guess we are feeling what the French
felt a few weeks ago in Paris.''
Morgan was equally disbelieving of the turn of events which had robbed
Scotland of victory. ''We turned around 13-3 up and that was satisfying
all of us at that stage,'' he said. ''What we needed to do in the second
half was take the game more to them. Having said that there are some
things you don't deserve, and we didn't deserve to be beaten in that
game.''
Hastings, the pain of it all increasing as the interrogation
continued, added: ''Just as Dougie has said, to have a game that is
snatched from you at the last second is the extreme disappointment.
''Duncan came into the changing room afterwards and said that we've
still got a game next weekend. After a shower the disappointment will
get slightly less and we just have to go out next week and play the game
of our lives, but we will make history by becoming the first Scottish
side to beat the All Blacks.''
With the sweat still drying on his brow, the Scottish captain
attempted an analysis of how it had gone. ''In the first half the way
the forwards took the game to France was superb. We scored a try in the
dying seconds of the first half but we could have had another couple.
''The lineout play was good and the scrummage was pretty solid. We
caused the French an awful lot of problems and it is difficult for us to
fathom just how we lost the game but it lasts as long as the referee
decides.
''There was a lot of injury time played and they scored right at the
death. We're pretty shell-shocked.''
Paterson added: ''I think we did enough to win. We are disappointed
but that is different to feeling sorry for yourselves. The
disappointment will ebb as the evening goes on, and we will pick
ourselves up and give it a real go next week.
''There is a lot of character in this side and we are not out of the
World Cup. We've lost a very important game but we're not out yet.''
Back at the team hotel, the Scots were still finding it hard to come
to terms with defeat. Paterson likened the result to having: ''half your
life savings stolen. But,'' he added, ''there is tremendous spirit and
character in this side, and if anybody can beat the All Blacks, they
can.''
Scotland have never defeated New Zealand in 100 years. The 17-match
series stands at 15 wins for the Kiwis and two draws.
Scotland came close -- 21-18 -- with the Grand Slam side in Auckland
in 1990. Paterson was manager then and yesterday he was reiterating that
the current crop of Scots had the spirit and character to go one better.
Scott Hastings agreed: ''None of us has beaten the All Blacks in a
Scotland jersey. Gavin has done it with a World XV but there is huge
incentive for us now. We will go out next weekend and become the first
Scottish side to do it.
Rob Wainwright, perhaps the pick of the Scotland side on Saturday
night, was equally adamant that the Scots could win the quarter-final
against the Kiwis and continue their interest in this tournament.
''We tried to sit on our lead against the French in the last 10
minutes, but came unstuck. We certainly didn't deserve to lose that game
but now we have to pick ourselves up, which we can do, and come back to
beat the All Blacks.''

PAY rises are holding steady at 3% with few signs of a take-off in
settlements, according to a report today.
Basic pay deals have been pegged at 3% for five months in a row,
marginally below the rate of inflation, said Industrial Relations
Services.
The survey of 1100 settlements found that six out of 10 employers are
giving workers higher rises than a year ago.
Most settlements in April, the busiest month in the pay calendar, were
for 3%, although one in four saw rises of 3.5% or more.

THE Government has been worrying about pensions for a long time. It is
still doing so. And it is right to worry because we currently have over
10 million people who are retired and the numbers are growing.
The remainder of the population over and above the 10 million will,
all being well, retire sooner or later and expect to get a pension.
One of the things which worries those people who think about them is
the ageing trend of the population. World Bank statistics show that in
1990 some 20.8% of the UK's population was aged over 60. The proportion
was last year projected to grow to 23% by 2010 and 29.6% by 2030.
The problem is how can the State ensure that they do not go hungry.
Most people realise that National Insurance is not really an insurance
contribution to pay for a pension and should probably be reclassified as
a social security tax. Effectively the money goes into the pot along
with income tax and all the many taxes on almost everything that moves.
State pensions are basically unfunded and are paid out of the year's
revenues plus borrowings. In the late 1970s the basic State retirement
pension was 20% of average male earnings. Earnings were, however, rising
faster than prices as measured by the Retail Price Index (RPI) so the
basis was quietly changed in 1980 to rise in line with RPI.
The facts of industrial life being as they are earnings, are likely to
continue to increase rather faster than the RPI index and a study
published by the Association of British Insurers suggests that it will
be less than 9% of average male earnings by 2020.
That clearly is an unattractive prospect -- both politically for
future governments and personally for all the people who will year by
year cross from employment into retirement and would like to be able to
live reasonably comfortably without having to get up at six o'clock in
the morning to do a paper round.
The Government has had one go at trying to make people provide for
their old age -- the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme and did not
like it. From its attempt to get out of the difficulties we have all the
current problems besetting the insurance and pensions industry over
allegations of mis-selling and so on and the big claims for
compensation.
It just may have another attempt. There is a suggestion that the
Government may be contemplating introducing a new compulsory scheme for
people to save in a non-government vehicle for their old age.
One insurance expert commented: ''The Government will have an
increasingly hard time providing for old age. That will pressure people
to provide for themselves.''
He added optimistically: ''That should make the insurance industry
look pretty good because it should play a big part in this. Funds will
effectively be directed our way. I have a feeling that the Government is
only waiting for the industry to get its house in order.''
The insurance industry is currently facing two big problems. As well
as the the claims for alleged wrongful selling of pension products it
has the impact of the new rules for disclosing commission which have
been hitting sales. Over the industry sales are believed to be heading
for a 25% fall this year on top of a 15% drop last year.
Just how if it happens workers would be required to pay into private
pension schemes is not clear. In Chile a contribution is compulsory but
the employee can choose between competing funds -- a situation which is
reckoned to have produced better returns than state-run provident funds
operated in some other countries.
Pensions are a complicated area beset with tight regulations from the
Inland Revenue. The Government has begun to remove some of the unhappy
consequences which can flow from the taxman's rules as they relate to
personal pensions.
It would be nice if any new rules for providing for your pension could
find some substitute to having ultimately to sink all your pension money
into an annuity. The only reason for making an annuity a requirement
seems to be that this is an easy way of ensuring that the income from
the pot of money accumulated by the saver is caught in the income tax
net.
The Revenue says this is in return for tax concessions given when the
money was originally invested in the pension fund. But if the Government
gives tax concessions to encourage people to provide for themselves by
putting money into what are usually share-based investments is it fair
for them to say the cash has to go into an annuity, equivalent to a
fixed interest investment when the saver retires simply so that it can
collect income tax?
And, of course, an annuity dies with the pensioner who cannot leave it
to his or her heirs. The annuity provider, usually an insurance company,
keeps what is left.
The new flexible pension rules help but there are still plenty of
disadvantages.

FIRST again.
New ground has again been broken on the little farm on the hill.
We had the first water-closet in Aberdeenshire, we sold the first
heifer with a CCD and our forage harvester scrambled the eggs of the
last corncraik east of Rothiemurchus. Now we are the first to cut
oilseed rape in May.
Unfortunately, I have to admit, that this is another of my firsts
which is something less than a triumph.
As you know we have to set-aside a large area of our ancestral acres
if we want to qualify for the money the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
puts the way of we needy farmers.
Last year, 15% of what would have been combinable crops was left idle.
This year only 13% must be left to the weeds and the wildlife but there
they are, over 20 of my ancestral acres growing (mostly) volunteer crops
of wheat.
Those acres are not all loss. They save the CAP a lot of money in
disposing of unwanted food. I get paid more than #100 an acre (about a
third of the gross margin I dream of getting from my barley or rape). I
spray the set-aside to kill a host of persistent weeds which only
growing potatoes used to control.
On top of that, I can sow my set-aside when we are waiting for
harvest. What a boon that was last year. The rape that had to wait for
harvest went into a very dry bed and fell well behind the earlier sown
set-aside.
But, to qualify for set-aside you have to follow the rules carefully,
and that isn't my strong suit.
The plan was sound enough. I would leave an acre of one of the home
fields for a cornyard. I instructed the contractor, the Man of Few
Words, to leave such an area. ''Uh-huh,'' he assented.
Quite sensibly he left the gushet, that awkward bit you get in all
Aberdeenshire's fields because they are never square. In the gushet the
drills get shorter and shorter and you do more and more turning and do
more and more damage to the crop. If they could, everyone would set
their gushets aside.
Unfortunately one of the many rules of set-aside is that it has to be
at least 20 metres across. It is no use averaging 20 metres.
If the department spies were to find that my set-aside was too thin I
could lose all my subsidies. (What cattlemen sometimes call ''an
undisclosed five-figure sum''.)
I could have chanced it but my native honesty militated against that.
And so did the fact that they check one-in-five forms, appearing on the
farm with maps, compasses and measuring wheels.
And so it was that I was the first to cut rape this year. I had to
make my set-aside up to 20 metres wide by cutting down some of my
beautiful crop of oilseed rape.
I used my grass-topper and it made a first-rate job. But I didn't
enjoy it. It was sad to see the burgeoning, yellow froth laid so low and
so green. And it was particularly frustrating to be going to all that
trouble just to recreate a gushet.
Mossie's having his troubles too. He is going to have to redrill his
sunflowers.
You will recall that he has confounded the critics for the last two
years by growing crops of 25,000 Happy Faces per acre and selling them
to the shops and as Pick-Your-Own at a #1 a bloom.
This has been hard for we jealous neighbours to bear and we are glad
to be able to report that the cold weather looks like beating him this
year.
The crop has been very slow to come which has given the yellowhammers
(who eat the seeds) time to pick them clean whenever the little
cotyledons appear. They sit on the hydro wires high above the field and
whenever anything stirs in the field below -- Bang! Down they come to
scoff it.
It happened last year too, but then they all came up together and
enough escaped. This year nothing. And you can't shoot yellowhammers as
they are not a pest species -- though I wouldn't advise you to tell
Mossie that.
And there's more.
He was over the other day in a state of some excitement. It wasn't:
''It's nae for me to say but blaw blaw blaw . . . '' It was
''Disaaaster! That frost has aborted all the winter barley.''
''Oh come away, Moss,'' says I, ''everybody can see, the winter crops
have never looked better.''
''Aye that's what they all think because all they ever see is a blur
as they drive past. It's only when you go into the crops and if you know
what you're looking for that you see disasters like this.''
And he showed me a handful of barley heads. At first sight they seemed
to be remarkably far advanced, beginning to turn even. Look closer. The
lighter colour comes from empty heads.
''You think you're doing well and then -- Bang! Nature hits you on the
chin. I've that all over and you've got it tae,'' said the honorary
consultant.
He's right of course but only in one field and only about 10% of the
heads are affected.
He says it's much worse at Moss-side where it is less exposed than on
our braes, but I suspect he's just building up an excuse for harvest
time.

IMITATION, it is said, is the sincerest form of flattery. If that be
the case then the Highland Cattle Society is paying the Aberdeen Angus
breed the biggest compliment they could think of.
It wants to build itself up to the same ''brand name'' status that
Aberdeen Angus has achieved. On taste and eating quality it believes the
Highlander can beat the Aberdeen Angus.
For the moment most of us would have to take them at their word. The
beef from Highland steers is not generally available -- even in the
quality High Street independent butchers which cater for the top end of
the market.
There is a kind of mystique about Highlander beef. Such trade as
exists is almost an under-the-counter operation -- a bit like Corporal
Jones of Dad's Army slipping in something extra with the ration book
supplies.
If you really want to try it out you would be advised to go to Forres
where a farmer/butcher makes a point of stocking it whenever possible.
Nearer home -- for those of us based in the central belt -- is Glamis
Castle. We know that beasts from that fold are occasonally disposed of
through ''a local butcher''.
David Soutar, farm manager for the Strathmore Farming Company, would
be drawn no further last week. The cattle are killed, butchered and the
word gets around. Thereafter the meat is snapped up by aficionados who,
presumably, then have to wait a full year before they can repeat the
experience.
Glamis was chosen as the launch-pad for announcing the Highlanders'
plans to create a niche market for their meat. The society will also be
pleased to disabuse the public of the view that the Highland cow is more
ornamental than practical.
It has, of course, been a great favourite with hobby farmers, and the
public, but it remains a rugged beast, capable of surviving mainly on
rough grazing, which makes it ''ecologically friendly''. With its thick
hide and hairy coat it can also withstand the foulest weather.
At Glamis, David Soutar has a small fold -- about 16-strong -- which
doubles as a tourist attraction and a most efficient lawnmower, keeping
the grassy areas nearest to the castle neatly cropped. However, he
contends that they are commercial and can give him a return comparable
to, if not better than, any other enterprise on the farm.
What then is the way forward for this ancient breed. In marketing
terms the society is starting from scratch. The meat is generally
unavailable and is not likely to be available in quantity even when the
society gets its marketing act together.
Step forward Alastair Massie, Aberdeen-based food consultant, who has
been working on the problem along with the Robert Owen Foundation.
The answer, he suggests, is to make a virtue out of the scarcity
angle. Highland beef could be marketed as the most expensive in the
world -- appearing on the menus of the best restaurants. The roasts and
fillet steaks, he assures us all, are extremely tender and tasty. Like
good, malt whisky they could be marketed as appealing to those with a
discerning palate.
The place to start the marketing exercise would be with the likes of
the Q Guild butchers -- suppliers to good local hotels and restaurants.
Mr Massie's view is that the Highlanders have a unique selling point,
being as near to ''natural'' beef as it is possible to get.
All of this sets a challenge to the breed society. At present it is
reckoned that there are about 4500 Highland cows in the UK -- but the
biggest percentage of them belong to non-farmers. The commercial edge
may be blurred, but on the Island of Mull about one-third of all cattle
will be Highlanders -- because they thrive well in the conditions there.
In some parts of Scotland they would be the only breed likely to
survive on the grazing available. With increasing emphasis on ''green''
credentials and low inputs this could be the best of times to consider a
re-launch on a commercial basis.
Already there are said to be signs that some farmers in the north of
Scotland are seeing Highland cattle in a new light. More herds are being
established and some of the larger estates are showing an interest.
That interest is mirrored worldwide and later this month about 200
breeders from 15 countries will participate in the society's first
international gathering. They will come from Europe, North America, New
Zealand and Australia for a two-day conference at which they will share
their experience of working with the breed. They will also visit a
number of herds, including that maintained at Balmoral by the Queen --
patron of the Highland Cattle Society.
Society president Archie McArthur can list the breed's achievements in
Scandinavia, Holland, Germany, Denmark, Austria and Switzerland. In
Canada, America and New Zealand, they have found an important role to
play in low-cost beef production.
The day may be dawning when the Highland cow will mean more to us all
than a pretty picture on a bar of toffee.

<HEADLINE>Warning of poorer prospects for pig producers</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>MIKE INGHAM</BYLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>16</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>978043053</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A HINT of poorer prospects for pig producers can be detected in
reports of unease among leaders of the UK industry.
The British Pig Association is apparently warning farmers to think
more carefully before starting a new cycle of herd expansion.
The general outlook is still bright, with MLC analysts talking of
sustained price strength. BPA executives broadly agree that the trade
will stay tight, but they are beginning to express doubts.
One worrying market signal is the April pig census result in Denmark.
It shows pig numbers in most categories larger than a year earlier, with
an especially strong increase in the weaner tally.
''This is particularly worrying from the producers' point of view
because the return to expansion has happened earlier than expected,''
said Grenville Welsh of the BPA. ''The Danes will clearly have more pigs
to sell over the next few months, although naturally we hope the Germans
will take most of them.''
A Danish production increase would probably not be sufficient in
itself to push prices lower across the European Union but the Germans,
too, have a habit of turning their industry round quickly, so there is
an outside chance of the whole Continental cycle swinging faster than
anticipated.
Even that would not necessarily bring tougher times for British
producers if sterling remained weak, keeping a floor under the export
trade. Supplies from the UK industry will probably remain tight in any
case.
Slaughterings are well down from 12 months ago and farm survey
results, due in the next couple of weeks, will almost certainly show
breeding herd contraction. Even there the indicators are contradictory.
The sow cull is still very heavy, running at well over 7000 in some
recent weeks. The crucial question is whether this reflects herd
contraction, which would be a good omen for pig prices, or whether
producers are taking advantage of the high sow prices caused by strong
demand both from exporters and from UK meat product manufacturers
finding beef scarce and expensive.
''My instincts are that the pull is higher prices,'' said Mr Welsh.
That belief forms the basis of the BPA's concern. If producers are
selling sows because the price is so attractive, they may have both the
inclination and the money to replace them with younger breeding stock
rather than leave output capacity reduced.
There is a feeling within the BPA that a strong sow replacement trend
has developed, even though it is not likely to be visible in the April
farm survey figures. Very strong prices in the market for gilts suggest
this is happening although the values may have been bloated by shortages
resulting from the weak market last year.
Sooner or later the market will soften. The Meat and Livestock
Commission and the BPA agree that it will stay buoyant through 1995 but
the BPA's opinion is now noticeably less optimistic than the MLCs.

<HEADLINE>Governor unlikely to get rate rise past Chancellor</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MOST economists now expect interest rates to remain unchanged after
Wednesday's monthly monetary meeting between Bank of England Governor
Eddie George and Chancellor Kenneth Clarke.
However, opinion remains divided, with a minority still forecasting a
rate hike.
The Bank of England's case for increasing base rates from their
current level of 6.75%, to support sterling, is probably still intact.
However, the Chancellor will focus on the housing market, retail sales
and consumer spending, which remain undeniably weak.
Adam Cole, UK economist at broker James Capel, believes the chances of
the Bank of England getting a rate rise past the Chancellor on Wednesday
are slim.
The meeting between Mr Clarke and the Governor will be the main event
in a relatively quiet week for economic statistics.
Narrow money supply data, due today, is unlikely to have any great
bearing on Wednesday's meeting.
The consensus forecast is for a 0.6% rise in M0 during May, which
would increase the annual rate of money supply growth from 6.2% to 6.4%.
However, Capel is forecasting a 0.1% fall in M0, which would reduce the
annual rate to 5.7%.
Meanwhile, the City expects figures on Thursday to show that both
industrial production and manufacturing output grew by about 0.5% during
April.
With a big monthly rise last April dropping out of the equation, the
annual rate of growth of total production is expected to fall from 5% to
about 3.5%, with that of manufacturing output declining from 3.8% to
about 3%.
Also on Thursday, the Confederation of British Industry releases its
distributive trades survey for May.
The following day, figures for March are expected to reveal a slight
narrowing of the UK's visible trade deficit with the rest of the world
to about #1000m.
TODAY -- M0 figures (May -- provisional).
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- None announced.
THURSDAY -- Index of production (April).
FRIDAY -- Balance of visible trade (March).

<HEADLINE>KPMG report shows dramatic increase in Scottish insolvencies</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978043055</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PERSONAL insolvencies and company liquidations in Scotland rose
sharply during the first quarter of this year reflecting a possible
squeeze on small businesses, accountants KPMG said.
Personal insolvencies in Scotland increased by 20% to 649 from 538 in
the last quarter of 1994, while company liquidations rose 35% to 137
from 101.
A rising trend was also evident in year-on-year figures.
Personal insolvencies were 24.3% up on the first quarter of 1994,
while company liquidations were 15.1% higher.
The bad news follows an earlier KPMG announcement that 32 Scottish
companies went into receivership during the first three months of this
year, up from 21 in the last quarter of 1994.
Corporate recovery partner Blair Nimmo said the sharp increase in
business failures could be a blip in what has so far been a downward
trend in receiverships throughout the UK.
But the rise in receiverships to levels last seen in 1993 might also
reflect a squeeze on small businesses that find it difficult to pass on
rising costs to their customers, he added.
''There is no doubt that many smaller companies are still finding
trading very tough,'' Mr Nimmo said, noting that the construction,
textile and retail sectors were particularly hard hit.
''They are finding it very difficult to pass on price increases and
therefore to improve margins,'' he added.
On a more positive note, Mr Nimmo said many middle-sized companies had
emerged from the recession leaner, better run and hungry for
acquisitions.
He reported ''very high levels of interest'' in companies with a good
core business to be saved where KPMG had been appointed as receiver.

FIVE water companies announce a deluge of results this week.
Attention will focus on their dividend policy after North West Water's
decision to share its bumper profits with customers as well as
shareholders.
North West has promised to pay a special dividend of #3.80 per share,
complemented by a refund of #6.50 per customer for the next five years.
''The story for water companies has always been dividends . . . the
question now is whether there are any more NWW-style deals,'' said
Andrew Stone of Daiwa Securities.
Anglian Water kicks off the run of water company results today.
Analysts forecast a pre-tax profit of #217m to #234m, up from #192.2m
previously, with the dividend rising to 25p from 22.8p.
Thames Water, forecast to report a profit of #300m to #307m up from
#241.7m, follows tomorrow.
But the water company considered most likely to announce a North
West-type dividend plus rebate package is Yorkshire Water, which reports
on Wednesday.
Yorkshire's pre-tax profits are seen rising to a range of #153m to
#186m from #143.5m with the dividend increasing to 28p from 25.4p.
''They have strong financials, but it is politically difficult to give
huge dividend growth year on year,'' said Michael Cohen of Salomon
Brothers.
Northumbrian Water, which is fending off a hostile bid from Lyonnaise
des Eaux of France, is likely to propose a generous dividend on Thursday
to sweeten its present shareholders and convince them that the company
is well-run.
Analysts see Northumbrian declaring a payout of more than 28p after
24.3p last year, with profits climbing to #86m to #92m from #62.8m
previously.
Welsh Water rounds off the torrent of water company results on Friday
and is widely tipped to offer customer rebates.
Although profits might well be down on last year's #144.2m, analysts
say the company still has room to increase its dividend to about 28p
from 25.4p previously.
''Welsh Water has seemed to feel clamped on dividends in the past,
possibly because Wales has a high number of opposition members of
parliament,'' said Philip Hollobone of Williams de Broe.
Other highlights include today's results from British Airports
Authority (BAA).
There has been a surge in traffic at BAA's seven airports, but
analysts warn that profits could be held back by construction work. Most
see a pre-tax profit of about #366m up from #322m last year.
''They will have strong traffic growth, but the retail side was
affected by construction work going on at several major terminals and
that will have knocked the retail side a bit,'' said Nick Ward at
NatWest Markets.
Granada is expected to report pre-tax profits of #139m to #155m on
Wednesday, up from #103m last year, with powerful contributions from its
television and catering divisions.
The group's next move is expected to be a European catering
acquisition. There is strong speculation that Granada will pay #550m for
the non-French activities of Eurest, a subsidiary of the Paris-based
Accor hotel group.
Glass manufacturer Pilkington is seen improving to #125m to #156m on
Friday from #97.8m last time.

LORD Weinstock's cash-rich GEC is this week believed to be poised to
re-enter the battle for submarine-builder VSEL.
The electronics and defence giant has until June 13 to bid again, but
it is understood its management is anxious to respond quickly to British
Aerospace's #678m offer announced last week.
There is a growing belief in the City that GEC will go for a knockout
bid in an attempt to outgun BAe. Some analysts in the City estimate it
will have to offer at least #800m to win the day. Analysts believe the
battle is not just for VSEL, but for the prize of being the UK's
principal defence group.
BAe's renewed offer for the Barrow-based company came just over a week
after the President of the Board of Trade, Michael Heseltine, said both
BAe and GEC were free to relaunch their assaults on the company.
The BAe share offer values each VSEL share at #17.47 -- #2.47 higher
than its revised offer in November shortly before BAe's and GEC's rival
bids were referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Last month Mr Heseltine revealed he had overruled the MMC finding that
the GEC offer should be blocked on public interest grounds. The
commission concluded the BAe approach was not against the public
interest, but it believed the bid by GEC was because the group would
control two of the three remaining warship yards. GEC already owns
Yarrow on the Clyde.
BAe is offering VSEL shareholders 3.3 new BAe shares or a cash
alternative of #16 per VSEL share -- #2 higher than its previous cash
terms. The group said to fund the cash offer it would call on the money
raised from a two-part #553m rights issue of new shares. The offer is
conditional on the approval of BAe shareholders.
VSEL has become even more attractive to BAe and GEC since the
sumbarine-builder released annual profits figures last week showing its
cash pile had grown to #411m from #322m in the previous 12 months.

<HEADLINE>Housing market to remain in doldrums for rest of the year</HEADLINE>

THE generally gloomy prognosis on the housing market remains in place
for this year and there also doubts about next year although both the
Halifax and Nationwide building societies are looking for some
improvement in house prices in 1996.
The Government is now considering a number of possible options to help
those hundreds of thousands of housebuyers locked into negative equity,
particularly in South-east England. Scotland was never as badly
affected, it is mostly a southern England phenomenon.
The Chancellor may well try to introduce some sort of tax relief in
his next Budget which might provide some impetus to the market, albeit
the Government's own actions on tax reliefs have contributed to the
present situation.
Consumers are still uneasy, anyway, about job security. The so-called
''feel-good'' factor seems as far away as ever throughout the UK.
Leading City investment bank Morgan Grenfell, in a report out today
assessing the housing market, also reckons that prices will remain in
the doldrums for the rest of this year but should then begin to creep up
and by 1997 will be rising faster than inflation.
However, it rules out any repeat of the explosion in prices seen in
the late 1980s and considers that even a mini-boom seems highly unlikely
before the end of the decade. But it does suggest that the outlook for
the housing market and the more than one-million householders trapped in
negative equity is brighter than suggested by some recent gloomy
forecasts.
In particular, Professor Douglas Wood of the Manchester Business
School has predicted that a combination of low inflation, reduced tax
incentives for home-ownership, job insecurity and the decline of the
full-time career would result in a steady fall in the real,
inflation-adjusted, value of houses over the next 20 years.
The Morgan Grenfell economists, among the more bearish house price
forecasters in recent years, agree, however, that the short-term outlook
is grim. ''Both house prices and turnover are below year-ago levels and
mortgage lending is falling -- the housing market can best be described
as stagnating,'' says the report.
''With the latest round of tax increases having only just come into
force and a possible further rise in interest rates over the summer, the
team have cut their, albeit previously modest, forecast for house prices
for the year to the fourth quarter to zero (from 2%).''
However, the report says that the outlook beyond this year was more
encouraging. Household finances, which have been squeezed by tax
increases imposed in the last three Budgets, would receive a boost from
tax cuts expected this November and cash windfalls associated with
building society flotations in the pipeline. ''Indeed, real income
growth is now expected to average more than 3% over the next three
years,'' it says.
With housing now more affordable than at any time in the last 25 years
and the longer-term prospects for a fall in interest rates improving,
this should provide some scope for the market finally to recover.
Even so, the recovery is expected to remain modest by historical
standards, hampered by the structural constraints of negative equity and
reduced equity, and the changed perception of the housing market brought
about by the slump.
''Accordingly, while house prices are expected to rise next year,
probably by around 2.5%, they will still fall in real terms. Only in
1997 do we expect house prices to rise in real terms.''
The report said housing's reputation as an investment vehicle had been
seriously damaged by the post-1988 slump, the fall in inflation and
reductions in mortgage tax relief.
''Housing as a speculative asset will not return,'' says UK economist
James Barty. ''Other assets are more attractive due to lower inflation
and tax rates as well as incentives such as PEPS (personal equity plans)
and TESSAs (tax-free savings accounts).''

FRANCHISING has become big business in the UK with an annual sales
turnover of #5.5 billion. More than 200,000 are employed in an industry
that has 414 different franchisors supporting more than 26,000 outlets
that encompass big names such as McDonald's and Prontaprint to the newer
starts such as Kwik Kerb or Coffeeman.
A franchise is basically the granting of a licence by a franchisor,
who is the creator or owner of a business format that has been tried and
tested, to a franchisee who can then sell the franchise's product or
service. There are certain rules to follow which are general to the bulk
of franchises and although overnight success is not guaranteed the risk
of failure is considerably less than it would be for someone setting up
on their own. The package a franchisee gets contains what is needed to
establish a business and run it at profit.
It is likely that the franchise name will be widely known through
national advertising campaigns and once signed-up, a franchisee will be
allocated an area of the country in which to do business. It is
worthwhile checking what competition there is for your intended business
in the area you wish to operate as overlap and competition may affect
your trading projection.
As a franchisee you will be given training by the franchisor which may
take anything from a few days to three or four weeks. But it will
provide you with not only the general skills required to run a business
but the specific skills peculiar to the franchise.
The 1994 NatWest/British Franchise Association franchise survey shows
that 87% of franchisees are trading at a profit compared with 70% in
1991 and 86% of those trading less than two years claim profitability.

BLIMEY. What a scorcher to close the Perth Festival. Pianist Michael
Roll tore through Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto like a pit bull
terrier. You know the Fourth? That's the restrained, poetic side of
Beethoven, right? Wrong. Last night Michael Roll turned it over and
shook it by the neck until the fibres strained and the sweat poured out
of the thing.
In a way, I've not heard a performance quite like this. Volatile and
tempestuous weren't in it.
Hardly the most controlled and accurate in the book -- Roll tends to
get very excited, leaping up and down in the seat, ripping into the
piano, taking all manner of risks, belting round corners in top gear and
on two wheels.
Inevitably there are rough moments, but, my God, you know you've heard
a live performance. You know when you've been Beethoven'd.
And he was backed to the hilt by the gutsy City of London Sinfonia,
giving a supercharged performance under violinist Andrew Watkinson, who
leads very much from the front with an impressive, almost savage,
attacking style. In similar mode the band had catapulted the concert
into life with an electrifying Prometheus Overture.
Momentarily, in this all-Beethoven programme, the Sinfonia defused the
tension with a lovely performance of the Romance in F -- Watkinson a
splendid soloist -- before winding it up again with the Seventh Syphony,
packed with incident, simmering with energy, and perhaps lacking just
that final edge of pace.
Terrific concert from a very feisty chamber orchestra.
And with a leader like Watkinson, perched high on a stool, giving good
sight lines and impeccable leads to the band, who needs a conductor?

Dance
FROM the ideas expressed within the choreography through to the
touring schedule of recent months (often with schools residencies and
workshops attached), this is essentially a programme about points of
contact.
Since last November, when his own company first came on stream,
Richard Alston has looked to take the dance into as many communities as
possible, and out to those audiences that don't often have the chance to
see live performances, particularly of contemporary works, at a venue on
their doorstep. Sometimes -- as with Perth -- the houses haven't been
full. But, and this is the true reward for going beyond the established
circuit, the response has been genuinely enthusiastic.
It's easy to see why. Alston has recruited a good-looking, highly
motivated group of dancers who come together well in ensembles yet
retain a nice degree of individuality throughout. More than that, they
give a real sense of having utterly embraced the subtext to his
choreography. For the significant touches in these pieces all carry an
emotional shadow, a fine-tuned inflection that ties the exquisite lines
of the dance into recognisably human situations.
When I first saw this programme (at the Traverse in February), I was
immediately struck by the fierce intensity of both Lachrymae and
Movements From Petrushka -- powerful, disquieting pieces full of fraught
energy and inner grief where the caring gesture of an outstretched hand
took on vital, aching importance.
I suspect I didn't really appreciate Shadow Realm sufficiently at that
time. However, at Perth, Leesa Phillips and Andrew Robinson certainly
brought its strength to the fore: she, tiny compared with his
large-boned, athletic frame -- thereby adding a certain piquancy to this
duet

CLARE HENRY finds sculptor Doug Cocker is best away from the trials of
meeting a client's needs
SCULPTURE is ''expensive, troublesome, heavy, and unprofitable. I love
it.'' Doug Cocker, now 50, means what he says. He has returned to
Perthshire and to the pleasure principle. Having taught for 20 years,
and completed public art commissions all over Britain, he decided to
make some pieces ''because I wanted to make them; not to make a living.
It was an emotional need rather than a rational decision. I started
making quick, small forms in wood with a band saw. Immediate,
spontaneous, above all not to a brief! I was getting up early; eager to
get on; enjoying it. Back in the crack of thinking, drawing, and
making.''
Cocker is one of very few full-time career sculptors -- ''almost as
rare in Scotland as the golden eagle''. His Perth Festival show is apt.
Perthshire born and bred, now returned, even to the farm where he picked
tatties as a boy (''I married the farmer's daughter''), he has just
finished a public sculpture for Perth. Models for this, alongside
drawings, prints, and boxes dating back to 1975, are at Perth Museum
till June 18.
Tools and farm implements are seminal to his abstract shapes. ''Even
last week I was picking up more bits off old rakes, carts, and
threshers. The richness in their forms always spawns ideas.''
Working in Northampton, 1972-82, was a culture shock. The boxes from
1977 encapsulated memories of rural Perthshire. Titled Response to a
Farmyard, they contain natural objects -- stones, wood or bark -- plus
photographs. ''I hope they were never overtly nostalgic -- but I was
homesick.''
Moving to Aberdeen in 1982, he discovered Deeside's rich heather hues
and textures, which prompted sculptures laboriously covered in bark. It
was the era of Thatcher's political follies which meshed with Queen
Victoria's Deeside architectural follies and monuments. Cocker's State
of the Nation and To the Power of One reflected his anger at ''the
forlock-tugging mentality''.
These rather kitsch bark sculptures were followed by a flirtation with
figuration during a fellowship in Essex. He made prints at Peacock
Printmakers, ''an unbridled pleasure'', including Mostri, powerful
semi-figurative red and black woodcuts which depend on witty simplicity
and a sense of scale for their impact.
Perth's 80 drawings demonstrate a robust humour often lacking in the
more po-faced 1980s ''political soundbite' sculptures. One sketch shows
a monumental Mr Whippy, another an egg basket in the form of a
fingertip. The Heckler's Dirge, Meet the Feet That Beat the Street,
Self-Portrait Not Feeling Too Good all have a wry humour. Text is often
part of the sketch. He loves drawing: ''It's pure pleasure connecting
with my imagination where no-one can impose restrictions.''
Perth shows large colour photos of his commissions, including
Moondance 1987, for Glasgow's Hunterian. This elegant, pale, smooth,
curved ash and cedar piece foreshadows his new, more formalist oeuvre,
Diaspora.
His shedding of narrative, however ironic, is a good thing. Cocker is
best away from the ''gut-wrenching trials of meeting a client's needs''.
This sculptor with a national reputation laughs, ''If I'm not careful
I'll do myself out of a living!''
* Doug Cocker's Fish With Boy can be seen on Perth's South Inch. His
work is also on show at Edinburgh's Talbot Rice Gallery until June 24,
and in Taking Form at Edinburgh's Fruitmarket from June 16.

Opera
VIRTUAL opera. It had to happen sooner or later and the Scottish
International Children's Festival made sure they were going to be first
in inviting Victoria State Opera to perform their recent commission
Software; an operatic journey along the highways and byways of
cyberspace in search of the lost disks of Avalon.
Hysterical, having lost her mother's precious earrings, the central
character, Valerie, decides to seek solace in her home computer. Having
logged on, she is met by two virtual characters, Cursor and Control who
have descended from the electronic bulletin board to invite her on an
interactive adventure.
Once travelling through cyberspace, they are confronted by an evil man
in a purple kilt who turns out to be Mega Byte, the master of the
matrix. Valerie is transformed from an excited little girl into Valerie
the virtual Walkure, complete with tunic, helmet and shield, and a
fierce virtual battle ensues.
Having crossed the perilous river Styx, sung, or should I say warbled,
her way through to Avalon, and mastered various platform games, Valerie
eventually finds the lost disks hidden underneath Mega Byte's cloak.
Returning to real life, the lost disks are miraculously transformed into
her mother's missing earrings.
Colourfully staged on a simple but versatile set, the four singers are
accompanied throughout by a keyboard, sequencer and tone box, the
resultant music being of an electro-acoustic nature. Aimed at the 6-11
age group, the singing pushed a few young fingers into ears but on the
whole the computerised format kept them attentive. An excellent
introduction to the discipline of opera, this one is well worth a look.
Further performances Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, and at Stirling's
MacRobert Arts Centre next week. Check performance times with theatre.

Music
GOOD turnout on Saturday morning for a strong, if
strangely-structured, vocal recital at the Perth Festival by mezzo
soprano Yvonne Howard. Anyone deceived by the apparently user-friendly
generic title of Howard's programme -- A Charm of Lullabies -- must have
felt a chill seep into their bones that was nothing to do with the
bleak, grey, damp morning outside St John's Kirk.
As accompanist Scott Mitchell -- whose exquisitely delicate pianism
was a feature of the concert -- pointed out, there was nothing remotely
comforting in the eponymous song cycle by Benjamin Britten which opened
this lengthy and packed recital programme. Songs from the dark side of
the mind, this lot -- their unsettling quality portrayed by Yvonne
Howard with an ambiguous neutrality that generated unease.
From there it was into the romantic mire (just as well it wasn't a
bright summery day outside) with extracts from Mahler's Songs on the
Death of Children, featuring memorable moments from both performers --
Howard's plunge into a deep and creamy alto register, and Mitchell's
achingly sustained postlude to the second song.
So far, so black. And then it all dissolved into bittiness, with a
misplaced Debussy Prelude, several disconnected lighter songs, and a
dive into sentiment with Dvorak's Songs My Mother Taught Me (even though
ravishingly sung).
Strangely, the odd structural pattern was almost exactly repeated in
the second half, with the first piano-accompanied performance of Howard
Blake's new Stevenson cycle, The Land of Counterpane -- an evocative and
accessible set of 10 songs notable for their graphically descriptive
accompaniment -- followed by a stream of numbers (that didn't relate)
from composers as diverse as Butterworth and Gershwin.

Performance
MY companion thought he'd got the phrase for it. ''Tales From
Cybergraphic Oceans'', he'd said, invoking the ghastly shade of Yes at
their most grandiloquent and empty as he regarded the serried images on
Laurie's three video screens on Saturday night.
For a spell it looked like he was depressingly correct. In vain we
sought meaning in endless video-loops of feathers, burning books, and
Gulf War missiles. Meanwhile, Laurie would be keening over tectonic
grinding sounds, or issuing dread scrapings from her violin.
Laurie also unfurled the banner of the scarey pointy-heads: Richard
Dawkins, Stephen Hawking, Don DeLillo, John Cage. Somewhat bafflingly,
Laurie told us that history was an angel being blown backwards into the
future.
But then Laurie simply started sharing stories with us, and her
techno-aided musings took on a welcome personal aspect. She told us
about her fundamentalist grandmother being unseated by vanity at death's
furlong-marker. She told us about how, when she was working as an
Egyptology lecturer, she had made up her lectures.
Most affectingly, she spoke of coming near to death in Tibet and being
pulled through by the sound of one human voice. It wasn't so much what
the voice said, you understand, more that it signalled its owner's
willingness to express human concern. Which I reckon is the point of
Laurie Anderson's art, a mundane kind of a point which, paradoxically,
she makes by means of advanced digital technology.
Similarly, it's a point Laurie Anderson makes by raising fresh
questions rather than uttering grand statements of certainty. And to the
question ''Is Laurie Anderson fab?'' there can only be one answer: yes.

Music
TO ITS annual array of visiting orchestras and recitalists, the Perth
Festival has increasingly added a binding factor in the form of its own
specially recruited musical forces, conducted by John Currie and
exclusively tailored this year to the characteristics of St John's Kirk.
Handel's Israel in Egypt, stirringly performed on Saturday by the
Festival Chorus and Orchestra, was the climax of a week that had begun
in a different area of the Old Testament with Britten's Burning Fiery
Furnace. As a result, the one could be experienced, unexpectedly, as the
adverse of the other.
When first sung in 1739 Handel's oratorio displeased pious people
because it was too dramatic. In 1995, in surroundings as dramatic as St
John's, we could rejoice in the sweep of the music and the vividness of
Handel's word setting, never more potent than here.
Currie's conducting of it, in spite of some rough edges, had the pace
and grandeur of utterance demanded by Handel's epic description of the
plagues and the crossing of the Red Sea. The picturesque imagery was
relished by singers and instrumentalists who suggested the itch and
scratch of ''all manner of flies and lice'' and conveyed the hammer
blows of the smiting of the first-born.
Though stylistic authenticity was not a priority, it was a performance
stylishly scaled to a medium-size church, characterised by clarity and
freshness of sound, and by alert response to the glories of the score,
whether in the enveloping harmonies of ''He sent a thick darkness over
all the land'', or the mighty fanfares of ''He hath triumphed
gloriously''.
Though solos were brief, Currie ensured that they made their point.
Richard Evans and Alan Watt rose to their great bass duet, and
Caroline-Louise Fairbrother brought a nice brightness to the tiny role
of Miriam, the Prophetess, who in a dozen solo bars proposes the theme
of the final chorus.
Can I, in answer, propose a Handel oratorio cycle continuing next year
with, say, Saul? The scope is wide, the music sublime, the audience's
reaction on Saturday sufficient to suggest that there is a public in
Perth for Handelian music drama, zestfully sung with no hint of
pedantry.

Theatre
DAVID HARROWER's first full-scale production, Knives In Hens is a play
where language takes centre stage. Set somewhere in sixteenth-century
Scotland -- dates and place names are not specified -- the piece focuses
on the lives of ploughman Pony William, his young wife, and the village
miller.
Within their world only objects with a concrete use are deemed worthy
of a name and the play traces the young woman's quest to create a
language for the thoughts and feelings in her head. The relationship the
woman forms with the learned miller (an outcast from the community for
supposedly murdering his wife and unborn child) gives her both the
practical and emotional tools she needs for self expression.
Knives In Hens is however much more than a dry philosophical tract on
the problems of language and communication. It draws us into a world
that is far from simple and shows us lives that are governed by
superstitious customs, misguided religious beliefs, fear, and hatred.
The play bubbles with a strong erotic undercurrent and as it progresses
layers of deceit, infidelity, and sexual desire are exposed. It is also
a surprisingly funny play, with its humour lying in our recognition that
the characters are not simple-minded peasants from yesteryear but people
like us with similar emotions, frustrations, and aspirations.
Martyn Bennett's live musical score gives the piece a vibrant sense of
urgency and Mark Lease's beautiful, simple stage design seems to reflect
the poetic sparsity of Harrower's language.
Knives in Hens is a bizarre, unsettling play that speaks to us in ways
that are both strange and familiar. It is a genuinely compelling piece
of theatre.

As the Perth Festival reaches its climax, Michael Tumelty describes
its beginnings and casts an eye over its rich programme
LAST night the 24th Perth Festival of the Arts reached a climax with a
large-scale orchestral concert devoted to the music of Beethoven. Today
The Herald celebrates the Perth Festival and its distinctive qualities
with a page of coverage, ranging across dance, visual arts, and music.
The Perth Festival maintains a rather individual character, both
artistically and in its organisation. It's not too widely known, but the
festival was founded after a newspaper comment by colleague Conrad
Wilson (who reviews Handel's oratorio, Israel in Egypt, below).
In 1970 Wilson had written that Perth was ''the ideal festival city
without a festival''. The statement was taken on board by the city as a
challenge. On instruction from the town council, a feasibility study was
quickly undertaken by the Junior Chamber of Commerce.
Their report suggested it would take about 18 months to organise a
festival. Inspired by the challenge, however, the town council gave them
six months and #700. Iain Halliday, Perth businessman and immediate past
president of the Junior Chamber, was told to ''get on with it''.
And therein lies one of the most interesting and unusual aspects of
the Perth Festival. From day one, it has been organised and administered
by businessmen and professional people. (Iain Halliday, now chairman of
the festival committee, is trade relations manager for Matthew Gloag.)
This gives the festival administration a unique flavour in the arts.
It is entirely free of what we might call artistic angst and
hand-wringing: not for nothing is it known universally as ''the friendly
festival''.
It is run by cool, level-headed folk. And it may be significant that
in the 24 years of the festival, not once have the books failed to
balance; not once has the Perth Festival run up a deficit. Which
probably makes it unique.
Artistically, the Perth Festival has the reputation of being more
associated with the mainstream than the avant-garde. By and large,
that's true, though -- for the discerning festival-goer -- there are
always nuggets to be found. Wildcat's musical farce, Bedfellows, could
hardly be accused of political correctness. In dance, Richard Alston --
reviewed on this page -- works at the cutting edge and is among the most
forward looking of choreographers.
In this year's music programme, Japanese pianist Noriko Ogawa unveiled
some little-heard Takemitsu, while performances of Britten's church
parable, The Burning Fiery Furnace, staged earlier in the festival by
John Currie, do not exactly lie thick about the ground.
Meanwhile, this year the Perth Festival also celebrates one of the
city's own sons, sculptor Doug Cocker, whose exhibition -- a major
retrospective -- is covered by Clare Henry. Cocker is fairly singular
among sculptors in that, through a series of major corporate commissions
from industries throughout Britain, he actually made a living out of his
art.
All in, then, a rich and varied programme, reflected in the breadth of
coverage on this page.
Next year, to celebrate its 25th birthday, the Perth Festival is
promising ''a big splash''. They're giving nothing away at the moment,
but a spokesman for the festival said: ''We won't let the occasion
slip.''

In 1955, three young women left the Glasgow High School for Girls for
university, and adult life. They had been best friends during all of
their school years, and they are still firm friends today. Their class
recently held its 40th reunion, and more than 50 Old Girls attended.
Nancy McFarlane (nee Mackinnon), Molly Ferguson (nee Hamilton), and Joan
Mackenzie (nee Provan) tell the story of their lives since leaving
school to Neil Alexander.
JOAN MACKENZIE
WHEN I finished school in 1955, I went up to Glasgow to do an arts
degree, as many of the Old Girls did -- but I left after the first year
because I happened to meet the man who was to become my husband, Gregor
Mackenzie, and I didn't want to waste any time. We married in 1958, and
I had my first experience of electioneering with Gregor in 1959, when he
stood as the Labour candidate for West Perth and Kinross.
Gregor eventually got into Parliament in 1964 as MP for Rutherglen,
where he remained until 1987, when he did not seek re-election. In
between times, he was Minister for Industry in the 1974 Harold Wilson
government, and was Minister of State for Scotland in the Callaghan
government from 1976 to 1979.
I suppose I'm different from the other girls because I didn't really
have a career as such, but my career was looking after our two children
while my husband was away. Gregor was down in London most of the time
when the House was sitting, so although our main residence was in
Cambuslang, we also had a flat in London, and I used to take the
children there when school stopped at the end of June. Parliament didn't
rise until the end of July, so we always spent the summer holidays in
London in order to spend more time as a family.
Once the children had flown the nest -- my daughter got married and
left home, and my son was at law school in London -- we moved from
Cambuslang and bought a bigger flat in Kennington in South London.
While we lived in London I became interested in voluntary work, and I
was a member of the South East Thames Health Authority, which was
responsible for St Thomas's and its satellite hospitals. I still do
voluntary work with the health service, although the NHS was rather
different back in the 1980s.
At present, I am a non-executive director of the Greater Glasgow
Health Board, which is basically concerned with running the NHS in the
greater Glasgow area. I am one of only two women on the board, so I tend
to deal with women's health issues. I chair the Women's Health Policy
Committee and I'm also on the Maternity Liaison Committee, but there are
many other aspects of the board's work which I enjoy.
Although I am approaching retirement age, I have no plans to give up
my voluntary work, and I have a very full and interesting life. I have
two years left to run on my health board appointment, which I hope to
complete, and in the last three years I have taken up bowls, which I
enjoy.
I have four grandchildren and lots of good friends, including many
from my years at the school. I can't explain why we Old Girls have
remained close for so long, but perhaps the school had something to do
with it. We have kept very closely in touch with each other over the
years and we really do have a bond which developed at school and has, if
anything, grown stronger over the years.
MOLLY FERGUSON
IWENT to Glasgow University like most of the other girls from my year,
but I was a bit unusual for our class because I chose a scientific
course. I did a four year honours degree in Natural Philosophy -- or Nat
Phil as it was called in those days -- and graduated in 1959.
After university I went to work with a company in South Wales, where I
worked in the lab. It wasn't a particularly successful move because I
didn't really like the job much, and I returned to Scotland within a
year.
When I came back in 1960 I started work as a lecturer in Physics and
Maths at Paisley Technical College, which is now Paisley University, and
stayed there for three years. By that time I was married, and I left
work to have my children. My son was born in 1964, and my daughter in
1966. Soon after my daughter was born my husband, who is a doctor, was
seconded to Kenya, so we took the two babies there for a year and a
half.
In 1968 we came back from Kenya and from then on I did a series of
various part-time teaching jobs while the children were still young. In
1971 I decided that I had better get a proper teaching qualification --
which I didn't have at that time -- so I went to Jordanhill to do my
teacher training, and then we moved to Ayr in 1973.
As I was then a qualified teacher, it meant that I could work in
schools as well as FE colleges, so I went to work in Wellington School,
an independent school for girls, which I thought was sort of like full
circle. I had started at an independent all girls' school, and I ended
up teaching at one. I was there for 13 years, from 1976 to 1989, and now
I don't do any work.
I just decided I've done it, and there are other things to do in life,
so I stopped teaching in 1989 and since then I've been a lady of
leisure. I'm involved with the Ayr Hospital League of Friends and I do a
bit more travelling now because my son is a history don at Oxford and my
daughter is doing postgraduate work at Yale University in America, but
really, I'm a bit of a lazy soul now, just enjoying life.
I'm a very keen gardener, so I spend a lot of time in my garden, which
is quite large, and that's really about all I do these days. I visit
family and have family to visit me, and I'll spend a weekend here or a
few days there, but I really don't do anything very exciting now.
I still have the same best friends today as I had 40 -- or even 50 --
years ago. I know many people lose touch with their school friends, and
my mother and her friends are always saying that it must have been an
amazing school for all of us to have remained so close, but we always
felt we got so much out of the school and we just had such a good time
there that none of us wanted to forget.
Perhaps it has something to do with us all being women, or maybe it
was just a lucky grouping, and we are certainly very fortunate, but we
still get on as well -- if not better -- than ever. If there are still
enough of us around in 2005, then I'm sure we'll have another reunion
for our 50th anniversary.
NANCY McFARLANE
IREALLY wanted to go into medicine after I left school, but I was kind
of frightened to try it because I didn't know if I was good enough. The
universities used to operate a quota system for female university
entrance, and to get into medicine as a woman you had to be really good,
so I took the soft option and went to Glasgow University to do English,
and then I went straight into teaching.
The first school I taught at was Chryston Higher Grade School in
Lanarkshire, which I don't think exists anymore. It was the local school
for Bridgend, the village where the 1958 Auchengeich mining disaster
happened. Over 50 miners were killed, many of whom had children at the
school, so it was a very sad time for the school and for Lanarkshire.
In 1960 I went back into Glasgow to teach at Onslow Drive School in
Dennistoun. I really moved back to do a Diploma of Education in
Psychology, but it wasn't a career driven decision, I just decided I
would like to go back and be a student again because I kind of liked the
life.
I finished my postgraduate course in 1961 and then I got a job at
Cumbernauld High School. At that time, people who went to teach in
Cumbernauld were given houses, so it meant that I had a new job and a
new home when I finished my course.
During my time there the school leaving age changed from 15 to 16, so
although it was a beautiful school, they were hard times. Some of the
pupils were quite unco-operative, but I think I would have felt the same
if I had been expecting to leave school the next day and they had told
me I had to stay on another year!
I left Cumbernauld in 1963 and moved to Tillicoultry, where I took
time out to have my two children in 1964 and 1966, and I decided that I
wouldn't go back to work until my children started school in the early
70s.
In those days there were teacher shortages. I took my son to his new
school at nine in the morning and by lunchtime I had a phone call from
the headmaster, who asked me to come back and teach anything. He said I
could name my timetable, so to speak. That's just another example of how
education has changed. Now there are thousands of qualified teachers who
simply can't find jobs.
I taught at the local FE college for a while and then moved into my
present field, which is teaching in a unit for kids who have been
excluded from other schools.
I've never regretted going into teaching, even though I wasn't sure it
was what I wanted to do. When I first left university, I thought of a
career in social work, but my father felt that it would be a nine-day
wonder, and convinced me to go into teaching.
In those days we were just getting to the end of the time when you did
what your parents expected of you, and I felt that as he had paid for me
to go to a fee-paying school, and financed me through university, I
should do what he asked. I've never regretted it, and it was the right
thing for me, so my father really did know what was best for me!
My main concern at the moment is that I'm due to retire next year and
I'm quite frightened about it -- or apprehensive anyway -- because I
love my job. I really don't know what I'll do with myself.
I'm still very friendly with my old classmates from the Girl's High
School, and we see each other regularly. We've just had our 40th
reunion, and I'm sure we will have a 50th, too.

Television cookery programmes can
create a huge demand for products
which takes kitchenware suppliers,
supermarkets and delicatessens by
surprise, reports ANNA BURNSIDE
THE small studio audience applauds self-consciously. Fern Britton,
plumper than the normal TV presenter, introduces two chefs -- different
ones each day. Some brim with braggadocio in their whites; others
outcamp Julian Clary.
Two ordinary people, carrier bags in hand, come down to the stage.
Each tips out a #5 selection of groceries, puts on a pinny and, with 20
minutes on the clock, helps the smarmy professional to cook something
stunning. The audience votes to choose the winner.
This is Ready Steady Cook, the shambolic but influential afternoon TV
show that has become a student cult. Despite its unglamorous slot
(4.30pm, BBC2) three million people turn on every day.
Here are some dazzling dinners to make in the 20 minutes that research
has shown to be the average time most people are prepared to spend
cooking a meal.
The guests often bring ingredients they've fancied, but are not sure
what to do with: filo pastry, lemon grass, sun-dried tomatoes. One sweet
student brought a large trout he had caught himself.
The professionals, with 20 minutes, a pan loaf, chicken breasts and a
bag of avocados, fall back on the techniques which give fast, flashy
results. They reach for the ridged pan grill, which makes impressive
criss-cross patterns on meat, the tiny mould to make an individual
summer pudding, filo pastry basket, even a neat heap of fried cabbage.
Viewers are impressed. They want a bit of that.
Niall Simpson, the manager of Edinburgh cookshop Studio One, heard
about the programme from customers who travelled hopefully to
Morningside in search of their own pan grill, ramekin set or dariole
mould.
He's grateful for the new business, because these are not his regular
customers, but he finds the programme gimmicky and a little tiresome.
''Take the apple corer and slicer, the ones you push down and apple
splays out in slices. We just can't get them.
''We used to keep them in stock and hadn't sold one for about nine
months, so we dropped them. Then they start using them on this programme
and everybody's looking for them. ''Much as I may mock it, it does bring
people into the shop, and they can see what else we've got to offer.
It's a shame there's exposure like this and they can't use it a bit
better - but then maybe if it was a better, more serious programme,
people wouldn't watch it.''
Kitchenware suppliers, supermarkets and delicatessens have learnt, the
hard way, that television is a demanding creator. Sarah Browne
popularised wholewheat flour and Madhur Jaffrey was responsible for a
small run on curry leaves, but it wasn't until Delia Smith's Christmas
Collection, first broadcast in 1990 and repeated for the following two
festive seasons, that the industry really woke up and smelt the coffee;
or, more accurately, the pastry. Smith's fancy mince pies caused a
nationwide lattice pastry cutter crisis, with spin-off stampedes for
sticky toffee pudding moulds and liquid glucose.
Simpson recalls: ''When Delia Smith started using creme caramel moulds
to make sticky toffee pudding, we had hundreds of people coming in and
ringing up for them. Before that, we maybe sold a couple of dozen a
year.''
By the time Smith made The Summer Collection in 1993, she had worked
out that obscure herb or must-have gadget, plus television exposure,
equals demand that must be matched by supply. Frances Whitaker, the
executive producer, explains: ''Delia has learnt that, although
headlines saying 'Country runs out of liquid glucose' are good
publicity, they are also infuriating.
''People want these ingredients and can't get them. Now we let the
trade press know what ingredients we are using, and kitchen shops keep
in touch to find out what we're going to be doing.''
Mould makers and liquid glucose suppliers were not the only ones to be
amazed by the scale of the response to Smith's programmes. Whitaker knew
they would be successful but ''it always takes TV executives by
surprise. They don't consider cooking to be an essential of life; they
can't believe that five million people will watch a programme that's
just about cookery''.
But they will, and buy the book, and demand the mortar and pestle,
olive stoner and muffin tins, so they can follow the recipes. The Summer
Collection, where Smith advocates crushing garlic, spices and making
salad dressings by hand, created more frustration for Niall Simpson.
''We eventually had to get mortars and pestles shipped in from
Holland, we just could not get them in the UK. Then there's the lemon
zester, which she uses to zest limes. In the last couple of years we
have sold hundreds; in the years before they sat on the shelf and we
sold a couple a month.''
Ready Steady Cook's recipes are on Ceefax and the BBC's Internet
pages, but Smith's programmes are accompanied by big-selling books that
consolidate the demand for her chosen equipment and ingredients.
The Summer Collection is being shown for the third time next month.
But smug suppliers, their shelves loaded with mini muffin trays and pure
vanilla essence, can't sit back and relax. Smith's new series, The
Winter Collection, starts in October. Frances Whitaker warned: ''I'd
expect a big run on cranberries. If I was Mr Sainsbury or Mr Tesco, I'd
start stocking up now.''
* The Best of Ready Steady Cook starts on June 9; Delia Smith's Summer
Collection starts on June 28.

Jack Bruce has never looked back since his rise to the top. David
Belcher talks to the rock legend and explains why the world is still his
oyster
MORE than two years after Jack Bruce became the first Scot to be
inducted into America's Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame, the former cornerstone
of Cream is about to be honoured in his native land. Along with Midge
Ure, the 52-year-old bassist will tomorrow night be presented with a
special achievement award at a fund-raising dinner being staged in
Edinburgh on behalf of the Nordoff-Robbin Music Therapy in Scotland
charity.
And Jack Bruce will not be arriving at the occasion empty-handed,
either. One of the evening's other highlights will be a fund-raising
auction of all-star memorabilia, and Nordoff-Robbins organisers have
been thrilled to learn that Jack Bruce will be inviting bids for a
signed bass guitar which he has donated to the cause.
Although Jack is scheduled to play in Edinburgh later in the year --
during the festival, on September 2, at the Queen's Hall, when he'll be
undertaking piano solos and duos with funk overlord Bernie Worrell --
he's unlikely to be repeating his Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame acceptance
routine and performing music on stage in Edinburgh tomorrow night.
Cream's induction into corporate rock's hallowed ranks, alongside the
Beatles, Chuck Berry, and James Brown, took place in January, 1993, and
prompted Jack and his pioneering power-trio partners, Ginger Baker and
Eric Clapton, to play together publicly for the first time in 27 years.
''What I tried to say at the ceremony in my acceptance speech,
standing up there in front of everybody who has ever been anybody in the
history of rock'n'roll, was that it should seem like a hell of a long
way from Glasgow to Hollywood -- but it isn't anymore,'' says Jack. ''It
did seem a long way in 1963, though.
''If I've any regrets, I regret the fact that I had to leave Scotland
in search of whatever it was I was in search of . . . that I had to cut
off my ties at 17 and become a displaced person.''
Jack's family had their own spell of displacement, having returned
home to Scotland from a brief post-war emigre spell in Canada when Jack,
born in Cardonald, was five. They resettled in Pollok. Jack attended
Bellahouston Academy and then the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and
Drama, studying piano. But not for long.
''It seemed they were intent on not encouraging any individuality or
originality I might have had. I was very precocious, though . . . I'd
composed my first string quartet at 11. But I remember the sneering
reception I got; one that seemed to say: 'Just you stick in with the
Mozart, sonny, and you'll maybe one day be good enough to be in the back
row of an orchestra'.''
Instead, set on a front-row musical career, the teenaged Jack Bruce
took his double bass by train to Coventry for his first pro engagement
as a member of the Murray Campbell Big Band who toured the Mecca
Ballroom circuit throughout the fifties. Inevitably, Jack ended up based
in London.
En route to Cream, Jack played alongside Rolling Stone Charlie Watts
in Alexis Korner's band; the Graham Bond Organisation (with Ginger
Baker); John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (alongside Eric Clapton); Manfred
Mann, and the Powerhouse (with Clapton, Steve Winwood, and Paul Jones).
It was only his impending first marriage which stopped Jack accepting
Marvin Gaye's offer to join his band in America.
Post-Cream, Jack Bruce was part of what now reads like an
encyclopaedia of jazz-rock fusioneering. Tony Williams's Lifetime; West
Bruce and Laing; Jack Bruce and Friends (including Larry Coryell and
Mitch Mitchell); the Jack Bruce Band (with Carla Bley); John
McLaughlin's Mahavishnu Orchestra; BLT (with heavy-metal guitar-bender
Robin Trower). There are also Jack's 11 solo LPs, of course, beginning
in 1969 with Songs For A Tailor and culminating in Somethin Els,
enlivened by a couple of guest appearances by old pal Eric Clapton and
released in 1993.
Jack's most recent albums have been collaborative affairs, however.
Cities Of The Heart, featuring Gary Moore, Ginger Baker, and Bernie
Worrell, was a live-in-concert record of Jack's fiftieth birthday
celebrations in 1993. Last year Messrs Bruce, Baker, and Moore united as
BBM and produced Around The Next Dream. ''You should have called
yourselves CWC,'' unkind critics noted: Cream Without Clapton.
Critics have not gone overboard about every Jack Bruce project.
Generally, enough paying members of the public have. Particularly about
Cream. Thirty-five million Americans bought their four albums, Cream's
sales success leading to the creation of the platinum-disc rating for
million-sellers in the US.
Angst-levels in the band rose even more steeply than the retail
graphs. After two-and-a-half increasingly tense years, the trio broke up
in 1968 before they broke one another up.
''That band,'' Bruce says, having come to terms with the light Cream's
reputation shines on his subsequent work. ''You forget how loved they
were. They're bigger commercially than anything else we've all done
since, and it was difficult then to walk away from that. I've done lots
of things and had the recognition I've wanted for them, but not the
commercial success.
''At first I deliberately refused to play Cream songs -- I'd be
playing jazz in tiny clubs, with vast crowds of Cream fans trying to get
in -- and I got stick for it from critics. It was difficult at times,
but I stuck with it.
''We had no formula for Cream's huge success; it was completely
unexpected, we didn't set out to achieve platinum records . . . and that
level of success wasn't the reason I was in music.
''People don't believe me when I say it, but I never liked stardom. I
didn't want it. It gets in the way of the music. I like to live a fairly
ordinary life. I was never in love with limos. For a while in the States
with Cream, we had to have bodyguards, and then after the John Lennon
tragedy, while I was doing some work with Yoko Ono, I saw the way their
kid needed two bodyguards virtually all the time, even around the
house.''
Jack Bruce's notion of a fairly ordinary life springs from his fairly
ordinary Scottish upbringing, or as fairly ordinary as it's possible to
be when both your parents are paid-up members of the Communist Party.
But whatever their political persuasion, everyone likes a devilish good
tune. Jack grew up in a musical home.
''I think music was prevalent in most working-class Glasgow homes in
the fifties. Singing, performing. I was taught a lot of Scottish songs
at my mother's knee, literally, almost on a subconscious level. Having
learnt his songs as a child, I relate to Robert Burns as a songwriter,
definitely. My dad was an engineer and a keen amateur piano player . . .
he was into Fats Waller, actually, now I think of it.''
Music supports newer branches of the Bruce family tree. Jack has two
grown-up musician sons from his first marriage, both of whom play with
him from time to time -- as well as in a band with Ginger Baker's son.
He also has three children under 12 -- two daughters and a
three-year-old son -- in his second marriage, to German-born Margrit.
Having lived in Germany and then in Gairloch, when his daughters were
toddlers, the Bruce family now reside in rural Suffolk. The world
remains his oyster. ''Japanese audiences are incredibly young, about 14.
But everywhere you go it's emphatically not the people who saw you the
first time.
''In the US and Europe I play with a bunch of Latin guys, Haitians,
Cubans, all speaking different languages and communicating via music.
That's the thing about music, its universality. I'm not a believer in
nationalism . . . we can all see that's a destructive thing; tribalism,
chauvinism. I've never liked the professional Scot; I was never a Harry
Lauder fan.''

THOSE who would like to be their own boss but feel uncomfortable about
starting business completely on their own may have given some
consideration to business format franchising. Taking an already proven
and successful formula, the franchisee enters a partnership with a
franchisor who has an established and profitable concept and thus
removes many of the risks attached to new business start-up.
Similarly, the owner of a sound and successful company may wish to
expand his idea to fresh territory and introduce new blood without
incurring the often heavy oncosts associated with expansion. As a
potential franchisor you may require clarification about exactly what
franchising your business involves and what benefits it can bring.
Whether your interests lie on the side of the franchisee or towards
that of a franchisor the forthcoming exhibition at the SECC, Glasgow on
June 9 and 10 will attempt to explain the principles of the franchising
concept. Representatives from the world of finance, legal profession,
Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Business Shop will be at hand to
offer advice and guidance. More than 40 franchisors will also be in
attendance to answer questions from would-be franchisees.
Franchisors from pet food to fast food, petrol stations, lighting,
vending and cleaning, large operations that require hefty investment to
the smaller man and van business, every conceivable mix is represented
at the exhibition offering the visitor the best possible focus on
franchising under one roof.
Mark Beaumont is managing director of Franchise Events Ltd and last
year his company organised a similar exhibition at the SECC: ''We
launched the Scottish event last year following research which led us to
believe that the time was right to bring the franchise equation into
play for boosting the Scottish economy.''
Scotland's business birth rate is one of the lowest in the UK but
according to Beaumont, franchising could help: ''Governments keen on
rapid growth such as Singapore and Malaysia have backed franchising to
the hilt. If official bodies in Scotland realised this, and backed
franchise growth in Scotland the region would really take off.''
For the potential franchisee the exhibition dedicated to franchising
is an excellent event for comparing the attributes of various companies.
You will be able to meet franchisors head to head and question them
about their companies.
But while franchising continues to grow in Britain there are still
areas of uncertainty about franchising and how it works. For potential
franchisors a series of seminars have been arranged with the aim to
clarify precisely what is meant by franchising and what it can, and
cannot, do for your business. If you have a proven business concept
which you wish to expand but are lacking in the necessary financial
resources then franchising may allow you to expand your business without
many of the associated hassles.
One thing you will be able to depend on is that those who join you in
the partnership will not only have invested their money but also their
drive and enthusiasm to succeed. Experts will discuss with you items
such as how to franchise your business or the legal aspects of the
franchise agreement. They will also take you through the basic steps of
drawing up a feasibility study and pilot operation.
If you would like to be your own boss, the franchise offers you an
opportunity based on a proven business. Seminars at the exhibition will
help you assess your suitability for a franchise and show you how to
evaluate franchises that are available. Again, experts will cover issues
such as finance, legal and what the franchisor expects from you.
These seminars have been arranged for both days of the exhibition and
a question time will follow each seminar. Britain has no specific laws
which govern franchising and guidance by consultants, solicitors and
banks with franchise experience is all important.
Newcomers to franchising can only benefit from the advice given by
experts at the exhibition and it can be a relaxed way of getting to know
all about franchising.

WOMEN make up slightly more than half the population, but less than
10% of our MPs. That, in a sentence, is the inequality that Labour has
promised to address by engineering what could be a dramatic increase in
the number of women MPs in the next Parliament.
The party wants half of its candidates in winnable seats at the next
General Election to be women. The ruling applies to safe Labour seats
where the sitting MP is retiring, and marginal seats where Labour is
within a 6% swing of victory.
Nationwide, this amounts to about 80 seats. So, if all goes to plan
and Labour sweeps to power in two years' time, the number of women
Labour MPs in Parliament will at least double, from 39 to 79, more than
the current total of women MPs from all parties.
The arrival of the SNP's Roseanna Cunningham at Westminster this week
will bring to 63 the number of women in the Commons, out of 651 MPs:
three out of 22 Liberal Democrats; 19 out of 329 Tories; two out of four
Scottish Nationalists; and 39 out of 269 Labour. There are no women MPs
from Ulster.
Not that numbers are needed. It only takes a glance across the Commons
Chamber on the rare occasions when it is full to see what a male place
Westminster is. The women are easy to spot: splashes of
attention-grabbing colour in a drab sea of grey and navy. To the
outsider it remains a club for white men in late middle-age, ruled by
often incomprehensible rituals redolent of public school and the lodge.
To attempt to change this by force, however, could prove to be one of
the Labour leadership's riskiest gambles since Tony Blair took over last
summer. Like the ban on homosexuals in the armed forces, the role of
women in politics is a hysteria-inducing issue, a source of unwanted
controversy for a party intent on doing nothing to threaten its record
lead in the polls.
Since its adoption at last year's conference, the policy has already
resulted in a number of confrontations. Some constituencies have refused
to adopt an all-woman shortlist, forcing Labour headquarters to step in
and impose one. At least one excluded male candidate -- Peter Jepson in
the new London seat of Regent's Park and Kensington -- is suing for
unfair discrimination. The Tories, predictably, are making the most of
it.
The objections are expected to multiply as the selection procedure
picks up pace, and some around Tony Blair concede that the greatest
resistance will come from the North-west of England, where a variety of
forces -- established male candidates, suspicion of London party
headquarters, or good old-fashioned sexism -- are lined up to resist
change.
One of the most convincing voices in favour of enforcing equality is
Rosina McCrae, member of the Scottish executive, and one of the founders
of the Scottish Labour Women's Caucus. She is a veteran of this debate,
and has answers to all the arguments against change. ''I've been in the
party 22 years and I've always faced all-male shortlists. Nobody ever
complained about that,'' she says.
All-women shortlists make a mockery of selection based on merit? Look
around you, she says. The suggestion that MPs are elected on merit is a
joke. The Commons benches are packed with those -- we know who you are
-- who got there because they joined the right trade union or were born
into the right family. All-women shortlists undermine local democracy?
Rubbish, she says: how many MPs actually live in the constituency they
represent?
So far in Scotland the policy has been a success largely because only
six seats are judged to be eligible: five are winnable marginals, the
sixth is the Motherwell constituency of retiring MP Dr Jeremy Bray.
Party secretary Jack McConnell convened a meeting earlier this year of
all six constituencies and asked three to volunteer to field an
all-women shortlist. Ayr, the ultra-marginal held by Tory Phil Gallie,
volunteered immediately, followed shortly by Stirling, seat of Home
Office Minister Michael Forsyth. The two are Labour's main targets at
the next election.
But a third constituency has yet to be found. In Inverness East, Nairn
and Lochaber, where the Liberal Democrat Sir Russell Johnston is
standing down, the constituency Labour Party want to stick with David
Stewart, who ran Sir Russell to within 458 votes in 1992. Labour
headquarters are not prepared to disagree.
Nor will Motherwell and Wishaw volunteer. Quite the opposite. The
Labour Party in the new Lanarkshire constituency created out of Dr
Bray's Motherwell South hates the idea. Two male candidates are already
vying for the seat -- Frank Roy, Dr Bray's agent, and local councillor
Harry McGuigan -- and will not step aside.
The other three eligible constituencies are in Aberdeen, and there is
little room there for optimism. Aberdeen North MP Robert Hughes is
expected to bid for the new safe seat of Aberdeen Central. In the
remaining two there are existing male candidates who are known to be
interested. Jack McConnell claims he won't have to impose an all-women
shortlist anywhere, but critics of the policy fear it may be
unavoidable.
For Tony Blair the issue poses a dilemma. He accepts the principle,
that women are not adequately represented by the British political
system. But he also recognises that enforcing equality from the centre
sits uneasily with Labour's claim to be the party of local
accountability. He is under mounting pressure to reverse the policy, and
in particular the decision to apply the all-women shortlist requirement
to half of all council seats. A ban on men, his opponents in and out of
the party claim, proves Labour remains a slave to political correctness.
The doubts are shared by a cross-section of MPs including a number of
women. Helen Liddell, MP for Monklands East, has expressed anxieties.
Without fundamental constitutional reform, including a Scottish
parliament, she argues, women with families and those geographically
remote from London will continue to find it difficult to get involved in
politics.
Tony Blair has brought an honest ruthlessness to Labour's pursuit of
power, and he will apply the same approach to this issue -- until the
polls indicate otherwise. If giving Britain's women a greater voice at
Westminster matters, then he won't worry about trampling over a few
constituency parties. As Rosina McCrae points out, ''the Labour Party is
about government, and that's the overriding factor. You have a huge
credibility gap when your legislature is so unrepresentative of your
population''.

COMPANY MAN, The Rise and Fall of Corporate Life
By Anthony Sampson
HarperCollins: #20.
IN his latest book, the serial anatomist of post-war Britain has
turned his ever-sharp scalpel on the evolution of business corporations
around the world, the entities which have brought us everything from
canned beans to computers, sugared drinks to motor cars. And provided
the jobs through which countless millions have sought -- and with
mounting anxiety, continue to seek -- an economic stake in society.
Anthony Sampson communicates his fascination with what lies before him
on his slab in the first page of the introduction.
The son of an ICI company man, whose father progressed from a research
post in Billingham to running his own department in the mighty ICI HQ
fortress at Millbank on the Thames, Sampson recalls as an undergraduate
walking along Regent's Park one day with the sociologist-to-be Barbara
Wootton, gazing at the rows of people passing paper to each other behind
the office windows of the terraces they passed.
''What are they all doing in there?'' Wootton asked. ''No-one will
ever know.'' In what follows Sampson is determined to find out.
He traces the rise of the modern business corporation from its
historic roots in the United States, Europe, and Asia, from the trading
companies of the British empire, through the way railways opened up
commercial opportunity, particularly in the US, to the dismantling of
feudalism in Japan in the Meiji period.
Sampson's technique of laying bare the past will be familiar to anyone
who has enjoyed his earlier dissections of Britain. The fruit of Sampson
interviews with key players is laced with source material from
prodigious reading, much of it nineteenth and twentieth-century fiction.
Sampson also throws in multiple references to popular film, and laces
the whole with a rich dressing of personal reminiscence culled from
travels, casual reading, and acute observation.
The result is a highly readable account, which charts the rise of the
modern corporation, from the period when ownership became separated from
management, through the impact of successive World Wars -- sowing
complacency in the Anglo-American business community, forcing renewal on
the Germans and the Japanese -- to political distrust of the growing
power of the biggest corporations. Senator Harry S Truman, Sampson
reminds us, once accused Standard Oil, the forerunner of Exxon, of
treason.
Sampson pauses regularly throughout this book to consider the
evolution of particular corporations -- Boeing, Ford, ITT, and IBM,
among others, in the US; Unilever, Shell, Fiat, and ABB in Europe;
Toyota in Japan.
His central thesis is that, everywhere, vast business multinationals
-- whose market power reached unprecedented levels in the post-war
period, whose workers, from Toyota City in Japan to the small-town
communities of the Hudson River valley colonised by IBM, grew to believe
that corporate paternalism was here to stay -- are now in retreat.
That retreat involves a return to core products and concerns, massive
shopfloor redundancies and the stripping away of layer upon layer of
management bureaucracy. In some cases it has meant extinction for the
entire edifice. But why have so many multinational corporations been
forced into this retreat? Sampson cites four main reasons. The cultural
revolt of the 1960s, spearheaded by students from Paris to Washington,
explicitly targeted corporate values and their links with military
adventures like Vietnam. That ''decade of disgust'' deprived major
companies of the best brains of a generation.
Business in Europe and the United States was then faced with the
growing competitive threat from the East, as first Japanese and then
other Asian companies produced product after product which outsold local
suppliers.
Too many western corporations, Sampson argues, had grown fat and
complacent by the 1980s, boardrooms were more concerned with personal
status and perks than with competitive advantage. Along came a new breed
of corporate raiders, ostensibly dedicated to championing shareholder
value and shaking out the corporacy.
The fourth factor to undermine the big corporations, Sampson believes,
was information technology. Not only did it produce a new breed of
laid-back entrepreneurs, typified by Microsoft's Bill Gates, and the
fickle corporate loyalties of Silicon Valley, it also made the way
corporations can do business very different from those scenes glimpsed
so many years before behind the windows of Regent's Park Terrace.
Sampson calls his book Company Man. But thankfully he manages to
devote two chapters to the role of women in the story. The first is
about the impact of the typewriter and the telephone in attracting women
into office work. The second is about why corporate life continues, at
the top levels, to be so male dominated and whether, after some signs of
the glass ceiling being cracked, able women are explicitly rejecting
corporate culture and seeking other challenges elsewhere.
The book ends with a chapter entitled corporate kings, which dwells on
the powerful few who, in the slimmed-down empires, still wield enormous
power, with little real accountability to the shareholders who own the
business. Sampson dwells on an issue of the moment, the fat rewards that
few are now awarding themselves and asks: who can control them? Another
Sampson book beckons, I suspect.

MESSINA, Sunday
THE only trouble with this place is that work keeps getting in the
way. We are here in sunny Sicily to report the launch of the next phase
in building a united Europe but in between ministerial briefings and
news conferences the friendly Sicilians kept bringing on more delicious
food and generous pourings of the superb local wine.
We were billeted in Taormina, a delightful town a few miles down the
coast. It is difficult to believe that this is officially one of the
poorest regions of Europe, needy enough to qualify for aid from faraway
Brussels. Compared with the West of Scotland it looks affluent.
Looking around the spotless streets with their ancient archways, curio
shops, churches, and inviting al fresco cafes, there is a complete
absence of the social curses which afflict cities and towns elsewhere,
notably the UK. No beggars, not a single drunk, no chewing gum defacing
the cobbles, no boisterous behaviour, no alienated teenagers threatening
the peace.
Sicily has its own problems, publicised widely enough, but social
breakdown in the British sense is not one of them. If this is a glimpse
of how a more integrated Europe will influence Britain then let us have
more of it.
Some British politicians would not agree, of course. The atmosphere of
Euro-celebration here is enough to make the average Tory Eurosceptic's
hair stand on end. To the Taylors and Cashes of this world the Messina
gathering is a conspiracy of ghastly federasts.
For example, in the official booklet welcoming the world's media to
Messina, the Italian Foreign Minister, Susanna Agnelli, wrote
unashamedly of how most other EU politicians see the near future.
Looking to next year's super-summit on Maastricht for which the agenda
was begun over the weekend -- she used terms strong enough to make the
British Government come over faint.
She talked of the EU moving soon to a single currency and ''a common
commitment to considering means for strengthening European activities in
the areas of foreign policy, security, defence, justice, and internal
affairs, all of which were once reserved exclusively to national
sovereignty'' -- and all of which the Brits are determined to protect
from majority voting.
Susanna Agnelli and other Italians are proud of their part in hosting
the Messina conference 40 years ago which led to the founding of what we
used to call the Common Market. Four decades on, their official
literature proudly recalls the comments of Altiero Spinelli, their Prime
Minister of that era, who said: ''Only when Europe is no longer divided
into national and sovereign states and when a solid federated European
state is created will the peace and progress of its people be
guaranteed.''
As if that was not enough to turn the stomachs of Douglas Hurd and his
Eurosceptic deputy, David Davis, the Italians concluded with a unclouded
vision of a federal Europe of the kind which prompted Margaret Thatcher
to scream ''No, no, no'' across the floor of the Commons.
They summoned up the ghost of Spinelli to argue that ''federation
would guarantee a future based on progress and prosperity . . . by
eliminating the idea of the nation state. Obviously, this could only
happen if individual countries relinquished part of their national
sovereignty to a supranational body: a Federation of European States.''
And, for good measure, they issued a reminder that it was none other
than Winston Churchill who called in one of his early post-war speeches
for a United States of Europe. This tilting at the sovereignty of
nations -- especially creaking nation states like ours -- goes to the
heart of our Government's objections to the integration process. And so,
into this federast morass, came the UK, one of the most centralist
states in the EU, easily the most Eurosceptic, and probably one of the
least solid of nation states as nationalism gains ground in Scotland and
Wales and the Government talks with the Irish Republic on the future of
Northern Ireland.
There are suggestions here that all is not well between No 10 and the
Foreign Office these days. It is rumoured that the Foreign Office is
becoming restive about the rigid approach to this negotiation by John
Major. The Prime Minister, in a series of recent speeches, has said he
will block any moves to dilute the national veto, and that he will
simply not negotiate on such ideas as more powers for the European
Parliament. If that proves to be the case there is really not much point
in the British turning up because agreement will be impossible.
But at least Mr Hurd did turn up after suggestions that he might plead
the need to be elsewhere because of Bosnia. Forty years ago it was a
different story -- one in which the British won a memorable place in the
''How Wrong Can You Be?'' category of history.
When the first Messina conference was called it was attended by the
Benelux states and by France, Germany, and Italy. Britain sent an
observer who remarked sniffily: ''If you continue meeting, you will not
agree. Even if you agree, nothing will result. Even if something
results, it will be a disaster.''
Forty years later we have the European Union which is already too
unified for Britain's liking and which is about to take another step
towards integration as Maastricht is refined. Despite Mr Major's
determination to prevent any ''great leap forward'' the UK must either
drop its No Surrender approach to Europe if it wishes to be taken
seriously in the coming months or it can simply sulk on the sidelines as
others make the running.
This could all end up with a so-called Union Jack General Election in
which all the latent nationalism of (some of) the British at the end of
the twentieth century is poured into an anti-European crusade by the
Eurosceptics (in all parties). It could be their last hurrah.
The last formal act of the Messina conference of 1995 was a call for
delegations to stand to attention as the Ode to Joy, Europe's anthem,
was played. By that time Mr Hurd was reportedly on his way home soon to
be followed by the hacks determined to make sure no more work got in the
way of the fun.

THE letter was frank but devoid of self pity. Its author, a woman
living in the West End of Glasgow, had just been listening to a
programme we'd put together for the Speaking Out slot trying to referee
the current debate as to what it means to be poor.
The letter writer said she was due to go out that same morning and
pick up her giro since she was unemployed. With a precision to shame the
average actuary she had worked out that if she paid her outstanding
bills, met the rent, and gave the cat a modest treat for that night's
tea she would be able to divvy up the remaining wealth into 14 neat,
daily spending parcels. According to the arithmetic she quoted she would
have a whole fiver a day to play with.
The problem with renting in her area, she added, was not that the
surroundings were grotty, but that she was a poor person in a largely
affluent area.
The local shopping street was stiff with the kind of outlets catering
for people with rather more money than sense. Aesthetically pleasing
affairs retailing scented candles and clever T-shirts and the kind of
ephemera used by the wage-earning classes to reward themselves after
five weary days before the office mast.
Little boutiques with bright jokey leggings, and witty sweaters, and
coloured canvas shoes demanding to be included in the holiday wardrobe.
Walking down that street was a very particular kind of torture,
reflected my correspondent. The images mocked you at every turn. And, if
you succumbed, if you spent half the daily allowance on the candle,
terminal guilt set in.
Her eloquent testimony; her telling description of being in the
affluent society but not of it, homed in on the core of the debate. For
according to the evidence assembled by the Institute of Fiscal Studies
we should concentrate on the fact that relatively speaking today's poor
are richer than 20 years ago. They are liable to have more disposable
income. To which the honest response must surely be Gawd help the poor
of 20 years ago.
But the institute, and the rest of us, should know better than that.
It's several decades since Professor Peter Townsend made a compelling
case for different definitions of poverty. He argued that added to the
self-evident indicators of being warm and fed and having access to
health care should be the equally vital business of not being excluded
from typical contemporary lifestyles.
And if that includes ''luxuries'' like taking your kids for a holiday
once a year, then not having that option made you poor.
My letter writer may or may not have known of that institute's report,
but she did hear at first hand the thoughts of a contributor to our
radio discussion, the Adam Smith Institute's Douglas Mason. Douglas was
on top form. People in housing estates in Scotland didn't know what poor
was. They should try living in a Third World shack. OK so they couldn't
afford tickets to the opera. Neither could he. And having lit the blue
touch paper he retired to whatever planet he's currently inhabiting.
In fairness to Douglas he is far from being alone. That particular
brand of visually challenged arrogance is actually quite fashionable. It
was evident over much of last week when a procession of business
spokespeople affected genuine incomprehension that the public saw fit to
question the pay and share option deals of executives in our once public
utilities. All right so they earn hundreds of thousands of pounds for a
job which paid a fraction of that three years ago. So they have a shares
package which allows them to win the company lottery as well. Lots of
people in other countries in similar positions get more so what's the
problem?
It seems they have no facility for grasping the fact that if companies
fire their staff or curtail their employees' income when the business is
performing well, and simultaneously throw more money at the boardroom,
then there is something of a shortfall in natural justice. That's what
finally motivated some normally passive shareholders to travel in their
thousands to the British Gas AGM and try to blow the whistle on
corporate greed. And, as we now know, the irony of that noble but doomed
exercise was that the board were bailed out by the block vote of pension
funds. Pension funds representing you and me and thousands like us.
That self-same brand of apparent indifference to the performance and
commitment of rank-and-file staff is now endemic from the health service
to the banking sector.
It's not difficult for the chief executives of banks to point to their
success in maximising profits, after all, when that enhanced performance
is largely due to effecting widescale redundancies and screwing the
customers.
There was yet another report out last Friday. It confirmed the
dangerous trend of steep rises in the pay and perks of those already
earning significant sums of money, and decreased access to benefits for
those at the bottom of the pile.
Finding that distasteful is not a matter of envy. Nobody can pretend
that everyone is born equal in terms of ability. Nobody should begrudge
adequate rewards to those whose talents and efforts merit recognition.
But we would have not just a fairer, but a safer, healthier society if
that recognition applied to the whole population and not the favoured,
fatter few.

IT is reassuring to have friends who are more eccentric than oneself.
Samuel Taylor Coleridge must have been a great comfort to Wordsworth,
Southey, Charles Lamb, etc, despite being a constant worry. It is one
thing to invent Pantisocracy, with the elevated aim of taking communism
to America, which Coleridge briefly planned with Southey. It's quite
another to log the rate at which one's toenails grow or, when the ink
ran out, to write poems in one's own blood, which took Coleridge's
nonconformity into a different league. Until the realities of the French
Revolution became clear, even Wordsworth was something of a poetic
firebrand, of course. Yet despite being better known, it is to be
doubted if he wrote any lines as compelling as those of The Ancient
Mariner, or as evocative as the introduction to Kubla Khan. Coleridge's
genius was sadly warped by opium, a far easier drug to succumb to in the
days when laudanum was the only painkiller. Yet despite his addiction he
is credited with taking English literature from the eighteenth century
into a new era of thought and expression.
It will be interesting to see if our view of the man is changed by
research at University College, Dublin, which claims the discovery of
300 of Coleridge's unrecorded poems. When completed later this year, the
collected Coleridge works will be formidable: three volumes of poetry,
and no fewer than 25 of prose.
It is human nature that our image of the man will remain that of an
eccentric -- the poet who enlisted as a common soldier, ''Silas Tomken
Comberbatch'', and had to be rescued by his brothers. The man who
soliloquised for so long that Charles Lamb once escaped only by cutting
off the button he was holding. In later days his learned harangues were
no longer intelligible. After one two-hour discourse, uninterrupted,
Wordsworth was asked by a companion how much he understood. ''Not a
single syllable,'' he replied.

THE Labour leadership's attempt to impose women candidates willy nilly
on a fair number of council seats selecting for coming elections is
evoking much resistance. It looks as if the rank and file distress and
opposition, about which there has not been too much publicity, is
causing a rethink. That would be all to the good. There may be too few
women in politics (in all parties) but the way to change is not by some
declaration in favour of a crude formula which reserves so many seats
for women regardless of the wishes of the local organisations supposedly
choosing and campaigning for them freely. Not only Labour men are
fighting the imposition; some Labour women find the whole operation
distasteful and patronising as well. Although the movement was supposed
to be voluntary it is only a step from establishing such quotas in all
elected spheres, and not just for women, but for all groups which are
perceived as minorities and discriminated against. Labour's idea is a
sort of positive discrimination and while it was not expected to right
the accumulated wrongs of the past at one go it was intended as a
dramatic gesture bound, because of its size, to make an impact. It is,
in short, a kind of social engineering. If, however, the whole exercise
was intended to be voluntary there would have been no opposition: very
few local Labour parties would volunteer such arrangements.
Actually women are not a minority for there are more female than male
voters but the evidence that their political under-representation is an
issue is hard to identify. There is, for example, little evidence of
gender determining the outcome of elections, or even winning votes, in
individual seats or even nationally. Such questions, which are normally
at the heart of politicians' electoral calculations, are brushed aside
by proponents of ''women-only'' shortlists for Labour selection
committees. Supporters believe that what is involved is social progress,
and the power of the leadership should be used to force local parties to
do what is an evident public good by restricting their choice of
candidate. Opposing this misuse of centralised power is extremely
difficult since it can easily seem like opposing the advancement of
women. But it does need opposing, which is in fact what is now
happening, if belatedly.

EVERYTHING in life is a learning experience, including the alarming
events surrounding the demise of Health Care International's hospital at
Clydebank. That said, it will be intriguing to find out just how much we
will learn from the examination of the subject later this month by the
Public Accounts Committee. A particularly intriguing question concerns
the amount of taxpayers' money ploughed into the private project by the
Scottish Office. A sum of #15m has been mentioned in the past. It is
accepted that this is an incomplete figure and other accounts suggest
that the sum may be a good deal larger.
A meeting of creditors of HCI was held in Glasgow last week, and
following from that it is claimed that money and other assistance
advanced by the Government may add up to nearer #30m. All of this will
be lost. Mr Lang is a careful man, although not careful enough to stop
public money flowing into a very poor investment, but it is now time to
give in detail the dimension of the public exposure to this deeply
unwise investment.  Other aspects are even more worrying although,
again, it is perhaps optimistic to suppose that much will be learned
from them. The Scottish Office backed the HCI project because it
believed apparently that sufficient numbers of patients would be treated
from the beginning to enable the hospital to succeed financially. It
seems to have based this belief on nothing more substantial than fresh
air and hope. Any prudent investor would have discovered that
insufficient contracts were in place to ensure a steady flow of
patients. The company failed because it did not have these contracts and
the Scottish Office is culpable because it either failed to enquire
about contracts or, having enquired and found them wanting, did not
care. Either way it is a disgrace. All of these strictures apply equally
to the prestigious banking syndicate involved.
A further question centres on the possibility that an element of
ideological support for private medicine may have prompted the Scottish
Office to put public money into a venture which so patently lacked the
basic ingredients for success. It is unlikely that the Public Accounts
Committee will want to dip into this particular morass, but the
suspicion remains.

THE short span of American history always becomes clearer when I
remind myself that, of the 41 Presidents, a round dozen have been in
office in my own lifetime.
From George Washington through Jefferson and Lincoln to Roosevelt,
Kennedy and Clinton, they have covered a broad spectrum of humanity,
four of them felled by the assassin's bullet, while the ever-silent
Calvin Coolidge, a man noted for doing nothing, drew that memorable
comment from Dorothy Parker. On hearing that Coolidge was dead, she
said: ''How can they tell?''
Into that pattern of varied humans, who have always fascinated me, it
is difficult to fit someone you know personally. Yet that is the outside
possibility with the news that the Scots-bred Malcolm Forbes jun, better
known as Steve, has serious thoughts of running for the presidency next
year.
A Republican displeased with his party's candidates, Steve Forbes has
set the wheels in motion. With Robert Dole and others falling out of
favour, the 47-year-old owner of Forbes Magazine will decide very soon
if he is to bid for the Republican nomination.
In terms of intellect at least, he is a giant beside the more recent
occupants of the White House.
The very idea would delight his late father, the colourful Malcolm
Forbes, who was tipped for President in the 1950s but was beaten for the
Governorship of New Jersey -- and diverted himself instead to becoming
one of America's richest men.
Malcolm's flamboyant image, as big-spending tycoon and lover of
Elizabeth Taylor, covered a much more serious man, who knew the business
value of all that publicity.
He also knew the right side of a bawbee, as did his father, Bertie
Forbes, the poor country boy from New Deer in Aberdeenshire who took his
journalistic skills to America and founded Forbes Magazine in 1917.
On his periodic returns to the Buchan homeland, Bertie would play
Saturday-night card games with my parents at the famous old railway
hotel at Cruden Bay. Poker and solo were the favourites.
My father always recalled how Bertie sent the teenage Malcolm to
collect the evening sports paper. He gave him a penny -- and, when he
came back, held out his hand for the halfpenny change!
One of 10 children, Bertie was by then a millionaire, when that word
meant something, but it was son Malcolm who would expand the empire and
raise the family fortune into the realms of the unthinkable.
When he died in 1990 there was inevitable speculation about the
calibre of the offspring. In New York in the sixties, I had first known
his four sons as kilted lads who all played the bagpipes and were well
versed on their Scottish background. Daughter Moira came to Aberdeen
University.
Steve was the eldest, a different animal from his father, quieter,
more studious, a young man who listened and learned. But soon he was
emerging as his own man, reckoned one of the best young business brains
in America and blessed with the wisdom of a much older head.
His speaking engagements took in Scotland, where his phenomenal grasp
of world economics, expressed without notes, made a deep impression.
His father left more and more to Steve's judgment so that the
change-over on Malcolm's death was almost seamless. Malcolm had
undertaken to be president of the Royal Highland Show in 1992, but
chairman Jack Sleigh transferred the invitation to Steve.
As a family friend who had already acquired Pitsligo Castle in
Aberdeenshire for Malcolm, I advised Steve to take it on, as one way of
making himself known in the land of his fathers. He did so -- and Jack
Sleigh still talks about the quietly powerful effect of his presidency.
Meanwhile, the personality of young Forbes has been emerging through
his shrewdly observed columns in the prestigious family journal, with
its paid circulation of over 700,000 taking in the bulk of America's
most influential people.
His privileged childhood at Far Hills, New Jersey, was surrounded by
names like Eisenhower, Nixon, Rockefeller. He still employs Caspar
Weinberger, Reagan's Defence Secretary. But he told me that, without
political office, he had not thought of himself as a presidential
candidate; not, that is, until he read the book Dark Horse, which told
of the ''amateur'' Wendell Wilkie, a lawyer with even fewer political
credentials who nevertheless gained the Republican nomination in 1940.
Wilkie's task was the impossible one of unseating the legendary
Franklin D Roosevelt. But at least he got within reach of the White
House. Whether Steve Forbes can emerge as another dark horse is in the
lap of the gods.
When his father died, he asked me to bring the minister from New Deer,
where grandfather Bertie is buried, to take part in the service at St
Bartholomew's on Park Avenue. The family Boeing 727 duly arrived from
New York to take us there.
In that huge cathedral, where Malcolm's lady-friend Elizabeth Taylor
was seated with Richard Nixon, Steve publicly honoured his father but
stayed loyal to his mother and told how the divorce, after 39 years, had
shattered Malcolm.
Roberta was given her place that day and heard another son say: ''My
father had no difficulty with women -- he simply married the best.''
It was a touching demonstration of how emotional conflict affects us
all -- even when your sights are set on the White House of Washington.

FOLLOWING the extremely regrettable and expensive fire at the Eastwood
District Council depot which eliminated the entire cleansing-vehicle
fleet, the district council, as well as reviewing its security
arrangements, might consider its cleansing and recycling arrangements
for the future (May 30).
Unlike other neighbouring authorities which encourage the recycling of
glass, paper, plastic, steel, aluminium, textiles, etc, not only through
recycling centres but by encouraging domestic users to sort waste and
the use of modern adapted collection equipment, Eastwood makes no
arrangements beyond a few bottle banks scattered around the district.
When residents put out their domestic rubbish crammed into the
solitary bin bag supplied by Eastwood, it all ends up in increasingly
scarce landfill sites.
Eastwood District Council must take the opportunity of this
involuntary clean start to inaugurate a responsible and comprehensive
waste recycling policy and re-equipping with this in mind.
At least something would then be retrieved from the ashes of disaster
at Rouken Glen.

WITH reference to your report about the Duchess of York's recent trip
to Romania (May 23), I would like to point out that the trip was not
sponsored by Scottish European Aid, who invited the Duchess, but Rank
Xerox, who held a reception in her honour.
Scottish European Aid is committed to using donor's money as carefully
as possible and would never spend it in this way.
We have been working in Romania in difficult conditions for over four
years, and the visit was a great honour for us. Her trip was a valid
significant step forward for our charity, and we were delighted that her
royal highness could spend time with our volunteers and the children and
adults whose lives we are trying to improve.

KIRSTY SCOTT'S pleasant article about pipe smokers and with its
mention of Harold Wilson (May 31) reminded me that he used to be a
customer of the former well-known tobacconists, Rattrays of Perth.
On his visits to Perth to attend annual conferences of the Scottish
Labour Party, he often visited Rattrays, with its polished wooden
shelves and cabinets, to sample and order some of his favourite blends
of tobacco.
As I sometimes sat next to him on the conference platform I had a
close-up view (and smell) of the famous pipe in action. In the 1960s,
the usually hot air of Labour conferences, in Scotland at any rate, used
to be polluted very much by tobacco smoke. It was Janey Buchan who quite
rightly eventually got the delegates to agree to ban smoking but I
cannot recollect that the party leader ever raised any objection.
Harold Wilson must have had an assortment of pipes at home. The one I
remember had a massive bowl which I think he may have used not only
because it was well matured, but also as a means of deterring kindly
folk from offering him a fill from their pounch. It could hold very much
more than a pinch of tobacco.
Stanley Baldwin, who had three terms of office as Conservative Prime
Minister in the period between the First and Second World Wars, was
another famous pipe smoker. He featured in an advertisement for another
popular tobacco, with a Scottish connection, called Presbyterian
Mixture.
The advertisement in your predecessor, The Glasgow Herald, featured a
black silhouette of the head and shoulders of a man, smoking a pipe,
which looked suspiciously like Stanley Baldwin; it also had a caption
which said something like: ''My thoughts grow in the aroma of this
particular blend.''

YOUR headline, Wife's post angers university staff (May 30), should
have read ''some staff''.
I was not angered by news of Dr Davies's appointment. What Glasgow
University needs is full flexibility to hire and fire staff, most
notably the right to forcibly retire dead wood, some of which is
hopelessly under-qualified and itself appointed without open
competition.
I wonder if it was this latter which acted as your anonymous

PAUL H SCOTT states that ''If we are to see, and let the rest of the
world see, the best that our theatre is capable of producing, we need a
national theatre which can give to our best plays the resources they
require'' (May 27).
I and many others in the theatre world are challenging the idea of a
national theatre for Scotland because collectively every theatre company
in Scotland represents our country and presents a diversity of work
which is what makes our theatre unique.
What is the best environment in which productions are created? Would a
national theatre provide this?
In Scotland we have been lucky enough to see some of the best world
theatre. We have always been fortunate in having the Edinburgh Festival
but also in recent years I have seen at Mayfest, the Tramway in Glasgow,
and at the International Children's Festival in Edinburgh the most
inspirational, innovative, and challenging productions ever.
I would include in this category companies of the calibre of the
Canadian Les Deux Mondes, Lepage, and the Italian Teatromusica. All of
these are examples of the finest work I will ever hope to see.
What makes their work so good? Basically time and resources. Les Deux
Mondes, a children's theatre company, spent three years completing their
production of The Tale of Teeka. This show will tour for years all over
the world proving that the resources used, while developing the
production, were well spent. This is a common attitude of many companies
from abroad -- you get back what you put in.
Secondly. these companies from abroad represent their countries not by
producing shows which are particularly about Italian or Canadian history
or culture, but by creating terrific theatre which tackles the big
universal themes, and this is what makes them long lasting,
international works.
We need to learn from the companies abroad. This does not mean, as
Paul H Scott suggested, that we would be ''contributing little, or very
little, to the total of human diversity when we merely imitate others''.
Emulating great work does not mean copying.
We are Scottish, we live in Scotland, and this cannot help but inform
our work. For Scotland to aim to produce theatre of the calibre of the
top international companies we need to ''think big''. We need to look
beyond Scotland and ''Scottishness'' and this applies both to funders
and our indigenous companies.

G H BENNETT (Myth that Bruce was French, May 19) is not comparing like
with like. Twentieth-century Brazil is not the same as twelfth-century
Britain.
I am challenging the validity of calling the French-speaking
aristocracy of medieval Britain Scottish and English in the context of
modern, democratic nationhood. There is a scholarly alliance between
Scottish and English historians to conceal this aspect of our past.
John le Patourel called the Plantagenets French, not English, ''in the
sense that Normandy, Anjou, and the rest were French at the time''.
David I's charters are addressed to ''Francis et Anglicis''. Before
the Battle of the Standard, Ralph Nowal, Bishop of Orkney, is recorded
as saying: ''Scotland, subject to you (the Normans) by right, strives to
repulse you . . . ''
Medieval baronial Scotland was created by the Normans which other
nobles adopted even if they had, like Niall, Earl of Carrick, ''a
distinctly Celtic background'' though Niall, originally Irish, was a
common Norman name, as was Marjorie.
Moreover, you and I, Jock Tamson's bairns, for the most part, are the
descendants of the English-speaking peasant farmers, ''the poor
husbandmen of the King of Scotland'', who formed the bulk of the
population of Lowland Scotland and who had little to do with the
politics of the social elite they supported.

IN his article on the Bosnian conflict John Macleod asserts that the
American Civil War would have been won in six months, by October 1861
presumably, if not for ''timorous and stupid'' Union generals such as
George McLellan (May 30). This is arrant nonsense.
John Macleod should know that McLellan was not called from military
success in Western Virginia to reorganise and command the army of the
Potomac until after the defeat at Manassas on July 21, 1861.
Timorous and/or stupid he and other Union generals such as Burnside
and Hooker may have been, but John Macleod completely overlooks the
military genius of opponents like Stonewall Jackson and Bedford Forrest,
two thoroughly nasty individuals, and Robert E Lee, perhaps a decent man
fighting for a thoroughly nasty cause.
The struggle to overcome the confederate bulwark of Vicksburg, many
hundreds of miles from the theatre of operations of the ''timorous
ones'' and directed by Sherman and Grant, two very un-McLellan-like
officers, occupied the Union army of the Tennessee from autumn, 1862,
till July 4, 1863.
As late in the war as June, 1864, almost a full year after the heavy
defeat at Gettysburg, Lee was still able to inflict 7000 casualties in
eight minutes on Grant's army at Cold Harbour.
That war was a ghastly catalogue of such bloody and merciless actions,
fought by good and bad men, in military and moral terms, on both sides.
The absolute determination of the South to fight such a war against a
clearly stronger adversary meant that the bloodshed could have ended
within six months only had the Union, after early Southern successes,
conceded Confederation secession.
Lincoln would never have accepted such a solution nor, I suspect,
would John Macleod.
The notion that any war, just or not, in which one camp has a
preponderance of men and material and even, perhaps, God on its side,
will be over by Christmas has always been a dangerous one.

I WONDER if Bill Smith (June 1) remembers the Peterloo Massacre. When
the news of this atrocity reached Shelley he penned the famous Mask of
Anarchy, a clarion call to the people.
This is a poem that has never left the lips of all unsung fighters for
justice and human liberty:
Rise like Lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number.
Shake your chains to earth like dew
Which in sleep had fallen on you --
Ye are many -- they are few.
No milksop lackey, this splendidly attuned man. Alone, this one poem
ensures for him the crown of Bays.
But his output was enormous. How about those lyrical effusions of his?
-- The Cloud'', To a Skylark''?
We look before and after
And pine for what is nought.
And of course what young lover can forget his Love's Philosophy, that
invocation to the Law Divine?
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea.
Shelley, shipwrecked and drowned, and him not yet 30 years of age. A
poet only at the beginning of his life. Despite the unfeeling and
nonsensical dismissal of Shelley by Bill Smith, the feeling persists
that Smith, in his worship of MacDiarmid, has become lost in a
wilderness of jargon. He is to be pitied.
Note his disparagement of Coleridge and that sly reference to Dundee's
own McGonagall. Can we believe Hazlitt when he tells us that Coleridge
at 24 had read almost everything and that his creativity was boundless?
Do we throw away the Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Kubla Khan because
this man is obsessed by the music of McGonagall and the lack of it in
MacDiarmid?
As Francis Bacon wrote: ''The gardens of the Muses keep the privilege
of the golden age; they ever flourish and are in league with Time. The
Monuments of Wit survive the Monuments of Power; the Verses of a Poet
endure without a syllable lost, while States and Empires pass many
Periods.''
I hope Bill Smith is listening. For the last word is with our own
Robert Burns:
What's a' jargon o' your schools,
Your Latin names for horns an' stools;
If honest Nature made you fools,
What sairs your grammars?

DUNCAN BROWN'S puerile attempt to dismiss Hugh MacDiarmid simply won't
wash (May 24). There are countless readers all over the world who
recognise the quality of MacDiarmid's work, in a range of different
poetic forms.
Lyrics such as Milk-wort and Bog-cotton or Of my First Love are
excellent examples of poetry that can appeal immediately to the
non-specialist, while On a Raised Beach is one of the twentieth
century's great philosophical verse-meditations, standing beside Eliot's
The Waste Land, Rilke's Duino Elegies, and Neruda's The Heights of
Macchhu Picchu.
In the scale of greatness, MacDiarmid is better than Eliot and bigger
than Pound -- which is a crude way of asserting quality but one that is
easily recognised by those who have read all three of these poets, and
not just the Anglo-Americans.
Let's be clear: MacDiarmid was the most important thing to happen in
Scotland since 1707. He destroyed the complacency of the cultural
establishment and asserted an international scale of literary values
against which Scotland's art might be measured. The evidence of that is
in his essays and journalism, published by Carcanet in 1992 (Selected
Prose) and forthcoming this year (Contemporary Scottish Studies).
It is always too easy to forget about the importance of that
international vision, and to lapse into Palgravian Anglo-centrism. A
freedom fighter is good for everyone, men and women alike, if they
believe in freedom.
Moreover, Hugh MacDiarmid is a major twentieth-century poet: it's as
simple as that. To begin from the premise that he was in some sense a
minor poet capable only of writing bad verse is to disqualify oneself
from any claim to credibility as a literary critic at all.
As for the notion that MacDiarmid was ''a crude Realist'' and the
assertion that his work ''has no artistic appeal and is bereft of the
common humanity in all great literature'', the evidence of the Selected
Poems available in paperback in the Penguin Modern Classics series is
all to the contrary.
Read The Dead Leibknecht for the horrific recognition of revolutionary
fervour; read Jeannie MacQueen for its generosity of humour and
sympathy; read In Memoriam James Joyce for a sustained and thoughtful
consideration of language and the value of linguistic diversity.
Few poets can be so immediately, so shockingly honest and direct; few
poets have had to contend with such extensive unfounded rejection and
scurrilous attack. MacDiarmid is a poet of great eloquence and flair, of
rich humour and deep psychological insight.
Mr Brown's letter may be symptomatic of a tide of feeling running
against the proper appreciation and evaluation of his work.
Nevertheless, MacDiarmid is held in high esteem by those who know his
work well, and he is held in remembered affection by many more people
than Mr Brown's letter suggests.

Few hoteliers have a retiring nature and Maurice Taylor is certainly
not one of them. He tells Cameron Simpson that his latest comeback is in
the Frank Sinatra category
RUMOURS of his retirement have been greatly exaggerated. Maurice
Taylor, one of the most famous names in the Glasgow hotel scene is back
with a new Holiday Inn for the city.
Work is already under way on the #4m, 80-bedroom hotel which is being
built by Mr Taylor's company, Chardon Leisure, diagonally opposite the
Royal Concert Hall in West Nile Street.
However, the sign, where the hotel's name should be, is covered by
black paint. Today it will be revealed officially that under a
newly-struck franchise deal between Chardon Leisure and Holiday Inn
Worldwide it will be the Holiday Inn Garden Court Hotel.
This time round Mr Taylor, the hotelier and restaurateur behind some
of the most succesful and innovative concepts in the 70s and 80s, will
''conduct the orchestra at the new hotel, not play in the band'' in his
comeback which he likened to that of ''Frank Sinatra's 27th''.
Now ''in the autumn of his hotel career'', it is nearly a decade since
Mr Taylor sold the four hotels he owned in Glasgow -- the Beacons,
Lorne, Garfield, and Apsley.
His thoughts at the time turned to retiring in Portugal. Hawaii came
into the picture too -- a place where he could indulge a personal
passion for scuba-diving. But he made a comeback in 1990 with the #4m
Parklands Country Club in Newton Mearns, his last venture in the city.
He sold out 18 months ago and turned his thoughts again to retiring.
However, Mr Taylor -- who is reticent when asked his age and says he
has been 39 for ages -- said yesterday: ''I thought of going to Hawaii
but the grass skirts wouldn't have suited me. The pull of the hotel
business has proved too much for me.
''It's a thrill to be introducing this Holiday Inn concept to Glasgow.
I believe that the partnership of Holiday Inn and Maurice Taylor will
offer the innovation and professionalism of a brand leader combined with
the personal touch of an independent hotelier like myself.''
The Garden Court brand, which Holiday Inn Worldwide launched in 1989,
is designed to provide a high standard of bedroom accommodation with the
services and facilities considered essential to both the business and
leisure guest.
In Glasgow, the hotel had made provision for conference and banqueting
facilities which will accommodate about 70 delegates, as well as a
brasserie and bar.
But didn't Glasgow need another hotel like the Iranian book of the
month club needed Salman Rushdie? Mr Taylor disagreed. He said: ''Two
independent surveys have shown that there is a shortage of 600 beds at
the value-for-money end of the spectrum. This is the need the new hotel
will supply.
''We are not trying to talk down the Glasgow market but we will supply
things people most want in hotels.''
It will, he said, have character and a French atmosphere and reunite
him with La Bonne Auberge which Taylor created and opened in 1975 as the
pioneering bridgehead for Glasgow's new wave of eating and drinking
establishments.
The hotel will also look French from the outside. Mr Taylor said: ''We
will sell it from the pavement. The canopy, for instance, has been
cribbed from the legendary French restaurant the Tour d'Argent in Paris
where I worked as a waiter and served the likes of de Gaulle and
Brigitte Bardot.
''In essence it will be the European version of what the Americans
have a reputation for -- a hotel with a relaxed, friendly atmosphere.''
Among other things the hotel will have an international satellite
reservation system -- the first in the UK -- while rooms, which will
start at about #49 a night, will offer modems for guests with laptops.
Mr Paul Bell, franchise development director with Holiday Inn
Worldwide, said: ''We are delighted to be working with Maurice in
developing this hotel in Glasgow. This property is in an oustanding
location and will offer guests services and facilities to match.''
Once it opens in January 1996 the hotel is expected to create about
100 jobs.
Holiday Inn Worldwide is the world's largest single hotel brand with
more than 1950 hotels and 360,000 guest rooms in more than 60 countries
and employs 160,000 staff worldwide.

Charles Kennedy reports that while South Africa has made startling
progress, some of its toughest challenges lie ahead
THE political poster on the road in from Cape Town airport sums up the
challenge before South Africa and its multi-racial people: to turn
''Human Wrongs into Human Rights''. The distance travelled already is
almost unbelievable -- meetings on consecutive days with Deputy
President F W de Klerk and President Mandela confirming that
overwhelming feeling. But, in many respects, the really difficult part
is now being faced -- and it is not just the obvious problem of the
impossibility of fulfilling black African material aspirations. It is
equally that the practical dismantling of apartheid and the introduction
of democracy at local level now has to be achieved.
''Democracy's On A Roll: Are You?'' asks another wall poster, this one
underscoring the immense task of registering for the first time nearly
24 million voters, almost half of whom are in outlying, rural areas.
Local elections in 705 new local authority areas are to take place on
November 1. The registration drive, for which there is no central
co-ordination, has been undertaken on a local basis and must be
completed by today. Putting into practice the provisions of the Local
Government Transition Act is proving a herculean task across the
country's nine provinces.
V Z Slabbert, a liberal white who co-chairs a task force trying to
implement the Act, describes his headaches in mechanical terms: ''It's
like trying to dismantle a motor car and then reassemble it -- without
switching off the engine.'' He anticipates about 56% success rate from
the registration drive, itself a remarkable achievement.
Perhaps the greatest difficulty flows from the abolition of the
apartheid-driven Group Areas Act. Now, at local level, new community
boundaries are having to be drawn on the basis of natural associations
of social interests -- schools, communication links, health coverage and
so on. This is the point at which the white community is going to
experience, in a tangible, everyday sense, the feel of the ''new'' South
Africa.
For students of, or adherents to, constitutional reform issues there
is much to ponder in the philosophical analysis set out by Slabbert. He
compares the nature of the South African change with other historic
national transformations and points to its unique feature: it is ''deal
driven''. Some countries change by means of military coup, civil war,
de-colonialisation or intervention from an outside force. In South
Africa's case, the recasting was negotiated internally, resulting in the
deal-clinching Record of Understanding among the former adversaries.
Since the basis of this ''deal driven'' accord was to create
legitimacy through democracy, it now becomes essential to establish the
common franchise at local as well as national level. Only if citizens
feel that the local delivery mechanisms are legitimate will they be
likely to accept the decisions which will follow.
While democratic legitimacy at national level has delivered President
Mandela, at local level democratic legitimacy may be more about what
cannot be delivered, at least in the short term.
However, the longer-term economic indicators have to be encouraging.
South African business, now able to shed its semi-clandestine
appearance, is rapidly on the move internationally. From January to
October 1994 trade grew by 30%. The Mandela government is pursuing a
generally cautious fiscal and economic strategy: the budget deficit is
steadily coming down and the intention to scrap exchange controls has
been well flagged. An agreement has been struck with the World Trade
Organisation to phase out the rampant protectionism of the apartheid
era. International business circles have noted all this with approval.
So have individual consumers. Wine exports to Britain, for example,
have grown over the past two years from 190,000 to two million cases; in
Canada the consumption rate has shot from zero to 250,000 cases in one
year. Similarly, tourism is rapidly expanding.
Internally, much political emphasis is being placed on the ambitious
reconstruction and development programme, which aims to give effect to
the twin government priorities -- the levelling of social/racial
inequalities and the furtherance of national reconciliation. The
programme is headed by Jay Naidoo, a member of the ANC executive and an
ex-communist trade union activist. This would be akin to Tariq Ali
becoming President of the Board of Trade.
Yet political sources confirm that Naidoo has become one of the more
monetarist-minded in the upper echelons of government. Ideologically,
like the best South African rugby players, he travels with speed -- and
lightly.
Somewhere between the grand designs, high rhetoric and local delivery
of social improvements, will lie the legacy of this founding,
multi-racial administration. So far, history has shown that, in South
Africa at least, miracles can happen. They are going to need a few more.

Robert Burns died two centuries ago, but his poetry has kept his name
alive throughout the years.
Lesley Duncan reports on the worldwide admiration for Burns and an
impressive festival planned to mark the bicentenary of his death
ROBERT BURNS died 200 years ago next year -- a circumstance which is
not destined to be overlooked. Hollywood has yet to turn its sights on
the farming, fornicating poet of genius -- though with Rob Roy, Sir
William Wallace, and Robert the Bruce already undergoing cinema
treatment, this may just be a matter of time. Meanwhile, an
international festival of impressive scale is being planned to celebrate
the Burns bicentenary year.
The festival is, appropriately, being masterminded in Ayr -- that
unsurpassable town for honest men and bonnie lassies. Its activities
will stretch as far as Asia and the Antipodes. This scope may surprise
some Scots. For, however much they revere the poet through the
sentimental haze of whisky and haggis each January, they may find it
hard to grasp how seriously he is regarded and deeply admired elsewhere
in the world.
Although, as festival director John Struthers explains, not all events
are finalised, the list is formidable. The festival starts off in the
new year with what's billed as ''the world's largest international Burns
supper'', the date being, appropriately, January 25. Parties of 400 to
800 people will go through the time-honoured rites in locations reaching
from New York, New Delhi, and Auckland, to Sydney, London, and Glasgow.
Satellite TV coverage is under discussion.
Perhaps surprisingly -- granted the traditional Russian enthusiasm for
Burns (all that egalitarian emotion) -- there is no Russian
participation yet, but John Struthers is hopeful this will be organised.
On February 4 there will be a major concert in Glasgow's Royal Concert
Hall, presented jointly by the hall and the Burns Federation and
involving male voice choirs along with the talents of Moira Anderson,
Bill McCue, and Tom Fleming. There may be royalty in the audience.
Reflecting the literary raison d'etre behind the whole festival, a
poetry prize is to be launched in April or May. There will be given
themes but, says John Struthers, these will be left as open as possible
since restrictions can be discouraging. The financial rewards -- topped
by a first prize of #3000 -- are sizeable, and prize-winning poets will
have the pleasure of hearing their works read at the Kilmarnock Literary
Festival in October. The winning poems will also be published. Some 5000
to 10,000 entries are expected. Aspiring bards are well alerted.
The Tam o'Shanter story enriched by song, dance, ''live action'',
superb special effects, lights, sounds, and lasers is promised in a
''spectacular'' which, it is hoped, will attract 20,000 to 25,000 people
in the course of 12 nights. This event -- planned for various locations
including Kilmarnock, Stranraer and Dumfries -- is distinct from the
''Tam o'Shanter Experience'' at Alloway, part of the Burns National
Heritage Park, to be officially opened by the Queen on July 5.
''Pride and Passion'' is the title of an ambitious exhibition devoted
to Burns. Organised jointly by the National Library of Scotland and the
National Museum of Scotland in association with the National Galleries
of Scotland, it will open in the Royal Museum of Scotland on June 8 next
year.
Forward into July and the focus moves to Dumfries, where Burns spent
his last years before his death at 37. The Northern Sinfonia are the
musicians in a southern counties commemorative concert on July 19. Their
concert will have a Scottish flavour, including Mendelssohn's ''Scotch''
Symphony. A Scottish conductor, still to be named, will preside.
Also in July, one of the festival's most attractive events is
scheduled for the lovely setting of Culzean Castle on the Ayrshire
coast. Dame Kiri Te Kanawa will be the principal soloist in a concert
featuring a yet unnamed Scottish orchestra and other soloists. They
will, says John Struthers, ''provide a concert with a strong Scottish
personality using the life and work of Robert Burns to introduce
sections of the programme and tie the evening together.''
Granted benevolent weather this will be a special treat, with
Culzean's magnificent terraced gardens and windswept cliff-walks to
explore before and after. A Culzean Castle music weekend, including an
orchestral concert with fireworks, is also promised.
Two lighter entertainments are also planned for the summer. A Burns
Travelling Fair, with a company of 12 actors and three musicians, will
lead visitors through an eighteenth-century fair with a market, an inn,
a preacher, and all the fun and games of the time.
Towards the end of September, the Dunaskin Heritage Centre, Patna,
will be the setting for a weekend of country music with American stars.
Dumfries again sees two notable events later in the year: a music
weekend from September 27 to 29, with two concerts, one orchestral and
one by leading Scottish artists; and a literature festival concentrating
on the poetical achievements of Burns and contrasting his works with
contemporary Scottish and international literature.
In addition to these 13 keynote events, there will be almost 100
community-based and locally organised functions.
The president of the festival is the Princess Royal. Patrons to date
are John Cairney, who will talk about Burns and be doing a tour of all
the places where Burns spent a night; the folk singer Jean Redpath,
whose performances in Boston, Atlanta, and New York early next year will
help publicise the festival; Moira Anderson, who has sung Burns songs
throughout the world; and Dr James Mackay, the latest of Burns's
biographers. This last distinction will, incidentally, be assumed by
writer and Herald contributor Alan Bold when his own study of Burns is
published.
Funding for the Burns International Festival has come from local
authorities and enterprise bodies, as well as the European Regional
Development Fund under regional partnerships. Further funding from the
commercial sector and sponsors is being sought.
It will all be good for the tourist industry. Maybe, too, people will
turn with renewed pleasure and amazement to the poems, whether lyrical
or satirical, and to those peerless songs which communicate their
passions over barriers of language.

DILYS Powell's extraordinary career as film critic of The Sunday Times
spanned the golden age of cinema and today's Hollywood action
blockbusters. She died in hospital in London aged 93.
Painfully shy, she nevertheless had authoritative opinions in print
which earned her respect within the industry.
The daughter of a Bournemouth bank manager, she read French at Oxford
and was ''sent down'' for two terms for a late-night assignation with
the man who became her husband, archaeologist Humfry Payne.
Once married, they moved to Greece and she started writing book
reviews for The Sunday Times.
In 1936, Mr Payne died and she returned to London.
Three years later, she became the Sunday Times film critic, recalling
years later: ''Whoo! Nine pounds a week!''
She remained in the post throughout the golden years of cinema and up
until 1976, when she last reviewed new films for the paper. Even after
that, she worked for Punch and reviewed films for television for The
Sunday Times, right up until her death. She once said: ''A day without a
movie is a day deprived.''
She did not hesitate to give her opinion. Gone With The Wind did not
impress her on release. She wrote: ''You come out feeling that history
isn't so disturbing after all . . . one can always make a dress out of a
curtain.'' But she loved Wuthering Heights and cried at the death scene.
She relished the rise of British and European cinema and had great
influence, helping to conceive the London Film Festival and securing a
cinema release for Duel, the television film that put Steven Spielberg
on the road to success.
Her second marriage was to Sunday Times literary editor Leonard
Russell, who died in 1974.

THEY are the most unusual lighthouse keepers in Britain: to wit, a
pair of lifesize imitation eagle owls, which have been brought in to
tackle one of the strangest problems to confront lighthouse bosses.
The Butt of Lewis lighthouse in the Outer Hebrides is not only one of
the UK's most remote manned beacons -- but also a pit-stop for hundreds
of thousands of birds, migrating between the Arctic and Africa.
Attracted by the 750,000-candle power beam, the visitors -- plus vast
colonies of resident gulls, kittiwakes, fulmars, and other seabirds --
have caused a major safety headache with their droppings.
Each morning, two lighthouse keepers attach themselves to safety
harnesses to clean the glass dome of the light, 120 feet up, where winds
of more than 80 mph are recorded regularly. If the job was left for a
couple of days, it could almost mean lights out for the beam, which
should be seen 25 miles away from the rocky coastline.
Various type of geese, including brent and greylag, head for the Butt
-- plus redwings, fieldfares, and starlings. So do extremely rare birds,
such as the endangered corncrake.
Because the area is so vital to birds -- all protected -- culling was
immediately ruled out. However, principal lighthouse keeper Donald
Michael is a radio ham and read of a fellow enthusiast who got rid of
birds from his aerial by using imitation eagle owls.
Last week, a pair of two-foot-high plastic replicas of the fearsome
birds of prey were delivered to the 133-year-old lighthouse, on the most
northerly and windswept tip of the Isle of Lewis.
The owls were stuffed with concrete and fixed with steel bolts to
prevent them being blown away. They seem to have done the trick already.
''The birds are more apprehensive and are keeping away, sending out
distress calls,'' said a happy Mr Michael, 56.
''We have thousands of birds around us -- they are attracted by the
warmth of the light. The beam does not seem to put them off.
''Sometimes the weather is so bad we can't go out -- and that is a
worry with the glass being frosted-up by droppings. But we hope that the
bird problem is solved now. Time will tell.''

* FOR every Government denial that they are privatising the National
Health Service, opponents come up with what they see as further evidence
that this is exactly what is happening.
The latest example, a deal by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board with the
American-owned Irvine Care company to provide care for the elderly
mentally ill, is a reminder to existing NHS trusts that when competition
is introduced, someone loses.
Private-sector partnerships for the care of the dependent are already
established in the NHS; however, more recently the Government's Private
Finance Initiative has opened up the vista of acute hospital care, with
its panoply of hi-tech medicine, being bought as a commodity on behalf
of NHS patients.
The pay-off for the Government is a reduction in its public sector
borrowing, and a sharing of the risk with the consortia who build and
run the hospitals. One of the first hospitals to announce it was going
down this road was Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, whose 950-bed replacement
project, expected to cost #150m, is attracting interest from major
construction and finance consortia.
Greater Glasgow Community and Mental Health Services Trust has
received 70 inquiries from British and European companies interested in
building and running a new psychiatric unit in the grounds of Stobhill
Hospital, and Grampian Health Board has been told by the Scottish Office
to invite open competition for future provision of Stonehaven hospital
services.
The British Medical Association has now challenged John Major over a
situation which it sees as taking medical care out of the hands of NHS
professionals and into the hands of private operators.
''The introduction of this private initiative is a clear sign of the
Government's intention as to the future of the NHS,'' says Dr John
Callander, chairman of the BMA Scottish Council.
However, privatisation is a step-by-step process that has been gnawing
at the principles of the NHS since it was founded in 1948.
* Dentistry: One of the first victims of ''privatisation'' when
charges for NHS dental and ophthalmic work were imposed not long after
the NHS came into being. Now almost all dentistry in some parts of the
country is private, leaving a diminishing rump of NHS dentists in urban
areas.
* Prescriptions: Charges for these followed suit, initially at 1s (5p)
for an entire prescription, even a multiple one. Now it stands at #5.25
per item.
* Clinical services: Until now, these have been bought on an ad-hoc
basis from private hospitals, in order to clear waiting lists; normally
the NHS charters the private facilities for use by NHS doctors. The HCI
hospital in Clydebank was among the first to offer the full service with
in-house clinicians.
* NHS Trusts: The Government was at pains to deny that trusts were
''opting out'' of the NHS; but they are self-governing units which sell
their services to the NHS, either through health boards or fund-holding
GPs -- in a quasi-business fashion. The next step, floating them off as
companies, would not be far down the line if the political will was
there.
* Private Finance Initiative: The door has now been opened for
commercial companies to finance, build and operate entire hospitals and
provide other services which the NHS would buy on behalf of patients.
* Community Care: For many this is a back-door form of privatisation,
achieved by hiving off the elderly and the handicapped from NHS to local
authority social services, where free care would not be an automatic
entitlement, and patients would be means-tested and made to pay if they
had sufficient assets.
So when is privatisation not privatisation? The mantra that is
repeated by the Government is that health care is centrally funded and
free at the point of need. That, clearly, is shot full of exceptions.
Even the central funding principle is now in question if large numbers
of former NHS patients are to be cared for by social work departments.
Even allowing for the central funding element, the quantity and quality
of care will now, to some extent, be at the mercy of the local council
tax.
Even if the NHS remains largely free, however, the way is now open for
it to become, eventually, little more than an agency -- a string of
local quangos negotiating with private companies to buy packages of
health care for their patients.

Kirsty Scott reports how the full extent of the HCI fiasco is now
emerging, with fears that the cost to the public is even greater than
revealed so far, and Alan MacDermid records how creeping privatisation
is gnawing at the principles of the NHS
IT was the first thing that everybody noticed at the official opening
in June of 1994. While the operating theatres, wards, and offices at the
new Health Care International centre at Clydebank were as full of shiny
hi-tech equipment as any medic could ever wish for, the facility seemed
eerily quiet.
Even Scottish Secretary Ian Lang, who performed the opening ceremony,
was not shown delighted customers in rows of neat beds -- he was shown a
state-of-the-art filing system for dealing with the records of patients
who, quite simply, did not exist.
''At the time the press was asking: where are the patients? and I was
asking: where are the patients?'' said Clydebank MP Tony Worthington
yesterday.
Those questions were never answered but they have been raised by the
receivers in their recent report and they will be one of the central
themes when the National Audit Office report into the HCI debacle is
picked over by the Public Accounts Committee in a couple of weeks' time.
That and, more crucially, the exact amount of public money pumped into
the venture.
The National Audit Office report is the one that everyone has been
waiting for. The Scottish Select Committee report into the affair is
being held back until the NAO findings are out and the receivers' report
has given a balance-sheet outline of the financial position.
What most people will be looking for is -- probably -- a two-digit
number, a final tally for the public contribution to the facility. The
Scottish Office said yesterday that the total amount of government
grants reached #27m. Others have speculated the figure could be as high
as #40m.
The receivers, meanwhile, have underscored the question of the missing
patients by putting in print what most people have been saying, that the
venture was practically a hollow shell almost from the word go.
''From shortly after the opening it became clear that actual patient
numbers were dramatically below those originally forecast,'' said their
report. ''In order to have achieved the necessary patients-flow a
significant number of contracts would have had to have been in place
prior to the commencement of trading . . . the failure to secure such
contracts is the primary cause of the company's failure.''
That bald statement has resurrected another question -- the key one in
the whole affair: Why was the Scottish Office not aware of what was
going on?
''What this receivers' report does is reveal the scale of the losses
but, more importantly, it repeats the central question of why the
Government didn't spot this, why it was not on top of the missing
patients,'' said Tony Worthington. ''Ian Lang hasn't explained this.
No-one has properly explained it.''
HCI, as was, lasted 110 days from the official opening to the day the
receivers were called in, but the project was roughly seven years in the
planning and was dogged by delays and doubt even before it opened.
A year after Malcolm Rifkind gave the go-ahead for the project in the
summer of 1987 -- with at least 1800 jobs promised -- came the first
hiccup with officials warning they would pull out if Clydebank District
Council rejected their planning application. Then there were concerns
about the site -- and a series of financial hiccups, including the
pull-out of a Japanese bank in March of 1991. By the time it opened in
1994, people were going public with their doubts. It lasted only a few
months until Arthur Andersen was called in and it was eventually sold
off to the Abu Dhabi Investment Company. The most recent press bulletins
on the hospital concerned a recruiting drive and the admission of some
NHS patients.
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday called for Ian
Lang to consider his position over the affair. He said the receivers'
figures underlined ''the spectacular folly'' of the entire enterprise.
''I think this is an area where anyone responsible for this amount of
public loss of money should really be considering his position . . . the
Govermment have said that they didn't know until August of last year
that the thing was in trouble. If that is the case how did they not
know?''
Still trying to make some sense of the situation which has consumed
his constituency, Tony Worthington said yesterday he thinks HCI quite
literally ''fell through the cracks''.
''It should not have done because it's not just an inward investment.
When the Secretary of State says we have had 'x' number of inward
investment projects and some are bound to fail, this is one of the
biggest. If there was one project they should have been looking at this
was it. The Secretary of State would have been a lot more convincing if
he said we made mistakes on this. So far he has just postured and said
these things happen.''
''I think this is a resignation issue,'' said Mr Jim Devine of Unison.
''This is not going away. Clearly Ian Lang and Malcolm Rifkind have got
to seriously consider their positions . . . the Government claim they
had a report which supported their position, but no-one has ever seen
it. Someone has got to carry the can.''
He added: ''The receivers report totally vindicates the claims we made
from the very start of this project. We did not oppose it on the grounds
of ideology. We opposed it because it was a flawed project. When the
Irish were offered the project they made it very clear they wouldn't
touch it with a barge pole. They would have nothing to do with it. We
called it at the time the Scottish De Lorean.
''If you were in the Middle East and you could afford to fly to a
foreign country for treatment, your first choice would be Harley Street,
your second choice would be Switzerland and the third choice would be to
bring your own doctor over. For the services it provides you need an
international reputation and clearly they did not have that.''
He said HCI was a hard pill for the healthcare industry to swallow
when the amount of public money which disappeared into the project could
have solved the latest dispute.
''It's very interesting when you look at the whole health services
dispute in Scotland where we could give everyone an across-the-board 3%
and it would come to #28m. We could solve the dispute with what went
into this white elephant.''
The Scottish Office, meanwhile, will not be drawn into discussion of
the HCI fiasco or the receivers' report until the National Audit Office
document is out. They insist that the amount of Government grants to the
facility totals #27m and can't comment on potential loss of taxes.
''We don't know what it is,'' said a spokeswoman yesterday. ''The
official call to account for what the Government did, whether right or
wrong, that process is already in motion and there is nothing we can say
at this point.'' Ian Lang could not be reached for comment.

<HEADLINE>Calls for restrictions on sectarian rallies after 63 arrests and injuries to five policemen Violence mars republican march</HEADLINE>

A LOTHIAN region councillor yesterday defended his committee's
decision to allow a republican march through Edinburgh which resulted in
five police officers being injured, two of them requiring hospital
treatment for face and head injuries.
Sixteen people were arrested and charged with public order offences
before and during Saturday's 300-strong march and rally by the James
Connolly Society.
A further 47 people were detained temporarily but later released
without charge.
Police officers, in a major operation costing thousands of pounds,
outnumbered marchers by almost two to one along the route.
The violence erupted only weeks after the Scottish Police Federation
approved unanimously a motion from Lothian and Borders joint branch
board calling for recognition of ''the serious disruption caused by
sectarian marches''.
The federation approved a call for its joint central committee to seek
changes to legislation which would preclude the use of any road for such
processions.
The committee is due to meet in Stranraer on June 13 and is likely to
discuss the issue.
On June 17, an Independent Loyal Orange Order parade, which has been
approved by Lothian region's transportation committee, will march
through Edinburgh.
Yesterday, Assistant Chief Constable Tom Wood said he expected some
degree of confrontation on the streets of the capital as a result of it,
but not on Saturday's scale.
''There will be opposition, I have no doubt. But we said we could
police the Connolly Society march and we did and we said we could police
the march on June 17 and we can.''
Mr Wood said there had been a ''fairly significant group'' of around
100 opponents of the Connolly parade.
Councillors had been warned there was a risk of violent clashes
between militant loyalist and republican groups on Saturday and at the
one to be held on June 17.
The Edinburgh Loyalist Coalition had been told that its members would
be arrested if they tried to disrupt Saturday's march and rally in
memory of Edinburgh-born Connolly, who was executed for his part in the
1916 Easter Rising in Dublin.
Yesterday, Councillor Kenneth Harrold, Labour vice-chairman of the
committee, defended the decision to allow the Connolly march and the
June 17 parade to go ahead on the basis that people had a democratic
right to demonstrate. ''We made the right decision,'' he said.
Pointing out that there were difficulties in applying a blanket ban,
he said he and others on the committee had hoped there would not have
been counter-demonstrations given the current peaceful situation in
Northern Ireland.
''We were sadly wrong,'' stated Councillor Harrold. He said, however,
that Saturday's events would be re-examined when the committee next had
a request from the Connolly Society.
SLD Councillor Mrs Marilyne MacLaren, who monitored the march in and
around her Sciennes/Marchmont ward, has called for a special committee
to be set up to review all marches.
''I will be pushing for the new unitary authority to look at the whole
issue of marches and the policy to be adopted towards sectarian ones,''
she said.
''If there is trouble for whatever reason, we must seriously think
about not giving them permission next time. How far do we tolerate
this?''
Constable Norman MacLeod, secretary of the Lothian and Borders joint
branch board, who will speak on the issue at the Stranraer meeting, said
Saturday's violence had borne out his remarks to the federation's annual
meeting last month.
Mr MacLeod wants such events off the roads and held in park areas
where, he believes, security would be easier and there would be no need
for hundreds of officers to be deployed.
''Innocent bystanders are being drawn into this and the streets are
not safe,'' he said. ''Police officers are being used as pawns in the
middle of this political game.''

In 1993 almost two-thirds of the people of Harris were in favour of
plans for a superquarry. Now two-thirds are against. Highland
Correspondent David Ross looks at the reasons for this change of heart
THIS evening in Stornoway the Western Isles Council will hold a
special meeting which will almost certainly decide by a large majority
to withdraw council support from the proposed #70m superquarry at
Lingerbay in the south of Harris. This will come just two days before
the end of the public inquiry which has been examining the proposal
since last October, on the basis that the council supports the quarry,
and it follows the results of a referendum conducted by the Electoral
Reform Society which two weeks ago showed overwhelming opposition to the
development, two to one of the people of Harris. The enormity of that
vote, based on an extraordinary 82.7% turnout, has changed everything.
Two years ago it was all so different. In June, 1993, members of the
development services committee met in Tarbert and agreed they were
minded to grant planning permission to Redland Aggregates for the
superquarry. They were joined by colleagues and immediately reconvened
as the full council.
Lewis councillor Alasdair Nicholson (Coll) warned that more
information was needed on the project, that its true scale was not
appreciated. But only two others supported him, and the remaining 24
enthusiastically endorsed the earlier decision.
All three Harris councillors voted with the majority, as had been
expected because these meetings had also followed a referendum. But the
one in 1993 had found that 62.1% of the people of Harris were in favour.
Most who were then opposed were seen to be incomers, who already had the
Harris they wanted.
So what changed in two years? Perhaps not as much as might be
imagined. With literally one or two exceptions, nobody in Harris
actually wanted one of the world's largest holes to be dug on their
doorstep.
Roineabhal is not the most beautiful of mountains, but the removal of
600m tonnes of anorthosite was hardly going to improve it. Dust, noise,
vibration, quarrying is not the least intrusive of human endeavours. But
the local people were desperate for jobs.
With only half the island's people economically active and 25% over
the age of 65, there were communities that were dying. Here there was
the prospect of 80 full-time jobs at the quarry with perhaps as many as
between 200 and 300 when all indirect employment was added.
It was huge in Harris terms, anything up to 30% of the island's
population aged 16-64 could expect work on these figures. It was the
only thing to offer real hope, rather than just talk.
But since the council last voted, news of other potential developments
began to filter out. Developments which demanded a clean environment,
most notably Scotia Pharmaceuticals which was talking in terms of 40
jobs.
Questions also began to be asked on the island. What effect would a
quarry have on the 40 to 50 fishing jobs around Leverburgh in South
Harris? What of the 120 jobs in fish farming throughout the island? What
about tourism?
Such concerns were growing all the time, supported by official
objectors at the inquiry such as Scottish Natural Heritage and the Link
Quarry Group, an umbrella organisation supported by more than 20
environmental bodies. Islanders began to do their sums on jobs. What had
been clear cut was no longer.
But, in February, quarry supporters received a boost from a report
prepared by the Scottish Office Agriculture and Fisheries Department at
the request of inquiry reporter Miss Gillian Pain. This concluded there
would be little threat to marine life around Harris from unwanted
organisms being introduced if the discharge of ballast water from quarry
ships was properly controlled. Ballast water had been one of the key
environmental concerns, although significantly SNH did not lead evidence
on it.
Redland were known to believe this report was game, set, and match to
them. Certainly two years ago it would have reinforced local support for
the quarry, but it was too late. Continued uncertainty about how many
jobs and when meant more. There was no reservoir of goodwill and trust
on which the company could draw with the local people.
Redland had four years to nurture good relations, but in the end they
allowed themselves to be caricatured as the uncaring multi-national
company which saw only a #60m turnover in Harris. Significant
concessions over Sunday working and the community trust fund were made,
but were seen as crumbs carefully counted before being grudgingly thrown
from the corporate table.
Ian Wilson, the Dunblane-based mineral consultant who holds the
mineral rights to Lingerbay, is however convinced that opponents have
misrepresented issues: ''They have had two years to mobilise opinion.
They targeted the fishermen and misled them over issues like ballast
water, dust, and noise. They misled the people into believing they had
to choose between the quarry and other developments. That wasn't true.
But the final decision is with the Secretary of State.''
Council vice-convener Angus Graham, meanwhile, has also been a great
supporter of the quarry. He had to work hard to persuade Redland to make
a meaningful contribution to a local community trust fund, a
contribution which could rise #140,000 a year at full production. But he
believes it's all a question of balancing the different prospects:
''There is no moral high ground in this debate. It is a question of
judgment of what will benefit the community most. Both sides are trying
to do what they believe to be right for the community.''
The shame, however, has been that the council, with 19 of its 30
councillors changed from June 1993, has been left this last year
tortured democratically and procedurally.
The people of Harris had every right to change their minds, and most
understand why they did. But the council has spent these past eight
months and several hundred thousand pounds championing its old cause at
a public inquiry which will cost the public purse about #2m.
There has been no easy formula to follow in these circumstances. But
whatever official importance is finally attached to the recent
referendum in Miss Pain's report to Mr Lang, he cannot ignore it. The
final decision is his, and it is a difficult one.
It raises fundamental questions whose answers are more likely to lie
in Aristotle than planning law.

LOYALIST terrorists responsible for one of Northern Ireland's worst
atrocities, the Greysteel pub massacre, have been moved out of the Maze
Prison after a dispute with other loyalist prisoners.
Tensions ran high when the four-man gang, and five others, strongly
objected to doves of peace being painted over emblems of the Ulster
Freedom Fighter in the jail.
The authorities moved the men a few miles on Friday to Maghaberry
Prison, which is normally used for those who have forsworn their
paramilitary allegiances.
The four men were given 32 life sentences for the Greysteel attack in
which eight people died a week after the IRA murders of 10 Protestants
in the Shankill Road bombing.
The governor moved them and the other five out of H Block 2 while
efforts were made to resolve the dispute over the emblems. Loyalists in
the block refused to accept them back so he arranged to move them to
Maghaberry.

payment for work done, Care's director for Afghanistan Steve Masty said

MOSCOW: The Russian army said yesterday it was in full control of the
southeastern rebel base of Vedeno, the symbol of historic Chechen
resistance to Russia, but a Chechen spokesman dismissed the claim as
nonsense. The official Itar-Tass news agency quoted a Russian army
spokesman as saying that Moscow's troops seized Vedeno early yesterday
after a night of fierce fighting. A Defence Ministry spokesman said the
town had fallen but gave no details.
Interfax news agency said the Russian military commander in Chechnya
visited the village yesterday and addressed a meeting of local
residents. Colonel-General Anatoly Kulikov promised an amnesty to all
rebels who would lay down their arms, Interfax said. Kulikov said
humanitarian aid would be sent to the area as soon as mines were removed
from roads leading there from central Chechnya.

mini-polls that political leaders have elevated to a major test of
strength.  Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) won 39.13% of the ballot among
a tiny slice of the electorate -- 88,448 voters, or less than three in
1000 of Turkey's eligible voters -- in local by-elections in two
townships and 34 municipalities.

Hong Kong, Sunday
THOUSANDS of Hong Kong people of all ages gathered for a candlelit
rally today in remembrance of those who perished in China's ruthless
crushing of the Tiananmen pro-democracy movement six years earlier.
Flickering candles illuminated banners fluttering in the warm evening
breeze. They read: ''As we cross to 1997, never forget June 4th,'' and
''Release all political prisoners''.
Speakers invoked the spirits of the hundreds who died in Beijing in
June 1989 to give courage to the people of Hong Kong as the British
colony's 1997 handover to Chinese rule nears.
After two hours of singing along to pro-democracy anthems, the
ceremony climaxed when the crowd surged as one to their feet and bowed
deeply three times to an obelisk commemorating Tiananmen's ''martyrs of
democracy''.
A moment of silence fell over the park before the protesters, many
overcome by tears but still clutching their candles, turned to embrace
their friends and family.
''As we face what could become even greater pressure and trouble, we
resolve to cross over into 1997 without forgetting June 4th,'' Hong Kong
pro-democracy leader Szeto Wah told the crowd. ''I ask the spirits of
the dead of Tiananmen to give courage to the people of Hong Kong.''
China branded Szeto a traitor and counter-revolutionary for his role
in leading the protests that swept Hong Kong in the wake of the
crackdown, but the school headmaster-turned-politician remains defiant.
''We have to be prepared to resolutely go forward and fight to the
end.''
The police presence was heavy but there was no trouble. ''It's
peaceful,'' a police spokesman said.
Crowd estimates varied widely with police estimating some 15,000
people had turned up while the organisers claimed twice that figure.
''I want my children to know more about recent history in China,''
said secondary school teacher Chan Kwok-wing who brought along his
daughter, eight, and 12-year-old son.
Chan, who said he had attended every remembrance rally in Hong Kong
for the past six years, added: ''Even after 1997 I will continue to come
here.''
Scores of people mobbed labour activist Han Dongfeng, a major figure
in the Tiananmen movement who is now living in exile in Hong Kong.
''It (1997) is getting closer so people are getting more afraid,'' Han
told Reuters, as well-wishers jostled to shake his hand and thump him on
the back.
Six years ago, up to one million Hong Kong people braved typhoon-force
winds and rain and poured on to the streets to express their grief and
anger over the deaths in Beijing and killings in other big Chinese
cities.
Foreign consulates were mobbed by people wanting to obtain passports,
and emigration from Hong Kong swelled to over 1000 people a week.
The crowds attending the Tiananmen memorial rallies have gradually
diminished over the years, but the emigration rate, according to
consulates in Hong Kong, remains steady at an estimated 50,000--60,000 a
year.
Retiree Wong Cheung, 65, said that for him the bitter memories of 1989
had not faded.
* In Beijing today, leading dissident Chen Ziming staged a one-day
hunger strike at his home and unknown mourners hurled hundreds of yellow
paper slips in the air in Tiananmen Square -- a traditional Chinese
offering of ''money'' to the dead.
The paper-throwers were led away by some of the hundreds of police in
the square and their handiwork swiftly cleaned up, according to Western
diplomatic sources who witnessed the act.--Reuter.

Bujumbura, Sunday
HUTU militiamen and government troops today battled for a fifth day in
suburbs of Burundi's capital Bujumburu, witnessess said.
Sporadic but intense clashes took place in Kamenge and the
neighbouring Hutu-dominated suburb of Kinama, with the noise of
automatic weapons fire crackling out across the city.
The fighting first erupted last Tuesday, a day after an Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) peace mission arrived in Burundi to press the
majority Hutus and minority Tutsis -- who dominate the army -- to accept
peace after months of clashes.
The personal involvement of OAU secretary-general Salim Ahmed Salim
reflected the level of concern in Africa that the rumbling Burundi
crisis could explode into full-scale war similar to last year's conflict
and genocide in neighbouring Rwanda.
Tens of thousands of people have died in ethnic clashes since 1993
when President Melchior Ndadaye, a Hutu, was assassinated by Tutsi
soldiers.
A delegation of government officials tried to reach the conflict zone
today to defuse the situation but failed.
Jean Mimani, president of the Burundi Democratic Front party, told
Reuters: ''We have been unable to enter Kamenge because the shooting is
continuing.
''Residents who have been able to slip out of Kamenge say the
militiamen will not stop shooting until they have assurance of an
amnesty and an assurance that they will not be killed by the army,'' he
said.
He added that the situation was still confused. ''When we telephone
Kamenge we don't know who is a militiaman and who is not.''
United Nations special envoy Ahmedou Ould Abdullah, who returned to
Bujumbura today from Paris, was expected to join the efforts to halt the
violence.
So far 11 people, including four soldiers, have been killed, military
sources said. But a postal worker interviewed on Burundi radio said 25
bodies had already been buried.
Thousands of Hutus from Kamenge are now sheltering in nearby villages,
where the Red Cross is tending to the wounded.--Reuter.

THE whisky industry last night poured a large measure of cold water on
a call for its EU export subsidy to be scrapped.
The recommendation is contained in a new report, Counterbalancing the
Drinks Industry, prepared by the Institute of Alcohol Studies for
Eurocare, an alliance of alcohol abuse agencies in the EU.
According to the report, alcohol is the most widely used psychoactive
drug in the EU, adversely affecting tens of millions of its citizens.
Across Europe, one in 10 deaths, one in five male hospital admissions
and one in three road traffic deaths are alcohol-related. Two out of
three violent offenders were found to have been drinking at the time of
the crime.
The results of acute intoxication -- rowdiness, crimes of violence,
accidents at work and play -- hit other people as well as the
perpetrators, the report says.
It is against this background that it calls on the EU to implement a
balanced alcohol policy.
One of the recommendations says the #2000m a year the EU spends on
subsidising exports by French and Italian wine producers and the Scotch
whisky industry should be removed.
Mr Derek Rutherford, director of the IAS, said: ''Why should we export
our problems abroad, paid for by the taxpayer.
''It would not hit the Scotch whisky industry badly to lose its
subsidy. There would be less profit for the shareholders but that's all.
At the end of the day, I'm not going to bleed for the drinks industry.''
However, a spokesman for the Scotch Whisky Association said last night
that the industry did not get an export subsidy.
He said: ''What we get is an allowance because we are forced to buy EU
cereals at prices which are higher than would be available if we bought
them on the open market.''
The spokesman also took issue with the broad picture painted by the
report. He said: ''Less than 2% of people who take a drink have a
problem. We are not complacent but let's get this into perspective.
Alcohol is not a great demon being exported by the EU.
''The World Health Organisation in fact says alcohol in moderation can
be beneficial.''
Among the report's other recommendations are:
* A high-profile public education campaign on the anti-social nature
of drinking and driving; a 20mg% legal alcohol limit for driving; and
vigorous enforcement of the law by random breath testing.
* A statutory code of practice for alcohol advertising, with financial
penalties for infringement.
* All employers and employee associations should be encouraged to
develop alcohol policies.

THE Boys' Brigade could be broken up into regions under a radical
proposal put forward by two Scottish battalions.
Units in Glasgow and Edinburgh want the brigade's constitution to be
rewritten to decentralise control of the organisation.
A federal set-up is envisaged. The national headquarters in Hemel
Hempstead would have overall control but regional councils would be set
up to represent England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the
Republic of Ireland. Each council would draw up its own constitution.
The change could possibly open the way for some regions to take in
girls -- a development which has some support in England but not in
Scotland or Northern Ireland.
A copy of the constitutional motion has been printed in The BB
Gazette. The Glasgow and Edinburgh battalions want it to be put to the
vote at the annual brigade council which will meet in Inverness in
September. Two thirds have to be in favour for it to be passed.
Officials at the brigade's headquarters are believed to be taking
legal advice to see if it can be put to the vote.
Edinburgh battalion's development officer and secretary, Mr Stewart
Rose, said he believed it was the first time a move had been made to
replace the original 1883 constitution.
''I don't think there have been major changes since the Boys' Brigade
was set up. It is a long time. Society has changed and it may be an
opportune time to look at things and perhaps move forward.
''The main thing is regions having more autonomy.''
He added that the issue of girls joining the brigade could possibly be
addressed under the new set-up. The London battalion put it to the vote
at last year's council meeting but the motion was defeated.
''There is not really much support for it in Scotland or in Northern
Ireland. Maybe we are just traditional. A lot of the boys do not want
it. They have got girls in the same class at school and think it is nice
to get their own space and be with boys of their own age group.
''There is not perceived to be a need for it, not from boys
themselves.''
The Boys' Brigade, which has the Queen as its patron, has around
100,000 members in the UK ranging from the age of six to 17. Scotland
alone has more than 34,000 members and 6000 leaders and helpers.

THE leaders of the four new unitary councils in Lothian have agreed to
co-operate on a wide range of issues.
These include trying to ensure that the present region-wide
concessionary travel scheme for the elderly and disabled can continue.
A joint liaison committee -- with members from the new councils in
Edinburgh, West, Mid, and East Lothian -- will give priority
consideration also to structure planning and the administration of
council tax.
In a joint statement at the weekend, the Labour leaders of the four
councils said the committee would be examining areas where it might be
more effective and more economical to provide local-authority services
through a joint arrangement rather than individually.
They would also work together to seek European funding for the area,
building on the ''excellent'' performance of the outgoing authorities,
which will disappear next April.
Lothian Regional Council's Labour leaders have hoped ever since the
Government's reorganisation became inevitable that some region-wide
services could be maintained. The fact that all of the new councils in
the area are Labour-run has made this easier.
The region's Labour leader, Councillor Keith Geddes, who also leads
the new City of Edinburgh Council, said they faced an enormous challenge
to ensure the smooth transition to the new system of local government.
He said: ''We want to make sure that individual service users are not
disadvantaged by the many changes which will take place.''

THE dawn of the National Lottery has boosted the number of Britons who
enjoy a gamble, according to a report published today.
The report from market analysts Mintel said that nine in every 10
people (89%) now enjoy a flutter, while only 74% of the population
gambled in one form or another before 1994.
The figures imply that around 15% of the population had been drawn
into the betting market because of the Lottery, Mintel said.
However, a spokeswoman for Lottery operator Camelot said: ''This
survey was carried out very early on, when many people were taking part
for the first time because of the novelty value.
''Our research shows the current figure for people taking part is 64%
of over 16s, who are eligible to play.''
Previously, there was little change in the profile of gamblers each
year. It was very much a male, rather than a female pleasure, especially
popular with adults aged 35-44 and skilled manual workers.
However, the profile of those gambling now matches the national
population profile.
''Our research showed the National Lottery drew in more women, more
affluent consumers, and both the young and old,'' said Mintel analyst
Pat Neviani-Aston.
''Women, in particular, seem to have been attracted to gambling by the
Lottery.
''In 1992, only 70% of women gambled, compared to 78% of men. In 1994,
the picture had changed to the extent that 87% of women now gambled,
compared to 89% of men.''
As of November, 1994, 71% of the population played the Lottery, 38%
did the pools, 17% played bingo, 16% played a machine in the pub, 14%
gambled on horses, 12% played cards for money, while 35% gambled on
raffles and draws.
London had levels of participation below the national average for most
forms of gambling -- the football pools in particular.
In contrast, Scotland was above average in almost every category. The
variation between any two regions for any one activity did not exceed
12%.
The vast majority of the lottery ticket-buying public intends to stand
firm in its giving to charity, according to another study.
The nationwide poll, published by Third World charity Actionaid, and
carried out by the Harris Research Centre, showed that 88% of lottery
punters say their flutter would make no difference to their giving to
door-to-door collections such as Actionaid Week, which starts today,
while 3% were even more likely to give.
However, the charity's head of fund raising, Ms Marion Jackson, warned
that a significant minority (up to 8%) of ticket buyers indicated that
they would be likely to reduce their giving.
* Nearly #20m could be at stake in next week's National Lottery draw
as no-one held the winning six numbers this week.
The numbers drawn were: 31, 1, 29, 40, 21, and 32. The bonus number
was 27.
The estimated jackpot of #8.7m rolls over to next week, said
organisers Camelot, and the extra betting that goes with a rollover
could swell the prize to more than double that.
Eleven tickets had five numbers plus the bonus number, and win
#288,849 each. There were 517 tickets with five numbers, winning #3841
each; 40,623 with four (#107); and 931,366 with three (#10).

Moscow, Sunday
RUSSIA'S emergencies ministry said today it fears epidemics from
decaying corpses as stray dogs roam the ruins of the Neftegorsk
earthquake disaster zone.
A major health risk is posed by bodies buried a week under mounds of
rubble in the remote oil town on the Far Eastern Sakhalin island, 4500
miles east of Moscow.
The known death toll reached over 1000 at the weekend as fresh tremors
rippled through the region. But authorities say hundreds more bodies
have still to be recovered.
''There are stray dogs all around the ruins and the corpses are
decaying,'' emergencies ministry spokesman Vasily Yurchuk told Reuters
by telephone in Neftegorsk.
''The workers are spraying the rubble with disinfectants but it gets
very hot in daytime. We fear epidemics,'' Yurchuk said.
Troops patrolling the disaster area for looters have shot dead several
dogs which lie alongside the mounds of blankets and plastic bags
containing human bodies.--Reuter.

Washington, Sunday
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton's United Nations envoy today predicted a
humanitarian disaster if UN peacekeepers leave Bosnia, but said a troop
withdrawal could occur if the situation becomes ''totally untenable''.
If the existing 22,000-strong UN force were withdrawn, ''what we see
is a humanitarian disaster -- refugees flowing out of the safe areas,
hunger and all kinds of horrible things,'' the envoy, Madeleine
Albright, said on the NBC News programme Meet the Press.
Asked what could prompt the UN to throw in the towel and leave, she
replied: ''I think if the situation became totally untenable in terms of
(the peacekeepers') being able to defend themselves.''
But, she added, a decision by Nato and European Union countries to
bolster the UN force was an effective way to head off the dangers that
could lead to such a pullout, which she said all Security Council
members wanted to avoid.
The Western allies agreed over the weekend to send a multinational
rapid-reaction force of up to 10,000 troops to protect UN peacekeepers,
even as Clinton narrowed the conditions under which US ground forces
could be used to aid the peacekeepers.
The UN force is supposed to ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid
and protect Bosnian civilians in six UN-designated ''safe areas''.
The decision to strengthen it followed the seizure by Bosnian Serbs of
hundreds of UN troops in retaliation for Nato air strikes against Serb
ammunition dumps -- a thumb in the eye that highlighted the
vulnerability of the peacekeepers.
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas, who favours a UN pullout
paired with unilateral lifting of the UN arms embargo so Bosnian Muslims
can defend themselves, said on Meet the Press that there was no peace to
protect in Bosnia.
Dole, front-runner in the race for the Republican nomination to oppose
Clinton in the November 1996 presidential elections, said he supported
Clinton's offer to let US ground troops help in any future withdrawal of
UN peacekeepers, the bulk of whom are from Britain and France.
But he said the United States could discharge its responsibilities by
giving the Bosnian Muslims the arms and training with which to defend
themselves, even if they ended up losing on the battlefield.
''I think if you provide the equipment and they're poorly trained and
they lose, they've given it their best shot. It's not our problem,'' he
said. ''The problem is if we don't do anything, it's our problem.''
But Albright dismissed Dole's proposed unilateral lifting of the arms
embargo as a ''feel-good option'' that ''does not really look at the
feel-bad prospects that come with it''.
She said it would lead to an ''Americanisation of the conflict, and
that is why we are opposed to a unilateral lift''.
Kurt Schork writes: Two French soldiers, isolated for 10 days since
their comrades were taken hostage, foiled a fresh attempt by Bosnian
Serb soldiers to capture them today, the UN said.
One destroyed his radio and code book, the other hit a Serb soldier to
avoid capture at an arms dump north of Sarajevo.
The two French non-commissioned officers have been trapped by rebel
Serbs at a UN-controlled weapons depot at Bare since May 26. Another 16
French peacekeepers posted there have long since been taken hostage.
The two were in separate armoured personnel carriers at different
sections of the dump, Bare High and Bare Low.
''At about 11.30 on Sunday morning two groups of 10 Bosnian Serb
soldiers arrived at Bare and infiltrated the site and one group each
surrounded the two French armoured personnel carriers,'' said UN
spokesman Major Guy Vinet.
''The Serbs asked our peacekeepers to come with them. They refused and
were then threatened. Fearing capture, the NCO at Bare High destroyed
his radio and his code book,'' he said.
''The NCO at Bare Low tried to do the same but the Serbs intervened
and he was forced to hit one of them to escape to a guard post on the
site where he locked himself inside.''
Vinet said the French soldier at Bare High was still in his armoured
personnel carrier, but stuck without a radio.
The peacekeeper at Bare Low, where the atmosphere is described as very
tense, is in a sandbagged redoubt, communicating by field telephone.
The two French NCOs are among 257 UN personnel either blockaded or
held hostage by Bosnian Serbs as a result of Nato airstrikes against a
Serb ammunition dump on May 25 and 26.
The 10-day ordeal of the two peacekeepers illustrates one possible
role for a new 10,000-strong rapid reaction force being formed by 15
Nato and European Union countries.
Heavily armed and equipped with attack helicopters, the force
presumably would be able to protect UN personnel in exposed positions
like Bare or evacuate them if necessary.
The rapid reaction force will not be fully operational for days, if
not weeks. Meanwhile, the two French NCOs -- like scores of other
peacekeepers scattered around Sarajevo and surrounded by Serbs -- are on
their own.--Reuter.

Johannesburg, Sunday
PRESIDENT Nelson Mandela's orders for guards to kill if necessary to
defend his headquarters during a Zulu march in 1994 were within
international law, South Africa's ruling ANC said today.
''The president was not giving an order for people to go on the
offensive to murder. Under South African and international law you are
permitted to kill to defend yourself,'' African National Congress
spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa told Reuters.
''He was reiterating the right to self-defence.''
Mandela's admission last Thursday provoked a storm of protest from his
black and white partners and foes.
The president has called a snap national assembly debate on Wednesday
into the incident on March 28 last year.
Sixty people were killed in and around Johannesburg, eight outside the
ANC's Shell House headquarters, when supporters of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party marched in support of their king and
against the country's first democracy elections to be held the next
month.
Police found a weapon on only one of the eight victims, although the
ANC has maintained its headquarters was about to be stormed. Inkatha has
denied this.
Johannesburg's Sunday Times quoted Witwatersrand acting
attorney-general Clive Attwell as saying if people were attacked they
had a right to self-defence.
''If that attack is on your life and if it is a last resort, then you
are entitled to even shoot. Shooting and killing is a last resort. Our
law recognises the right to defend yourself and even to kill in
self-defence,'' Attwell told the paper.
Velaphi Ndlovu, Inkatha's spokesman on safety and security, said on
Friday that police chief George Fivaz should question Mandela and charge
him as an accomplice to murder.
Inkatha said later that Mandela, who became South Africa's first black
president on May 10 last year, would be held personally liable for civil
damages claims arising out of the shootings totalling nearly $3m.
The Sunday Times said in an editorial that Mandela's admission raised
questions about his moral culpability about what followed when ''nervy
ANC guards fired into a crowd of marchers killing eight . . . but it was
not a 'shoot to kill' order as has been comprehensively suggested''.
''At best it was a legitimate instruction to exercise the lawful right
of self-defence in life-threatening situations, at worst a seriously
misjudged statement at a time of high tension,'' the paper said.
Political sources viewed the row as a continuation of the war of words
between the ANC and Inkatha, its main black opponent, but most did not
see it as a crisis yet for the unity government in which Inkatha is a
partner.
Buthelezi, scotching rumours that he intended to resign from Mandela's
government, did not refer to the president's admission during a rally in
KwaZulu-Natal today and instead criticised white Inkatha members he said
were demonising him.Reuter.

WHEN forestry bosses have a tough job in the mountains, they don't
hire strong men or huge machines.
Instead they call in Kirsty Robb and ask her to bring thousands of
tons of trees down a treacherous hillside.
Kirsty is Britain's only woman horse logger.
She and her Welsh Cob Campbell boldly go where modern machines would
not dare to tread.
Kirsty, 24, and her horse went into business when landowners who
cashed in on Government grants 30 years ago by planting trees in
inaccessible places discovered they could not get the timber to the
sawmills.
Machinery which put traditional lumberjacks out of business could not
work on the impossible inclines.
But Kirsty can drag down five trees at a time from the steepest
slopes.
She bought the specially-made harnessing needed for three-year-old
Campbell to drag the logs with a grant from Prince Charles's special
fund for youth businesses.
Now she operates country-wide from a cottage on the Duke of Argyll's
estate at Inverary.
She got the SOS from the Forestry Commission when it wanted to clear a
mountainside at Invergarry, Inverness-shire.
Forester John Ireland said: ''We called in Kirsty and Campbell because
new technology couldn't do the job.
''It is a very sensitive situation and finding Kirsty was a Godsend.''
Kirsty, who employs woodcutters and wins prizes at horseshows with
Campbell, said: ''I know I am small, but it is Campbell who really does
the work.
''He can get up the slopes and into the tight corners where machines
would either fail or fall over.
''I suppose it's turning the clock back, but we are finding that this
is really one case where the old way is the best way.''

THOUSANDS of youngsters in Lothian are to be given special credit
cards to ''buy'' training in the search for jobs.
In a #30m initiative launched today by Lothian and Edinburgh
Enterprise Ltd (LEEL), more than 12,000 school leavers, over the next
three years, are set to benefit from the programme.
The card will entitle teenagers to seek training from employers or
organisations which claim LEEL cash.
The Skillseekers programme is expected to help train a third of all
school leavers in the region in the next three years. Half of those are
expected to be trained to apprenticeship standards, achieving craft and
technicians' skills.
The initiative is expected to replace Youth Training as the main
programme for 16 to 18-year-olds in the area.
LEEL chief executive Dr Des Bonnar said: ''A skilled Lothians
workforce is essential not just for the local economy but for the whole
of Scotland.

THE former Tory Minister accused of leaving the scene of an accident
which left a three-year-old boy trapped between two cars is under
pressure to stand down at the General Election.
Conservatives in Sir Nicholas Scott's constituency in London have
expressed shock and disappointment over reports that the MP allegedly
hurried away from the scene of the incident and was later breathalised
by police.
Mr Rupert Cecil, deputy chairman of the Chelsea constituency
Conservative association, said: ''After this incident, I would have
thought it might be likely that Sir Nicholas might announce that he
would be retiring.''
His resignation would not take effect until the next election.
The constituency, which Sir Nicholas holds by a majority of more than
12,000, will disappear under boundary changes. It will be merged with
Kensington.
With a number of Tory MPs expected to be competing for the seat, the
incident will have damaged Sir Nicholas's prospects. Last year he was
sacked as Social Security Minister following controversy over his
handling of the Disabled Bill.
Mr Cecil said: ''It wouldn't surprise me at all after this latest
incident if he decides not to stand for selection to the new merged
seat. I imagine that people in Chelsea will be very disappointed about
the whole thing. All the people I have spoken to are fairly shocked.
''It came as a big surprise to me that he would do something like
that, but his political record does seem to be tainted with a few
bloomers. He may realise now that the pendulum has swung against him. An
incident like this will hardly help. In any case, he is 61 and he has
done very well in politics.''
Sir Nicholas faces competition from Kensington MP Dudley Fishburn,
whose seat also disappears. Another mentioned as a possible candidate is
the former Chancellor Norman Lamont.
Yesterday, Mr Cecil endorsed Mr Fishburn for the post.
Meanwhile, Sir Nicholas remained unavailable, despite a demand for an
apology and a threat of legal action from the father of the boy
involved. Thibault Perriard, aged three, needed treatment for shock
after his pram was caught between two parked cars, one of which was
allegedly shunted by Sir Nicholas's Volvo on Thursday night.
However, M Yves Perriard said last night: ''As far as I'm concerned,
the case is finished. I want some peace this evening and I hope Mr Scott
gets some peace too.''
Witnesses quoted in the Sunday papers claimed Sir Nicholas left the
scene while the boy was still trapped. He was later found by police at a
nearby address, breathalised and released on police bail to appear in
court next month.

<HEADLINE>Leading companies faced with High Court challenge by GMB over political donations Union bid to check boardroom pay</HEADLINE>

ONE of Britain's biggest unions is to take on some of the country's
largest and most influential companies in court, in a bid to make them
more accountable over donations to political parties, directors' pay,
and members' pensions.
The GMB general secretary, Mr John Edmonds, confirmed that his union
would be taking High Court action aimed at stopping company donations to
political parties, where they have not been authorised by shareholder
ballots.
The move could set up a new battle front between unions and companies
as other organisations get involved on opposite sides of the court
dispute.
The move against what the GMB sees as ''widespread abuse'' by
unaccountable City investors using shareholders' block votes, was
launched yesterday by Mr Edmonds at the opening of the union's annual
conference in Brighton.
It comes as the Greenbury Committee, set up by the CBI to look at the
issue of boardroom pay, is reported to be considering giving
shareholders' more power to curb pay and perks.
The committee is said to be drawing up proposals to give shareholders
a say in the salary packages of directors. However, it is believed it
will stop short of recommending that the changes be enforced by law.
Mr Edmonds said that, on the advice of lawyers, his union had drawn up
a list of seven companies -- most of them household names -- to be
targeted, but would not be revealing the names until next month.
This was to allow time to assemble the substantial funds necessary to
take these cases ''all the way'', especially as non-targeted companies
are expected to support those that are taken before the courts, he
added.
Other trades unions might be invited to assist with financing the
legal action.
In addition, the 1500 GMB representatives on occupational pension
schemes would be pressing for clear policy decisions, on issues such as
directors' pay, at company annual meetings.
At the same time, the union would be campaigning for a change in the
law so that votes at company AGMs had to be cast by shareholders
themselves, thereby outlawing the practice of directors casting millions
of what the GMB claims are unauthorised proxy votes, as happened at last
week's British Gas meeting, when a major shareholders' revolt over
directors' pay was stifled by the marshalling of block votes.
Yesterday, Mr Edmonds said the British Gas AGM had focused attention
on the abuse of shareholder democracy and the fact that companies were
making key decisions without consulting shareholders.
The union's research has indicated that few, if any, companies have
articles of association that allow for donations to political parties,
or hold ballots of shareholders. There were strong indications that even
fewer would be likely to sanction such donations if they did.
Later this week, the union will name seven leading insurance companies
which, it claims, failed in their advice to GMB members who were
encouraged to quit the State earnings-related pensions scheme.
Details of cases to be taken against companies for mis-selling
pensions to GMB will be revealed, and several companies are understood
to appear on both GMB ''hit lists''.
Meanwhile, with the Greenbury Committee due to report on pay in public
companies next month, Labour yesterday challenged the Prime Minister to
use the report as the basis for legislation.
Shadow Chancellor Gordon Brown said: ''Greenbury must take on the
whole issue of tackling boardroom abuses effectively. That means
legislation will be needed. John Major cannot avoid his responsibility
to take action.''
Mr Major, who has publicly condemned excessive pay rises, has refused
to take action in advance of the committee's report.
The committee was reported in the Sunday Times to be poised to
recommend that shareholders be given the right to vote on directors'
share options and bonus schemes before they are awarded.
Companies would also be expected to tie pay and perks more firmly to
performance, the newspaper claimed.
Labour has sought to seize the initiative on boardroom abuses by
announcing its own plans for a clampdown on rules that allow major
institutions to steamroller small investors at company meetings.
Proposals to be put to the party's national policy forum in Reading,
Berkshire, next Saturday, would prevent large institutions effectively
handing company boards proxy votes, and would force them to take an
active part at shareholders' meetings.
Labour strategists want to attempt to end what they see as the company
equivalent of the union ''block vote'' at party conferences and to cut
secrecy in corporate affairs.

A SENIOR union leader admitted last night that there was a
''difference'' between unions and the Labour Party over the crucial
issue of a minimum wage.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union, said a
policy document to be discussed by Labour next weekend made no mention
of a formula at which a minimum rate should be set. Unions want a Labour
government to legislate for a minimum of around #4 an hour.
''No-one wants to get into a noisy and damaging row about this, but
there is no doubt there is a difference of opinion,'' Mr Edmonds said on
the opening day of the GMB's annual conference in Brighton.
GMB President Dick Pickering told delegates there appeared to be a
''watering down'' of exisiting Labour policy. He said: ''#1.50 or #2.50
an hour will do nothing to help the low paid in this country. It will be
seen both as an insult and a disaster.''

AS THE freed British hostages in Bosnia relaxed at their HQ in Split,
in Croatia last night, anxious families of the 22 Royal Welch Fusiliers
still being held were waiting for news of more releases: they heard only
of the Bosnian Serbs taking more prisoners.
Three Canadian soldiers were captured at their observation post
yesterday in the Ilijas pocket near Visoko.
Two French soldiers, meanwhile, refused to surrender to the
Bosnian-Serb Army at Bare, near Sarajevo in a stand-off confrontation.
A spokesman for the UN peacekeeping force, UNPROFOR, said: ''The
Canadians were manning observation posts when they were taken away and
disarmed. They were taken to a Bosnian Serb police station and detained.
We are not aware of any shots being fired.
''The BSA tried to take away two French soldiers at Bare, but they
refused to surrender and remained at their post.''
The 11 freed Fusiliers will return to their units if doctors rule them
fit for duty.
US military sources said they were trying to make ''third-hand''
contacts with Bosnian Serbs over the fate of a US pilot who ejected from
his F-16 jet after being hit by a missile over Bosnia on Friday. Serbs
said they had captured him, but two days later had still produced no
evidence.
Hardline Bosnian Serb military commander General Ratko Mladic said he
would speak about the US pilot only to the commander of all UN forces in
former Yugoslavia, General Bertrand Janvier.
French President Jacques Chirac contacted Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and stressed a need for co-ordinated action to help win the
release of the hostages.
He also informed him of the decision by EU and Nato Defence Ministers
in Paris on Saturday to set up a rapid reaction force to help the UN
peacekeepers.
Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, meanwhile, admitted the decision to
bolster the peacekeeping force might not work, and a Nato withdrawal
plan was ''virtually complete''.
Britain and France will spearhead the multi-national force of up to
10,000 men designed to provide the firepower to save UN peacekeeping
troops in Bosnia from further humiliation.
The force will be made up of two parts: a combat group of 3000 to 4000
British, French, and Dutch soldiers, and a British force of 4000 to 5000
men equipped with helicopters and lightly armed vehicles.
Mr Hurd conceded on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend: ''It might
not work. The circumstances might turn wrong again, so that the UN
simply could not do that job, in which case we would have to withdraw,
the arms embargo would be lifted, the present uncertain peace -- half
peace, half war -- would become a full war again. The war might
spread.''
He reiterated that Britain's priority was to get the rest of its
hostages freed.
Defence Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said forming a stronger UN force
showed the Bosnian Serbs have made a ''massive miscalculation'' when
they took hostages.
''So far as the particular position of the hostages is concerned, the
Bosnian Serbs inevitably have put themselves in the firing line,'' he
said on BB1's Breakfast with Frost.
British troops brought six 105mm guns into Bosnia yesterday to start a
buildup of heavy firepower needed by the UN to deter Serb attacks. The
artillery pieces rolled into the British UN base at Gornji Vakuf.
Several more 105mm guns are due to arrive from the British UN
logistics base on Croatia's Adriatic coast to which British troops, arms
and equipment have been ferried on dozens of flights since late May.
It was the first artillery backup for the UN peace force since it
deployed in Bosnia in 1992.
US forces in Germany began a 10-day programme of live fire exercises
for 1900 troops.
Turkey is to contribute soldiers to the force. Its involvement is a
sensitive issue given its close historical and cultural ties with the
Bosnian Muslims.
Earlier Bosnian Serb forces shelled Sarajevo, killing five people.
They blasted a western suburb, hitting a vital government supply line.
Another 10 people were wounded in the shelling and sniping of the
Sarajevo ''safe area''. The UN said there was little it could do to
protect the ''safe area'' while 257 hostages were held.
Diplomats in the Serbian capital Belgrade said Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic had put his credibility on the line over the hostage
release. Open confrontation between him and Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic on the issue was looming, they said.
Serbian authorities jailed nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj for 20
days.
Seselj and leaders of his Serbian Radical Party (SRS) were arrested in
the town of Gnjilane after a clash with police.
Seselj, sentenced for disturbing public law and order, has bitterly
criticised Mr Milosevic for accepting a peace plan for Bosnia last year
and imposing sanctions against Bosnian Serb leaders who rejected it.
An agreement, not yet reached, would effectively bury the nationalist
Serb dream of a Greater Serbia. Seselj, once Mr Milosevic's close ally,
has been touring Serbia to denounce the president as a traitor and to
whip up support for separatist Serbs in Bosnia and Croatia.

The predictions, compiled by a team of scientists at BT Laboratories'
advanced application division near Ipswich, Suffolk, make fascinating
reading.
Head of the division, Professor Peter Cochrane, said: ''We are all
going to get far more involved with computers and communications,
because we all crave more and more information, whether we are at home
or in the office.
''The way in which we receive and assimilate that information is set
to change dramatically.
''For example, in only a few years, we will be dialling telephone
numbers by voice and the machine will recognise who we are. Hugely
faster and more powerful computers will be able to interpret human body
language and gestures, there will be 3D videophones, and e-mail that
talks to you over a mobile telephone, all within the next 25 years.''
Computer power could be a million times greater than today's if the
pace of development of the last quarter century is maintained.
Profesor Cochrane added: ''There are now wrist watches that wield more
computing ability than some 1970s mainframes.''
The team predicts we will probably have discovered a new mechanism for
communication, other than radio, electronic, and optical transmission.
While English will still be the global language, there will be
real-time language translation for voice and print.
Changes in transport will include nuclear propulsion and
electromagnetic thrust, and there will be 300-seat aircraft flying at
more than four times the speed of sound.
The Moon base will be the size of a small village and work will have
started on the Mars manned laboratory.
Medicine will benefit from artificial ''smart skin'' and advanced
membranes after the development of artificial eyes, ears, livers, blood,
and nerves. Replacement limbs are in prospect.
In the fields of energy and the environment, intervention in natural
disasters will become more effective, mitigating, controlling or
preventing floods, earthquakes, and landslides -- and it will be
possible to induce rain, they say.

ON the eve of the list of Scottish sites for designation under the
European Union's Habitats Directive being submitted to the European
Union, the Scottish Landowners' Federation has warned of the alienation
that over-restrictive management regulations could cause.
Today all European states are submitting to Brussels their lists of
sites proposed for nature conservation under the directive.
A spokesman for the SLF warned that over-restrictive management might
prevent important conservation objectives from being achieved.
He said that the federation was concerned about ''continued
uncertainty'' over what designation would mean. Its members felt nature
conservation would be achieved through co-operation and incentives
rather than compulsion on owners.
''Since all the proposed sites coming under the directive are already
SSSIs (Sites of Special Scientific Interest), it is hoped that the same
management regimes and implications can in most cases continue, so
avoiding the onus of additional complexity, bureaucracy, and restriction
being placed on owners and managers.
''Where SSSIs are to be redesignated under the Habitats Directive, the
SLF is asking for existing management agreements to be allowed to run
their course, especially since current legislation allows for the
imposition of a Special Nature Conservation Order should an owner not
agree to new management procedures.
''This loophole would effectively undermine Government's confirmation
that bilateral agreement would be used to implement any changes, and
would offer a device whereby Scottish Natural Heritage and the Secretary
of State could circumvent existing contractual obligations. Use of such
measures would alienate farmers and landowners.''

Madrid, Sunday
THE Faces of Belmez are back in numbers and are set to become the
weirdest tourist attraction in Spain this summer.
Today there were 11 distinct figures on the concrete floor in the
humble home of widow Maria Gomez, 75, in Belmez, a remote village of
2000 people about 40 miles along a mostly dirt track from Jaen in
Andalucia.
The widow, whose two sons are shepherds, has lived with the Faces for
24 years since they first appeared one August morning. They stay
sometimes just for days, other times for many months.
Among the figures looking up from the floor was the face of a child
with a woman, a naked woman and an angry-looking man.
The Faces of Belmez have scientists and other experts baffled. They
have proved that the outlines are not painted or drawn but can find no
explanation for them.
One German expert stayed two months in the village but left as bemused
as when he arrived.
The mayor, Paco Donato, said: ''We have learned to live with the
Faces. At first people were sceptical. But the experts say the Faces are
not painted and people now accept there's no explanation.
''But there are some who say that when Maria dies there will be no
more faces.
''We get carloads of visitors, sometimes even a coach full. They just
go to the house, look at the Faces and often leave without even stopping
for a drink. The village does not make money out of this, nor does Maria
-- although she has charged newspapers and television to take
pictures.''
Mrs Gomez, who lives alone, said: ''It has been said that my house was
built on the site of an old cemetery and these are the faces of people
buried centuries ago. Experts have dug up the floor twice but can't
explain.
''I was terrified at first but now I've learned to live with the
Faces.''

Colombo, Sunday
A RED Cross vessel carrying 12 people hit a mine laid by Tamil Tiger
rebels off northern Sri Lanka today, killing at least one crewman in the
explosion, the military said.
One Indonesian crew member was missing, presumed dead, after the
explosion. Two crew were injured, military spokesman Sarath Munasinghe
said.
The tug, chartered by the Red Cross for the regular run from Point
Pedro 125 miles down the east coast to Trincomalee, had just undergone
security checks at the northern army-controlled port of Kankesanturai
near Jaffna.
As it pulled out of the port, it hit the mine, blowing a hole in the
hull, the military said. All the other crew members were rescued.
The tug, called the Sea Dancer, was carrying 12 people including one
official of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) which
runs regular relief missions to the rebel-held north.
The two injured were taken to the nearby Palaly air base for
treatment.
The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, fighting for a homeland in the
north and east, have raided a Red Cross ship before but never blown one
up.
Political analysts said the mine had probably not been deliberately
planted to blow up the ICRC vessel.
Tamil Tiger rebels today attacked an army camp near Sri Lanka's
largest country park, a guerrilla hideout and no-go area for the last 10
years, the military said.
One soldier was killed and six were injured in the early morning
attack in the village of Naranvila, on the outskirts of the northwestern
Wilpattuwa country park.
The injured soldiers, deployed under the brigade based at Cheddikulam,
six miles to the northeast, were evacuated for treatment to
Anuradhapura, the ancient capital to the south.
''Troops effectively repulsed the attack inflicting heavy casualties
on the terrorists,'' the Defence Ministry said in a statement.
Tamil Tigers also attacked a police post at a Muslim village in the
eastern Batticaloa area, killing a constable and two civilians, the
military said. The rebels burnt down three village houses. There were no
details of rebel casualties.--Reuter.

THEY came from far and wide to be slaughtered in the rain, and then
returned home happy after a good day's work.
The scene was Peebles, and the time was very, very early on Sunday
morning.
Hundreds of budding stars gathered at Neidpath Castle, in various
states of Highland dress, to enact battle scenes from the forthcoming
film, The Bruce, based on the life and times of the victor of the Battle
of Bannockburn.
Stars include Oliver Reed as Bishop Wishart of Glasgow, and Brian
Blessed as Edward 1.
Michale Van Wijk, better known as Wolf on the television series
Gladiators, plays Sir Humphrey De Bohun.
Many of the extra roles have been filled by members of the Wallace
Clan Trust for Scotland who are veterans of film-making, with credits on
Highlander and Mel Gibson's Braveheart.
One, Tam McDermott, 49, from Edinburgh, said: ''This is the perfect
opportunity for us to do what we love and be in a film at the same time.
''They aren't paying us anything, we all just bought shares in the
film and that means we had the option of being in it. I think it's a
great idea.''
However, he had one gripe: ''I think it's disgraceful that the reason
they don't make more films in mainland Britain is the tax levels imposed
by the Government on foreign film companies. That's why they so often go
to Ireland instead.''
Another extra, Tam Harris, 48, travelled from Wales to indulge his
love of all things Scottish.
His son bought a share in the film to allow Tam to don his kilt and
brandish his broadsword.
He said: ''When I heard about the opportunity to be in the film, I
thought: ''That's the one for me'.
''I don't know too much about the whole battle but I love Scotland and
that's why I'm here.''
The film maker, Cromwell Productions, has come under fire for choosing
to film the Battle of Bannockburn in Peebles instead of the original
site.
However, the company defended its choice by saying housing had swamped
the original battlefield, rendering it unsuitable.
Problems finding extras to play the defeated English were solved by
bussing up actors from south of the border.

A 14-year-old girl is one of four people being questioned by police
last night in connection with the death of a 35-year-old man, found
badly injured in Glasgow's Queen's Park early on Friday.
The others being held in police custody are three youths aged 16, 18,
and 20.
Mr Michael Doran, of Allison Street, Glasgow, was rushed to Southern
General hospital after being found with ''serious injuries'' in the park
but died a short time later.
A report is being sent to the procurator-fiscal and the girl and the
three males are expected to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court today.
Meanwhile, in a separate case, police have stepped up patrols in
Glasgow's red-light areas over the weekend, following the murder of a
young prostitute in the city on Friday.
The increased police presence is likely to continue until inquiries
into her death are complete, the woman detective leading the inquiry
said yesterday.
The battered body of Ms Leona McGovern, 22, was found near the city's
red-light area in Washington Street, near Argyle Street, about 8.10pm on
Friday. She was the third prostitute in less than four years to have
been murdered in Glasgow.
Police believe Ms McGovern's killer may have been heavily
bloodstained.
Detective Chief Inspector Nanette Pollock, in a warning to patrons who
may have visited the red-light area on Friday, said: ''We would like
anyone who has any information to come to us, rather than having us go
to them.''
She said there had been an increased police presence in the city's
red-light areas at the weekend, which would continue until inquiries
were complete.
Detectives are also still examining film from closed-circuit
television security cameras used by local businesses in the area where
Ms McGovern's body was found, in the hope that it may shed some light on
the attack.
Ms Pollock said she was anxious to speak to a man, aged between 20 and
30, who was seen running in Washington Street towards the Broomielaw
about the time of the attack on Friday.
The man is said to have dark hair and was wearing a denim jacket and
light-coloured trousers.
Yesterday, detectives carried out door-to-door inquiries in the
Cranstonhill area, where a murder incident room has been set up.
In October 1991,the body of city prostitute Diane McInally, 23, was
found dumped, almost naked and with head injuries, in Pollok Park,
Glasgow. Hours earlier, Ms McInally, who had a young son, was seen alive
in Glasgow's red light district, where she worked to support her drug
habit.
In February 1992, two men were charged with her murder but, on the day
they were due to appear in court, both were released from custody on the
instructions of the procurator-fiscal. Since then, the case against both
has been marked ''no proceedings''.
In April 1993, the body of another prostitute, Mrs Karen McGregor, 26,
was found hidden in a car park at Glasgow's Scottish Exhibition and
Conference Centre.
Her husband Charles McGregor, 30, stood trial for her murder but was
freed after the charge was found not proven.
The jury at the High Court in Glasgow took three hours to find the
charge that Mr McGregor battered his wife with an unknown object and
strangled her in their home, unanimously not proven.
Another charge that he hid her body in shrubbery in a car park in
Glasgow's SECC and attempted to defeat the ends of justice was also
found not proven unanimously.
During the 13-day trial, the court was told that Mr McGregor was
arrested six months after his wife's body was found. Because there had
been striking similarities to the murder of Ms McInally, her death was
being treated as a prostitute murder by a client.

Katyn, Russia, Sunday
THE presidents of Poland and Russia, marking the opening a cemetery
for thousands of Poles killed by Soviet security forces in 1940, vowed
today to seek reconciliation between their countries.
Poland's Lech Walesa condemned the murder of 15,000 Polish army
officers while laying the corner stone at the cemetery in Katyn forest
about 250 miles west of Moscow where some 4400 of the victims had been
shot dead.
But in a speech after an open air mass attended by hundreds of the
victims' relatives, he praised Russia's decision to allow the cemetery
to be built after long denying it was responsible for the massacre.
''It means pain and humiliation but at the same time hope as well,''
Walesa said after Poland's Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal Jozef Glemp,
led the mass in the pine forest nine miles from the western Russian city
of Smolensk.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin declined an invitation to take part in
the ceremony, attended by Poland's top state leaders including Prime
Minister Jozef Oleksy and the speakers of the two chambers of
parliament.
But he sent a message of reconciliation which was read out by Sergei
Filatov, head of Yeltsin's administration.
Yeltsin hailed the commemoration ceremony as an ''historic moment
which confirms a new character in the relationship between democratic
Russia and democratic Poland.''
The Katyn massacre, ordered in March 1940 by the Soviet Communist
Party's ruling Politburo, has long cast a shadow over Moscow's relations
with Poland.--Reuter.

BRITISH women are passionate about their clothes and happy to pay
extra for quality, according to a study today.
The survey, of 1000 women, showed also that the average British woman
was a size 12 or more, dressed in dark colours, and was most likely to
be seen wearing a blazer, a polo-neck top, and straight skirt, jeans or
leggings.
The Princess of Wales is seen to be a leader of fashion. She took the
highest number of votes for best-dressed woman with 36%, ahead of
fashion icons including Lauren Hutton (10%), newsreaders Sue Lawley (7%)
and Julia Somerville (4%), Princess Caroline of Monaco (1%), and Joanna
Lumley (also 1%).
Giorgio Armani was the biggest fashion influence among those surveyed,
with half admitting to longing for an Armani-style trouser suit. A total
of 29% rated the Italian as their favourite designer, beating Chanel
(18%) and Ralph Lauren (10%).
Findings from the study included:
* Most women consider themselves fashionable, with 57% describing
themselves as followers of fashion.
* Nineties' fashions were by far the most popular with those surveyed.
* The nineties were the favourite style era, for 37%, followed by
fifties' fashions. Seventies' gear received only 5% of votes.
* Women were prepared to pay for quality, with 40% ready to pay up to
#150 for a jacket and one in 10 as much as #300 -- the average price of
a designer jacket.
* British women are not petite. Sizes 12, 14 or larger were the most
common dress sizes for those in the study -- only one in every 15 women
measures up as size eight or 10.
* Navy is the favourite colour of British women.
* There are certain items of clothing which appear in most women's
wardrobes -- a straight skirt was owned by 88%, a blazer (70%), jeans
(73%), a polo-neck top (82%), and leggings (69%).
The survey, carried out for Good Housekeeping, was based on 1002
replies to a questionnaire which appeared in the March issue of the
magazine.

THE newly-elected Scottish National Party MP for Perth and Kinross, Ms
Roseanna Cunningham, has scotched a report that she is considering
contesting the party's deputy leadership.
Yesterday, Ms Cunningham described the claim made in a Sunday
newspaper as ''complete fantasy''. She added that she had no intention
of involving herself in a head-to-head contest with the party leadership
so shortly after winning the Perth and Kinross by-election.
Acknowledging that she had considered standing for the post last year,
Ms Cunningham said her sole priority now was consolidating her position
in the constituency.
''I shall be spending my time over the next few months in developing
my role as the new MP for Perth and Kinross and I shall continue to
welcome and need all the help and advice I can get from our dedicated
and talented parliamentarians and our effective leadership team.''
The deputy leadership is currently held by Euro MP Allan Macartney,
who yesterday confirmed he would be standing for re-election at the
party's annual conference in autumn.
He said he had been nominated by his branch and had every intention of
signing the application before the mid-July closing date. He said he was
not aware of any other challengers and said the suggestion that Ms
Cunningham could contest the post had only been made to him by the
Sunday newspaper.
However, he pointed out that party branches had more than a month to
nominate candidates.
Ms Cunningham said she was unaware of the closing date for nominations
and added: ''After the tremendous support from Alex Salmond (the SNP
leader) and Allan, and the whole party in the by-election, any
suggestion that I might even be considering a challenge is ludicrous and
insulting.''

LABOUR today rejected the idea of banding by ability as a means of
avoiding ''ghetto'' comprehensive schools.
It was suggested by the Fabian Society, the left-wing think-tank, as a
solution to the party's deep dilemma on school admissions.
It would mean each school containing fixed proportions of children of
varying abilities, selected at random from those who applied.
But it was ruled out by shadow education spokesman David Blunkett, who
said that it smacked of re-introducing the 11-plus.
One of Labour's biggest problems in education -- having embraced
parental choice but set itself firmly against selection -- is what to do
when too many parents choose one school.
The principle of ''fair'' admissions will be re-iterated later this
month in a document on a new ''local democratic framework'' which Labour
hopes will settle its policy on grant-maintained schools.
But the party is still searching for an alternative to simple
admission by catchment areas, which leaves schools prone to ''selection
by mortgage''.
Particularly in big cities, well-off parents can simply move to get
their children into popular schools, leaving others to decline.
Banding by ability was proposed by Fiona MacTaggart, of London
University's Institute of Education.
The existing system of open enrolment, she wrote in the Fabian Society
paper, helps create ''ghetto schools'' because it ''benefits the best
choosers, who tend to be children of relatively prosperous parents''.
But a system of selection by catchment area could produce the same
effect.
Banding by ability and random choice from applications would give all
parents a fair chance, while stopping the most popular schools picking
the brightest children.
Mr Blunkett said that he opposed the idea because ''it inevitably
means some form of 11-plus exam''.
''The real answer has to be to concentrate on raising standards in all
schools. That's the only way to avoid over-concentrating admissions in
existing successful schools,'' he said.
''The argument in these schools is how to get a quart into a pint pot.
It ought to be about how to make the other pint pots better.''
Mr Blunkett would give nothing away about Labour's proposals for a new
relationship between local authorities and all schools -- including
those which have opted out of local authority control.
Labour is pledged to abolish grant-maintained status, but the issue
became more difficult for the party when leader Tony Blair decided to
send his son to an opt-out school.
The Fabian Society paper proposed a range of ideas, including regional
education authorities and American-style school boards.
Mr Blunkett described them as ''intellectually stimulating ideas, but
politically inappropriate for the real world''.

A POST-MORTEM examination will be held today on the body of a Russian
seaman who fell overboard from a tanker off the Western Isles on
Saturday.
His body was later found in the Minch off Barra.
The captain of the 15,000-tonne Lady Sovereign, a chemicals and oils
tanker, raised the alarm before 2pm.
''The tanker had been steaming north through the Minch but the captain
told us the crewman had not been seen since 4am, when the man had
finished his watch,'' a coastguard spokesman said.
Several warships and military helicopters, already on exercise off the
Hebrides, joined the search. They helped four lifeboats, from Stornoway,
Portree, Lochinver, and Barra, the coastguard helicopter, and other
shipping.
The Liberian-registered and Norwegian-owned tanker, which normally
carries chemicals, oil, or molasses, was on its way from Belfast to
Norway.
The coastguard spokesman said: ''The missing man's body was finally
spotted in the sea, not far from the north of Barra, by the crew of a
Latvian merchant ship which had also joined the search.''
Barra lifeboat took the body to Lochboisdale on South Uist and a
post-mortem examination will take place at Stornoway later today.
The coastguard spokesman said: ''We have no reason to believe the man
committed suicide.''
Meanwhile, the Lady Sovereign has been allowed to continue her voyage
to Norway.

SOME schools will be urged to take a tougher line on homework after
Government inspectors found wide variations in the amount expected from
pupils.
However, some children will be pleased at the prospect of doing more,
according to the Office for Standards in Education. A report by school
inspectors found some children more keen on homework than their teachers
thought and already working longer hours at home.
When parents complained about homework, it was also more often to say
their children were being asked to do too little rather than too much.
The report, dealing with England and Wales, said schools should set
clear policies on the amount expected, pointing out that some already
operate ''homework charters'' with parents and pupils.
Many primary schools do not specify amounts of homework, the report
added, and in pupils' early years at secondary school, it varies from
half-an-hour per week to an hour or more for the core subjects of maths,
English, and science.
The report said that when homework was taken seriously, it could raise
standards, increase coverage of the curriculum through more effective
use of lesson time, and improve pupils' attitudes to learning.
Its findings show children actually spend more time doing homework
than their teachers think because they enjoy it, need extra time for it,
or want to do better.

SUZANNE Shepherd was given only weeks to live when she was born with a
complicated kidney disease -- one of only three children in Scotland
with the condition.
However, despite having both her kidneys removed and undergoing one
failed transplant operation, Suzanne, of Beith in Ayrshire, will be four
in August.
She suffers from congenital nephrotic syndrome, and is wired to a
dialysis machine for 16 hours a day.
''Sometimes she lies awake crying because the tubes hurt as they pump
life-saving proteins into her bloodstream,'' said her mother, Verna, at
the family home in Lomond Crescent.
Mrs Shepherd, and her husband, Malcolm, a taxi driver, pray each day
for doctors to tell them Suzanne can have a another transplant.
At first glance, Suzanne is like every other little girl her age but
she cannot go to the local swing park, she has never met the children
next door, and chocolates and fizzy drinks are a rare special treat.
Alarmed doctors noticed when Suzanne was born four weeks prematurely
that her feet were swollen and her eyes puffy.
After tests at Glasgow's Yorkhill Hospital, surgeons warned her
parents that she would die within a month.
However, a new drug began to show results and she was given plasma
transfusions six hours a day for four months.
At nine months, her first kidney had to be removed. Last September,
she began intensive dialysis but complications set in and high blood
pressure caused her to slip into a coma. In February, doctors removed
her second kidney.
It was only a few weeks ago that the Shepherd family found new hope
when Suzanne was given a transplant, but the operation failed.
Her parents have offered their own kidneys but doctors say they are
unsuitable.
''I'd rather it was our kidneys than another child's,'' said Mrs
Shepherd. ''That's the really sad part -- that some other child will
have suffered before Suzanne can have a transplant.''
Suzanne will go back on the transplant list next month. She needs
injections three times a week and antibiotics along with her dialysis.
''She never grumbles,'' said Mrs Shepherd. ''She's as bright as a wee
button. She's happy sitting watching videos with her brothers and
sisters.
''They spoil her rotten and call her their special wee sister. She's a
battler and I wouldn't change her for the world.
''Suzanne is looking forward to her fourth birthday party in August
and hopes to start nursery later this year.''
Local children raised #50 last week to provide Suzanne with books and
videos.
Her mother said: ''The thing I'm grateful for is that she isn't old
enough to understand what is happening to her.
''Suzanne believes her life is normal. She's no idea just how good
life could be but, if she gets her transplant, then she will find out.''

<HEADLINE>Clegg case comes up for review at Stormont</HEADLINE>

<RECORDNO>978043152</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
JAILED paratrooper Lee Clegg will make a further bid for freedom
tomorrow when his case goes before the Life Sentence Review Board in
Belfast.
Members will decide whether they should refer it to the Northern
Ireland Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, who has the power to make
recommendations for an early release.
Clegg, 27, was sentenced to life for the murder of Karen Reilly, a
17-year-old joyrider who was shot in the back when soldiers opened fire
on her car in west Belfast in September 1990. The driver, 18-year-old
Martin Peake, also died.
Miss Reilly's family said they believed Clegg could be free as early
as tomorrow evening.
Her father, Sean Reilly, 38, said: ''I have this awful feeling he
could be out then. I am finding it hard to focus at the moment. It is a
very trying time for us all.''
Last January, the Law Lords refused Clegg's appeal to reduce the
murder charge to manslaughter. Since then, there has been a sustained
nationwide campaign by supporters of the soldier, including former Army
officers and MPs on all sides, to have him released because of the
controversial circumstances surrounding the shooting.
Normally his case would not come before the Review Board until he had
served at least 10 years but the Northern Ireland Prison Service has
already stated that there are ''mitigating factors'' in the case and
that an earlier review is appropriate.
It is a private meeting and will be chaired at an office at Stormont
by the Permanent Under Secretary, Sir John Chilcot. He is the senior
civil servant involved in exploratory talks with Sinn Fein.
A probation officer, a consultant psychiatrist, and other senior NIO
officials will take part in the review. They are expected to study
written submissions by Clegg, who is being held in Wakefield Prison.
Sir Patrick has the power, after consultation with the Lord Chief
Justice Sir Brian Hutton and the trial judge, to order Clegg's release
from prison on licence.
However, it could be some time before any announcement is made,
according to NIO sources.
At his home on the Twinbrook estate on the outskirts of west Belfast,
Mr Reilly said: ''People seem to be forgetting all the time about Karen
and what happened to her. It seems to be 'Poor Lee Clegg this, poor Lee
Clegg that'. Some people seem to want to make a hero of him.
''Next thing, he will be Lord Mayor of Bolton. We are sitting here
wondering what the hell is happening. We never thought he would do 10
years. Five, maybe, but he has hardly been in jail for more than three
years. The campaign which has been mounted to get him out has really
hurt this family.
''It is unbelievable what is happening. I stand at Karen's grave and
say to myself, 'What is happening here?'.''

<HEADLINE>Protesters claim #4m access road will leave council's environmental policy in tatters. Commuter rail link under threat</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>

<RECORDNO>978043153</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
PLANS to establish a commuter rail link between Glasgow and Fife are
under threat this week.
On Wednesday councillors in Central region will be asked to give the
go-ahead to a #4m new road into the centre of Stirling while at the same
time scrapping proposals to reopen a crucial section of railway to
passenger traffic at a cost of #3.4m.
Railtrack and anti-road protesters yesterday said the
Labour-controlled council would be guilty of an environmental
double-whammy if its technical services committee approved the
recommendations.
Less than three years ago, the council trumpeted the launch of a
radical policy intended to switch the emphasis from the private car to
public transport in Central region.
Both Railtrack and protesters opposed to the road say Wednesday's
decision could leave the policy, known as All Change, in tatters.
In a further twist, Railtrack is threatening to block the road scheme
by refusing to release a parcel of land it owns on the proposed route.
Plans for the controversial Stirling Eastern Access Road were sent
back to officials last month after a storm of protest.
A new package being put forward for approval on Wednesday includes
fine tuning to the road's town centre junction, but still involves
carving a swathe through the semi-derelict Forthside area of Stirling
which local residents want turned into a park.
At the same meeting, officials are recommending no further action on
plans to reopen an eight-mile stretch of railway track between Stirling
and Alloa.
Railtrack had hoped the scheme could have led to the re-opening of
further track between Alloa and Dunfermline and the re-establishment of
a Forth circular line and commuter links from Glasgow into Fife.
Councillor Tom Sinclair, chairman of Central region's technical
services committee, said the recommendation not to release a further
#70,000 for a phase two feasibility study had effectively killed off
plans to reopen the line.
He said the plan was not viable due to rail privatisation and the
scrapping of the regions.
An initial study had shown the line would require an annual subsidy of
between #284,000 and #576,000.
Mr Sinclair suggested now might be the time to consider ripping up the
track and using the route for a cycleway.
''It does look like the final nail in the coffin for the Stirling to
Alloa line,'' he said.
His remarks brought a furious reaction from Railtrack.
Spokesman Mr John Yellowlees said the company had no intention of
releasing land it held in the way of the planned road, at the rear of
Stirling station, until the Alloa line scheme was unblocked.
Accusing Central region of hypocrisy, he said the council's All Change
policy had resulted in the reopening of just one railway station -- at
Camelon, Falkirk, -- while at the same time the council was prepared to
spend millions on the Stirling access road and a new bypass for the
village of Tullibody, Clackmannanshire.
''All the studies show that if you build new roads you just get new
traffic jams,'' he said.
''We are a transport company, so why should we sell land for another
mode of transport?
''We have no intention of ripping up the track, and I can only presume
that downhearted and defeatist attitude from Central region is because
as an authority they are not long for this world.

A BIRD protection official yesterday described the killing of a golden
eagle in a Highland glen as ''appalling''.
An X-ray has revealed that the protected bird was struck by between 30
and 40 shotgun pellets. It was found dead last Tuesday in the Glen Clova
area, next to the privately-run Airlie estate, north of Kirriemuir. The
results of a post-mortem examination are expected later this week.
Tayside police and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds have
launched a joint investigation to trace the killer of the rare bird,
which is afforded the highest level of protection under both British and
European law.
There are only about 400 known pairs of golden eagles in Scotland and
just a few south of the Border.
Scottish Natural Heritage, whose North-east Scotland board chairman,
Mr David Laird, is factor of the Airlie estate, has expressed concern
and willingness to co-operate with the investigations.
A police investigation was also held last month into the poisoning of
a buzzard on the nearby Glen Ogle estate, of which Mr Laird is also the
factor.
However, there is no suggestion that Mr Laird, who chairs the
newly-formed Cairngorms Partnership, had any involvement.
Police and RSPB officials have spoken to various people on the Airlie
estate, including the head keeper, but have yet to determine where the
bird came from or who killed it. Other known pairs of eagles in the area
have apparently not been disturbed.
Mr Laird said yesterday: ''It is very bizarre. The opportunity to get
close enough to an eagle to put 30 pellets in it must be very rare.
''They normally give humans a wide berth and this makes one wonder if
it might have been a tame bird.
''There is no proof the eagle was shot in the Glen Clova area and
there must be a suspicion that it wasn't.''
A Scottish Natural Heritage spokeswoman said: ''If an offence under
the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1991) has been committed then we would
take that extremely seriously and would co-operate fully with any police
inquiries.''
A police spokesman at Forfar said the force's wildlife liaison officer
was acting with RSPB officials to try to trace the bird's killer.
Mr David Minns, the RSPB's head of public affairs, described the
shooting as appalling. ''There is absolutely no excuse for this kind of
criminal activity in this supposedly enlightened day and age,'' he said.
''People who carry out acts like this are living in the past. They
have archaic attitudes towards predators and are wholly out of touch
with British public opinion.''
Four shootings of golden eagles were recorded by the RSPB last year.
Mr Minns said the birds were surviving relatively unscathed in much of
the Highlands, although some continued to disappear in game-rearing
areas of the country.

SIXTEENTH century Arnage Castle in Aberdeenshire is for sale --
complete with dungeon.
With its thick walls, vaulted ceiling, and tiny window slits, the
castle is set in 35 acres of grounds. It lies 20 miles north of Aberdeen
and is on the market for offers over #420,000.
Mr Ruaraidh Ogilvie, of selling agents Savills, said: ''The story of
Arnage goes back to the Comyns, Norman Earls of Buchan, who were
dispossessed by Robert the Bruce.
''In a charter of 1310, King Robert bestowed the lands of ''Meikle
Arenische'' on Malcolm Maerschal. It later passed to the Cheyne
family.''
Arnage Castle was eventually bought by Baillie John Ross, of Aberdeen,
and marked the beginning of the Leith-Ross dynasty who lived at the
castle until 1937.
The property has seven bedrooms, a swimming pool, and a wine cellar.

A GLASGOW University professor has praised housing policies in
Scotland and the good sense of consumers for helping to avert the ''boom
and bust'' in house prices, and the serious effects of negative equity
and home repossessions.
Professor Duncan Maclennan, Director of the university's Centre for
Housing Research and Scottish Homes board member, said Scotland had an
enviable position in enjoying a stable and gradually improving housing
market -- in contrast to England.
Welcoming National Housing Week, he called for a greater understanding
of the contribution that housing made to Scotland's economic well-being.
He said it was vital it was not treated in isolation from economic
development, and that the effect it had on job and wealth creation in
Scotland must not be ignored.
''The reality is that housing in Scotland is big business and matters
very much to the economy. Equally, healthy local economic activity is
facilitated by good housing and vibrant communities.''
Claiming that the contribution housing made to employment, wealth, and
incentives was too often passed over, the professor said that, on many
occasions, economic development and housing professionals failed to
''make the connections''.
Professor Maclennan said housing planning in Scotland had evolved
steadily since 1989, and had made a contribution to a more stable
market.
''Scottish housing policies and the good sense of consumers has meant
we have not suffered the boom and bust in house prices or serious
effects of negative equity or home repossessions, despite our steady
growth in home ownership to 57%,'' he added.

AN 11-month-old boy died and his father was seriously injured in a
road accident on the outskirts of Edinburgh yesterday morning.
Ryan Edwardson, of Moffat Road, Ormiston, East Lothian, was sitting in
a child seat in the back of a car before the tragedy in Sir Harry Lauder
Road, Portobello, just before 10am.
His father Simon, 20, -- who was driving -- was last night in hospital
in Edinburgh where he was being treated for serious head injuries.
A police spokesman said: ''The driver of a red-coloured westbound
Vauxhall Astra appeared to have lost control of the vehicle which
crossed on to the other carriageway and collided with a Freight Rover
Sherpa van which was carrying a small boat on its roof.''
The driver of the van, who has not been named by police, was not
injured.
The road, which links Portobello to the busy A1 south, was closed for
an hour as the wreckage was cleared away in drizzling rain.
Police have appealed for witnesses to the crash, about 200 yards east
of the junction with Baileyfield Road, to come forward.
Officers are particularly anxious to trace the driver of a westbound
dark-coloured car which stopped at the scene but left before emergency
services arrived and also a red-coloured Astra or Belmont, which
followed.

THE first executive elections of Britain's largest trade union, the
new combined Unison, saw both joint presidents as well as the leading
woman lay official unseated.
However, this first stage in the boiling down of the executives of the
unions which combined to form Unison -- Nalgo, Nupe, and Coshe --
appears to have retained the previous ratio of a mainly
Labour-supporting executive with a few Tories at one end and Militants
at the other.
As previously agreed, women have a built in majority of 35-21 on the
executive, which has been reduced from 120, to reflect the predominance
of women who make up almost one million of the 1.3 million members.
There are at least five Scots on the executive representing Scottish
members and at least two sector-based representatives including
Kent-based Ms Anne Picking, from Dunfermline, who is chair of Unison's
health executive and therefore prominent in the ongoing health dispute.
Casualties of these first Unison executive elections include joint
presidents Ms Brenda Hudson (formerly of Nalgo, Yorkshire) and Mr
Michael Bryant (NUPE, London) as well as Ms Jean Geldhart, chair of
local government services, who is one of Unison's TUC general council
representatives.

A CLAN chieftain and the deputy lord lieutenant for the Highlands have
launched a unique marine venture on Scotland's west coast.
Mr Robin Maclean, of Ardgour, 18th clan chieftain, and Mr Iain
Thornber, who deputises as the Queen's representative in the Highlands,
began their luxury sea ''taxi'' service from the remote landing at
Kingairloch on Loch a'Choire at the weekend.
The Cathula, launched by Mr Maclean's seven-year-old daughter, Helen,
is a small, luxury cruiser capable of taking parties of up to six to
some of the most remote and beautiful areas of the west coast.
It can be hired for all kinds of trips, from exclusive champagne
picnics on the Lismore islands and wildlife expeditions on the
spectacular Morvern peninsula to tours of castles on Mull.
Unashamedly aimed at the top end of the tourist market, Mr Maclean,
43, admitted he would have few excuses for failure -- he is a descendant
of Lord Inverclyde, the chairman and founder of Cunard.
Mr Thornber said: ''We believe this service will be a welcome
attraction for people wanting to visit places they could never get to by
road. There is nothing else like it operating in the area and we felt it
was a luxury niche that had to be filled.''
Both men have a vast knowledge of the region. Mr Maclean runs the
32,000-acre family estate at Ardgour which has been in his family since
1432, and Mr Thornber is widely recognised as a leading Scottish
historian.
The operation has been called Somerled Voyages after the
twelfth-century half-Norse, half-Celtic King Somerled, who ruled the
Hebrides.

A LANARKSHIRE couple are living in fear after a shot was fired at
their house.
Deborah Murphy, 29, and Gary Ralton, 30, of Ness Gardens, Larkhall,
were in their home in the early hours of Saturday when the shot was
fired through an upstairs bedroom window into a room littered with their
children's toys.
The children were not in the house.
Only a month ago, the couple fled the house after a firebomb was
thrown through a window and destroyed their living room.
Ms Murphy blamed the first attack on gang warfare. She said: ''There's
a war going on between two rival gangs in this town. My man is nothing
to do with either side but he is caught in the middle. We were warned
that this attack would happen.
''It's just lucky my kids were staying with their gran. That's where
they'll be staying from now on because we no longer feel safe in our
home.''
In a separate incident, a shot was fired at another house in Larkhall
just an hour later.
Despite the house being only a few streets from Ness Gardens, police
do not believe the two incidents are linked.
Denise Bisset, 23, was asleep in her home at Primrose Avenue when the
shot was fired through her living room window.
Detective Sergeant Tommy Tighe, of Hamilton CID, said: ''Our inquiries
are ongoing, and you can never rule out that the attacks could be
linked, but we don't think that is the case.
''We would ask anyone with information to come forward.''

AN advertisement publicising grants from an educational trust open
only to Protestant applicants under 25 years of age resident in Argyll
should not have been placed in the staff magazine for Strathclyde
Police, Strathclyde Regional Council admitted yesterday.
Mr John Brown, the council's head of public relations, said it was
''inappropriate'' for the advertisement to have appeared in Newsbeat, a
staff newspaper.
''It gives the impression that the regional council is supporting the
terms of the trust, whereas it is only administering the trust,'' he
said.
Mr Brown explained that Strathclyde region inherited the
administration of the 80-year-old Charles and Barbara Tyre education
trust scheme from the former Argyll County Council in the last
reorganisation of local government 20 years ago. It administers about
500 trusts in this way.
The council's public relations department normally places
advertisements for applicants to such trusts in the appropriate local
newspaper, treating them in the same way as statutory public notices,
said Mr Brown.
However, an advertisement for the trust was placed in the June issue
of Newsbeat by an official of the council in Argyll, said Mr Brown. In
fact, the closing date for applicants for a grant this year was May 31.
The trust was also advertised in March in a local newspaper in the
Argyll area.
The trust, which is worth about #250,000, makes annual awards of
between #4000 and #5000 to male or female applicants from the Argyll
area for further education or training purposes.
One spokesman for the Scottish Police Federation, who asked to remain
anonymous, said: ''It is a scandal that the force agreed to take an
advert like this in this day and age. This kind of discrimination
belongs to the Dark Ages. It's not just politically incorrect -- it's
well out of order.''
Labour's Scottish home affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, said: ''I
can well understand the concern being expressed by federation members.
Its appearance in the magazine would give many people the impression
that the publishers -- Strathclyde Police -- were in agreement with the
contents of the advertisement.''
Mr Brown said: ''We actually tried to get the conditions of the trust
changed but the legal advice was quite unequivocal that we could not. We
could not use the trust's funds to finance that change, because it would
involve significant legal action and we had no powers to use regional
council tax-payers' funds to do it.''
He added that Newsbeat, a staff journal for Strathclyde Police, was
published under contract by an independent publishing company, Southgem
Ltd.

THE Ministry of Defence has started an investigation into drug abuse
at a Royal Engineers' depot which deals with bomb disposal.
Four men at the depot in Wimbish, near Saffron Walden, Essex, face
Army discipline after a raid.
The Ministry of Defence confirmed an investigation was under way, but
refused to give further details.
It is understood the men were caught smoking cannabis. They face
dismissal from the service.
The Army ordered a crackdown on drug use earlier this year, with
Military Police conducting random raids at camps. Soldiers are
encouraged to inform on colleagues using drugs.

SAILORS and car drivers could face a tougher time if they drink before
taking to the water or road.
It emerged yesterday the Government is considering a plan to set blood
alcohol levels for inland and coastal sailors, making it a criminal
offence to drink-drive on marine vessels as well as yachts, barges and
powerboats sailing on inland stretches of water.
The Department of Transport said the move had been prompted by
recommendations following the inquest into the Marchioness riverboat
disaster in the Thames in which 51 people died.
The Department also revealed it may toughen-up road drink-drive
limits, possibly dropping the legal limit from 80mg to 50mg, the
equivalent of a pint of beer.
The proposal to breathalyse weekend sailors who zig-zag across lochs
and waterways after a few or more drinks has been welcomed by those
using Scotland's busiest loch, Loch Lomond.
It was seen as a sensible measure aimed at improving safety. If given
the go-ahead, the job of enforcing the law would fall jointly on Central
and Strathclyde police.
There have been a series of accidents on the loch.
However, views varied as to the scale of the problem.
Mr David Henderson, president of the Loch Lomond Water Ski Club, said
drinking was a problem on board all types of vessels. The Loch Lomond
Park Authority's park officer, Mr Nick Pennington, said there were only
isolated incidents of excessive drinking on the loch. He added: ''In
principle it's something we would welcome because everyone wants to see
people behaving responsibly on the loch.''
Mr Jim Kinvig, secretary of the Loch Lomond Association, said that
while there were a number of pubs fringing the loch-side, this was not a
particular problem.
The proposal was wholeheartedly endorsed by Labour's Scottish home
affairs spokesman, Mr John McFall, who said drunken sailors must be
banned from all of Scotland's waterways.
The Dumbarton MP urged Scottish Secretary Ian Lang to take immediate
action to ensure the proposal was implemented in Scotland.
''Juiced up jet skiers, well-oiled water skiers, pink gin sailors and
pie-eyed powerboat drivers have been getting away with it for years,''
he said. ''It's pure madness that you have people devouring the
strongest of strong drink who would be banned if they got into a car
taking boats out in places like Loch Lomond and the Firth of Clyde.
''We all know about these Sunday sailors who have been seen for years
thundering up and down the loch in the gin palaces at 50mph and about
whom nothing could be done.''
New by-laws, aimed at curbing excessive speed and noise on the loch
have been introduced this month with ranger patrols stepped up to deter
speeding power boats and jet skiers.
Meanwhile back on the roads, a move to introduce tougher breath tests
was criticised yesterday by motoring organisations.
The Government is said to want to cut the legal limit for alcohol in
the blood from 80mg to 50mg.
For most drivers it would mean no more than one pint of beer or two
glasses of wine.
The AA and RAC said the majority of drink-drivers were hard core
offenders driving at twice the legal limit or more.
The plan has reportedly been devised to convince people no-one should
drive even after drinking small quantities.
A spokesman for the Department of Transport said that no conclusion
had yet been reached.
The Institute of Alcohol Studies has urged the European Union to lower
the limit for drinking and driving to 20mg. It also wants the EU to
adopt a balanced policy on alcohol, including taxes linked to the
alcoholic contents of drinks. This follows an institute report which
shows that alcohol is linked to one in 10 deaths, one in five hospital
admissions and one in five road traffic deaths.

A MOTOR-CYCLIST died and his teammate is fighting for his life in

Tragedy struck on the opening lap of an event when the bike ridden by
Aberdonian Bob Munro crashed at high speed.
Side-car passenger Paul Fargher, 31, of Port Erin, Isle of Man, was
killed when both men were thrown from the machine.
Mr Munro is being treated at Nobles Hospital in Douglas, where his
condition was last night given as ''seriously ill but stable''.
The accident happened on Saturday as the pair approached Sulby village
along a section of the 37-mile course known as the Sulby Straight.
A police spokesman said the racing machines would have been at their
top speeds of between 140mph and 150mph when the accident happened.

AN ARMY recruit from the Arbroath area has died after a shooting
accident at a training camp.
Private Scott McGregor was killed by a single bullet from a standard
British Army issue SA80 rifle.
The 18-year-old was shot soon after leaving a target range following
marksmanship practice at Otterburn Training Camp, Northumberland.
Private McGregor had been due to pass out as a member of the Black
Watch regiment in a few days.
An officer in civilian clothes travelled to his family home near St
Vigeans, by Arbroath, to break the news. The family refused to comment
last night.
Ministry of Defence chiefs ordered a team of Army investigators to
launch an inquiry into Friday's shooting.
An Army spokeswoman refused to confirm if Private McGregor had been
shot with his own rifle.
However, she added: ''He died from a single shot after leaving the
rifle range. Exactly how his death happened is still unclear and is
obviously the centre of the inquiry.''
A Northumbria Police spokesman said: ''This would appear to be a
tragic accident.
''The death is not being treated as suspicious -- an investigation
into what happened is continuing.''

SCOTT Hastings, one of the Scotland rugby World Cup team members,
yesterday admitted making a racist remark about the English player
Jeremy Guscott in an international match between the two sides.
In his autobiography At the Centre, due to be published soon, Guscott
claims Hastings called him a ''black bastard'' during the Scotland v
England Grand Slam decider at Murrayfield five years ago.
As the Scottish side were yesterday trying to come to terms with their
World Cup defeat by France on Saturday, Hastings admitted the
allegations were true.
''Yes, I said it and I regret it. It was said in the heat of the
moment during the Grand Slam game at Murrayfield in 1990.
''Jerry was down injured at a ruck and I said 'Get off the field you
black bastard'. As soon as I had said it, I regretted it. There was no
racial slur intended -- it was just something that came out in the
middle of an incredibly tense game.
''I apologised to Jerry afterwards. We were at the dinner and Will
Carling said to Jerry, 'Do you know Scott called you a black bastard?' I
said then that I was sorry and I've said sorry since.''
A year previously, on the triumphant British Lions tour to Australia,
Hastings and Guscott had formed the Lions centre partnership and during
the trip they had struck up a good relationship on and off the field.
''We were pals in Australia and we were pals afterwards as well. We
sit beside each other at post-match dinners and we get on fine.
''Frankly, I'm surprised that he's raised it in his book but good luck
to him. It's a good selling line.''
In his book, Guscott says: ''I remember Scott Hastings being in a
trance, with a film over his eyes. He was sweating and looking straight
through us. He's not here, I thought. When I was injured during the
match, Scott was apparently heard by some players to shout: 'Get up, you
black bastard'.''
Scotland won the match in question 13-7 and Guscott adds that Hastings
-- who is the brother of the Scotland captain Gavin Hastings -- was a
changed man at the dinner after the match.
''Scott had returned to the planet and was normal again,'' he writes.
Guscott, who is a part-time model, also says he dreads playing at
Murrayfield because of the attitude of Scottish rugby fans.

A MAN out celebrating the imminent birth of his child was found dead
in a pool of blood at the weekend. Hours later, his girlfriend had a
baby boy.
Mr Philip Kirk, 23, from Twyford, Berkshire, was found in an alley. He
died from head injuries.
Murder squad detectives were called in and the area sealed off.
Inspector David Purnell of Thames Valley police said: ''His girlfriend
has just given birth to their son yesterday afternoon. Philip was out in
Twyford just prior to her going into hospital when labour started.
''We are not treating the investigation as murder at the moment. It is
a suspicious death but we are keeping an open mind.''
He said he had not ruled out the possibility that Mr Kirk's death had
been a accident.
Mr Kirk's girlfriend, who has not been named, had been told of his
death and was under sedation in Reading's Royal Berkshire hospital.

THERE were renewed calls yesterday for the Scottish Secretary to
consider his position after the receivers looking into the Health Care
International debacle made it clear that the hospital project had been
flawed from the word go.
A spokesman for receivers Arthur Andersen confirmed last night that
their report claimed it became clear shortly after the facility opened
that patient numbers were lower than forecast and not enough contracts
had been put in place to ensure success.
''From the receivers' statement it is dazzlingly clear that this
project was in deep financial trouble right from the start,'' said
Shadow Scottish Secretary George Robertson yesterday. ''It is
inexplicable and unforgivable that public money continued to be poured
into this private medical black hole.''
Last night SNP leader Mr Alex Salmond said: ''Ian Lang's claim that
HCI's losses would be 'only' #15m has been shown not to be true. Either
that or his comment was the understatement of the year.''
The report was outlined at a creditors' meeting in Glasgow on Friday.
Losses for the banks, shareholders, creditors, and the Government have
apparently been put at #120m. It is said HCI lost #18.8m in the six
months before the receivers were appointed, in November of 1994, and
#21.6m in the previous period to March, 1994.
Mr Salmond added: ''Ian Lang must accept his share of the
responsibility. It is incredible that any politician can pour so much
public money into a black hole in this way and yet remain in office.''
The facility, since bought by the Abu Dhabi Investment Agency, is said
to be attracting more private patients from overseas. It has also
carried out surgery on NHS patients.

Taormina, Sicily
BRITAIN and Europe are on a collision course over the right to say
''no'' in EU policy-making.
European Commission President Jacques Santer directly challenged John
Major yesterday by demanding an end to Britain's right to a veto. His
comments came as Mr David Davis, Minister for Europe, was fighting a
rearguard action in EU talks in Sicily over majority voting.
Despite the Government insisting it would not surrender more power to
Brussels, Mr Santer called for an end to the national veto in key areas
such as foreign and security policy.
Britain would not be losing sovereignty but ''sharing sovereignty'' in
the interests of greater European efficiency, he declared.
Mr Major's stand on the issue has led to speculation that the
Government must either climb down as gracefully as possible or leave Mr
Major to put the debate to a General Election.
Mr Santer's comments infuriated the Tory right, particularly when he
insisted people could be ''trained'' to accept moves to closer European
integration.
Former Chancellor Norman Lamont warned an EU forced into a ''super
state'' would disintegrate with the same disastrous consequences as the
Soviet Union.
Lord Tebbit, the former Tory Party chairman, accused Mr Santer of
''arrogance'' and ''deluding'' people with a hidden agenda of creeping
federalism.
Cabinet Minister Malcolm Rifkind said Britain's position was clear: it
was going to keep every veto it had.
''You do not feel comfortable with a Europe if you are having to
change your own law without the consent of your own government, without
the consent of your own parliament,'' Mr Rifkind, Defence Secretary,
said.
However, Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Mr Rifkind's
rhetoric was designed solely to save the Government's skin at the next
election.
''Nobody wants to build a Europe that is all the same, that is
ludicrous,'' Mr Ashdown said.
Shadow foreign affairs spokesman Robin Cook said Mr Rifkind could not
argue on the one hand for an enlarged Europe of many more countries,
''and then have them all sitting round the table clutching their own
veto''.
Mr Rifkind's comments followed a meeting in Sicily at the weekend
which was held to start preparing an agenda for the inter-governmental
conference next year on the future direction of Europe.
Britain, represented by Mr Davis, emphasised it would block any move
towards more majority voting at the expense of national governments'
power.
Looking ill at ease after two days of blunt exchanges which will
define the agenda for next year's Maastricht treaty revision, Mr Davis
left for London after pledging: ''We will oppose the extension of
qualified majority voting in any areas.''
His stand left Britain apparently friendless among the other 14 EU
member states, plus the two European Parliamentarians and the European
Commission which make up the Reflection Group. The group has until the
Madrid summit at the end of this year to produce a report.
Mr Davis's stand, endorsed earlier by Mr Douglas Hurd, Foreign
Secretary, appeared to leave some room for negotiation on the question
of more powers for the European Parliament. Mr Major has already said he
would oppose new powers for the Strasbourg assembly while seeking a
bigger role in the EU for national parliaments.
However, Mr Davis made only scant mention of this subject over the
weekend. Mr Hurd has recently said Britain would oppose ''massive''
extension of the parliament's power, a change in vocabulary which has
been taken to mean a softening of British will on the issue.
Mr Davis talked of wanting a more flexible approach to Europe,
suggesting Britain might pursue more opt-outs like the one negotiated by
Mr Major for the UK on Maastricht's social chapter. Britain is also free
to opt out of the planned European single currency if it so wishes.
Other countries overwhelmingly took the view that the so-called
''Europe a la carte'' with some states opting into and out of passages
of Maastricht would lead to institutional chaos.
Mr Davis insisted Britain had some allies but when invited to name
them he refused.
Meanwhile, Mr Santer also renewed his attack on Britain's opt-out of
the social chapter on workers' rights. ''If we are not sharing the same
goals, then you are making another Europe and that seems to me very
difficult to understand,'' he told the BBC TV programme Breakfast With
Frost.

EXCLUSIVE
BRITAIN could be forced to have its Trident nuclear missile submarines
refitted in the United States after 1999.
The switch could be made if Devonport dockyard fails to meet nuclear
safety standards within its #170m construction budget for the contract.
According to industry sources, the Government's options for the #5500m
deal are narrowing rapidly. If the Plymouth yard fails to bring its
Trident dry docks up to Nuclear Installation Inspectorate grade, or
costs escalate excessively in the attempt, then a rethink will be
necessary.
The only options at that stage would be an embarrassing about-turn on
the original decision and the award of the contract to Rosyth in Fife,
the politically suicidal move of allowing Devonport to pass on the
increase in its estimate for the project, or negotiation of a deal with
the Americans.
The US Navy operates 15 Trident missile boats of a similar size and
class to the UK's Vanguard-class boats and has a rolling programme of
refits under way. US yards are also desperate for additional contracts.
As revealed exclusively in The Herald last month, the limestone and
slate rock structure beneath Devonport is posing major problems for a
dry dock which would have to be able to withstand a small earthquake to
fulfil safety regulations.
Instead of building a new berth, Devonport Management Ltd, the
consortium running the operation, has tried to upgrade two battleship
docks. This involves strengthening the existing concrete structure with
a forest of 100ft-long solid rock anchors.
Rosyth, operated by Babcock Thorn, fitted seismic arrestor blocks --
giant shock absorbers -- in its proposed Trident dry dock, which is
built on solid bedrock. The Fife complex also has 30 years' experience
in nuclear refits for the Royal Navy.
According to one senior source, the nightmare scenario is a seismic
disturbance which would allow sea water into the drydock while a
submarine was berthed there with its nuclear reactor core exposed and
its fuel rods still in place.
The result would be ''a catastrophic explosion'' which would release a
lethal plume of highly radioactive gas.
The two-year refit operation involves cutting a hole in the hull to
gain access to the reactor and the subsequent removal and replacement of
its fuel rods, as well as upgrading and maintenance on other equipment.
Rosyth and Devonport engaged in a long and bitter battle to win the
Trident work. Refits on four boats over 25 to 30 years would be worth
more than #5000m at current prices.
The Defence Ministry had already invested #250m on Trident facilities
in Fife, notably the #120m ''hole in the ground'' known as RD57 dock,
before the West Country yard entered the bidding in 1992.
A political storm erupted when the contract finally went to Devonport.
The sop for Rosyth was the promise of 18 surface warship refits over 12
years.
Devonport's dry-dock problems now mean that an additional two Royal
Navy nuclear hunter-killer boats will go to Rosyth, which was supposed
to close its nuclear facilities by mid-1997. Plymouth will refit the
aircraft carrier Ark Royal as partial compensation.
The Government last month denied that this would happen, then did a
U-turn three weeks later and admitted that it would be necessary.
One of Rosyth's problems for the future of Trident work is that RD57
is to be sold off in a privatisation move later this year.
Devonport's management is still adamant that it will meet the required
nuclear standards and that costs can be kept under control. However, the
Defence Ministry has already warned it will not accept increased
expenditure on the strengthening of the drydock.
