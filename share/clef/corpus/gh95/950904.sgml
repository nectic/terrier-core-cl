ON Radio Scotland, Chick Young enthused about it, Alex Cameron
suggested it was one of the great games which he had seen. I eagerly
purchased my Herald to enjoy a good read about the previous night's
action. But no, overnight the whole atmosphere had changed. Our image of
Jimmy Nicholl returning the applause of the Celtic fans was replaced by
accusations of lack of sportsmanship dominating both the headline and
summary of the game.
What had Celtic done? Forget the 120 minutes of thrill and excitement,
they returned the ball in the wrong place. And there was I thinking
about going back to football again!

WORLD STUDENT GAMES
THERE was a silver lining for Doug Walker at the World Student Games
yesterday when he helped Britain to the runner-up berth in the 4 x 100
metres relay in Fukuoka. His medal was a measure of consolation after a
back injury spiked his dream of an individual 200m medal, writes Doug
Gillon.
Edinburgh's Walker ran the third leg for the quartet which clocked
39.39 behind the gold medal winners, USA (38.96). The UK team -- Paul
White, Toby Box, Walker and Michael Afilaka -- finished 0.25 ahead of
Italy in third. Britain took bronze in the 4 x 400m (Tony Williams, Dave
Deacon, Gary Jennings and David Grindlay) with 3-02.42. The USA won in a
Games' record of 3-00.40.
The Japanese hosts captured a record 24 golds, the same as the USA.
Britain was thirtieth in the medal table with three silver and seven
bronze medals. The multi-sport event, which ended yesterday, failed to
draw global attention, mainly due to the lack of top-class athletes.
Following immediately after the World championships in Gothenburg, and
the first week coinciding with the European swimming championships in
Zurich, many leading performers were absent. No world records in either
athletics or swimming were set during the 12-day event. Weekend
athletics winners and UK placings:
Men: 1500: AK Chekhemani (France) 3-46.53; 4, B Witchalls, 3-47.79.
10,000m: Y Watanabe (Japan) 28-47.78. Marathon: Takaki Morikawa (Japan)
2-21-32. 3000m steeplechase: D Muturi (Kenya) 8-27.03. Long jump: K

SHINTY
KINGUSSIE went on a spree when the Marine Harvest National League got
off to a stuttering start on Saturday.
Three games had to be postponed, one because of the weather and two
because of a shortage of referees.
The champions scored seven goals without reply against Oban Celtic.
Dave Anderson hit four, player of the year Ronald Ross got two, and
Michael Clark one. A late equaliser earned Fort William a 1-1 draw with
Inveraray at An Aird.
Inveraray certainly proved they will be a force to reckon with, almost
scoring in the first minute when Garry MacPherson's attempt shaved a
post. Fort, without suspended Adam Robertson and Drew McNeill, never got
going, but managed to square the game through Willie MacDonald.
In Glasgow, the city side took the lead through Kevin Thain, but
Glenurquhart hit back through Jamie Bell before the interval to square
the game.
In the North Division One, Skye, who narrowly missed a place in the
premier league, got off to a flying start with a 4-1 win over Beauly.
Kilmallie had the best win of the day, winning 5-2 at home to
Kinlochshiel. The Caol side led 5-0 before Shiel eventually got into the
game. Lochcarron and Caberfeidh drew 3-3 and Strathglass and Inverness
fought out a no-scoring draw.

BRAEMAR GATHERING
ALASTAIR Gunn crowned an outstanding season in which he gained the
World, British, and Scottish heavyweight throwing titles by winning the
heavy event championship at a rain-soaked Braemar Highland Gathering.
The Halkirk thrower was presented to the Queen after being the only
athlete to throw the Braemar heavy caber to clinch victory in the
overall contest, defeating Gordon Martin (Inverurie) and Bruce Aitken
(Glenbervie).
Tom Finkle, of Jedburgh, a former New Year Sprint winner, took the
British 80m title in 8.85sec., defeating Alastair McGurk (Lochgelly) and
Paul Allan (Pitreavie). Colin Donnelly, the Scottish hill-running
internationalist from Cambuslang, won the four-mile hill race in 25-49,
solid preparation for next Sunday's World Mountain Racing Championship
in Edinburgh.
* IAN Holmes, the holder, won the Centenary Ben Nevis Hill Race, but
by finishing sixth in the 10-mile, 4400-feet event, Mark Rigby of
Westerlands clinched the Tiso Scottish hill racing championship.
Bingley's Holmes worked hard to hold off 20-year-old debutant John
Brooks. Graeme Bartlett passed up the chance of challenging Rigby for
the title, in order to conserve his energies for the world championships
in Edinburgh next weekend.
Veteran Ros Evans (nee Coates), the former Olympic cross-country
skier, won the women's race for the sixth time since 1978. Details:
Men: 1, I Holmes (Bingley) 1-28.08; 2, J Brooks (Lochaber) 1-28.24; 3,
S Booth (Ambleside) 1-31.29; 4, D Rodgers 1-32.40; 5, W Rodgers (both
Lochaber) 1-32.55; 6, M Rigby (Westerlands) 1-33.14. Veteran: S Jackson
(Horwich) 1-40.38 (16th); 2, W Bell (Cumberland) 1-44.40; 3, C Hornsby
(Inverness) 1-45.09. Team: 1, Lochaber; 2, Borrowdale; 3, Bingley.
Women: 1, R Evans (Lochaber) 2-02.27; 2, T Dewsnap (Eryri) 2-05.32; 3, K

BADMINTON
SCOTLAND claimed their first ever victory in the Friends Provident
Grand Slam series yesterday on home turf at the Perth Open, when
Scottish champions Kenny Middlemiss and Elinor Allen defeated Julian
Robertson and Gail Emms of England in the final of the mixed doubles.
The Scots saved match point five times before winning 16-17, 15-8,
18-17 to beat the pair who defeated them convincingly in last year's
Lancashire Open.
Middlemiss outsmarted Robertson with a shot to the top left hand
corner of the court to regain service and clinched the game with a
smash. The win went some way to making up for the pair's disappointment
at the inaugural event last year, where they were top seeds but missed
out due to injury.
However they will not have much opportunity to continue the season as
they started it yesterday. Work commitments take Middlemiss abroad for
the next four weeks while the Edinburgh pair miss another six weeks as
they make their off-court partnership official and marry in November.
Allen also reached the final of the women's doubles with English
partner Emma Chaffin but lost in three games to England's number two
pairing Joanne Davies and Nichola Beck. Final Results:
Men's singles: D Hall (England) bt P Knowles (England), rtd. Women's
singles: J Muggeridge (England) bt J Mann (England) 11-3, 5-11, 12-9.
Men's doubles: N Cottrill and J Quinn (England) bt J Robertson and N
Robertson (England) 15-11, 15-7. Women's doubles: N Beck and J Davies
(England) bt E Allen (Scotland) and E Chaffin (England) 15-8, 1-15,
15-3. Mixed doubles: K Middlemiss and J Allen (Scotland) bt N Robertson
and G Emms (England) 16-17, 15-8, 18-17.

TONY Dorsey was on song for Birmingham Bullets in the City of Glasgow
Integrated Tournament men's final scoring a remarkable 50 points as the
Bullets pipped their English Budweiser League rivals London Leopards
98-96 at the Kelvin Hall yesterday.
Leopards, sponsored by Harvey Goldsmith, were favourites after both
sides and Irish team Killester had enjoyed big victories over their
Scottish opponents who had to face them without the help of paid foreign
players.
Leopards managed to fight back from a nine-point deficit early in the
second half to one basket with 28 seconds left but Bullets were primed
for victory. Nigel Lloyd added 14 for Bullets while Karl Brown scored 26
and Rob Youngblood confirmed his reputation as a 'rebounding machine',
scoring 19 for Leopards.
An understrength Sheffield Hatters still managed to win the British
Women's Club title, beating Rhondda Rebels 51-46 in the final while
Sheffield also won the wheelchair event which was given equal prominence
in this 'integrated' tournament, Steelers beating Oldham Owls 39-36 in a
close final. Results:

BOWLS
PORT Glasgow took the last major final of the outdoor bowls season,
beating Aberchirder 14-12 in the final of the Ashbourne Homes National
Mixed Pairs championship at the St Vincent Club, Glasgow.
In a match played in torrential rain, Port Glasgow's Lesley Stevenson
and Fred Kimmins began with singles on the opening two ends. But Isobel
Bremner and Frank Stevenson of Aberchirder, moved ahead with a count of
3 on the third end and remained in front over the next 11 ends to take a
12-9 lead into the fifteenth end.
Port Glasgow squared matters with a 3 and then wrapped up the title
when they added singles on the next two ends.
Earlier, Port Glasgow defeated Freda and George Walker from the Low
Waters Miners' Welfare Club in Hamilton, 15-14.
In the other semi-final, Hawick Wilton international Irene Bennett and
husband, Jim, saw an early lead disappear as the Aberchirder duo hit
back for a convincing 20-11 victory. Hawick led 8-2 after six ends, but
their North of Scotland opponents picked up three successive 4s between
the seventh and ninth ends to open up a 14-8 advantage and they went on
to clinch victory.
Wilton took third place when they beat Low Waters 14-13.

THE start of the English football season has resulted in referees
being insistent that players who require treatment are stretchered off
and treated at the sidelines.
I disagree with this procedure, and would rather see 10 minutes or so
added to each half by the referee in injury time. The dangers involved
in an over-zealous referee insisting that a player is removed when
medically unsafe to do so sends me weak at the knees.
It is supposed to be a time-saving exercise, but I do not believe that
it saves much time. The average playing time for a game in the World Cup
would vary little from the time played in the league last season (60-65
minutes ''ball in play'').
One of the most important features of the procedures is the ability to
confuse and upset the paying audience. I shall give two examples.
(a) The man is told he must get on the stretcher and go off. By the
time he reaches the sidelines, he has caught his breath and is ready to
continue. This causes animosity among supporters and the player is
branded a time-waster and cheat because the referee followed the letter
of the law.
(b) A player goes down in the six-yard box and is stretchered behind
the goal where, duly patched up, he attempts to rejoin the game just
before a corner. The referee tells him that he must enter the field of
play from the half-way line. Clearly the referee is being unjust and is
liable to get a rousing reception from the fans.
So if the game is not helped by the new rule, what good does it do?
The answer is quite simple. The referee has discharged his duty for
injury time as he has saved so much time during the game (not!) and so
the game ends at 4.45pm in time for the ''teleprinter'' and match
reports before the classified results.
Television schedules are delighted, no-one ever runs out of satellite
time and everyone gets to the adverts on time. FIFA collect the
advertising revenue by way of the fee they charge the TV companies and
all the corporate ''supporters'' are happy. The deed is done.
Football being run for TV and for football authorities is a dangerous
pastime which could easily end in farce and create a situation where the
game would no longer be an attractive spectacle for paying customers. In
the last World Cup, we did not play quarters, but how long can we hold
out?
It's time for managers and trainers to deal with their teams to stop
the cheats (like Brian Clough used to do) and bring back the ''magic
sponge and on your way'' attitude to less serious knocks.
Referees should play all the injury time required and let us enjoy our
football even if we don't get home in time for ''Pets Win Prizes'' (oh,
what a frightening nightmare).

REGARDING Ken Gallacher's article on European ties and the travelling
pertaining to same, although I am a Rangers fan, I can sympathise with
Celtic's position of having to play a league match so soon after their
arduous trip to and from Georgia. I agree that clubs are representing
their country and that they should be given more consideration by the
administrators of the game in Scotland.
However, I take issue with Mr Gallacher when he says that performances
in Europe affect the seedings and standings of clubs in future
campaigns.
The fact that Blackburn Rovers were seeded into the Champions' League
without any European pedigree and that had Ajax been beaten in the last
final, they would not have been seeded, notwithstanding the performances
of other clubs from their respective countries, proves that money from
TV coverage from the biggest countries in Europe is the main criterion
for European competition seedings. Events on the park have little to do
with it.

THERE is a constant thread which runs through the conversations you
have with Scotland's international footballers at the moment and I don't
mean the obvious hope that they can defeat Finland at Hampden this week.
It's more WHY they want to do so. And here we have a group of players
who are not thinking about the bonuses they will earn if they carry the
country into the European Championship Finals.
After all, the story has already been told that skipper Gary
McAllister simply crumpled up the piece of paper he was handed with the
bonus proposals and hurled it into a wastepaper basket.
There is more than mere money at stake here. There is old-fashioned
national pride and the nightmare scenario which failure to qualify would
bring. That, of course, would see Scotland sitting at home while our
neighbours, England, host one of the major soccer parties, the finals of
the European Championships.
Those of us who were around in 1966 when England staged the World Cup
Finals need no reminding of how chastening an experience it can be when
you are left on the outside looking in at one of the game's great
occasions.
Scotland manager Craig Brown can recall that and he has not hesitated
to use that memory to instil in his players the absolute need to
qualify.
So, when the players arrived at Hampden this week-end, you had
defender Colin Calderwood emphasising: ''We just don't want to be left
out when the finals are on.''
He went on: ''The lads at Spurs don't seem to realise just how close
we are to being in the finals next summer. We have just sneaked up on
them quietly until we are almost there.
''But we know we have to win this game if we want to make sure, or, at
the very least, avoid defeat to leave ourselves still in with a
qualifying opportunity.
''But, down south, because England didn't have to qualify, no-one has
been paying too much attention to what is going on in the various
qualifying groups.
''We just HAVE to be there. On a personal note, I have watched World
Cups and European Championship finals on television, but never really
believed that I would ever have any chance of taking part. Now we are
tantalisingly close.''
So close that even the cautious Brown might well accept that his side
have succeeded if they can defeat Finland, even though Greece would
still have an outside chance.
Meanwhile, as Calderwood gave the Anglo view of how much qualification
will mean to the players, the domestic version came from Billy McKinlay
who now looks set to be the first home-based player from outside the top
division to play for his country since the days of Alan Rough and his
time with Partick Thistle.
That is not a thought which dents McKinlay's confidence. He grins:
''It's not all that easy playing in the first division and looking at
some of the difficult places you have to go, but I have had only the one
game at Dunfermline because of suspension.
''I feel as fit and ready for this one, if I'm picked as I was last
season.
''You do worry about keeping your international place when your team
is relegated, but the boss, Craig Brown, assured me I would stay in his
plans just as long as I kept playing well.
''Basically, he was telling me I had to maintain my own standards no
matter where I was playing and that is my aim for the rest of the
season. We are in the first division because we didn't play well enough
last season. We had bad results and bad performances and paid the price
for that.
''Now Scotland have given me a little bit of a release, away from club
pressures. Mind you there are pressures enough this week for all of us.
We know what victory means.
''The thought of sitting at home while the European Championships are
being played just across the Border is just too much to bear. We cannot
afford to let that happen. There is no way any of us would want that.''
McKinlay looks sure to take over from Stuart McCall after the Rangers'
player limped away from Hampden on Saturday suffering from a knee
ligament injury.
Scotland manager Craig Brown has yet to decide, but the injured McCall
is convinced the Tannadice man will take his place and probably score.
''I can see Billy coming in and scoring,'' he said, ''and then I would
have to wait to get my place back. Honestly, that is the kind of thing
Billy does. Gets called in and then helps himself to a goal. He will not
be worried one bit about being in the first division. Billy is not the
type of player to let his head go down.''
McKinlay added: ''None of the lads will be over-confident about this
one. A lot of the fans seemed to think it was all over when we defeated
the Greeks. It wasn't.
''Both Greece and Finland still have outside chances of qualifying.
All we have done is put ourselves in a powerful position, but we have to
win this one to make sure. That has to be our aim. The last thing we
want is to be on the outside looking in next summer.''
I remember vividly the last time that happened and can still see Jim
Baxter coming towards me in the Long Bar at Wembley after the Final and
saying: ''Imagine them winning the World Cup!''
Let's not have any repeat performance next summer.

BASKETBALL is, for some reason the biggest-growing participatory sport
in the world. It is huge in the States, of course, and has long figured
in movies as America's version of putting yer jaickets down for goal
posts and playing soccer.
Hard-eyed precinct polis and private eyes are forever making friends
with local Dead End Kids quite simply by throwing baskets. Sydney
Poitier made a living for 10 years chipping balls into nets in Harlem
playgrounds with dissident kids in his movies.
And basketball is big business indeed. It has come to Europe and
elsewhere in the last few years, and especially the UK, and England and
Ireland are very strong. Indeed, Ireland has shown Great Britain the way
ahead. There were two Irish women's teams represented at the City of
Glasgow Integrated Basketball tournament in Kelvin Hall, held over
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday when the finals were enacted.
Naomh Mhuire, (pronounced -- well, a bit -- as ''Nave Weerer''), the
experienced team from Dublin which was surprisingly beaten in the semis
by The Sheffield Hatters, can yet be happy in that the cutlery town won
rather well against the Welsh girls from the Rhonda. Mind you, the Welsh
girls were smaller and younger, and Sheffield won last year as well at
league and cup level. They were also winners at the British and Irish
Federation Cup last year.
Two points here. Basketball is an all British Islands sport. The other
Irish women's team in attendance was Waterford's Snowcream Wildcats, who
showed well. A very young team, with six out of nine players only 21
years of age, the Wildcats can expect to be a major force soon.
The other point is that this City of Glasgow-sponsored tourney, (they
put in, it is reputed, nearly 10 grand, matched by a similar sum from
Strathclyde Regional Council, and the ubiquitous Glasgow Sports and
Recreation Department had much officialdom attending, many voluntarily),
was originally intended as a competition for disabled basketballers.
When the Scottish Basketball Union discovered the Kelvin Hall was also
a perfect venue for a women's competition, they jumped at the chance to
run the Federation Cup at the same spot. Then the lads joined in.
The men's event is an invitation tournament, and that was when
Scotland really saw the difference between the relatively small numbers
of basketball players in our ain wee nation and the massive number of
players in England.
Two English teams in the men's final, and London Leopards were beaten
by 96 to Birmingham Bullets' 98: pretty close. But so too were the
disabled players. The Meteors from Liverpool were expected to do well,
for they are a very old club and have a long history of development
among younger players.
They came in third, which is pretty good, but the winners were the
Sheffield Steelers, who defeated the Oldham Owls, who had a cast list of
all GB internationals, including 42-year-old Vernon Ross, and Jon
Pollock, who, at 18, is probably the most outstanding prospect in
Britain. Wheelchair-based athletes know how to face adversity, of
course, but it will surprise many people who have never seen wheelchair
basketball just how bloody fast it is.
Basketball will naturally take to the family day out, cans of Bud, and
hotdogs with mustard Americana which is, for instance, so much a part of
ten-pin bowling.
This is an embryonic sport yet, certainly in Scotland, but there are
clearly commercial opportunities, and I don't mean for blatant
profiteering and sleaze: I mean for what I said. A day out for families,
a healthy sport for kids and young people of any age.
Originally an outdoor game, it is ideal for indoors, obviously a
factor in this country. Starting as a game invented by Bob Naismith in
the USA as a means of keeping his football players fit during the off
season, it has become, some say, the most popular team game in the
world.
For disabled basketball, first introduced for people with spinal
injuries in Britain in 1945 by German neuro-surgeon Sir Ludwig Guttman
as part of a rehab programme, the game offers a team sport rather than
an individual one and there are now over 600 registered wheelchair
basketball players in Britain.
We Brits are currently European Champions. We Brits can't say that
about many other sports.

THE remarkable success of a five-year initiative to lock out crime
from one of Scotland's most notorious housing estates, Easterhouse in
Glasgow, has emerged from a survey.
The estate, with a population the size of Perth's, has seen crime drop
by almost one quarter in the 90s. Overall, violent crime fell last year
against a 13% rise across Strathclyde.
The findings appear in the annual review of Safe Greater Easterhouse,
an umbrella of prevention, education, and victim support schemes. It is
the largest of four urban safety programmes set up in Scotland in 1990.
Under the main thrust of the strategy, every householder on the estate
was offered free security fittings and improvements such as mortice
locks, window catches, and safety chains. More than 7000 homes have been
installed with devices at a cost of #680,000.
A community safety advice shop was opened earlier this year to sell
further improvement items at cost price, and a network of support
schemes has been started to help the victims of break-ins and other
crimes.
Last year, the initiative reported that house-breaking dropped by 24%
and total offences by 7% in the area, a significantly sharper drop than
experienced in falling crime rates across the rest of Strathclyde.
Co-ordinator Mr Dennis Daly said the project team were ''proud but
realistic'' about the results. ''It would be silly to declare there is
now nothing wrong in the area. You don't take problems of 40 years
making and turn them round in five years, but we have made a start.''
He said the background aspects of the campaign, which include
educational programmes in primary schools, women's self-defence classes,
and counselling for crime victims, were of equal importance.
''As well as making people actually more secure, we believe we have
made people feel they are more secure. When the initiative commenced,
60% of people in the area reported they were regularly worried over
safety. Now it is 53%.
''That may not sound a lot, but for us that 7% is real evidence that
the tide in attitudes is turning.
''You're on a hiding to nothing if you think that physical safety
measures alone can tackle the roots and effect of crime. What we have
done is to target awareness and welfare as well.''
While the end of five years of public funding had led to the closure
of other 1990 urban aid programmes, he confirmed that Easterhouse's
success meant it would continue under local authority and private sector
backing.
Mr Daly's optimism was echoed by the Easterhouse development company's
business manager, Mr Gordon McCorkindale, who reported a ''continuing
upsurge'' of business interest in the area. He said the estate had had
65 new commercial investments since 1993 and that business security was
''one of the safest in Glasgow''.
Easterhouse's crime prevention officer, Sergeant Donald Macleod, said
the advances included an improved community relationship with the
police. He said: ''People are now feeling safer in their homes and more
positive. There has perhaps been an element of mutual suspicion before,
but I detect there is now a closer communication between Easterhouse and
the police.''
However, he added: ''There are still problems as with any large
housing scheme and the reputation of Easterhouse still exists to some
extent. Incidents which happen elsewhere happen in Easterhouse, and are
publicised because of the estate's name.''
He said that vandalism had continued to rise in the estate in recent
years, despite falling crime, and said projects should now be turned
towards young people in the area.

SCOTTISH SENIORS
BRIAN Huggett edged a tantalising tit-for-tat tussle in the final
round of the Shell Scottish Seniors Open in his favour yesterday, so
rounding off a remarkable record of consistency in this #100,000 event
at Royal Aberdeen.
The 58-year-old Welshman, a Ryder Cup player on no fewer than six
occasions in his heyday, relied on his considerable matchplay prowess to
fend off the challenge of England's Neil Coles, who was vying for his
second successive seniors success directly alongside his rival.
In a finale that could not have been better scripted before a crowd of
3500, Huggett compiled a four-under-par 66 for a record 10-under-par
aggregate of 200 and a cheque for #16,660. His evergreen adversary Coles
mustered a 67 to close two strokes adrift.
With a brisk breeze blowing in from the North Sea Huggett added his
thirty-third world-wide victory to a runners-up position gained in 1993
and a third-place finish last season. Both were recorded across these
6372-yard Balgownie links.
Ultimately, events at the penultimate hole sealed victory for Huggett,
though the 25-foot birdie putt he holed across the final green was an
additional touch of class. The weather caused Coles to overclub with a
No.4 iron at the 180-yard seventeenth, following which Huggett switched
to a No.5 and secured his par.
By Huggett's own recollections, the last occasion these two great
players had been pitched together in such a head-to-head confrontation
was in 1972 at the Scottish Open at Downfield, where Coles emerged as
victor at the first extra play-off hole.
''I've never let him forget that he topped his ball off the tee and
still won the hole,'' grinned Huggett.
Overnight leader Antonio Garrido allowed his stranglehold on the
tournament to slip with an extremely disappointing three-over-par 73.
On Saturday, as torrential rain delayed play for almost two hours,
only a hardy handful could cope with conditions. They were shown the way
by that veteran of eight Ryder Cup campaigns, Bernard Hunt, who, at 65,
marred a run of par figures with only two bogeys and one birdie.
Despite casual water hampering players' progress, the pensioner drew
on his years of experience. He explained: ''It's only rain. You just get
your head down and play for par. It's not a difficult course.''
Leading home competitor was Robert Webster of Mount Oswald Golf Club,
an exile living in Stockton, who carded a steady 70 for a four-over-par
aggregate of 213. He was followed by North Berwick's David Huish on 216.
Elsewhere, there was good news for Brian Barnes, who was responding to
treatment for a blood clot in the main artery of his right leg. The
Anglo-Scot hopes to leave hospital for his Sussex home on Friday in a
chauffeur-driven limousine -- courtesy of the tournament sponsors --
though he is expected to be out of action for at least another three
weeks.

ENGLISH OPEN
WORLD No.1 Laura Davies continued her remarkable season with a sixth
win of the year when she captured the Wilkinson Sword English Open title
for a third time with a closing round of 70 at The Oxfordshire Club
yesterday.
Davies broke the Tour record of 21 victories she shared with Dale Reid
when her nine-under-par 279 left her one clear of Karina Orum, from
Denmark, with Wendy Dicks one further behind.
Scotland's Julie Forbes and Reid were another stroke in arrears to
share fourth place with Trish Johnson and Diane Barnard.
Davies, who has now amassed 39 career victories since 1985, had
started the final round two strokes behind Dicks who had led through the
first three rounds and was still one behind at the final turn.
With the pressure at its greatest down the final stretch, Davies
turned the tables when she birdied both the eleventh and twelfth holes
to take the lead she never surrendered.
Leading final scores (British or Irish unless stated):
279 -- L Davies 72, 67, 70, 70 (#13,500).
280 -- K Orum (Denmark) 71, 73, 68, 68 (#9135).
281 -- W Dicks 67, 68, 72, 74 (#6300).
282 -- D Reid 69, 75, 68, 70; D Barnard 68, 73, 70, 71; T Johnson 71,
68, 71, 72; J Forbes 74, 70, 66, 72.
283 -- L Navarro (Spain) 74, 69, 75, 65.

SEVE Ballesteros has called for the course at Crans-Sur-Sierre to be
made tougher -- despite missing the halfway cut by seven shots.
The Spaniard bowed out after scores of 74 and 76 in the first two
rounds but claimed: ''The back nine is too easy.''
Ballesteros is a good friend of Gaston Barras, president of the
organising committee, and wants more bunkers to be installed where the
pros are likely to be tested. ''I don't want this tournament to be won
at 22 under par like it was last year,'' he said.
Another to miss the cut was world No.1 Greg Norman. He was reputed to
have been offered #194,000 in appearance money, but is returning some of
his fee. He said his contract will ''be adjusted accordingly'' and he
has promised to return.

THE RYDER CUP
A MOUNTAIN of dollars is flooding into Rochester, New York, like never
before. Everyone is gearing up for the Ryder Cup showdown between
Bernard Gallacher's European hopes and Lanny Wadkins' local heroes later
this month.
The circus is coming to town and American golf fanatics are determined
they won't miss out on the action which takes place over three dramatic
days starting on September 22.
The clash of the giants is expected to generate a fantastic $40-$50m
to the metropolitan region along Lake Ontario's southern shore.
All 6090 hotel rooms in the city and surrounding Monroe County have
been snapped up for the past year.
Hotel chains from Buffalo to Syracuse and as far off as Utica, 130
miles to the east, are fully reserved, as is every rental car and
half-decent restaurant for miles around.
Local people, too, are awash with money, renting out their homes for
mega bucks. It's estimated as many as 500 families who live within
walking distance of the Oak Hill Country Club will move out to let the
fans move in.
Steve and Jackie Braverman are a typical example. They are renting out
their four-bedroom house alongside the fourteenth hole to six strangers
for around #16,000.
''It's very difficult to turn down that kind of money,'' said
Braverman, who owns a money-management firm. ''It's a lot of cash. It's
crazy in fact.''
His wife added: ''They've given us a ludicrous amount of money and
that will mean we'll do some ludicrous, extravagant thing we wouldn't
normally do.''
The couple are celebrating his fiftieth birthday with a 12-day trip to
southern France. ''We're going to Monte Carlo,'' she said. ''We're not
going to put it all on red. We're looking on it as found money and just
doing fun things with it. We're giving some to charity.''
The demand for accommodation is staggering with fans splurging
anything from #800 for a tiny apartment to upwards of #30,000 for a
mansion complete with cooks and maids. Most of the ranch and
colonial-style homes bordering the tree-lined fairways were snapped up
by corporations entertaining top officials or revered clients.
0 Some people are even renting their driveways or allowing sponsors to
erect hospitality tents on their lawns. One couple traded their house
for the week with a golf fan in Bermuda.
Stockbroker Thomas Huber, whose house offers an unobstucted view of
the first green, is getting more than #14,000. The corporate guests
include his chief executive. ''You feel a little more comfortable when
the boss is going to be there,'' he said.
All 25,000 Ryder Cup tickets have long been sold.

TWO days after considering quitting the Greater Milwaukee Open in
disgust, Scott Hoch won the tournament with a 15-under-par aggregate of
269, finishing with two 65s to be three clear of his nearest challenger,
Marco Dawson.
Hoch was one of several players who had felt victimised by the severe
conditions of the Brown Deer Park greens, which second-round co-leader
Richard Zokol had said were like ''putting on a bumpy pane of glass.''
Leading final scores (Americans unless stated):

THE doorway to a brave new rugby world continues to creak open and
sportsmen who deserve more than the support of a nation could be rubbing
their hands in expectation. They may even have instructed their bank
managers to await a financial deluge, the flood of money which they
might believe is about to wash over them all.
It is a pleasant thought and one which might act as a balm as the
players count the bruises which tell them another season has opened, but
someone has to enlighten the rugby fellows. Someone has to ask them:
Into what kind of new world do you believe you are about to enter?
They may look like Neanderthals with their re-arranged faces and, in
some cases, bodies which appear to have been assembled from left-overs,
but there is a higher degree of intelligence within rugby than, say,
real football, and it should not be too taxing for them to comprehend
that the world remains round and it belongs to soccer.
This is not a statement designed merely to annoy or offend anyone, but
the fact is the sporting world is already overrun with clubs and
organisations, agents and spivs, and men in finely-cut suits who can
sweet-talk even the most hard-nosed businessmen into parting with hefty
sponsorship cheques.
Rugby is late in moving into the twenty-first century, and the way the
people involved in this sport have been behaving is worrying, not for
the myriad other sports, but for their own game. The money men have not
been waiting with arms full of greenbacks for rugby to throw off its
flimsy cloak of amateurism which failed miserably to disguise the
appalling hypocrisy with which this sport, to its eternal discredit, is
synonymous.
Scotland's other major sports, football and golf, have been tapping
into corporate finance for years -- and still they can't get a big
enough share.
Rugby will find there are dozens of minor sports wrestling to pick up
the scraps which fall off the table on which football and golf dine, and
the majority of rugby's clubs might find themselves trying to nuzzle
into that particular feeding trough. It is a harsh world into which
rugby is moving.
It would be extremely foolish to think television will throw money at
them, and even a European competition is unlikely to have companies
falling over themselves. English football will be settling down soon to
negotiate a new television contract for the Premiership and it is
expected they will be given #100m, which won't leave a lot for other
sports, let alone rugby.
The rules are basic: before real money can be attracted a sport must
have mass appeal. It has to be a spectacle which regularly will attract
customers in significant numbers, because only then will television's
cameras be trained on the action. Then, when when media attention is
strong and sustained, sponsorship follows.
Frankly, rugby does not have mass appeal, and it is a fatuous argument
to present the Rugby World Cup or the Five Nations' Championship as
positive proof that rugby is worshipped in every home. Scotland's
sporting fans are patriots, so the viewing figures of major
international matches would be an unsound foundation on which to build
any new world.
Rugby is still regarded as an upper-class sport in Scotland and it
will take a considerably long time to discard that damaging image and
persuade those who feel more comfortable with the people's game that
there just might be something in the other game of football. It will
never happen, and if anyone at Murrayfield or in any of the clubhouses
throughout the land are in doubt about football's place in the grand
scheme, a walk through any housing scheme would bring reality sharply
into focus.
Children, boys and girls, teenagers, and adults are wearing the
football tops of various clubs. Also, just like the players, they have
change strips.
When it comes to parting the public from their money football has
nothing to learn, while rugby has still to start school. Even if rugby
somehow were to lose its game-for-the-privileged reputation it would
still be faced with the massive problem of trying to entice youngsters,
a difficulty which even football has been experiencing.
Rugby has to try, of course, but I fear this is one contest it cannot
win, simply because of traditions and the expertise which now exists
within football clubs, especially the biggest operations.
Rangers, for example, are a multi-million pound business, as are
Celtic, and yet these clubs cannot get enough of the sponsorship money
sloshing around. The bigger a sporting concern becomes the greater the
share of corporate money it must have.
There is not enough money, be it from television or other sources, to
go around in football, and rugby's share will be minimal. It won't be
enough to pay for any vibrant professional world in which players are
full-time and salaried.
Perhaps one or two clubs will be able to pay decent money to a select
few players, but in general the sport will shuffle along, a collection
of semi-professional outfits just like the football clubs in the lower
divisions of the Scottish League.
The country just isn't big enough for two major sports and rugby will
always be a poor second. It's too late for them to do anything about
that now.

EUROPEAN MASTERS
MATHIAS Gronberg, the 25-year-old Swede, using a new driver, an old
putter, and employing a new caddie, gained his first European PGA Tour
success when he won the Canon European Masters at Crans-Sur-Sierre,
Switzerland, yesterday.
Gronberg, who refused to look at a leaderboard throughout the day,
shot a final-round 69 for 270, 18 under par, to beat Barry Lane and
Italian Costantino Rocca by two shots and Sweden's Joakim Haeggman and
Eduardo Romero, the defending champion from Argentina, by three.
Lane won more than #60,000 for his joint second place but was just one
week too late. Had he won this kind of money at last week's German Open
he would have qualified for the European Ryder Cup team.
Rocca, who will be playing against the United States later this month,
has been playing well all season and says his success is due to Bruno de
Michelis, the psychologist for the AC Milan football club.
But this was Gronberg's week, for the man from Stockholm won #116,660
-- by far the biggest pay cheque of his career -- and, starting the day
one shot ahead of the field, he never faltered in the final round,
leading all the way.
He said: ''I thought I would have a new everything this week. I played
with a new driver which gave me another 10 yards in length, I changed
back to an old putter I had not used for several months, and I had a new
caddie called Ken. I don't know his other name.
''I did not look at a leaderboard, even when there were just a few
holes to play. I know you cannot change what anyone else is doing so I
just played my own game. I didn't even know I was two shots ahead when I
came to the last hole. I was only sure after I had holed my final putt.
''I hardly slept last night but once I had birdied the third today I
just relaxed, looked at the mountains and enjoyed myself.''
Lane shot a best-of-the-day 64 to come from joint seventeenth to joint
second but it might have been much lower. He missed five feet putts at
both the tenth and thirteenth, and three-putted both the sixteenth and
eighteenth.
He was philosophical about his Ryder Cup misfortunes. ''It's no good
worrying about what might have been,'' he said. ''I played really well
today, had eight birdies and an eagle 3 at the fifteenth, and am not too
disappointed.''
Rocca, who had six birdies and an eagle 2 at the seventh in his 66,
said: ''I owe a lot to Bruno de Michelis. He told me to forget when I
hit a bad shot and just relax. When I played bad shots before my head
would go 'Boom' and I would make other mistakes. But Bruno told me, be
angry just for the moment but then forget it, walk down the fairway, and
think only of the next shot. Well, it works.''
Sam Torrance, who is lying second in the order of merit, made up a
little ground on leader Colin Montgomerie. Torrance (68 for 275)
finished joint ninth to win #14,805 and Montgomerie (70 for 276)
finished joint eleventh to collect #11,725.
But Montgomerie, bidding to be European No.1 for the third sucessie
year, is still #30,000 ahead of Torrance.

THE correspondence regarding cricket and ''colonialism'' was summed up
for me by Brian Meek's recent article on the England cricket team. He
wrote of them as ''our lot'' and went on to justify his stance by
pleading that it was all the Scots have to support. I do not follow his
logic in this. But it does seem to exemplify an at least partially
colonialised mentality.
The game of cricket, watching it, talking about it, perhaps even
playing it, provides the English with a deep sense of cosiness and
security. They are rich in this comfy nostalgia. Lucky them. Tebbit even
went so far as to use one's cricket allegiance as the yardstick of one's
nationality. It helps to underpin their Englishness.
What may well be happening to the Scots may be what has happened to
Brian Meek. Our supine attitude to a tidal wave of things English, e.g.
five full days of the English cricket team on TV (all six Tests), leads
to a kind of creeping Englishness in and out of which Brian Meek, for
example, seems to slip as the situation requires (handy for a Scots'
Conservative politician).
I watch cricket on TV but I am aware that there is quite a lot of
brainwashing going on through the medium of the Broadcasting Corporation
(British? English?). But can you imagine them ever talking about
'British cricket'?

Sugar's performance on television the other night was a gem. The film
should be copied and distributed among would-be football club chairmen
of this world who should study the Tottenham Hotspur leader in action.
His behaviour was that of a spoilt child, especially when he tossed
the Spurs shirt which had been worn last season by Jurgen Klinsmann, and
made the ridiculous claim that he had been ''the mug'' who resurrected
the German's career. A look at that film ought to be enough to disabuse
the Charan Gills among us of the notion that football is for them.
What they all fail to realise is that this game has a habit of
changing people who fall under its spell. It is a high-profile business
-- significantly, maybe, in the case of the recent Partick Thistle
fiasco in which some MP or other seemed to be using the notion of a
buy-out as some kind of political platform on which to pontificate --
which entices successful men, lured perhaps by the thought of publicity
after years spent working towards personal fortunes in relative
anonymity.
After all, there is an egotist lurking within all of us.
How many times have you heard someone buy over a club and state that
he doesn't want to be in the public eye, that he seeks only to work away
in the background happy to see the players and managers bask in any
success? They may start out with that belief, but soon these new
chairmen are vying for media attention.
They are not all screen stars like Wallace Mercer, who could sense a
camera or microphone from 1500 metres, but most of them like the
attention. They enjoy holding court, and only a few, the ones like
Airdrie's chairman George Peat, who would have all hacks flogged and
banished from the world of football, shun approaches.
Even the most astute of businessmen have to rethink their strategies
when they discover, usually fairly quickly, the rules and methods of the
real business world don't apply to the running of a football club
because these organisations are subject to so many bizarre and
antiquated ways and prejudices. For example, Fergus McCann entered as
Celtic's saviour trying to apply pure business techniques and systems,
but, stubborn as he is, he had to re-assess.
He bumped into The Herald's economics editor, Alf Young, at a match
recently and said: ''You're the journalist who thinks football is a
business. I used to think that when I came here at first as well.''
What were Jim Glass, who wanted to buy into Hearts, and Gill, who we
were told had the notion of moving into Firhill, thinking about? Neither
succeeded and both should be grateful. If they are silly enough to try
again, and with genuine bids this time, their family and friends should
usher them gently into darkened rooms and apply cold compresses to their
foreheads.
''Why do we buy into football clubs? I'll tell you why,'' said
Falkirk's chairman George Fulston. ''Because most of us are wired to the
moon, that's why.''
Fulston, who leaves the country today for a week's holiday --
''basically because I'm knackered, but I'll be taking paperwork
regarding the club's new stadium with me'' -- was involved with Hamilton
before leaving them to take over as the driving force at Brockville, and
still wonders at times why he bothers. The rewards are not high, the
strain isn't good for anyone's health, and he admits the problems can be
horrendous.
''But it's a challenge, and I can't resist one of those,'' he says.
''I came in because I felt I could give something in terms of time and
money, but I like to work hard and I believe in being a hands-on type of
chairman.''
Fulston, who owns a forklift business, reckons that so far he has
invested a seven-figure sum in football and he knows there is no
guarantee he will get it back, but he loves the game. And the publicity
and glory?
''No, I don't crave any of that stuff. I honestly don't like to see my
face in the papers and every time I do, I look at the ugly mush and I
say to myself, 'my God, that's what my wife has to wake up to every
morning.' It really is just that I want to do something with the club
and for the community, even though I know that if the time I devoted to
Falkirk was directed towards my business, it would be the biggest
forklift company in Britain.''
Fulston was bemused by the recent attempt to take control of Thistle.
''I don't know Jim Oliver all that well, but he has invested his time
and his money in that club, so why should he suddenly stand aside
because someone else says so,'' he wondered.
''What makes supporters think that the first person to come along
seeking to buy is the right person or a better person than the man
already there? Thistle are rebuilding a stadium and they are still in
the premier division. What is being done there is not easy.''
Oliver himself has been wondering about that also, and he must also
question the loyalty and perhaps even the intelligence of some fans, who
seem to think that a ground and a team can be rebuilt at the same time
on an average crowd of 3500. ''I didn't set out with the intention of
buying into Partick Thistle,'' Oliver said. ''My company, Windex, did
the Speirs Wharf development and I was looking at the Firhill basin,
which would have required getting a piece of ground from the club, and
it went on from there.
''At the time the club had a fairly massive debt, but nevertheless I
bought out the people in charge at the the time and I have invested
something like #1.75m while others have put in money and also provided
interest-free loans. Grants and money from other sources account for
another #2.5m, and if anyone else thinks he can do more, then all he has
to do is demonstrate they know how to run a club and that there is money
for players as well as to buy out the current directors.
''This is not like Celtic. We are not hanging on by our finger nails,
and there is no bunker mentality. There is none of that here and if
somemone else doens't have the #4.5m to #5m needed to come in, then we
are as well staying where we are.''
Oliver and his people are in the sixth year of their 10-year
programme, and he says they are on schedule with 9500 seats in Firhill.
And the chairman also claims that for the first time in a while, money
generated can be spent on players. ''Sometimes, though, it seems like an
impossible task,'' he said.
Another with a majority holding in a club, Raith Rovers' Alex Penman,
also is at a loss to explain exactly what possessed him to become more
than a wealthy supporter of the Kirkcaldy club. ''Just love of the team,
I suppose, and maybe because I thought I could take the club on another
step or two.''
Penman made his decision to become involved 18 months ago while
sitting on a Barbados beach, and he soon found how cold and harsh
close-up reality can be. ''What annoys me is that people concentrate
only on the bad things and quickly forget the good things at a club,''
he said. ''A lot of work goes into this and my time is split 50-50
between the club and my building company, but I've started something
here and and I'm not about to walk away.
''The old board found an easy way out when they had a big overdraft
and I have put something like #375,000 of my money into this club and
yet there are times when you get slaughtered by people on the outside
who think they know better.
''Everything is for sale, and if there is anyone out there then let's
see them, not that I want out. Besides, once you are in, it isn't easy
to walk away. You put your money in and the rest is a gamble.''
Something to do with pride and challenges they all say, although few
of them would advise others to do what they have done. Football absorbs
too much finance, but the hidden costs, the damage to family and private
lives, can be severe.
Why do they do it? Perhaps it is really is like Fulston insists. ''I'm
telling you. We must be mad.''

TONIGHT a modern-day Bruce will lead the Scottish troops into battle
against the Auld Enemy. As at Bannockburn, the odds are firmly stacked
against them.
In many sports there have been famous victories against the English:
the rugby Grand Slam victory of 1990 and the fondly remembered defeat of
the 1966 World Cup-winning team the following year at Wembley.
There have even been some close-run contests. But at badminton the
record is bleak. In more than 60 meetings the Scots have still to chalk
up a victory.
And the prospects are not good, as English players dominated the Perth
Open Championships at the weekend.
So Bruce Flockhart, 23, and the other intrepid Scots have a daunting
task ahead of them at Meadowbank tonight.
Their eagerness will be spurred by the fact that England has always
viewed the Scots as second-best -- so much so that their team don't
receive caps for a match against Scotland.
Yet there are signs that, individually, the Scots are making progress.
Flockhart, Scotland's leading singles player, has risen to No.29 in the
world rankings, the highest-ever placing of a Scot, and significantly
the top Briton at the moment.
It was almost inevitable that he would play badminton. Both his
parents, Adam and Joanna, played. His mother has innumerable victories
to her name and dominated the Scottish game for many years.
As a boy, Flockhart went along to tournaments with his mother and
watched the top players, and his enthusiasm for the game was born.
He progressed rapidly through the junior game and is now in his final
year at Stirling University, where he is studying computer science.
Flockhart is on a sports bursary and this has enabled him to take an
extra year for his course. It has given him extra time for training and
the university also assists him with some expenses.
Each year 25 athletes are given the opportunity to take up bursaries
there. In Flockhart's year there are 15 golfers. One of his fellow
students is British amateur golf champion Gordon Sherry, who faces a
similar uphill struggle later this week when he is a member of the
British Walker Cup team to meet the Americans at Royal Porthcawl.
In his quest to improve, Flockhart travelled to the Far East and then
to America and Canada during the summer. He played in Malaysian,
Indonesian, and Singapore tournaments with mixed success. Then it was on
to Atlanta for the American Open and Vancouver for the Canadian.
''These competitions helped me greatly,'' he says, ''because I had the
opportunity to play against some of the world's greatest players.''
For, in Scotland, although he has plenty of opportunity to train, it's
hard to find truly competitive games.
His present goal is to represent Britain at the Olympics in Atlanta
next year and he has already played on the courts there. Flockhart has
been included in the British Olympic squad but only two men will play in
the men's singles.
''There are probably four of us in the running,'' he says. The three
others are Englishmen Darren Hall, Peter Knowles, and Anders Nielsen.''
On Saturday he suffered a setback when losing to Knowles in a tight
three-setter in the quarter-finals in Perth.
The two men who are highest in the rankings at the end of April will
automatically be the representatives for Britain. To maintain his
current lead, Flockhart willl have to get his cases out again and travel
to Denmark, Germany, and possibly Korea and Japan to compete at the top
level.
Hopefully, by April he could become the first Scot to represent his
country at badminton at Olympic level.
Badminton has rarely enjoyed much television coverage and so, although
it is played extensively in schools, church halls, and leisure centres,
the leading players are not heroes like Sam Torrance, Gavin Hastings,
and John Collins.
Other Scots heroes have been to the fore recently. The film Rob Roy
has been a box office hit and Braveheart (about William Wallace) is
likely to follow suit.
Bruce and his troops may be up against a formidable English army
tonight but he would be a hero on the scale of his namesake if they
managed to pull off a victory. Whatever happens, he will certainly be
back to fight another day.

EVERYBODY is into fantasy sport these days, where fans in armchairs
get to run the team of their choice via a computer.
But some sporting fantasies are less fanstastic than others. I don't
wish to disparage the qualities of the football played in the northern
reaches of our nation, but the Highland League Dream Team competition
run by the Aberdeen Press and Journal definitely comes into the Haud Me
Back category.
Whereas fantasy football participants in the rest of the land are
splashing out #4m for Gazza[TMK] and #5m for Brian Laudrup, readers up
north are allowed the princely sum of #280,000 to purchase their entire
Dream Team. (Let's hope for Tommy Burns's sake that Fergus McCann
doesn't get any ideas from all of this.)
Top-rated players appear to be keepers Sutter of Brora and Pirie of
Lossiemouth, both rated at #60,000. Big Doug Rougvie, formerly of
Aberdeen and now of Huntly, is one of a few defenders priced at #50,000.
Quality strikers appear to be in short supply with #40,000 being the
top asking price for a chap called Minty of Forres.
North-Eastern Ethnic People (Neeps for short) are renowned for being
careful with their money and will be delighted to see that most of the
candidates are available for only #10,000 each. Which means a canny Neep
could buy his or her entire team for #110,000 and put the remaining
#170,000 into a fantasy building society. And then spend those quiet
Sunday afternoons working out how much fantasy interest was being made
on the money. Much more fun.
In search of its very own fantasy competition, we considered Fantasy
Netball or Dream Lacrosse, but colleague Jack McLean has copyright on
such pursuits.
We would like to launch instead a Fantasy Terracing Tam competition,
based on the performance over the season of selected fans of the teams
in the premier division. The Terracings Tams will win points on the
following basis:
* Attending an away match -- 3 points, 1 for a home match.
* Missing a match because of a court order -- 10 points.
* Attending a match in the middle of winter wearing nothing but the
team top, shorts and trainers -- 5 points.
* Putting the lieges into a state of fear -- 5 points.
* Shoplifting a bottle of wine from the Oddbins shop nearest to the
ground -- 5 points.
* Eating a combination of the burger, the chips with curry sauce, and
the pakora from the fast food stall -- 5 points.
* Shouting constant inane obscenities to the extent that the season
ticket supporter in the seat in front stops coming to matches -- 10
points.
* Using the wife's holiday money to buy shares in the club -- 15
points per 100 shares.
* Having an announcement over the stadium Tannoy telling you to hurry
to Rottenrow Maternity Hospital, where your wife has just had a baby
after 36 hours of painful labour -- 20 points.
Points will be deducted on the following basis:
* Leaving the stadium just because there was an announcement that your
wife has just had a baby after 36 hours of painful labour -- 20 points.
* Being caught shopping with the wife on a Saturday afternoon when
there is no premier division programme but knowing full well that the
reserves were playing -- 5 points.
* Agreeing with the sentiments expressed in your club's official
newspaper -- 5 points.
* Wearing a bobbly hat -- 10 points.
* Going straight home after the match and not having at least 10 beers
with your mates -- 10 points.
* Applauding any exhibition of skill by a player in an opposing team
-- 10 points.
* Using the money you had salted away for the next club share issue to
take your wife away for a winter holiday in the sun -- 20 points.
So how did you score? More than 100 points: you probably look great
with your Gazza haircut and all those tattoos.
No points: congratulations on being a sane person.
Minus 100 points: have you thought of taking part in The Herald's
Fantasy Rugby?
PS: As predicted in this column some weeks ago, Radio Clyde are
struggling to fill the very long hour of a Saturday afternoon when they
are denied access to football action at the Scottish grounds.
Saturday's highlight: Derek Johnstone and Paul Cooney sitting in the
studio doing a telephone interview with Richard Gough, who was home
baby-sitting. As Big Derek said himself during one longueuer: ''The
nights are fair drawing in.''

I TAKE it as correct to address this pointless letter to the Sports
Desk as it concerns the article by Jack McLean on the Cowal Games.
I always rely on Doug Gillon for informed comment on athletics.
The no point of this is that J McLean, when commenting on the winner
of the Games' 3000 metres, said that my son Adrian Callan's training was
assisted by chasing wee boys out of the school playground, as according
to Mr McLean ''Adrian is a school jannie of all things.''
While being a school jannie is a noble profession, I would be grateful
if you would let Adrian's former tutors know that he is still a
management accountant with British Aerospace, and running is an
enjoyable recreation.
If you decide to publish this I would be grateful if you would do so
before Adrian, who left for holiday in France after the Games, returns,
as I am sure this comment means more to his parents than Adrian.

HOCKEY
WORLD Champions, Australia, completed a hat trick of victories over
Great Britain in Sydney yesterday, winning the final game 3-2 to add to
their previous triumphs of 2-1 and 4-1.
For the second Test running Great Britain made the early running and
again they were rewarded with the opening goal through Jane Sixsmith.
Alas, a moment of madness cost Britain dearly. Centre back Karen Brown
was sent to the sin bin in 18 minutes for a deliberate foul when she
played the ball with her stick over her shoulder. While she was off,
Australia equalised through Lisa Powell.
The Australians took com mand after the interval and Powell scored
again in 44 minutes.Susan MacDonald, one of four Scots in the team,
equalised 13 minutes later, showing great composure to beat the
Australian goalkeeper. But in the dying seconds, Alyson Annan picked up
a clearance at a penalty corner to seal Australia's victory.
Susan Fraser, the fifth Scot in the British squad was ruled out of the
match with an ankle injury sustained in Saturday's 2-1 defeat. After
that tussle, British manager Jenny Cardwell protested that Australia had
12 players on the pitch when they scored their winning goal, but the
appeal was dismissed.

TENNIS: US OPEN
STEFFI Graf and Gabriela Sabatini upheld the glory of the old guard
yesterday by racing past a pair of promising new challengers to reach
the quarter-finals of the US Open championships.
The top-seeded Graf pounded American Chanda Rubin 6-2, 6-2, while
ninth seed Sabatini stopped the run of precocious 14-year-old Martina
Hingis of Switzerland 6-2, 6-4.
Graf, the three-time US Open champion and holder of 17 Grand Slam
titles, out-slugged the 19-year-old Rubin, who had posted an impressive
18-5 record since her surprising quarter-final showing at the French
Open.
''I felt I got into the rhythm right early on and I think that helped
me,'' Graf said after the 54-minute rout.
''And she was a little off on her serve and that helped as well.''
Rubin, who had won her first three matches in straight sets, said: ''I
played it wrong. I tried to overpower her. I made too many errors.''
Rubin double-faulted seven times -- twice on break points in the first
set -- and made 31 unforced errors in all.
In a much slower-paced, baseline duel, 1990 Open champion Sabatini
changed speeds and spins on the Swiss teenager and induced 41 errors to
win in one hour 11 minutes.
''It was a very tough match,'' said Sabatini. ''It seemed like every
single point I had to play great tennis.
''She moves so well and she gets everything back and I was changing
the speed of the shots and at some moments that didn't seem to be
bothering her.''
In men's third-round matches, third seed Thomas Muster of Austria
overcame Francisco Clavet of Spain 0-6, 6-4, 6-3, 7-5, eighth-seeded
Michael Stich of Germany beat Australian Scott Draper 6-3, 6-0, 6-3 and
15th-seeded American Todd Martin beat Mauricio Hadad of Colombia 6-2,
6-1, 6-4.
In a clash of unseeded players, Byron Black of Zimbabwe beat Jonas
Bjorkman of Sweden 6-3, 7-6, (7-5), 6-1.

SCOTTISH amateur champion Simon Mackenzie gave a new meaning to the
10-shot rule over his home West Linton course yesterday when he finished
a runaway winner of the South-East District Open.
After having started the day at level par following Saturday's two
rounds, the Edinburgh-based financier cashed in with two superb closing
rounds of 68 and 67 for a three-under-par total of 273, 10 strokes clear
of the field.
Nearest challenger on 283 was East Renfrewshire's Craig Watson, who
celebrated his call-up to the Scotland team for the home internationals
in Portrush with a best-of-the-day 66 in the final round. Leading
aggregates (including two final rounds):
273 -- S Mackenzie (West Linton) 68, 67. 283 -- C Watson (East

Euro title to her haul with a four-under-par aggregate of 284, one
stroke ahead of France's Ariane Pascalie. Both finished with rounds of
71. Ratcliffe tied for third place on 289 with Spain's Ana Belen
Sanchez. Leading aggregates:

Kevin Flanagan by the same margin.
* TEN-handicapper Kieran Gallagher produced one of the rounds of his
life at Craigie Hill yesterday to win the Perth and Kinross Youths
Strokeplay championship.
The Craigie Hill member carded a five-over-par 71, which tied him with

Barron (Craigie Hill). 73 -- D Wilson (Craigie Hill), bih; C Barr

Leven yesterday with a one-under-par aggregate of 141.
Swan set himself up for victory with a two-under-par 69 in the opening
round and his 72 in the afternoon was sufficient for a three-stroke
victory over Cupar's Brian Heggie. Leading aggregates:
141 -- S Swan (Thornton) 69, 72. 144 -- B Heggie (Cupar) 75, 69. 145

Scratch: 140 -- C Riddick (Dumfries &amp; Galloway) 70, 70. 151 -- C Clark

home internationals in Portrush in three weeks' time by leading the
North Youths team to a 9-6 victory over their North-East counterparts at
Buckpool yesterday.
* POLICEMAN Henry Anderson booked a notable double at Falkirk on
Saturday, when his level-par 70 was enough to give him top prize in the
scratch section of the Stirlingshire Autumn Meeting.
The Callander member, who pipped home club player Graeme Gardiner by a
stroke, also won the Stirlingshire District's spring meeting at
Glenbervie in April. Leading scores:
Scratch: 70 -- H Anderson (Callander). 71 -- G Gardiner (Falkirk).
Handicap: 66 -- P Jenkins (Grangemouth, 11). 68 -- A Blair (Campsie,
12), bih; C McIntosh Jr (Polmont, 6). 69 -- R Stewart (Campsie, 8), bih;

Gardiner (Tobermory, 10).
* NORMAN Kelly, of Hilton Park, had to rely on a better last six holes
to see of the challenge of Windyhill's Mark Britton and win the
Dumbartonshire Autumn Meeting at his home club on Saturday. Both players
returned net 67s, but Kelly's stronger finish clinched top prize. In the
scratch section, Milngavie's Calum Dunan took the honours with a 69.
Leading scores:
Handicap: 67 -- N Kelly (Hilton Park, 2), bl6; M Britton (Windyhill,
4). 68 -- M Hamilton (Douglas Park, 11). 70 -- K Smyth (Windyhill, 3),

THE quality of competition yesterday in the final round of the Bank of
Scotland Scottish Women's Athletic League may have been below par at the
end of a tiring season, but nails were bitten as frantically as if
Olympic gold, and not just promotion and relegation, had been at stake.
JGB Central survived the loss of 60 points, forfeit for allegedly not
providing sufficient officials, and made an appeal academic with a
landslide win in the division-two match at Crownpoint to clinch
promotion to the top flight after an absence of two years. Edinburgh AC,
in one of the two relegation slots at the beginning of the day, fought
past Minolta Black Isle and Nithsdale who drop to division three.
Arbroath's 19-year-old heptathlon internationalist, Sarah Ramminger,
was the leading individual, winning four senior events -- 200m
(27.3sec), 100m hurdles (16.3), long jump (5.21m) and triple jump
(9.95m).
But it was a commentary on senior performances that the under-17 100m
was won by Mairi McEwen (Victoria Park) in 13.1 -- faster than senior
winner Nicola Thomson (EAC, 13.4).
Kilbarchan and Falkirk Victoria come up to division two, while Ayr
Seaforth and Lochgelly are promoted from division four. Details:
Division 2 (Crownpoint). Match result: 1, JGB Central 367[1/2]; 2,
Edinburgh AC 311[1/2]; 3, Arbroath and District 296; 4, Victoria Park

placings: 1, Central 17 (promoted); 2, Victoria Park 14; 3, Arbroath 11;
4, EAC 10; 5, MBI 8; 6, Nithsdale 3 (last two relegated).
Division 3 (Coatbridge). Match result: 1, Kilbarchan 426; 2, Falkirk
Victoria 384; 3, Perth Strathtay) 325; 4, Fife 261; 5, Tayside 219; 6,
Helensburgh 88. Final placings: 1, Kilbarchan 17; 2, Falkirk Victoria 16

* JEAN Clark (Milton Keynes) broke the Scottish national record for
the hammer at an open graded meeting at Verlea. The 26-year-old thrower
went reached 50.12m, adding 34cm to her own record.
* VIKKI McPherson, leading Scot in the Great Scottish Run last month
in Glasgow, yesterday won the British 10,000 metres road race title at
Cardiff. The Commonwealth Games team captain finished in 33min 56sec,
just nine seconds clear of another Scottish internationalist, Karen
Macleod.
But accountant McPherson was denied a second title when the team
result added up one short -- her club, City of Glasgow, finished
runners-up, just one point behind Newport. Audrey Sym was fifth and
Jackie Thomson twent-third for Glasgow. Details:
Men: 1, P Taylor (Borders) 29-03; 2, C Kelong (Kenya) 29-11; 3, D
Lauchlin (Chelmsford) 29-15. Team: 1, Bridgend 60 points; 2, Swansea 63;
3, Westbury 90. Women: 1, V McPherson (CoG) 33-56; 2, K McLeod
(Edinburgh AC) 34-05; 3, C Mijovic (Birchfield) 34-28. Team: 1, Newport
28; 2, GoG 29; 3 Bridgend 40.
* SCOTTISH age-group champion, Alasdair Donaldson, from Pitreavie, set
a personal best of 1min 49.9sec when leading a junior select team to a
record-breaking victory in the British Milers Club Relay Meeting at
Oxford.
Donaldson, semi-finalist in the recent European Junior Championships
in Hungary, was fastest in the squad which won in 7-26.2 to better the
UK junior 4 x 800m record by nine seconds. Ian Gillespie recorded 4-04.0
for his mile stage in the international team which won the 4 x 1-mile
relay in 16-28.0.

MURRAYFIELD Royals showed they're learning fast despite going down to
Scottish arch-rivals Fife Flyers for the second time in eight days.
Flyers routed Royals 14-3 in the Benson and Hedges Cup at Kirkcaldy, but
last night Royals showed real fighting qualities.
They eventually went down 8-4, but earlier had fought back from a 4-1
first period deficit to be only 4-3 behind at the second break.
Three goals in six minutes at the start of the third stanza finally
broke Royals' resolve, but even the Fife fans clapped the inexperienced
Royals off the ice at the end.
On Saturday, Flyers made heavy weather of a 10-7 victory over
Blackburn Hawks who held a surprise 6-5 lead at the end of the second in
an entertaining tussle.
Five goals in 16 minutes in the third turned the game in favour of the
home side who will have to up a gear when the premier division starts
next month.
Flyers, however, remain on course for a slot in the Benson and Hedges
Cup quarter-finals. In the autumn trophy Flyers' former coach, Jim
Lynch, steered his new club, Dumfries Vikings, to their third straight
victory last night.
Vikings routed Billingham Bombers 14-3 in England and on Saturday beat
Solihull Barons 9-3 on their own ice.

SCOTTISH COUNTIES
THE elements -- assisted by a midweek decision by the Scottish County
Cricket Board -- conspired for the second season in a row to decide the
tenancy of the Caley 80/- counties' league title on Saturday.
Outgoing champions Strathmore had to remain indoors because of the
weather on the final day of last season. West Lothian, the new holders,
also had no work to do at McKane Park, Dunfermline, as their match
against Fifeshire was rained off.
It was the same story up and down the country as the weather
forecasters for once got it wrong. The cloud and scattered showers
predicted instead turned into a continuous downpour.
There are still mutterings about the Linlithgow club's overall
victory. Last Saturday, Aberdeenshire led the league, but after the
inquiry about them failing to fulfil a fixture at Boghall on August 12
finally went against them, the 25 points awarded to West Lothian as a
result put them on top.
Aberdeenshire will not allow the matter to rest. They have lodged an
appeal with the Scottish Cricket Union, and a spokesman added yesterday
that ''the content of the appeal will take about a week to put
together.''
However, it must be said that West Lothian, all season, have been one
of the most consistent and attacking sides in the league. As Gordon
Hollins, who will be leaving for pastures new, said: ''We chase every
game. We want victory.''
Skipper Steve Crawley summed up his side's strength yesterday. ''We
have 11 cricketers. Every one of them in the first team has hit a
century at some time in their careers. We have been very consistent
throughout the season.''
One irony for Crawley is that, as sales director for The Caledonian
Brewing Company Ltd in Edinburgh -- it was he who arranged the
sponsorship -- technically, he will have to present the trophy to
himself at the annual dinner. ''I'm sure we'll make other
arrangements,'' he said wryly.
It is West Lothian's first title since 1984, and if, as expected, the
new Scottish Cricket League goes ahead next season, it will be the last
counties' title to be won.
The new league of 10 is expected to consist of West Lothian,
Aberdeenshire, Strathmore, Ayrshire and Arbroath County being joined by
the East League's Heriot's, Grange, Carlton, Freuchie and Watsonians. It
should be quite a competition.

THE NATWEST FINAL:
A MOST commendable batting performance by Roger Twose and a highly
assured innings from man-of-the-match Dermot Reeve had a calming effect
on Warwickshire when they looked precariously close to disintegrating.
But the experience of captain Reeve saw the Midlands team achieve
their third NatWest Trophy victory -- comfortably, as it turned out, by
four wickets against Northamptonshire, and with seven balls to spare.
For the second year in succession, this one-day showpiece of the year
became a bit of an anticlimax. The weather had its say on Saturday, with
a capacity Lord's crowd of 28,000 watching a steady drizzle until the
start at 3pm.
Inevitably, the ball seamed around when play eventually got under way,
and consequently, the exhibition of stroke-play that one would expect to
enjoy on an occasion such as this was conspicuously absent. Instead,
there was a spectacular display of ground fielding from Warwickshire's
Rhodesian-born -- but England qualified -- Trevor Penney. His running
out of Tony Penberthy from a direct hit, from point, was straight out of
the Jonty Rhodes Book of Fielding. He could have had only one stump to
aim at from that side-on position.
Northamptonshire had their victory hopes in this final severely dented
by Warwickshire's South African signing, Allan Donald.
He showed from the lively opening overs that the general belief that
he is easily among the top fast bowlers in world cricket is not without
justification. He began the slide of the early Northants innings with
the removal of Richard Montgomerie with a ball that seamed into him to
send the bails flying. It was only the fifth over and there were just
four runs on the board.
Northants were not given much space to recover from the early shock
with Doug Brown striking twice on 39. The second blow was as damaging
psychologically as it was to the innings. It accounted for the wicket of
Allan Lamb, for nought, in his last of seven years as captain.
Rob Bailey played several perfectly timed cuts and powerful drives for
his side's top score of 44. Donald returned to the attack to reduce
Northants to 128 for six and later, after he bowled Snape, it was
decided that the light, on Saturday evening, was not good enough to face
his speed. Eight of the remaining nine balls in Northants' innings --
carried over to yesterday -- were sufficient to bring the innings to an
end on a 200 total, which seemed far from enough in a 60-over match.
It was obviously uppermost in the minds of Northamptonshire's bowlers
that they didn't have much on the board to bowl at.
Left-armer Paul Taylor responded in earnest, removing both openers
with 14 on the board, and when Penberthy had Brown caught behind, the
Midlanders were in strife. Dominic Ostler, dropped on 11, in Penberthy's
first over, was beaten by the nip off the pitch from Anil Kumble's leg
spin after repairing the innings with 45.
When Penberthy claimed his second victim on 122, half of the
Warwickshire side was back in the pavilion and with 15.2 overs
remaining, the game was in the balance.
There was an uneasy lull for Warwickshire as runs dried up and 14
overs went by before a boundary was struck. Twose, dropped on 6, brought
up his third 50 in three consecutive NatWest matches this year.
Reeve, on 4, survived a confident leg before appeal by Kumble, and
then a lobbed catching chance from Twose to wicketkeeper Russell Warren
fell just out of reach. The batsmen crossed for a run and Reeve would
have departed, well short of his crease, if the throw had not missed the
stumps by a fraction.
By the time Twose was run out for 68 from 127 deliveries, his side had
made considerable ground. But there was still some work left for Reeve.
He rose to the task, striking five boundaries, four from his last nine
balls. In hitting 37 from 47 deliveries, he guided Warwickshire to
triumph with expert perception.

BRANSTON Abby, who made a remarkable transition from handicap to Group
1 status when a close second to Cherokee Rose in the Haydock Park Sprint
Cup, may now miss Saturday's Ayr Gold Cup.
The filly, 14-1 second favourite for the Western Meeting highlight,
now is more likely to run in a Group event later in the year.
''After Saturday we will have to review all the possibilities,'' said
trainer Mark Johnston. ''We would rather run her in a Group race. It
would be great to win the Ayr Gold Cup, but it pales into insignificance
compared to winning a group race, and we have to think of the filly.''
Johnston has two other possible runners on Saturday, Double Blue, last
year's favourite, and Loveyoumillions, who has little form to date.
''He will meet Branston Abby's owner David Abell tomorrow when a
decision on her next race will be made,'' said Johnston, ''It will
depend on what group races are available to her.''
Branston Abby, winner of a rated handicap at York, ran a tremendous
race to finish only a length and a half behind Cherokee Rose, with 1-3
favourite Lake Coniston, in fourth place.
Johnson was ''absolutely delighted'' by his filly's performance
although he was not at Haydock to see the race. The Scot was at The
Curragh where his two-year-old Bijou D'Inde took the Group 3 Futurity
Stakes.
The colt is owned by Stuart Morrision, a Glasgow solicitor, whose
Quick Ransom -- now in Australia -- won several good handicaps.
* MARTIN Pipe has strengthened his hand for a possible bid to go
through the card at Exeter on Wednesday.
The trainer has multiple entries in all races and added Toomuch
Toosoon to the novices' handicap chase when the race was re-opened at
the weekend.
Pipe came within one of becoming the first trainer in Britain to win
every race at a meeting on the same course four years ago.
All Wednesday's races have attracted healthy entries and Philip Hobbs,
who has the in-form quartet of Henley Wood, Blue Raven, The Country
Trader, and Distant Memory all entered in different races, could present
a serious obstacle to Pipe.

WORCESTERSHIRE drew level with Kent at the top of the AXA Equity &amp; Law
League today with a comfortable 68-run win over Somerset at New Road.
Tom Moody's side, who finished runners-up last season, registered
their fifth successive win thanks to a fine all-round display by Graeme
Hick.
The England player top-scored with 72 out of 174 for seven and then
weighed in with a competition-best four for 21 as Somerset were
dismissed for 106.
Lancashire stayed in touch thanks to a six-wicket win over Surrey at
The Oval, with Wasim Akram making his mark on his final appearance of
the season.
Wasim took three for 30 to help restrict Surrey to 189 for nine, and
beat Ian Austin's Lancashire Sunday record of 29 wickets in a season.

WOMEN'S RUGBY
A 12-0 win over East in the deciding match gave North the Keyline
women's inter-district championship title yesterday at Riccarton.
North, with an early interception try by the Scotland captain Kim
Littlejohn, and a further touchdown by scrum half Ruth Thomas converted
by Rima Lewis, who played for Russia in the 1993 World Cup, were the
outstanding side in the two day tournament.
On Saturday, after drawing 8-8 with the Exiles, North went on to
defeat South 25-0 and yesterday trounced West 32-0. Results:
Keyline women's inter district championship -- North 8, Exiles 8;
South 0, East 0; West 0, Exiles 3; North 25, South 0; East 12, West 0;

NORTHERLY winds of up to 25 knots proved ideal for record breaking
Scottish Two Handed Races around Arran and the Holy Isle. Fergus and
Neil Crawford graduated from having won the Best Young Crew award in
previous years to yesterday lift the main trophy for the 80-mile Race 1
around Arran in the Westerly Tailor Maid.
The brisk spinnaker conditions followed by a stiff beat home to Largs
favoured the heavier boats as the breeze continuously built from astern
on the west side of Arran.
On the shorter 40-mile race around Holy Isle, Gordon Aikman's Moody
336 Scanne triumphed, holding off Jim Donaldson in the Melges 24
Tunnock's Teacake, by just half a minute.
* A SPRINT finish to the third leg of the Teachers' Round Britain
Challenge was won in Hartlepool yesterday by the Welsh boat Pride of
Cardiff, skippered by Richard Tudor.
The breeze filled substantially from the east latterly, favouring the
boats offshore. Scotland's Paul Jeffes in Lord Inverforth and Jon
Fitzgerald in Glendronach took third and fourth places repectively and
still lie second overall. Results:
Teachers' Round Britain Challenge, Rothesay to Hartlepool -- 1, Wales
I (R Tudor); 2, England II (D Alan-Williams); 3, Scotland I (P Jeffes);
4, Scotland II (J Fitzgerald); 5, Ireland II (D Harte); 6, Wales II (C
Lyons); 7, Ireland I (D Gomes); 8, England I (V Cherry); 9, France III

Scottish Two Handed Race round Arran -- 1, Tailor Maid (F and N

STEVE Hislop was crowned British Superbike champion after winning the
two latests races in the series at the Brands Hatch track yesterday.
The Scot, who rides a Ducati, comfortably raced to victory each time
knowing he was already assured of the British Supercup 95 series title,
with his main rival, James Whitham, absent because he is starting a
battle against cancer.
Yorkshire's Whitham was the early season leader in a race-by-race duel
with Hislop, who knows his championship success may be viewed in some
quarters as hollow in the circumstances.
''One or two people will knock me for winning the title when Jamie was
not here so it's nice to get the wins and be a worthy champion,'' said
Hislop after his double triumph.
Local man Terry Rymer, standing in for an injured rider, gave the
Castrol Honda team its best Supercup results of the year with two second
places.
But runner-up in the championship was Leicester's Matt Llewellyn, who
overhauled Whitham's points tally with third places in both races to
clinch second spot.

Clydebank 1, Dundee 1
BRIAN Wright, the Clydebank coach, certainly is not one to observe a
silence of lambs, and as far as his young side dancing with wolves in
the first division this season is concerned, he is reasonably confident
that a few clubs will suffer. There will be no messing about in this
league.
Which is why he had a dig -- again -- at the missing television
cameras when the premier division had a day off on Saturday. And he was
quite right when he said: ''That was a good game out there, plenty of
goalmouth incidents. Of course, there were mistakes, but that's what
makes the game exciting.
''You certainly don't get perfection in the first division, but you do
get excitement. Every team I've seen in this league this season has
tried to play football.
''Dundee are a good side. They came at us and helped to make a game of
it.''
Dens Park manager Jim Duffy thought otherwise about his own men. ''We
were crap,'' was his opening remark. He made no attempt to disguise the
disappointment about his side's performance after their midweek cup
turnover of premier division Kilmarnock, which should have had them on a
high.
''We play this game at speed. The ball must be delivered at speed.
That did not happen today. They just did not seem to be interested,''
said Duffy.
To take just one example, that wee bundle of talent, Neil McCann,
showed what he could do with his speed and agility. When he decided to
have a go, the Bankies' defence struggled to cope. Unfortunately for
Dundee, he did not do that often enough.
Young Jim Hamilton worked really hard and got his reward when he put
Dundee ahead after 71 minutes -- just 10 minutes after the Bankies
seemed to have been denied a stonewall penalty, when James Grady was
sent sprawling by Roddy Manley in the penalty area.
Hamilton got on the end of a Kevin Bain cross from the right and
volleyed a left-foot shot past keeper Gary Matthews.
He hit the ball so hard that his left boot was damaged, and he
signalled his bench to get him another one. It was here that red tape
could have altered the game. As Bankies hit back, the stand-side
linesman, a Mr McGuire from Bishopbriggs, could have swung the game.
As the replacement boot was thrown on to the park, Mr McGuire, under
the gaze of referee supervisor Kenny Hope, flagged for the referee's
attention while the game was buzzing on the other side of the park with
Bankies attacking Dundee.
Technically he was correct in that Hamilton's new boot studs had to be
checked, but surely commonsense should have prevailed. For example, wait
for a break in the action -- but, think about it, what professional in
his right mind would don a boot with dangerous studs?
Maybe the fact that the SFA's so-called three wise men of the
Independent Review Commission -- Ernie Walker, Tony Higgins on behalf of
the players, and Martin Rose on behalf of the supporters -- were there
also influenced Mr McGuire's thinking.
The trio must have been impressed at the style as well as the standard
of football, backing up coach Wright's views. Mistakes there certainly
were, and Graeme Connell's equaliser five minutes from time certainly
was the reason Dundee manager Duffy was fuming.
Gary Bowman is a hot handful for any defender and it was one of his
strong runs down the left which led to the goal. A combination of
ball-watching, mild panic, and attempts to clear suddenly left young
Connell with a sight at goal. As he said later: ''All I thought about
was keeping the ball down. There was no-one more delighted than me when
it hit the back of the net.''
Connell is one of Wright's young lambs who could become more of a lion
before the end of the season. The lad, from nearby Yoker, had a spell
with Ipswich after having left Clydebank Boys' Club. He was doing fine
under manager John Lyle, but when George Burley arrived things did not
work out and he was freed.
He is delighted to be back at Kilbowie, and even more delighted with
his first goal for the club.
Duffy, meanwhile, will be having a few more words with his men during
training this week. Four points behind leaders Dunfermline already at
this stage of the season is not good news.
Another guest at the game was Partick Thistle chairman Jim Oliver.
After recent events, he was a little unlucky in that the local wags
reckoned that the last person he wanted to see was Clydebank centre half
Tom Currie.
* DUNFERMLINE have failed in a #150,000 bid to sign striker Gerry
Britton from Dundee.
The injury-hit East End Park club, currently leading the first
division, wanted free-scoring Britton to boost their promotion
prospects.
But Dundee manager Jim Duffy knocked back the deal because he needs
the former Celt to sustain his own side's push for a place in the
premier division.

Dumbarton 0, Dunfermline 4
JIM Fallon must be wondering if he did the right thing in taking the
job as manager of Dumbarton.If anything, this defeat showed him just
what a task he agreed to take on an hour before kick-off.
Dumbarton started brightly enough. Roland Fabiani made surging runs
down the left. Martin Mooney jinked with menace. Sam McGivern, who is
player-coach under the new arrangements, rounded Andy Tod.
Then the alarm bells sounded when Dunfermline's Stewart Petrie struck
a post.
On the half hour, the game turned. Suddenly, the Sons were rumbled and
Dunfermline's innate superiority became obvious.
Ivo Den Biemen, the outstanding visitor, powered down the right,
crossed to Jackie McNamara, and the rout was on. The Sons never had a
chance.
Largely unhindered, Dunfermline went on to score another three madcap
goals.
Greg Shaw got the second when he punished an attempted pass-back by
Jim Marsland. Then Stevie Gow turned a cross by Den Biemen into his own
net.
The fourth capped all. Goalkeeper Ian MacFarlane thought the game had
stopped for offside. Throwing the ball out for a kick to be taken, he
put it straight to Petrie who slotted it into the net with thanks.
Afterwards, Dunfermline manager Bert Paton said he was more pleased
with the amount of goals than the performance. ''We just churned away,''
he said.
Whenever Jackie McNamara was on the ball the churning was in jig time.
His conversion from full back to inside forward is proceeding nicely and
Paton is delighted with the help he is receiving from Paul Smith
alongside him.
Without a league goal against them, Dunfermline's mixture of
experience and youth is looking formidable.
The last word went to Jim Fallon. As he sipped a welcome cup of tea,
he asked: ''Does anybody fancy swopping jobs?''

Airdrie 1, St Mirren 2
TO look at most of the St Mirren players as they filed out of
Broadwood early on Saturday evening, one was surprised not to find a
parent or guardian waiting to help them on with their jackets and lead
them away by the hand.
Some do not look old enough to shave, but according to their leader,
Jimmy Bone, the time has come for the Love Street gang to start repaying
the faith and no little patience placed in them by Bone and his buddies.
''All the young ones have been together now for three years with
perhaps between 70 and 80 games under their belts, so perhaps now the
penny's beginning to drop,'' said the St Mirren manager.
That certainly appeared to be the case at the weekend with this
victory against Airdrie. There were some delightful moves by the players
in red shirts, close control, and linking in difficult, underfoot
conditions, with two such passages of play culminating in goals from
Alex Bone and substitute Barry Lavety, whose thumping effort cancelled
out a headed equaliser from Steve Cooper.
The away stand erupted into much gaiety when the ball hit the Airdrie
nets, and it was strange to remember that Jimmy Bone had not had his
critics to seek for some time, but what chumps the manager could soon
make the doubters look because, as Bone claims, the Paisley club is
something of a mine and he has still some more gems to unearth.
''We are a young team, but the next batch is going to be even
better,'' said Bone with a smile. He then went on to name the guys who
will bring the good times back to St Mirren, headed by Ricky Gillies,
who must have trod on every blade of grass at Broadwood.
''I thought he was exceptional,'' said the striker's leader. ''He
worked very hard and showed his qualities. They could never pin him down
and this would have done his confidence the world of good.''
The arrival of Bobby Law should help the youngsters, too. The former
Partick Thistle player is enjoying a ''breath of fresh air'' at his
rebirth in new surroundings, claiming that: ''I have learned more here
in a few months than I did under John Lambie at Thistle.''
There was no element of bitterness in Law's words, more admiration for
the direction in which he is now being aimed. He admits his experience
could come in very handy in the months ahead. ''I was never a talker on
the park at Firhill,'' said Law, ''but the last year in Thistle's
reserves has changed that.''
Spare a thought, though, for Airdrie. When you were tucking into the
bacon and eggs yesterday morning while glancing through the Sundays,
manager Alex MacDonald had them galloping around a cold, damp field on
extra training duties. Who said a footballer's life is all glamour?

St Johnstone 0, Morton 2
MORTON manager Allan McGraw is thinking of more than mere survival in
the cut-throat first division.
Afer a Derek Lilley double secured the Greenock club's first win of
the season, McGraw insisted that last term's second division champions
could continue their upwardly mobile progress in the coming months.
''The good thing about this league is that everyone thinks they are
capable of beating each other. We may not be favourites but we will give
teams a fright,'' said McGraw.
''I think we are capable of getting promotion. We have to hold on to
our better players and we intend to do that, unless someone offers us a
ridiculous price. We certainly aren't looking to sell.''
McGraw and St Johnstone manager Paul Sturrock agreed the pattern of
the game was set in 17 minutes, when Perth defender Kevin McGowne was
sent after a linesman spotted an off-the-ball clash with Lilley.
Sturrock, whose side have failed to net in three League games, branded
McGowne's retaliation as ''utter stupidity'' and said the player would
be fined.
Several Perth players, however, queried why Lilley escaped with a
caution for his part in the confrontation.
The Morton striker, who slammed home a sixth minute opener and secured
victory in 81 minutes, insisted: ''I didn't play much of a part in it.
The defender wasn't very happy, but he knows what he did. The referee
and linesman got it right.''
Allan McGraw admitted: ''The ordering off was crucial. They dominated
the game at times, even with 10 men, and we had a few scary moments. We
aren't a good defensive team and I wanted us to push forward more often.
Fortunately, Derek Lilley's finishing was clinical.''
Saints manager Sturrock lamented second-half openings scorned by
midfielder Gary Farquhar and substitute Kevin Twaddle.
He said: ''Even with 10 men we had chances to take something from the
game. But we can't keep making excuses -- it's up to the players to turn
this around.''
The failure of twin strikers George O'Boyle -- a Northern Ireland
international -- and former Partick player Roddy Grant to get off the
mark, will be troubling the Perth manager, who also knows that centre
forward Ian Ferguson won't be available for two months after a cartilage
operation.

Dundee Utd 2, Hamilton 1
THEY played quite well, the crowd gave them sincere backing, and the
stadium looked splendid, but the overwhelming sensation as we watched
United win at home for the first time in the first division was one of
trepidation on their behalf.
0 It is a mammoth job Billy Kirkwood is tackling. This might well be
the most important season his club has ever faced, one which could
determine a return to the fringe of the good times or result in a
further, indeterminate exile.
The good form of Dunfermline, one of their main rivals for the title,
ought to serve as a reminder of what can happen when the wheels come
off. The Fife side have been shooting the promotion and relegation
rapids for the past couple of decades without ever recapturing their
peak status.
Unless United make great strides very quickly, they could face a
similar banishment to the outside courts.
United's main flaw against the Accies was lack of penetration. They
were helped by the reduction of the opposition numbers after Crawford
Baptie was sent off almost at half-time. The defender got involved in
one of those elbow-flying contests with Scott Crabbe and then seemed to
react with his head when the two continued their tete-a-tete.
Either way, he deserved to go, as his manager, Iain Munro -- to his
credit -- conceded, even if he felt that Crabbe was lucky only to be
booked. Kirkwood didn't think his man deserved even that.
The consequence of Baptie's departure was a committed defensive
pattern, rather than the enforced one of the first half, by Hamilton,
who had done well during that opening period to contain the home side.
They had also snatched a fine goal when John McQuade volleyed the ball
home from a Gary Clark cross.
United came back in good style, with Alan McLaren and Robbie Winters
doing well on the flanks, especially after Paddy Connolly came on for
Grant Johnson, and, in the end, scored the goals they needed to win.
The equaliser was a touch bizarre. Steven Pressley's header was
heading for goal when Accies' Steve Thomson stuck out a foot and sent
the ball against the far post from where it rolled along and eventually
over the line. Was it an own goal or Pressley's strike? The arguments
raged on in the press box. Pressley, naturally, took the credit, but I'd
have to opt for the own-goal lobby.
The winner had no such ambiguity. McLaren came racing in from the left
and shot hard against keeper David Cormack. When the ball came out it
hit, or was hit by, Connolly and went over the line.
For Kirkwood, the win, naturally, was welcome. ''Our defence was okay,
but we did not have enough threat up front,'' he said. ''If we can get
the players we are chasing, we should be in a better position.''
Kirkwood has a tough task ahead but there are signs of encouragement.

RUSSIAN striker Oleg Salenko came under the critical gaze of friend
and foe on Saturday as he made his first appearance in an Old Firm
match.
Even though this was a reserve team clash, Salenko must have wondered
what he was letting himself in for as 20,148 turned out to watch John
Brown get the winner for the Ibrox side. That was more than the
attendance at the entire first and second division programme.
The verdict on Salenko will have to wait, for everyone agreed he is
not yet match fit.
Rangers' #6.5m reserve side had to thank the spirited Brown -- now a
coach at Ibrox -- for their win. He threw himself to an Ian Durrant
corner to head the only goal.
Celtic fielded a young side which included Paul Dalglish -- son of
Kenny -- and coach Frank Connor said: ''It was a great experience for
our youngsters.''

THIRD DIVISION
A SCORE of 4-2 in favour of the home team is just about perfect in
terms of entertainment and a happy ending. There were 1471 fans at
Dingwall on Saturday and you can be sure that all of them went home
happy and will want to be back.
Their satisfaction is reinforced by the fact that Ross County are top
of the third division with maximum points, and on Saturday the fans were
treated to a stirring comeback victory over Arbroath inspired by winger
Billy Ferries.
Johnston Bellshaw had opened for County with a header, but David Pew
turned it Arbroath's way with a brace just before the interval.
Enter Ferries to set up goals for Jamie MacPherson and Colin Milne in
quick succession around the hour mark, with Gordon Connelly heading in a
cross from the winger with 14 minutes left.
County just missed promotion last term and so did East Stirlingshire,
but the Falkirk side's fortunes are vastly different so far in the
current campaign. They were on the wrong end of a 4-2 scoreline at
Cowdenbeath which leaves 'Shire at the foot of the table, without a
point.
Amazingly, they opened and completed the scoring all in the space of
36 minutes. But Stephen McLean's double for 'Shire was eclipsed by a hat
trick for former Junior internationalist David Scott, with last season's
top scorer Mark Yardley also on target for the Fifers.
The indignity of bottom place in the table is compounded by having to
look up to Albion Rovers. They and visitors Caley Thistle got off the
mark by sharing the points at Cliftonhill. An Alan Hercher lob put Caley
ahead but Joe McBride levelled with a 20-yard free kick. A Hercher
header restored the lead before the break and it was only in the final
minute that Gordon Young hit a second equaliser for Rovers.
Brechin City lost their unbeaten record and were joined on the
six-point mark by Alloa. The Wasps took the points through Barry
Moffat's goal after 19 minutes.

SECOND DIVISION:
STEVE Archibald's East Fife demonstrated on Saturday that you don't
need to have the ball to influence the outcome of a game. A 2-0 win away
to Stirling Albion gave the Fifers maximum points after three games and
they have yet to concede a goal.
This encounter could have been subtitled ''Operation Closedown'' by
Archibald's men. Fresh from their Ibrox exploits in which they gave
Rangers a fright with two late goals, Stirling attracted a crowd of
almost 1000 to Forthbank with hopes of a strong follow-up performance.
The main worry had been that the Stirling legs might be tired after
their midweek exertions, but there were few signs of that problem.
Albion just never really got going and that was mostly because they were
denied time and space to build up from the back and in midfield.
East Fife, meanwhile, were posing some threats themselves. An
Archibald back-header hit the bar before David Beaton opened with a
30-yard free-kick midway in the first half when his powerful shot was
fumbled by home keeper Mark McGeown. Nine minutes from the break a
corner on the right by substitute Benny Andrew was headed powerfully in
at the far corner by defender John Cusick.
Stirling came closest when a Steve McCormick header was saved
one-handed by Lindsay Hamilton, and Craig Taggart's 30-yard shot shaved
the top of the bar. But Kevin Drinkell's team were unable to change the
pattern and the Fifers mostly maintained their stranglehold.
Superb leading up by David Bingham set up Alan Morgan's early goal for
the only score of Forfar's game against Stenhousemuir, but the other
results were much more clear-cut.
Berwick took their tally to seven goals in two games with a 4-1
victory at Ayr, where home player-manager Simon Stainrod came in for
more stick from the Somerset Park fans.
A John Sharples header equalised the first of Willie Irvine's two
goals, but Ayr were still in the match, even after Alan Banks converted
a penalty early in the second half. However, Irvine followed his earlier
free kick with a headed goal 13 minutes from time and Paul Rutherford
added a fourth to ensure that the Ayr fans remained disgruntled.
The only team worse off than Ayr are newly-promoted Montrose, who are
still pointless after a 4-1 rout at Stranraer. After four games without
a goal, Alex McAnespie's team made amends in style, with Lex Grant's
double from two lobs being the most encouraging feature.
Clyde got back on the rails with a 3-0 win at Dumfries. Charlie
Nicholas opened for them in 18 minutes and their task was made easier
when Queen of the South's John McLaren was sent off early in the second
half. Eddie Annand and Tommy Harrison took advantage in the final
quarter.

JUNIORS
THE Abercorn Builders' Cup took centre stage in the Central Region on
Saturday.
The surprise result of the day in the competition was the 5-3 defeat
of Shettleston by Yoker Athletic. Ten-man Shettleston, following the
dismissal of central defender Paul Maher, raced to a 3-1 lead early in
the second half. They then lost the other half of their central
defensive pair, 'Budgie' McGhie, with a facial injury and Yoker took
control.
Kirkintilloch Rob Roy's fate was sealed after 10 minutes when Pollok's
Kevin Flynn and Jim Jamieson capitalised on defensive blunders to put
them 2-0 ahead.
Rob Roy's McLachlan scored to put Rob Roy back in the game but Pollok
held on to reach the semi-final, in which they will travel to meet
Maryhill, who struggled to beat a plucky Coltness United. In the
remaining tie Blantyre Vics beat Baillieston 4-3 and now meet Yoker.
There were goals galore in the Reebok league with Arthurslie and
Petershill starting off their campaigns in style. Hat tricks from Billy
McCafferty and Rocky Crichton helped Arthurlie to an 8-1 victory over
Cambuslang Rangers. Petershill went one better by beating Dunipace 9-0,
with Derek Kennedy netting four.
Cumnock reached the final of the Scarlett Cup with the help of two
penalties by Robert Irvine against Darvel.
Cup-holders Kilbirnie, undefeated this season, struggled to beat
Irvine Meadow in their quarter-final.
Most surprising result of the day was Maybole's 2-1 defeat of Alan
Rough's Glenafton. It was Glenafton who went ahead in 18 minutes with a
Billy Mullen strike. Maybole equalised just before half time with a John
Miller own goal and with eight minutes to go substitute Brian Dunn,
headed the winner to give Maybole a lucrative semi-final tie against
Cumnock.
Ardeer, arguably the most improved team in Ayrshire, had a convincing
3-1 win over Dalry.
In the East Region, Camelon suffered their first defeat of the season
at the hands of the newly-promoted Harthill.
The draw for the quarter-final of the Skol League Cup threw up some
interesting ties: Armadale v Ormiston; Bonnrigg v Linlithgow,
Newtongrange v Whitburn and Camelon v Livingston.
The draw for the first round of the West of Scotland Whyte &amp; Mackay

WORLD FOOTBALL:
UWE Seeler will undertake a challenge as great as any in his
illustrious career when he returns to SV Hamburg next month. By
appointing their former striker as president, Hamburg hope he will
achieve what his one-time team-mate Franz Beckenbauer has managed at
Bayern Munich.
Since Aberdeen beat Hamburg in the Super Cup more than a decade ago,
their fortunes have steadily gone downhill.
Seeler, their best-ever player, still enjoys legendary status in
northern Germany and his first task will be to unite the fractious
elements within the club.
Equally important, he must address the bribery allegations made by
ex-Hamburg keeper Uli Stein. He claims that on June 17, 1987, he and
another un-named player were offered bribes to throw a league game to
Kaiserslautern, so ensuring qualification for Europe.
Hamburg won 4-0 and Stein says the financial inducements were
rejected. Nevertheless, the German FA has asked for a detailed
explanation and Kaiserslautern have threatened to sue.
Seeler has already admitted that any initiative to resurrect Hamburg
cannot begin if there is even a whiff of scandal still about the place.
The German FA have also acknowledged that, if the allegations are
substantiated, Kaiserslautern cannot be relegated so long after the
incident took place and some other form of punishment must be devised.
* DEPORTIVO La Coruna, now under the control of former Liverpool and
Wales striker John Toshack and dubbed the 'dream team', lived up to
expectations with an impressive 3-0 home win against Valencia as the
Spanish league got under way at the weekend.
The accolade came after a run of success, including a hat trick of
wins against champions Real Madrid, as Toshack's new-look squad landed
the Super Cup.
Brazilian international striker Bebeto scored twice.
* GUUS Hiddink's brief reign in charge of Holland will end if victory
is not forthcoming against Belarus in Amsterdam on Wednesday.
Disappointing results and knee-jerk team selections from Hiddink have
undermined his position and left the Dutch also needing wins against
Malta and Norway to qualify for the European Championships.
He was in London last week appealing in vain for Chelsea's Ruud Gullit
to change his mind and end his self-imposed exile from the international
team.
Belgium are in an equally precarious position. They must beat Denmark
by two clear goals in Brussels and hope this can inspire a late
comeback.
* FEYENOORD'S decision to appoint a woman as their managing director
has stirred up controversy. Lawyer Nicole Edelenbos, 33, who is the
first female to occupy such a post on the Continent, has no background
in the game or any connection with the Rotterdam club, yet will still
earn #150,000.
* PSV Eindhoven captain Jan Wouters is under investigation by the
Dutch FA for alleged racist remarks after Moroccan Yassime Abdeelaoui of
NAC Breda lodged a complaint after last week's game.
* IF Bari's Igor Protti appears slightly under the weather the
explanation is quite simple. The striker won 1000 bottles of wine for
scoring the fastest goal when Serie A started last week, netting in just
three minutes against Napoli.
AC Milan's veteran defender Franco Baresi, with his first league goal
for five years, contributed to the 23 scored on the opening day in
Italy.
* ANDERLECHT have recalled their former Dutch coach Jan Boskamp to
bring much-needed stability. The growing number of critics of the
stricken Brussels club perceive the move as another panic measure.
Boskamp quit last season claiming the post was too stressful and he
would rather concentrate on youth development.
His latest regime started with victory over Club Brugge, their first
of the season.
* COLOMBIAN striker Faustino Asprilla has been given a year's
suspended jail sentence by a court in Bogota for threatening people with
a gun during a row in a pub last January. The Parma player must also
report each month to his country's consulate in Milan as part of the
punishment.

DAVE Bassett will need all his well known powers of motivation to halt
Sheffield United's slide down the Endleigh League into obscurity.
United have that look of relegation about them even though the season
is still in its infancy, the 3-1 defeat by West Brom being the club's
fifth successive reverse.
But Bassett is refusing to panic as the vultures gather around his
head. ''Every manager has to go through this kind of situation. I am
concerned but not worried. I will not panic.''
United have another tough task on Saturday, when they entertain
Norwich, who thrilled manager Martin O'Neill with the manner of their
2-1 win over Port Vale.
O'Neill said: ''We were absolutely fantastic at times and for an hour
played the best football I have seen since I came here.''
Millwall are three points clear of Leicester at the top of the first
division following Kerry Dixon's winner at Portsmouth. Dixon said: ''We
got an away victory without passing well and that is what you must do in
this tight division.''
Ipswich manager George Burley singled out striker Alex Mathie for
special praise after he scored all the goals in the 3-0 victory over
Sunderland. Burley said: ''I have always said Alex will score goals for
us and I'm delighted he is now proving me right.''
Terry Westley, the Luton manager, is looking to bolster his squad
after their 2-1 defeat by Derby, both the Rams' goals coming from Dean
Sturridge. Westley said: ''We need a midfield passer. I'm going to
Denmark to watch a man who is reportedly a playmaker.''
An own goal by Vince Overson gave Oldham victory at Stoke while
Grimsby fought out a 0-0 draw with Watford at Blundell Park.

LIKE Sir Alf Ramsey and now Frank Bruno, world champions at Wembley
and brought up on the East London-Essex fringes, England coach Terry
Venables is determined to do things his way.
His first squad selection of the new season, for Wednesday night's
friendly at home to Colombia, has emphasised yet again that there will
be no concessions to popular demand in seeking to achieve the target set
out for him -- in Venables' case, nothing less than winning the European
Championship next summer.
A year ago, the clamour for Andy Cole and then Stan Collymore was
steadfastly ignored. Matthew Le Tissier, another favourite, was given
one start, one appearance as a substitute, and then ditched.
Now a pool has been named without Paul Ince and Les Ferdinand, and the
pair of them further ignored even following withdrawals by Collymore and
David Platt.
Ince made the mistake of dropping out of last summer's Umbro Cup
tournament, claiming he was in the wrong frame of mind because of a
court appearance and speculation about his transfer to Italy.
Now he has his move to Italy, and there he can stay, for this week at
least. Venables, though he will not publicly admit it, clearly felt that
a point about priorities and loyalties had to be made.
Ferdinand finds himself in the same position as Cole last year,
carrying goals to Newcastle and carrying the Geordies to the top of the
Premier League in thrilling fashion, yet not convincing the England
coach that he is a better bet than Teddy Sheringham as Alan Shearer's
understudy.
The naming of the side tomorrow will nevertheless excite considerable
interest, not least in whether the midfield is to be constructed around
Rangers' Paul Gascoigne or a Liverpool fulcrum now including Jamie
Redknapp as well as Steve McManaman and John Barnes.
Unpredictable individualism touched with genius, or proven team
harmony? It may be, given Gascoigne's most recent injury, that Venables
errs on the cautious side, leaving him on the bench as he did for all
three of last summer's games.
If the size of the gate was any sort of consideration, Gascoigne would
be in from the start, for even at the beginning of such a critical
season the English public appear rather underwhelmed and ticket sales
are poor.

HIGHLAND LEAGUE
CLACH manager Roshie Fraser was reflecting on two cup exits within
seven days yesterday after having watched his side throw away a 3-0
advantage in their Scottish Qualifying Cup clash at Peterhead.
The Blue Toon stormed back to win 4-3, and Fraser said: ''Believe it
or not, I wasn't that happy when 3-1 up at the break. We'd taken our
chances, but were not playing anything like as good as we can.
''I couldn't believe the goals we gave away in that second half. I was
disappointed to say the least -- inexperience cost us dear.''
Youngsters Mark Holmes and Stuart Mackay had given Clach a dream start
with goals in the first 15 minutes, before Bruce McCraw made it three in
35 minutes.
Mike Smart pulled one back before the break, but it was a dazzling
second-half display which scuppered Clach.
Keith McCreadie potted Peterhead's second, before Bruce Campbell
snatched victory with a superb double.
In the league, Fraserburgh managed the rare feat of putting four past
Huntly at Christie Park -- but still ran-out 7-4 losers.
A Brian Thomson hat trick and a Craig Yeats double helped Huntly to a
7-1 lead with 20 minutes left. Broch barely deserved their late
goal-rush.
Rothes pulled off the shock of the day, with a 2-1 win away to league
cup finalists Cove, and a Neil MacPherson hat trick hoisted Keith three
points clear at the top of the table in a 5-0 thrashing of Forres.

HAWICK centre, and sometime Scotland winger and centre Tony Stanger is
to enrol soon at Moray House in Edinburgh, where he is to embark on a
degree course in Sports Sciences.
Stanger, 27, who won the most recent of his 38 caps during the World
Cup in South Africa, resigned from his job with a financial services
company on Friday and yesterday he quashed speculation that he was to
become Scotland's first full-time rugby professional.
''No, this is something that I have wanted to do for some time. When I
left school I went straight into the Royal Bank and then into the
financial services sector. It will probably come in the future, but I
don't think that the game in Scotland will support the full-timer during
my time as a player.''

COURAGE League champions Leicester only just managed to assert their
status over relegated Northampton in a niggly opener to the season.
Leicester needed a penalty try late on to win 23-17.
England flanker Neil Back and Northampton scrum half Matt Dawson were
warned for having a private fight.
* FORMER New Zealand rugby union coach and test player Ivan Vodanovich
died Saturday of an undisclosed illness.
A prop in his playing days, Vodanovich, 65, was an All Black in 1955,
playing in all three tests of the Bledisloe Cup series against Australia
and scoring a try in his debut in the first test at Athletic Park.
Vodanovich was coach of the All Blacks between 1969 and 1971, including
the side which toured South Africa in 1970.

BORDER rugby has lost a well kent figure for the second successive
weekend with the death of Douglas Lightbody, the former Jed-Forest scrum
half who has been a South selector since 1981. The previous weekend
Jimmy Riddell, the former Kelso forward, collapsed and died at the scene
of a road accident.
He captained Jed in 1956-57, when they won the Border League title and
shared the unofficial championship with Edinburgh Academicals as well as
scoring a rare seven-a-side success by taking the Selkirk trophy. He was
also club captain in two of the five subsequent seasons, and he played
for the South in district championship matches against Glasgow and the
North and Midlands in 1959-60. As a confident, cocky scrum half, he
would have made more numerous representative appearances had he not been
a contemporary of Arthur Dorward, Brian Shillinglaw, Alex Hastie -- all
capped Borderers -- and Glen Turnbull. Douglas Lightbody was at his home
ground, Riverside Park, on Saturday, when Jed beat GHK 9-5, but he died
at home overnight.

IN 1556 the Scottish nation hardly noticed the opening of the Wellpark
Brewery.
Their thoughts were on their young Queen Mary sequestered in far-off
France. But it was the start of something big.
On Saturday, as the kick-off of the new Tennent's Premiership drew the
spotlights, 12 junior teams quietly, and in most cases drookitly, got
the Tennent's 1556 Cup under ay. This, too, is something big, Scottish
rugby's first national cup culminating in a glamour final at Murrayfield
in May.
First out the bag in the preliminary round was the tie between RAF
Kinloss and Dalkeith, with the latter's eight-hour round trip coach
journey rewarded with a 35-9 defeat -- the biggest of the day in the
competition. Kinloss now travel to Lismore.
The glamour of Murrayfield was light years away as the teams kicked
off in driving rain. Dalkeith had first use of the conditions but didn't
capitalise.
The RAF chaps troubled the scoreboard first. The ball squirted in the
wet from a ruck on the Dalkeith line, an attempt was made to kick it
clear, but the ball only rebounded from the ruck, now scrambling to its
feet. Kinloss hooker Dave Taylor pounced for a try converted by Luke
Webb.
Dalkeith replied with a penalty from Donald Ross but Kinloss hit back
with an outstanding try in the conditions.
Counter-attacking from their own twenty-two, half backs Roy Dinnes and
Webb exchanged passes. Dinnes then found centre Ritchie Wallace who sent
winger Craig Dickie roaring in from halfway. Webb converted from in
front of the posts.
Although a subsequent penalty and drop goal from Ross let Dalkeith
turn only 14-9 in arrears, it was obvious that, facing the elements,
they would struggle.
They weren't helped by having to rejig the team to cope with replacing
scrum half Barry Watson (dead leg) at half-time and hooker Tony Aitken
(eye cut) soon after.
Stout defence held the RAF to a try from Mick Wright and three
penalties by Webb, until, in the closing stages, the screw was turned.
Ball taken against the head in a five metres scrum was used for a miss
move with Wright touching down.
Moray made the trip in the opposite direction to go under 28-6 at
Lasswade. The home team's win was based on their pack's good work and
they ran in three tries through winger Mark Smith, prop Davie McPheet,
and centre Bill Knowles. Lasswade now face big boys Royal High at home.
With tries from Alex Mack and Jim Halkett, Hyndland FP led hosts
Rosyth 15-3 at the turn. But with Rosyth successfully changing to a
mauling game and captain Steve Archibald landing five successive kicks,
they edged ahead at 18-15.
Tony Mulrain then produced a try from a set move and a final Archibald
penalty took Rosyth through by 26-15 to a home tie with Duns.
Broughton's Gerry Love scored a try and kicked a penalty and a
conversion as Waid were squeezed out 15-0. The first round proper brings
a local derby with Forrester FP.
In the other ties, Hamilton Accies slipped past Panmure 8-0 and RAF
Lossiemouth's sortie to Edinburgh Northern resulted in a 25-3 away win.
The winners again travel, to meet Walkerburn and Glenrothes.

SHADE Munro, fresh into his job as a development officer in Glasgow
under the guiding light of Ken McEwan, has been handed the reins to
start a new youth rugby club in the Maryhill area, and he hopes to use
Scotland stars like Craig Chalmers to help him.
A meeting he has set up with Roy Laidlaw of the SRU tomorrow also
could further change the face of Glasgow rugby.
It's a bold move by the city, and a clear indication that it means
business in at least attempting to divert some of the youngsters in
Glasgow from football to rugby.
The new club will use the old Jordanhill facilities at Caldercuilt,
and letters are being sent out to schools and parents in the area by
Munro today. Munro's move is only part of Glasgow's ambitious plans for
the future.
''We consider Maryhill, Summerstoun, and North Kelvinside as a fertile
area for rugby,'' said Scottish international Munro.
''We will be writing to parents, setting up after-school clubs,
running rugby festivals, and involving as many people as we can. I want
to be able to call on the services of Craig Chalmers to generate
interest in the area.''
Chalmers, who has an enviable profile in rugby these days, says he is
delighted to be able to help when he can. ''I already do that kind of
thing elsewhere and it is immensely enjoyable, said the Melrose stand
off at his home in the borders yesterday.
''I think it's a great idea and I am more than pleased to help Shade's
effort in Glasgow. It's the kind of thing that all of us want to be
involved in.''
In the inevitability of progress, Chalmers, like his South African and
New Zealand colleagues, will find himself in a contract with the Union
that stipulates that he has to spend a certain number of hours in the
promotion of rugby, and Munro will be able to call on that help.
Until now, many of the international players will appear on a wet
Sunday out of the kindness of their hearts -- as Kevin McKenzie did
yesterday to inaugurate the new Hyndland mini-rugby section -- but who
can blame them if they change their minds. The fact remains that
youngsters like heroes and Chalmers is a hero to many.
Munro knows only too well that his job is now to rival the Mount
Vernon project, which saw the inception of a rugby club from nothing,
and that club now has the coaches, resources, and players to enter
competitions.
''My hope is that we can get the same thing up and running in the
north-west of Glasgow,'' says Munro.
''It is absolutely true to say that the kids in Glasgow love New Image
rugby -- which is the game without the contact -- but I know that it
will be more difficult. I think it will take two years to get the club
going, but I am determined to make it succeed.''
I sense, even as a former player in the bad old times of Glasgow
rugby, that there seem to be far more rugby clubs starting up, expanding
their numbers, gearing up for success, and opening their doors to
newcomers than there used to be.
All I used to hear were stories of clubs losing numbers. That is not
happening. I sense it reversing. I actually hear people in Glasgow
talking about rugby now.
There's a concern that the rot has gone far enough, and a solution may
be in sight.
Take my own club, Glasgow Accies. After a deliberately quiet summer,
Brian Simmers has managed to keep Kevin Greene, the world class Waikato
coach, and attract the two highly ambitious Begley brothers to play
third division rugby in Scotland.
Both those lads want to play for Scotland. GHK's mini rugby section is
going bananas, Hyndland started a new section yesterday, and Cartha
Queen's Park coaches are going into Holyrood School -- the biggest state
school in Scotland -- with rewarding success.
We were just let down by GHK and West losing, but they were away games
and they will start winning.
And tomorrow, a meeting of historic significance takes place when
Munro meets with Roy Laidlaw at Scotstoun as the first get-together of
the two men as they plan Glasgow's centre of rugby excellence.
Although it is still in the earliest stages of planning, Laidlaw said
yesterday that he looks forward to developing elite players and the
centre of rugby excellence in Glasgow is in the planning stages.
All of which, I think, gives us some hope for the future of rugby in
the city. It was Jim Telfer who said at the SOS rugby forum at Glasgow
Southern on Friday night that he thought the lack of success in Glasgow
rugby lay at the feet of the players. And so it does.
But it is good to see that there are real efforts being made in this
dammed big city to get the right kind of kids -- and by that I mean non
fee-paying kids -- to savour the joys of one hell of a game and provide
a foundation of real hardness to take the sport forward in the city.
As Big Jill from Haddington sometimes says, if you've never tried
something different then you won't know how good it can feel -- and I
wish Shade Munro success in getting the kind folk, and kids, of Maryhill
to try rugby.
It is a real step in the right direction.

Dundee HS FP 14
Stewarts-Melville FP 17
DUNDEE coach Tom Dymock confessed: ''There were a few guys with tears
in their eyes in the dressing room.'' His young side had put in so much
effort and, having fallen at the final hurdle, they let their emotions
go.
Murray Thomson, the Stewart's-Mellville full back, having already
bagged three penalties, stepped forward in injury time and calmly
slotted a 30-metre penalty as the final act of the game to steal victory
for the Edinburgh men.
Dundee had taken the initiative and had lengthy spells of pressure,
but despite scoring two tries, they failed to convert pressure into
enough points.
Both tries were fine efforts -- full back Mark Lamont intruding at
pace and crossing after a classic dummy and straighten. Steve Newton
converted from well out and was the recipient of the scoring pass given
by boilerhouse man Richie Gray for High School's second try. Paul
Rouse's conversion stretched the scoreline to 14-3 and it seemed like
curtains for the vitiors.
But Doug Wyllie's well-placed kicks were the college's route back.
Thomson notched a second penalty and they drew closer still with
Graeme Stirling's poacher's try. He scooped up recycled ball, squirted
past the maul, and stretched to touch down one-handed.
Thomson failed with the conversion, but his next penalty tied the
scores, setting up the grandstand finish.
Dundee HS FP -- M Lamont; M Cousin, P Rouse, D Hamilton, J Jardine; S

Jed-Forest 9, GHK 5
IN a match overshadowed by the third-minute injury to Jed-Forest scrum
half Gary Armstrong, both sides did their level best to disprove the
theory that the new second division could conceivably witness some of
the premier league's most exciting ruby.
The loss of Armstrong -- who suffered a sprung rib cartilage and is
likely to be out of action for a month -- drained the match of colour,
leaving the rain-soaked Riverside spectators to reflect on whether a
dearth of tries will now replace the national drought.
Ironically, it was GHK who looked the side most likely to open the
scoring floodgates. A powerful Derek Busby break allowed Murray Wallace
to romp over for a try after 23 minutes, after Jed full back Chris
Richards had given the home team a 6-0 lead from two penalties.
Sadly, such decisive finishing was to prove the match's scarcest
commodity. Scoring passes from GHK's South African lock Cecil Duplessis
and replacement winger Sean Little both ended up in the hands of Jed
defenders, while Gerry Hawkes knocked on with the line at his mercy.
But Jed-Forest never lost their self-belief, even after losing
Armstrong. Skipper Ronnie Kirkpatrick was a tower of strength at No.8,
while the confident debut of replacement scrum half Clark Laidlaw (the
18-year-old son of internationalist Roy), is bound to boost morale.
Busby had to leave the field with a head injury following a punch-up
and 10 minutes later Richards finally pulled the plug on GHK with his
third penalty.
Jed-Forest -- C J Richards; K A Amos, A Douglas, H G Hogg, M Yule; G

Selkirk 24
West of Scotland 18
HAMISH Fyfe's first public duty as the new convener of Glasgow's
selectors was to travel across the country to Philiphaugh to see his
club, West of Scotland, open their programme in the new premiership's
second division.
He had little to be satisfied about in West's defeat by Selkirk on an
afternoon of dull skies and a threat of rain.
He drew solace, however, from the performances of the Bulloch
brothers, Gordon and Alan, the latter making his first league
appearance.
Each of the brothers had a hand in one of the two tries by which West
hauled themselves back from the dead at 6-24 to threaten Selkirk in the
last quarter. Gordon scored the first, driving over with the West pack
swarming in his wake after John Lonergan had regenerated from breakdown
on the left, and Alan made the other try, the centre breaking two
tackles before accelerating across the field to send David Riding over
on the right.
Selkirk had the edge in the first hour, though they did not make the
most of Keith McConnell's lineout domination. The home team led only
12-3 at half-time, and that included an injury-time try by Darren Hulme.
David Barrett opened the scoring in each half, the first with a drop
goal, the second with a penalty. Selkirk, however, made safe with two
tries in three minutes midway in the second half. Scott Nichol sprinted
over on the left after West had been drawn into the other corner, and
Hunter lanced through the middle to score between the posts.
Selkirk -- D W Hunter; M A Jaffray, K G Johnston, J S Brett, D Hulme;
S A Nichol, S Tomlinson; B Johnston, D Graham, J R S McColm, K D
McConnell, D C S Cameron, W Gentleman, D Nichol, P Minto. Replacement --

Currie 28, Kelso 16
CURRIE deserved this opening league victory over a plucky Kelso side
in a largely uninspiring match, marred by the sending off of Kelso prop
Darren Howlett after 30 minutes for dangerous use of the boot.
Ironically, Kelso's 14 men responded with the game's first try when
Bennett burst through from close range to score near the posts.
Aitcheson converted to add to three earlier penalties, but there the
game ended in an attacking sense for Kelso.
Currie had dominated for spells and four Ally Donaldson penalties kept
them in touch at half-time, but after the turnaround it was all one-way
traffic. However, tenacious Border tackling and Currie's inability to
retain good possession meant that chances were frittered away.
Aitcheson, the Kelso full back, stood firm under a barrage of Ally
Donaldson's garryowen's as Currie strove to use their advantage.
The Currie forwards, with their front row of Boyd, Ellis, and Massie
outstanding, dominated the set-pieces and it was invevitable that tries
would come. A Donaldson penalty and drop goal put the home side ahead
for the first time before the forwards gained rich reward when Hardie
was given the credit for a push-over try in 67 minutes.
Currie's full back, the classy Dean Shepherd, showed his paces with
some fine intrusions into the line, culminating in the clinching score
in the dying minutes.
Both sides played nervously as the pressure for league points was
obvious and there is no doubt that the home side were relieved just to
get this one out of the way.

WILLIAM HUNTER hauls up in a once sedate Clyde coast town, teeming
with all-things Norse for a year-round celebration of an ancient brawl
LIKE improving an ice-cream by putting blood-red juice on it, more
rape and pillage have been added to the holiday attractions of Largs.
Gore abounds. Celebrating old wounds at the seaside has been expanded
from a summer festival to an all-year show -- a daily salute to its
Viking invaders, entitled: Vikingar!
One day of violence long ago when the townsfolk of Largs tamed the
Norse invaders has brought forth a continuous performance that seeks to
entertain visitors while it educates them. Local history is served mixed
with humour. In a crowded hour or so is told a hardy tale that took four
centuries to write.
Vikingar! (it means Vikings, the exclamation mark added to suggest
they are still coming) is housed in an expanded Barrfields, a former
municipal hall and summertime palace of varieties. Later this year a
renewed theatre and swimming baths will give Largs a #4.1m waterfront
improvement.
Vikingar! is the most daring step of the district council to move
Largs into new-age leisure by going backwards and forwards at the same
time. Much electronic wizardy gets employed to beat old swords into
tourism's ploughshares.
It is also an effort to squeeze a seashore skirmish into the crammed
chronicle of long-ago Scottish battles. To the roll of honour of
fighting times -- Bannockburn, Stirling Brig, Culloden and the like --
will be more emphatically inscribed the year 1263 when roused townsmen
sent hand-picked seaborne invaders packing. Albeit the invaders had only
sailed from Lamlash on Arran.
Largs long-standing salute to the ensuing battle has, since l912, been
The Pencil monument, a plain obelisk that lies a normally bracing walk
along the waterfront. Annually there is the Viking Festival, a junket of
Norse culture and crafts accompanied by the clash of steel and the
burning of boats.
Vikingar! (with an admission price of #3.50) extends the experience
with a screen show programmed between two display areas of museum
instruction.
For their introduction, visitors lift wooden box-lids hinged to a wall
to light up displays of Viking lore about what Norseman wore, how they
lived, what games they played. There is a deadpan factualness about the
information. While it is asserted there was heroic feasting on bear
flesh and whalemeat, it is whispered that good sea warriors also
regularly supped their porridge.
Later, on the far wall of this Valhalla, materialises the face of the
god Odin to utter more thunderous tidings.
For a light interlude, local young storytellers, masquerading as
heroic personages of mythology, give commentaries about their lives,
while they ad lib asides and Ayrshire jokes to keep the mood holidayish.
Astrid, a white-robed housewife, discloses the concoction -- rich, she
tells her party of visitors, with cow urine -- which she uses to wash
the gore from her husband's working clothes when he decides to come home
from overseas.
Another reception is dominated by Elric, Paul Welsh, a towering figure
who bestrides the hall of the gods. He carries a sword. Pointedly, he
calls it Head Biter. After his guests had gone, Elric explains how he
quietens the restive: ''They get introduced to my sword right away . .
.''
In a small comfy cave of a cinema is projected on to a split screen,
set among rocks, a story of robust derring-do. It illustrates the Norse
code. Only death in battle ensures eternal happiness. To die of old age
or illness is base. Farming is considered a torpid way to live. Empires
(the script says) are built by landless younger sons, of whom the
Vikings had an abundance. There is much hearty clanking of swords and
stamping of feet; blood flows.
Time gradually tames the sea warriors. More of them settled on land.
Pirates became traders or statesmen, whom the film views as a detectably
different breed of men. Old ways of robbing Scots churches on Iona and
elsewhere become heroic folk memories. The magic of the show comes from
how it appears as a series of visions seen among old stones.
Reeling from the laser show, visitors next can view Norse history in a
more leisurely and scholarly way in what Vikingar! calls its hall of
knowledge. Ancient writings combine with push-button electronics to be
the book of the film. They provide more items of history than most
holidaymakers may wish to find themselves armoured with. Yet detail
about the Battle of Largs is scant.
Its place in Scotland's pugilistic story reads more like a local bout
than a title fight. But in a fair-handed way Largs allows the losers to
tell their side of it. For their defeat the Vikings blamed dumb luck.
According to their account, divine power wrecked their ships and sent
pestilence upon their troops.
While Largs took the day, three years had to pass before the invaders,
in a treaty signed at Perth, agreed to go away and behave themselves.
Even then they had to be bought off. The Vikings retreated from mainland
Scotland only after they had been given cash compensation in advance.
Although the Norse influence on Scottish life is much emphasised
throughout the exhibition, it is not much explained. Vikingar! does not
attempt to make a heavy meal of an ancient maul. Really it is a
celebration. Reading the runes in the elegant winter garden cafe of the
renewed Barrfields catches the mood.
Alongside breakfast snacks for morning raiders are dishes fit for a
Viking feast (the menu says), albeit they include lasagne and quiche.
Puddings come listed as a voyage to Valhalla. And in Largs now longboat
has become a word for a filled roll.
The Largs summer Viking Festival ends on Sunday after Saturday's
re-enacting of the battle and the burning of a longship.

Heriot's 10, Melrose 17
LACK of success always hurts when you have become used to it. Melrose,
it appears, are determined not to be hurt this season. They began their
assault on the Tennent's Premiership with a win which was far more
comfortable than the scoreline suggests.
Indeed, if the goal kicking sights of the normally reliable Gary
Parker -- replaced in these duties to little effect by Craig Chalmers --
had been better set, then the gap would have become a gulf.
It was clear that rugby was with us again as the puddles formed on the
usually immaculate Goldenacre surface and the handsome crowd shivered
and sheltered in the stand or below a forest of umbrellas.
The conditions were, to a degree, culpable for what was a rather
disjointed game, with only the odd forwards' breenge or backs' silky run
to brighten the day. Yet, to their credit, the star-studded Melrose back
division tried to move the ball as often as possible.
Their possession, particularly in the first half, was plentiful and
well won by a pack in which Robbie Brown led by example and was ably
backed up by his colleagues.
It is an impressively mobile pack which seems instinctively to know
the right option when recycling possession. The rumble comes when the
circumstances call, otherwise the ball is in Bryan Redpath's hands to
punt or detonate another attack.
With four of the current Scotland squad in the back line, Melrose
supporters are entitled to expect fireworks. Perhaps we will have to
wait for a crisp autumn day at the Greenyards for the sparks to really
fly.
Rowen Shepherd, determined to become the fifth full cap in the team,
is looking strong and sharp and set up some excellent attacks from deep
positions.
Of the others, the Redpath/Chalmers combination grows in stature,
Jimmy Turnbull adds punch to the midfield, and Craig Joiner looks
quicker than ever but must work on retaining the ball when under threat.
Heriot's were well beaten and it was refreshing not to hear any
excuses.
There is pace around in Hugh Gilmour and David Officer and a settled
midfield will help later in the season. The back row of Scott Elliott,
Tam McVie, and Graham Dall is hungry and combative and will help
Heriot's enjoy better days.
While meaning no disrespect to the second row pairing of Craig
Humphries and Peter Young, one feels that the return of a fit and hungry
Andy Macdonald will add a new dimension to the all-important area of
touchline possession.
We must also wait for the appearance of the Glasgow twins together in
the navy and white hoops. Cammy is still nursing an Achilles tendon
injury and Tony had to retire for treatment in his Goldenacre debut.
Heriot's turned early pressure into points with a Phil Smith penalty
goal in eight minutes. The Melrose faithful were not silenced for long,
however, as swift transfer of good possession through Chalmers and
Turnbull released the irrepressible Parker for the opening try. To his
frustration he sent the conversion wide.
It was Graham Shiel's turn to gladden the hearts of the travelling
support as he dived over from another Melrose attack linking backs and
forwards.
Heriot's had the last word of the first half, as a forward rush and
drive -- with Kenny Milne to the fore -- crossed to the line. Elliott
got the try and Campbell Aitken stroked over the conversion to make it
10-10.
The strains of Scotland the Brave from the school pipe band had barely
faded as Gary Parker failed with another penalty goal attempt -- swiftly
followed by a failure from Chalmers. Whisper it, but these normally
impressive goal kickers missed 10 chances between them.
Chalmers did, however, send the all-important conversion of his own
try soaring straight and true.
It was a try born of Melrose determination to get to the line. After
the forwards had been held up, they won sweet scrummage ball, Redpath
probed and fed Chalmers who just had to fall over the line.
Melrose will go from strength to strength, and we await sightings of
their Kiwi imports with interest, but there is no reason to doubt that a
full-strength Heriot's will have a telling influence on this intriguing
league.
Heriot's -- P Smith; H R Gilmour, A C Glasgow, G M Lawrie, D Officer;
C R Aitken, F McMillan; S W Paul, K S Milne, J Bryce, C Humphries, P T
Young, S Elliott, T A McVie, G F Dall. Replacement -- D Fowler for

DIVISION 4
RUGBY's new club, Glasgow Southern, began the first day of the new
Premiership with a record scoreline -- a 53-8 win over Haddington --
which, in view of the closeness of scores elsewhere, could last some
time.
They were 10-0 up in 20 minutes, with Jim Paterson claiming both
touchdowns. However, he broke a cheek bone and as Southern reorganised,
Haddington came back with a try from Calum Murray and a Scott Brownlee
penalty.
But after the turn there was no holding Southern, whose pack was far
superior. Stuart Simcox and Dom Sharkey each registered a brace of tries
while singletons fell to Kiwi stand-off Jim Dunlop, who spread play
well, Ally Menzies, and Mark Guthrie.
At Millbrae, Ayr won the south-west derby with Wigtownshire 31-15.
Back in the fold were winger Peter Manning, back from GHK, and flanker
David McVey, who has had seasons with Stirling County and West of
Scotland.
Two tries came from Manning and one from McVey and Young Kiwi import
Craig Foster completed the scoring with three penalties, two
conversions, and a drop goal.
Ayr built up a 31-10 lead going into the last quarter, but 'Shire
remained typically dogged. Michael Kilkerr had touched down in the first
half and with four minutes left Alan Drysdale rewarded sustained
pressure with a try.
Kilmarnock also produced two points for Ayrshire -- courtesy of
Gordonians who missed numerous penalty chances.
Mike Welsh touched down for the first try and Tony Finnegan added two
more. Phil Gordon kicked a penalty to let his side turn 18-0 up.
Gordonians dominated the second half, but only with 10 minutes left
did the first penalty slot home. In the closing minutes Steve Smith
scored with Doney converting.
No team was more upset by the sodden conditions than Edinburgh
Wanderers, whose young side are geared to run the ball. Langholm built
up a 13-3 lead with tries from Neil Basnett and David Patterson and a
Gary Brennan penalty. Wanderers hit back with a try by Scott Carnochan
converted by Robbie Bremner. Late on Wanderers had a clearing kick
charged down and Mark Grieve fell on it to secure Langholm's 18-10 win.

DIVISION 3
ON a day when, unusually, the rain was more intense in the east,
Glasgow Academicals used the reasonable conditions to beat Musselburgh
39-9 with seven touchdowns.
After a spirited Musselburgh opening, the powerful home pack took
control, and there were two first-half tries for Calum MacGregor.
Left wing Brian Boundy scored following snappy transference of a Dean
Barr pick-up on the right and Torquil Mathewson's touch-down after a
long pass from MacGregor let him show his speed.
With MacGregor kicking a conversion and Musselburgh's Cliff
Livingstone three penalties, Accies led 22-9 at the break and then so
controlled the second half they should have got more points.
Julian Richmond and Mathewson scored in the opening 15 minutes with
MacGregor kicking a conversion and Simmers scuttled in from 30 metres on
the whistle.
One of the best matches of the day was at Preston Lodge where visitors
Biggar won 21-17 in a game which could have gone either way.
Biggar's 18-year-old stand-off Stewart Harrison showed he has matured
during his summer playing with Manly, Australia. In the first half he
scored two tries -- one off a charge-down and the other a solo effort
from ruck ball -- as Biggar built up an 18-3 half-time lead.
PL blitzkrieged the opening 10 minutes of the second half with an
opportunist try from Stewart Payne on the left wing and three penalties
from Rodney Gibbs having Biggar trembling on 18-17. However, they dug in
and added a penalty from Malcolm Bruce in the last minute.
There was much poorer fare at view at Glensburgh, where Grangemouth
and Kirkcaldy splashed about to little effect. Kirkcaldy's territorial
advantage allowed John Mitchell to kick one penalty before the break and
two thereafter. A last-minute penalty from Kenny Halliday got
Grangemouth on the board.
Corstorphine should have been well ahead of Peebles by the interval.
They led 9-3 thanks to three Grant Pollock penalties, but seven kickable
chances had been missed.
The Borderers got on top in the second half, producing a try for Mark
Smith and allowing Rab Wilson to add to his early penalty success, and
getting home 11-9.

WHAT price professionalism? At what point is the game not worth the
candle? The end of amateur rugby was inevitable, of that there is no
doubt. The amateur ethos, about which so much hot air has been spouted,
was in any case very much a chimera, a hankering after a state of
affairs which had ceased to exist long ago.
In Wales they have paid their players for years. We all know that, and
look where it has got them. The Welsh national side is now a rag-bag,
motley crew which is rivalled in all of its tawdryness only by the
second-rate and spiteful gang of administrators who have allowed
something beautiful to wither and die.
However, money did not do that. Something dark, sinister and brooding
deep within the Celtic soul of Welsh rugby was the culprit, but the
lesson is there for all to see. Success cannot be bought. Or rather, if
it can be, then there is a hefty price to pay.
Look at the Springboks. World champions they are and professionals
they have been certainly since their re-emergence on to the world stage.
Just last week SRU senior vice-president Fred McLeod implied that when
the South Africans trounced Scotland last November at Murrayfield they
were, to a man, on contracts which were in breach of the amateurism
regulations.
Pro rugby in South Africa, even before it was legitimised last weekend
in Paris, is big-time. The rewards for the players and their provinces
were, and are, immense. Small wonder, then, that some players would seek
to feed off the fatted calf with some biological engineering of their
own. It is a matter of public record that South African rugby has not
been entirely drug-free.
Last week the Rugby World Cup drug authorities announced that all the
tests carried out in South Africa had been negative. Good, but no cause
for complacency or unwarranted celebration. Either the sport is
drug-free, the wrong players were tested, or players -- just as in other
money-spinning sports -- have kept one step ahead of the drug squad.
It would be folly in the extreme to believe that rugby players are any
different to the athletes, and all the rest, who have decided that a jab
or two from a hypodermic syringe is a risk worth taking if it means that
they can boost their performances and their bank balances.
The weekend revelations in the Radio 5 investigative programme, On The
Line, that steroid abuse is not uncommon in Welsh and English club rugby
is a timely reminder for those who believe that somehow rugby is
different and that rugby players are immune to the lure of the needle.
If there were a handful of self-destructive cheats around who were
willing to risk their health and their future in the game before
professionalism was legitimised then you can bet your bottom dollar that
their numbers will have been boosted in direct proportion to the amount
of money which can now be made legitimately from the game.
That is when the price of professionalism becomes too high and when
the game becomes not worth the candle. If ever, as seems to be the case
with world-class athletics -- and the doubters need only look at the
history of athletics over the past decade -- the situation arises
whereby an aspiring young rugby player must make a pact with the needle
if he is to realise his international, or even club, ambitions then all
is indeed lost.
Vigilance, public denunciation and lifetime bans for those who have
surrendered to the seductive lure of the apothecaries' cabinet are the
only remedies which will keep the sport clean. Money, like power, has a
tendency to corrupt.
Last weekend's Paris declaration to end the charade and the hypocrisy
of shamateurism is entirely welcome. There still remain a host of
problems to resolve -- problems which would test the wisdom of Solomon
never mind that of IB chairman Bernard Lapasset -- but on the issue of
drugs the message should ring out loud and clear across the globe.
Don't be blinded by the rewards which are now on offer. If you are
caught, then you are out of the game. Forever.

LITTLE Mona kissed the rope that hanged her. The 17-year-old student
had asked to be the last of 10 Iranian women sentenced to death because
of their belief in Baha'i. Her wish was granted and as Aktar, Izzat,
Mahshid, Nusrat, Tuba, and Roya, Tahirih, Simin, and Shirin walked to
their death she prayed to Baha'ullah, the founder of the faith.
The arrival of the red blindfold and the quick walk to the gallows was
the end of a short life and long interrogation for Mona, whose only
crime had been the teaching of Baha'i children's classes. For two months
she had been tortured and interrogated with 100 other women at the Sepah
Prison in Tehran in a bid to break their belief. The bid failed.
The trap-door dropped. The 10 women died. All on June 18, 1983.
In a time of anniversaries including VE-Day, the liberation of Belsen,
the end of the Vietnam War, Sunday will pass unnoticed. Only the few
hundred Scots who follow the Baha'i faith will remember the women in
their prayers. And remeber too that religious intolerance continues
worldwide.
Recently the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Edinburgh welcomed
Olya Roohizadegan to speak. Mrs Roohizadegan survived the interrogation
and escaped to write the story of the women and Iran's persecution of
the Baha'is in her book, Olya's Story. Hollywood is still tinkering with
it.
In the early eighties Iranian fundamentalists attempted to wipe out
Iran's largest religious minority. The Baha'i faith, which preached
religious unity, oneness of humanity and equality between the sexes, was
branded subversive by Iran's clergy.
Homes were torched, beatings administered, and hundreds of Baha'is
were executed or killed by mobs.
All followers were refused employment and education. Educated women
were targeted to be tortured until they recanted. ''All we had to do was
recant our faith,'' said Olya Roohizadegan, ''But how could you deny
what is true, what you know in your heart?''
It was a question met with silence from a crowded room. In the
chaplaincy centre of Edinburgh University members of Scotland's Baha'i
community -- had joined with interested students to hear the story of
one remarkable woman and through her, the story of the hanged 10.
Olya escaped to Britain in 1985, testified before the European
Commission for Human Rights, and published her book in 1993. Today she
works as a freelance beautician and hairdresser, while travelling the
world giving talks in sincere but slightly broken English. It is, she
said, her duty to her lost friends (she carries their pictures).
Olya is always at pains to stress the ordinariness of her friends. How
each had a wish to eat ice cream, visit relatives, even dine at a
restaurant if they were released. Yet none of them would utter the
simple words which the uneducated Islamic guards wished, despite being
beaten by electric cables.
Mrs Nosrat Yaldai saw her son, an economics graduate, hanged and was
herself beaten with cables 250 times and spent 55 days in solitary
confinement. Just one women broke down when her young child was shown to
her for the last time, her captors claimed. She recanted.
The interrogators attempted the same tactics with Olya. Her
three-year-old son Payam was brought before her and the judge, who asked
that she take pity on her child. ''I love him very much, but I will
never recant my faith.'' The judge wrote on her file in red ink.
''Sentenced to death. To be Hanged.''
''In prison I saw light in darkness. In prison there was no material
life just spiritual life, it made me more strong because I was so close
to God, it completely changed me. It is why I wrote this book. I'm not
against the Iranian Government, I forgive them, I pray for them.''
Olya's tenuous release was secured only when her husband put up their
house as a security bond. But it was a plot to trap other Baha'is using
Olya as bait. Instead husband, wife, and young son fled over the
mountains to Pakistan and begged refugee status at the United Nations
office in Karachi. Their flight had taken six days and nights. But the
worst was over.
''Leaving my friends was terrible. I thought: Oh my God! How can I
leave them? But one thing had a purpose to me, make me leave. Come out
and tell the world, then they were all happy, believe me . . . And still
their faces are clear in my mind, 'Go Olya, go, give the message to
humanity'.
''I believe my God looked after me. But I felt bad when they came to
release me. We go through same pain, same food, same cell, we share
everything together. I wished we were all released . . . How can I leave
them because they loved their lives. But they loved God more.''
It was only upon reaching Karachi and the United Nations office that
she learned the fate of her friends. ''Eleven months later, we were
granted asylum in Britain as our two older children were studying
here.'' It was her eldest son, Fuzlullah, now an engineer, who helped
translate his mother's book. Though free in Britain, a noose hangs over
her head in Iran, where her parents still live.
During her talk Olya asked one young Scottish Baha'i to read a letter
which Sharin, a graduate with perfect English, had written. She was
imprisoned with both her parents, and described the prison as where
''souls mightier than the walls lie chained''.
Around the world the chains are still fastened.

Boroughmuir 3, Edinburgh Academicals 18
I FULLY expected Audie Murphy to appear at Meggetland complete with
bandaged head and the Stars and Stripes over a shoulder. It would not
have been out of place with the walking wounded in the Accies team.
David McIvor, Patrick Haslett, and Chris Simmers had all left at
various stages to have head wounds wrapped in bandages. The Hollywood
star's Red Badge of Courage was truly in evidence as the visitors proved
themselves convincing winners and a force to be reckoned with in the new
premiership set-up.
Boroughmuir were left to reflect on why, with so much talent in the
team, they could not compete in any positive manner.
The Academicals left very pleased with themselves. None more so than
head coach Bob Easson.
''You could say I'm satisfied with our win'', he said. That was truly
an understatement.
''Seriously, myself and forwards' coach David Sole are delighted. Not
just at taking the points, but the manner in which the boys did their
work. It is particularly gratifying when you consider when we changed
our tactics almost at the last minute because of the weather.''
Coach Easson did not really have to tell anyone about his tactics
being successful. Everyone at Meggetland could see for themselves the
organisation, the commitment and the superb fitness of the Accies
line-up would be hard to overcome.
On the day, Boroughmuir just did not have the flexibility to overcome
the defensive web spun by the Accies. Nor could they put up defensive
barriers themselves to curb the ingenuity of the visitors' fly half,
Brian Hay-Smith. He had a heyday. Or is it a hey-Smith day. Whatever.
Not only did the fly half orchestrate the positive moves but he had a
personal double hat trick day.
Brian kicked three penalties and popped over three dropped goals to
collect all his side's points. And just to show his versatility, Brian
slotted the final drop goal with his right foot, with the other foot
doing the damage earlier on.
The Accies were nine points up at the interval, with Hay-Smith putting
over three penalties and missing the same number. 'Muir's repeated
killing of the ball or drifting offside was hurting badly. The home
side's frustrations not only showed in giving away penalties but in lack
of communication. They tried to run the ball but ran into a blue and
white blanket at every turn.
Fly half Andy Knight was a pawn in the Accies' web. He could not find
a way through. Ironically he had been brought into the stand-off spot in
preference to Brian Easson, son of opposing coach Bob.
Hay-Smith had the first of his drop goals in four minutes of the
second half, then came Knight's sole success. His team mates seemed
lifted for a short spell, with Lineen, Laird, Tukalo, and Mardon showing
some activity. Flyer Derek Stark rarely saw the ball but on the hour he
burst into action and almost put Andy Laird in.
The Accies soaked up the pressure almost with ease and broke away for
Hay-Smith to sneak over a drop goal from an almost impossible angle on
the right. With two minutes to play, the fly half completed a great day
with a drop goal.
Boroughmuir -- N R Mardon; D A Stark, D Laird, S R P Lineen, I Tukalo;
A Knight, G Beveridge; G D Wilson, N Dickson, P H Wright, D G Burns, D
George, A Cadzow, S Reid, S Wands.
Edinburgh Academicals -- K Baillie; R A G Porter, C Murray, C T
Simmers, G McKinlay; B Hay-Smith, K Troup; D J Wilson, W P Haslett, B D
Stewart, J F Richardson, S Murray, C J Allan, D J McIvor, R Hoole.
Referee -- I Ramage (Berwick)

<HEADLINE>JENNIFER CUNNINGHAM meets Jan de Vries as the naturopath celebrates 25 years of alternative medicine. With worts and all</HEADLINE>

THE dapper little Dutchman displays the excitement of a 10-year-old in
the run-up to his birthday. Jan de Vries grins and waves as his staff
decorate an enormous marquee with flowers and set out tables in
preparation for his party. The celebration is to mark his 25 years as a
naturopath in Scotland and his 35th wedding anniversary.
In a sceptical little country with an appalling health record,
alternative therapies ranging from acupuncture to osteopathy, homeopathy
and herbal remedies have brought material success and international fame
to the man who likes best to be described as a naturopath.
The paradox, he feels, merely points up the necessity for his
whole-person approach to illness: treatment for the physical
manifestations will be more effective if the mental and emotional needs
are also assuaged.
''Ever since I set up the first clinic in Mokoia in Troon, a house
that had been in my wife's family, I have had Scottish people telling me
they just have to suffer their problems. They are the kindest people in
the world, but they are killing themselves with kindness,'' he says.
In particular, of course, he is talking about our sugar-rich and
fat-rich diet and excess consumption of alcohol. The one good change he
has noticed in his quarter century of practising in Ayrshire is that far
fewer people now smoke.
To begin with, of course, naturopathy was regarded as a highly
suspicious form of crankiness. Inevitably, his patients were, and still
are, those who have run the gamut of orthodox treatment without success.
Now, however, some arrive at the suggestion of their GPs and many more
with their blessing.
Jan de Vries himself sees collaboration between orthodox and
complementary medicine as the way forward -- and in an ideal world, part
of the NHS.
''I do not think people should have to pay for treatment, but I also
think they should have choice. I have visited and worked in many
countries and the health service in the UK is still the best in the
world, despite its problems. What we should have is collaboration
between orthodox and alternative medicine. It is happening slowly with
osteopathy being recognised and registered within the NHS at last and
the number of conventional doctors who now use acupuncture.''
He puts this philosophy into practice in Newcastle where he works
within an NHS general practice. His ''clinic'' in Troon is the hub of an
international business with branches in Belfast, Preston, London and
Holland. Auchenkyle is a vast sandstone mansion in its own small estate
on the outskirts of Troon.
De Vries knows he is open to the charge of living an enviable
lifestyle on the back of gullible, sick people. He politely dodges
questions about money, saying that he robs Peter to pay Paul. Although
he has a flat-rate consultation fee of #14 (it was #1 when he started),
he also has a Harley Street practice where his patients are the rich and
famous.
He refers to ''filmstars'', a ''very famous singer'' and ''members of
the royal family'' but studiously avoids mentioning names, answering
''I'm not allowed to say'' to any hazarded name. He does not mention Mrs
Macsairback from Troon, either, of course, but does name ''an Irish
industrialist'' when asked.
He now has several staff at Auchenkyle, headed by his son-in-law, Dr
Tan, qualified in orthodox medicine as well several complementary
therapies. Dr Gissen, the medic to the Russian Olympic team, and his
psychiatrist wife also practise there. Another of his four daughters and
her husband, both osteopaths, run a clinic in north London.
''I am not interested in money,'' he insists. ''People ask how I
manage to live in this magnificent place, but it is not all from the
proceeds of the practice. We were able to sell our first clinic, my
wife's family home and buy a part of this house and then later we were
able to buy another part of it and return it to being one house.''
He does not hide his pride in it, happily showing off his organic
vegetable garden and his grandchildren's ponies. ''We sell the
vegetables in the coffee shop we opened for visitors. We do not make any
money out of it, by the way, quite the opposite. I insist on everything
being grown without pesticides or chemical fertilisers, so we need three
gardeners.''
He is consistent and quietly insistent. As a newly-qualified
pharmacist, preparing for a career in the drugs industry in 1959, he met
Dr Alfred Vogel, the Swiss naturopath and herbalist who changed the
course of his life. They have been colleagues ever since -- Dr Vogel, at
95, is still actively involved in research at his Bioforce plant in
Switzerland, mainly on plants gathered in the Alps.
Naturally Jan de Vries prescribes many Bioforce remedies as well as
other natural and homeopathic preparations, but has, he says, nothing to
do with the company. His interest in the properties of plants not
recognised by the Western world is as keen as ever.
The royalties from his books, which now number a couple of dozen, go
to research on plants in Third World countries. ''Nature has given us a
cure for every illness and most plants tell us what they should be used
for. For example, arnica is a wonderful remedy for trauma, because the
plant always springs back after being injured. I went to the Shetland
Islands and asked the old ladies what plants their mothers used to treat
illness and they said St John's wort. It is a very good remedy. People
do want more natural remedies and the knowledge that was once common is
returning,'' he says.
''I love people and I love helping them. This is a very emotional
celebration because I have invited the first 25 patients I had in
Scotland. One of them is a lady who came to me and said she had only one
month to live.''
Only one thing can stem Mr de Vries's enthusiastic flow of words on
every aspect of naturopathy and that is the arrival of his newest
grandchild and the confident, gentle cradling of that six-week-old
infant says more about his belief in the life force of nature than a
whole lecture tour.

Gala 6, Watsonians 37
INSTANT and profitable exploitation of offence kicks and the attack
variety and overall imprint created by their breakaway trio were
influential factors as Watsonians fashioned their fourth league win over
Gala from their last six meetings in a damp, error-strewn Netherdale
contest that spawned a state of rhythm wrecking stoppages.
Swift Watsonsians' reaction in taking tap kicks led to two of their
four tries. Another area of Watsonians' advantage was their more
productive lineout, despite conceding a number of offence kicks and the
opposition of Robert Hogg. Cameron Mather, mainly in midline, enhanced
his impressive overall work rate as well as calling the shots, and
Murray Rudkin was a practised aide. There was also variety in scrummage
ploy with which Gordon Hannah and John MacDonald embellished their own
dashing displays. Gala couldn't quite stay upsides, notwithstanding the
valiant efforts of Tom Weir in pick-up and John Amos in surging support.
There was more invention in Watsonians' back play and more searching
angles of running. Duncan Hodge supplied the tactical variations as well
as being more dependable in punting than either of the Changleng
brothers. Hodge also was on song in goal kicking, with seven successes
out of eight shots for four conversions, two penalty goals and a drop
goal.
That gifted footballer, Andrew Garry, in incisive form, conspired with
Scott Hastings in occasional midfield machinations that stretched Gala's
defence line while also combining with Hodge and their loose forwards in
keeping their own midfield door tightly closed.
In contrast, Gala's back play was somewhat pedestrian and they clearly
missed the sizzle that Gregor Townsend and Michael Dods can impart.
Townsend's brother Craig and Scott Paterson acted mainly as breakdown
targets for their forwards and were unable to release their very sharp
wings, Mark Moncrieff and Chris Dalgleish. Nor could Gala match the
occasional threats from the deep imposed by Gavin Hastings.
The first of David Changleng's two penalty goals, both for preventing
fair release, gave Gala an early lead and they should have benefited
more from the greater number of free and penalty kicks awarded to them.
By half-time, however, Watsonians were comfortably 17-3 ahead. Jamie
Weston tapped and burst as Gala slumbered and the gangling Gordon Hannah
thundered over for the first try. A decoy run by Scott Hastings enabled
the looping Garry to penetrate before sending Scott Hastings through
Malcolm Changleng's tackle for a beautifully worked score. The new
hooker from New Zealand, Si Farland, had a debut try after a break by
Graeme Inglis, a desperate save by David Boland, and a five metre
scrummage from which Hannah's pick-up was a key element. Dalgleish had
already thwarted another Watsonians' threat after a MacDonald scrummage
break and Hodge's deft chip ahead but there was no stopping MacDonald
when Gala's lineout offside enabled him to exploit another quick tap
kick and bullock over with ideal body angle.
Gala -- M Changleng; M Moncrieff, C Townsend, S Paterson, C S
Dalgleish; D M Changleng, D A Boland; G R Isaac, I Corcoran, H A Hunter,
G W Paxton, R B Hogg, N J Crooks, D T Weir, J P Amos.
Watsonians -- A G Hastings; G A Inglis, S Hastings, A R Garry, F M
Henderson; D W Hodge, E J W Weston; M B Stanaway, S Farland, S Mather, M
B Rudkin, D D Gray, C Mather, G Hannah, J D MacDonald. Temporary
replacement -- I Duncan for Hannah (26-29 minutes.)

Stirling Co. 9, Hawick 12
BRAVEHEART may have been the buzz word around Stirling at the weekend
as Mel Gibson and his Hollywood cronies made ready for yesterday's
William Wallace premier, but at Bridgehaugh on Saturday it was a
faint-hearted County who got their championship defence off to the worst
possible start.
Coach Brian Edwards admitted that he had considered the draw had been
kind to Stirling with a priceless home advantage for the first game of
the new-look season.
''If I'm honest, I have to say that I thought this was a banker, but
when I saw the boys in the dressing-room just before the kick-off and
realised how tense they were, I had an inkling that things might not go
to plan,'' he said.
The champions were strangely out of sorts and there will be those who
will take some pleasure in seeing the heroes from zero stumble at the
first hurdle. In truth, there was some, largely good-natured, banter
from Hawick supporters -- and remember, they've been here 10 times
before -- to the effect that the championship is a lot easier to win
than it is to defend -- but County know that this was a game they should
have won and that, for whatever reason, they have only themselves to
blame.
The rain, which fell incessantly throughout, played a significant role
in turning what should have been a curtain-raising spectacle into an
error-strewn wet blanket of an occasion.
Hawick came to terms with the conditions much more astutely than
Stirling and when Scott Welsh sent his soaring, left-footed drop kick
between the posts to resolve the 9-9 impasse in the final minute of the
game, justice, of sorts, had been addressed.
The Stirling forwards were slow to the breakdown and not even Kevin
McKenzie or Brian Ireland -- well versed as they are in the black arts
of close-quarter play -- could match the indefatigable Derek Turnbull.
The Hawick flanker, a policeman when not on duty with the Greens,
maintains a one-man neighbourhood-watch scheme. More often than not,
though, it is the neighbour's patch that he patrols.
Scott Welsh, who mastered the conditions with a profitable mix of boot
and break, did his hopes of further advancement no harm at all and in
Ian Elliot, Hawick had a fine forward.
Murray Fraser, making his debut at scrum half for Stirling, had one of
those days which he will want to forget. He is a better player than
this, a point acknowledged by Edwards who considered that, perhaps,
Fraser had been trying too hard.
Stirling now know, too, just how important a reliable goal-kicker is.
Mark McKenzie had a penalty goal and a couple of drop-goals, but he was
off target with four shots at goal and Logan with one from far out.
By contrast, Welsh had much the better strike rate, his brace of
drop-goals being augmented by a couple of penalty goals with only one
failure from three attempts.
He kicked Hawick into the lead after five minutes with his first
drop-goal and put them further ahead with a penalty goal 11 minutes
later. A Mark McKenzie penalty made it 3-6 at the interval at which
point Greig Oliver departed with a twisted knee and Mark Craig took up
position on the wing, Colin Turnbull moving to full back.
Mark McKenzie equalised with a drop-goal after 50 minutes but Welsh
put Hawick back in front with a penalty goal which dropped over via the
crossbar. Three minutes from the end a Logan run set up a lineout deep
in Hawick territory from which Mark McKenzie dropped a goal to put
Stirling back on a level footing. But then Welsh dropped that priceless
goal in 79 minutes to hand Hawick the victory of which, beforehand, they
must have considered they had only an outside chance.
Stirling County -- C Sangster; A S M Turner, I C Jardine, M
McGrandles, K M Logan; M McKenzie, A M Fraser; J J Manson, K D McKenzie,
G B Robertson, G Douglas, M Norval, G N Flockhart, J Brough, B Ireland.
Replacements -- C Brown for G Douglas (79 minutes).
Hawick -- G H Oliver; D Grant, C A Murray, A G Stanger, C W Turnbull;
W S Welsh, K Reid; B J McDonnell, J A Hay, A Johnston, I Elliot, A
Imray, D J Turnbull, B L Renwick, J Graham. Replacements -- M Craig for
Oliver (39), G Blacklock for Renwick (73).    Referee --  R J Megson
(Edinburgh Wanderers).

WELSH hooker Garin Jenkins will miss the first month of the new season
after becoming only the sixth Welshman to be sent off in a Test.
Jenkins and South African lock Kobus Wiese have been suspended for 30
days following Saturday's violence-marred game.
South Africa, playing for the first time since their Rugby World Cup
victory, crushed Wales 40-11.
Wiese was cited by the Welsh management for landing a haymaker from
behind on Welsh forward Derwyn Jones in the third minute, immediately
after flanker Mark Bennett had driven over to give Wales an early 5-0
lead. French referee Joel Dume and his touch judges didn't detect the
punch.
Jenkins, a half-time replacement for flanker Andrew Gibbs, was sent
off by Dume three minutes from time after punching Bok scrum half Joost
van der Westhuizen.
The players were called before disciplinary committees, consisting in
each case of the players' team manager and South African Rugby Football
Union representatives.
The SARFU's Edward Griffiths indicated that the union's management
committee, which meets on Thursday, could take further action against
Wiese. With the game now fully professional, the SARFU will decide
whether his actions warrant a financial penalty for breaching the
players' code of conduct built into the squad's new contracts.

SCOTLAND'S European Championship hopefuls gathered at Hampden
yesterday and tried to ignore the negative predictions which have come
from their opponents in the qualifying section.
The Scots have been written off by the players of the Faroe Islands
(though they have beaten them twice); told by the Greek team-manager
that they are only: ''a lucky team,'' and now dismissed by the Finnish
manager as a team without great ability.
Yet, as Scotland manager Craig Brown has pointed out: ''We are in a
position that other countries would like to be. It is in our hands and I
am not going to respond to what other people might say about us. What we
want to do is stuff it down their throats on the field.
''I don't want to say too much about their thoughts. We want to do our
talking on the field. As far as that is concerned we have shown what we
can do. The record is there. We have lost just one goal in our last
seven games.
''In our last 11 games we have lost just one, won seven, and drawn
three, and maybe that is something people should be looking at.
Incidentally, the game we lost was in Athens to a doubtful penalty.''
The words of new Finnish coach, Jukka Ikalainen, happy to write of
Scotland at the weekend, do not impress Brown. He looks at the group
games, the results there and sees a pattern which leads towards the
finals. Not that he is about to say so publicly.
Brown looks to his squad and seems to wonder at his good fortune that
less than half-a-dozen players are missing. Stuart McCall and Rob
McKinnon pulled out after the squad was named, and before that Paul
McStay and Duncan Ferguson were ruled out.
He will not pull anyone else in. Brown will go with the 19 players
already named. And he is convinced that they will deliver the result he
-- and the nation demands.
''The best way to silence criticism is by winning,'' said Brown. ''The
Russian coach has said that we are the team he believes will go through
to the finals along with them. That is good enough for me. Maybe some of
the other things we hear are sour grapes.
''In any case we have a group of players who have worked hard to get
into this position and will not give up on it. They want to get through
to the finals. Talk to Gary McAllister, Colin Hendry, any of the players
and you will get the same answer qualification means everything.''
Brown knows that the Finns may try to play a different game than the
one normally employed. But, to counteract that, he may move things
around, though exactly how he would was not outline yesterday.
To some extent it does not matter. Finland have lost all their major
games -- bar a home match against Greece -- and that must boost Brown's
hopes of qualification.
When they have been asked to produce something extra, they have
failed.
When Brown's unfancied side have been asked to do something similar,
they have produced.
That is the essential difference between the gritty Scotland side
Brown has moulded and the others who have craved second spot behind
Russia.
Yesterday, John Collins and Duncan Shearer declared themselves fit and
Brown has the opportunity to win with style. That was something that
striker Ally McCoist, whose goal against Greece won him the Bell's
Player of the Month award, decided he would like to see.
But with a barb aimed towards the Ibrox dressing room, the Scotland
attacker said: ''Niney minutes of Durrant could not win this award --
but 12 minuted of your old Ally gets it.''
Brown also collected an award and, in contrast to the ebullient
McCoist, dedicated it to the entire backroom staff of the national side.
But, then, none of them will score the goals which could take Scotland
to the finals, while McCoist promises: ''If I get the right service then
I can do the same as I did against the Greeks.''
Who would argue with that.

THE big fellow finally did it. From pantomime bit player, Frank Bruno
leapt to the pinnacle of his true profession at an emotion-charged
Wembley Stadium on Saturday night when he became heavyweight champion of
the world, a dream he had nurtured since boyhood, setting up a possible
#60m showdown with Mike Tyson.
Not since 1966, when England's footballer's won the World Cup, has the
old stadium witnessed such scenes of joy. Bruno, a three-time loser in
world-title challenges, showed the necessary grit, determination, and
skill to dethrone cocky, abrasive Oliver McCall, the World Boxing
Council champion from Chicago, on a unanimous points decision.
The judges, Australian Malcolm Bulner (115-113), Brazilian Newton
Campos (117-111), and Mexican Fay Solis (117-111), were, like myself, in
no doubt that one of Britain's most popular sporting figures had earned
his hour of greatness.
As the band of the Welsh Guards blasted out ''Land of Hope and
Glory'', fireworks soared over Wembley, streamers were launched in a
wild array of colour, and laser beams proclaimed ''Frank Bruno --
champion of the world.'' And Bruno wept.
''I'm sorry for being so emotional, but this means everything to me,''
said the man whose dream weas shattered by Tim Witherspoon, Mike Tyson,
and Lennox Lewis. He was bruised and battered, and hid a damaged eye
behind dark glasses, but he was not the only one in tears. Hundreds of
fans joined the big man in a wee greet, grateful, not only that he had
survived, but come through with flying colours.
Now Bruno could be in line for a staggering #60m fight with former
champion Tyson. American promoter Don King and his British partner,
Frank Warren, would not put a price on that fight the morning after but,
based on the figures for Tyson's much-heralded return against Peter
McNeely in Las Vegas last month, Bruno could break the bank some time
next year.
By then, pay-per-view television could be under way in Britain to add
more financial clout to that major meeting of heavyweight muscle.
Former champion Lewis, who lost on a sucker punch to McCall a year
ago, must, at some stage, figure in the WBC title shakedown by virtue of
his final eliminator victory in May, but the talk now is only of Iron
Mike.
''Tyson is bigger than Lewis,'' said Bruno. ''He is the nugget and
Lewis is a grain of sand on the beach. My main dream is another fight
with Tyson. I wasn't mentally ready when I fought him before -- I want
to end my career by beating him.''
Tyson could, by then, be in charge of the WBA title, as present
holder, Bruce Seldon, is emerging as a possibility for Tyson's March 16
date.
Tyson was informed by telephone of Bruno's success, and King said:
''Frank dropped the gauntlet on Tyson last night and he is ready to
accept.''
However, when all the patriotism and hype has burned out this latest
assault on the richest prize in sport has to be put into perspective.
Bruno, at 33, perhaps has just one good pay-day left, be it Tyson or
Lewis. The man has achieved his ambition, he has faced his date with
destiny and come through, but the real big boys are lining up.
To my mind, Lewis, Tyson, Riddick Bowe, and Evander Holyfield are the
top heavyweights at the moment. All would beat big Frank, who was lucky
enough to get his last chance -- and I am delighted for the man who
doesn't have an ounce of badness in him -- against someone as inept as
McCall.
Bruno should savour his next big pay-day. After that, I fear, his
career will be over. But having achieved what he has and got this
world-title obsession out of his mind, he will be able to settle down
and enjoy a normal life with his lovely family.
On Saturday night's historic success, Bruno said: ''It was very, very
tough. At the moment, I look like 'ET' gone wrong. If you gave me #20m
tax free, it wouldn't mean as much. Believe me, I'm history now. I've
got this belt, and if I never walk again, get shot, if I get run over,
this is history. My trainer, George Francis, told me McCall would come
at me like a madman, but all I had to do was survive.
''I hung in there. McCall was a very tough guy with a good chin. He
also punches hard. I don't want to get cocky. I want to be humble and
wear the world-title crown with dignity.
''I'm not in this world to prove things to people. I'm not an
egotistical person, but I've proved something to myself and my family.
You don't have to go to university. All you have to do is put hard work
into what you are doing, trust the Man above, and persevere and you will
get what you want.
''I knew I was going to win the fight. George Francis and the corner
kept pumping me up mentally, motivating me, telling me to be controlled.
You can see by my face it hasn't been easy. George has been in boxing
for 45 years and has got more tricks than a monkey. He's the best
trainer in the world.''
McCall was shown up for what he really -- a good, honest journeyman,
more suited to sparring with the superstars. He could do nothing against
Bruno's powerful jabs -- the Briton even switched to a southpaw stance
with equal success -- and it was only in the final two rounds, when
desperation drove him on, that he looked dangerous. I gave the champion
only three rounds, with eight to Bruno and one even.
''Good luck to Bruno,'' said McCall. ''We are always going to be
friends. I was a bit too relaxed, too comfortable, and suddenly I
realised I had to knock him out. I think I would have done that in the
twelfth round, if the referee had not let him keep holding.''
Quick-change artist Nigel Benn was one of Bruno's biggest fans at
Wembley, despite the fact that only moments before the main event, he
made a ninth successful defence of the WBC super-middleweigh title
against Danny Ray Perez, of North Carolina.
After having dispatched the American inside seven rounds, Benn was all
suited up and carrying the flag into the ring for Bruno. But Benn's
heart went out to Michael Watson and Gerald McClellan.
Afterwards, he went over for a word at ringside with Watson, who
suffered massive injuries in a fight with Chris Eubank four years ago.
Then, Benn said that if his unification fight with IBF champion Roy
Jones came off, he would give $1m to the stricken McClellan.
In the third world-title bout on the Wembley bill, American Virgil
Hill extended his dominance of the WBA light-heavyweight belt to 19
fights with a unanimous points decision over Canadian-based Drake
Thadzi, from Malawi.

I HAVE done my best. I have even increased the acreage of one of my
fields this year, and yet I cannot get the winter barley yield down
below 3[1/2] tonnes. In fact, we averaged 3.501 kilos over 88 acres.
That will do nicely.
Indeed, I would go so far as to say that with yields like that, we
could just about compete, as the Americans would have us do, at world
prices and without subsidies.
I put that to the lads on Sunday at the discussion group.
The very suggestion was greeted with a howl of protest. My view was
not popular even where it was shared. Mossie and the Red Rooster were
adamant that, while I could be right, it was the duty of every farmer to
deny it.
''Farmers are going through tricky times at the moment and it is only
the support of the taxpayer that is allowing some of us a decent living,
though there is no meaningful return on our capital,'' would just about
sum up their view.
But I was more impressed by Young Ochyoch. ''You maybe can survive,
farming on the balmy southern fringes, but about us in the wilds of
Central Buchan with nothing but our thrawnness to protect us from the
north wind?''
And this is where he really made me sit up. ''It's all very well for
you to say we could do without the subsidies but you've been at it for
thirty years.
''What about the younger lads that are just starting? When you've got
all these damned kids to feed and clothe, when you've borrowed over your
neck to get some land and some gear together, you need all the help you
can get.''
That profound thought has led me to develop a theory of the life cycle
of the farmer. It shows what a hard row we have to hoe and it shows
that, while there is always somebody creaming it with subsidies, there
are always others, at other stages in their metamorphosis, who need
every penny the Exchequer can spare.
I see the farmer going through seven stages, if he survives that long.
Stage one is when the young farmer prepares for the great day when he
takes up the reins. He learns all the skills of the trade. He may even
go to college for some book learning as well as developing the skills
which young ladies and barmen can impart.
All those things are done in stage one, but primarily, in my theory,
the prospective farmer saves.
Stage two starts when the old man finally moves over or even better,
moves out. If he has saved well and avoided marriage or married well,
the young farmer will enter stage two with a tidy little sum.
It will disappear very quickly, as he discovers that all those things
his father had on the farm were not, after all, there by magic. They had
to be paid for.
Stage three is the expansion phase in the farmer's life. All the
things his father did wrong are put right in phase three, or at least
that is the intention. The new machinery is bought. The new sheds are
put up. And the intensive unit is added.
But the thing that most expands in phase three is the overdraft. It
seems to be controlled by a ratchet. When there is a good year a new
shed is put up or the tractors are upgraded. When there is a bad year
the overdraft rises.
Stage four starts when the farmer's credit limit is reached.
Now, you must not imagine that what we are talking about here is the
farmer's overdraft limit. He will get one of those early on in his
career and through time will develop great skill in renegotiating it on
to higher and higher levels. On top of that he will discover that
equipment may be leased and that he can buy cattle at the mart and not
pay for them until he sells.
Stage four is only reached when the farmer can borrow no more and when
his creditors cannot be relied on to allow any further postponement of
payment.
Many go under in stage four but for the rest, the sooner stage four is
reached the better. For it is here that discipline enters the farmer's
file. Sums have to be done. Budgets have to be undertaken and stuck to.
Wonderful ideas which are losing money have to be abandoned.
Stage five has been reached when the farmer has a credit window. That
is when there is a time, be it ever so short, when, just after harvest
cheque has arrived, the farmer's overdraft is below its limit.
As stage five proceeds the farmer finds himself in a virtuous circle.
For a few weeks at first but for longer and longer each year he can shop
around for the cheapest instead of shopping where the salesman is the
most patient. And gradually the interest payments fall as the credit
window gets longer and longer.
Stage six is when, after the harvest cheque has gone in, there is a
day when there is no overdraft at all. That is when the farmer usually
dies. If not, stage six persists until the great day when the harvest
cheque arrives before there is any overdraft at all.
Then the farm business is mature. In stage seven, with no interest to
pay and able to pay cash for a quick deal, any fool can farm.
This year we entered stage seven. The Breadwinner and I took the
cheque down to the bank together and were happy.
It is true that we can manage without the subsidies but Young Ochyoch
is quite right. We wouldn't like to go back to stage one without the
support of the Exchequer.

WHERE better to hold a Festival of Walking than in the Border Uplands
where the sun and clouds chase each other across the sky and the
changing light makes the landscape always new?
This was one of the reasons behind the Scottish Borders Festival of
Walking, which starts on Saturday and runs for one week. It is based in
the village of West Linton, only some 20 miles south of Edinburgh.
Another great advantage about walking in the Borders is that it is so
varied.
Routes range from gentle, easy paths, through woods and along river
banks, to steep, rocky slopes where you need to go carefully -- not so
much rock climbing but occasional scrambling on scree -- and the sort of
forever-and-forever steep hill slope that calls for good fitness.
Nowhere is better for this sort of diversity than in Peeblesshire in the
north of the Borderland.
The idea was the brainchild of Iain McKinlay and Jane Dickson, who
both live and work in West Linton, and Roger Smith well-known walker
(and former editor of The Great Outdoors) who is now the Borders Walking
Development Officer.
Working through an active small committee, West Linton has come up
with a versatile programme of two or three walks a day for the week,
based in Upper Tweeddale, the Moorfoots and Broughton Heights. They
range from longer strenuous walks, through a middle range to easy short
walks ... with a bias towards the easier end of the scale.
''We don't have very steep and rocky terrain here,'' said Roger Smith.
''So we should appeal to a very wide range of people.''
On paper, the most exacting walk would seem to be Monday's stint up
Broad Law in Upper Tweeddale, only some 300ft below Munro height. In
practice, this is a big rounded hill but not difficult walking. The
inaugural walk on September 9 comes over the ridge from Peebles, and
some walks will follow a specific subject such as industrial archaeology
at Deepsyke Forest, where there were once many quarries and other
remains.
Three hundred years ago West Linton was at the heart of the great
streams of animals crossing the hills from farm to market to farm. At
its peak some 30,000 sheep passed through West Linton and the festival
organisers were already eager to revive these drove roads.
One of the most popular will be the Wednesday (September 13) walk
along Cauldstane Slap, the old drove road. These and other walks will
all be led by hillwalkers, rangers, or other specialist leaders. For
example, archaeologist Tam Ward will lead the Whiteside Hill Children's
Mini Walk of Discovery to an ancient fort. Buses leave West Linton
around 9.30 each morning to the various starting points, and for people
who prefer to walk independently, West Linton Festival Information
Office can advise on walks at all levels.
Sunday will have no walks, yet this is the time the festival expects
its biggest crowds for the country fair at Cottage Farm. In addition to
rural activities, the Finderlie Falcons will give a flying display, the
Gold Lions Army free-fall team will also take to the air, and the The
Clann will field armed skirmishes.
Keeping to the energetic outdoor aim is the Tweed Valley Search and
Rescue demonstration and a children's assault course. The week also
offers talks, activity days and a great ceilidh.
The festival will be fun but Iain McKinlay and his colleagues have a
serious purpose behind it. ''We want to show people this lovely West
Linton area, to educate walkers in the etiquette of the hills and open
spaces,'' he said. ''And to promote the tourist businesses in West
Linton.''
Nor is it planned as a one-off event. The idea is that next year
another Border town will hold the Border Walking Festival.
''And we shall hold a small West Linton Walking Festival, which
includes other activities'' Iain McKinlay added. It sounds a marvellous
idea almost the start of an outdoor walking chain letter.

PAUL Gascoigne will today try to convince Terry Venables that he is
ready to start for England for the first time in 18 months against
Colombia on Wednesday.
The jinxed midfield star looks well short of match fitness after a
groin problem restricted his British comeback with Rangers to just two
full competitive matches.
But Venables, with David Platt and Paul Ince missing, has not ruled
out Gazza stepping up from his three cameo Umbro Cup appearances,
saying: ''It's touch and go.
''He's a lot better than when he was with us last time. He would be
ready to start a match -- what I have to assess is whether he's ready to
take part in an international as well as he was before.
''But he's very close. He has surprised me -- I thought he might be a
little bit longer getting where he is today.
''I've got an open mind -- I don't have to pick the team until
Tuesday, so we'll have a really good session on Monday and after that we
should really know.''

GARY Armstrong was on pain-killers at home in Jedburgh yesterday
recovering from the sprung rib cartilage which cut short his premiership
comeback after just three minutes of Jed-Forest's home victory over GHK.
But it was the bitter pill of disappointment the scrum half was having
most difficulty coming to terms with.
''After all that I've gone through, I've learned that you have got to
take the good with the bad, but I haven't had much good come my way in
the last couple of seasons.''
Armstrong, who fought his way back to fitness after a devastating knee
injury sidelined him for a year, was felled on Saturday at only his
first touch of the ball.
''I landed on top of the ball and other players fell on top of me.
I've sprung a rib cartilage and shaved a bit off the ninth rib on the
right hand side. I was taken to the Borders General Hospital and they've
assured me that I can play again as soon as the pain subsides. They
reckon that will be in around three weeks,'' he said.
The Jed lorry driver, who only last week was named in the Scotland
squad as the first step along the way to winning back his Scotland
place, added: ''I'm determined that I won't let it get me down. It was a
freak injury and nothing more.
''What really sticks in my throat is the stuff that's in the Sunday
papers. They've got me being stretchered off and they're saying that
maybe I'm not up to it any more. That's a lot of havers.
''Of course it's a real sickener and I'd be lying if I said I wasn't
depressed about it, but I've got over worse and I've no intention of
giving up.''

Lunchtime O'Booze, fiddling his expenses while his editor burns with
fury
over missed deadlines, has wandered over Ludgate Hill and far away
TO some it was the Street of Adventure, to others it was the Street of
Shame. An outraged Charles Lamb called it ''a focus of vulgarity and
sedition''. J F Gore, who wrote a book about it in the 1920s, described
it memorably as ''a street of hasty judgment and elastic morality''.
For almost 500 years, it shaped world opinion with a blend of
unrivalled media power, notoriety, and sensationalism. Now Fleet Street,
as the mecca of British journalism, is no more.
After the diaspora of national newspapers to less glamorous locations
in the late 1980s, it was finally pronounced dead last month with the
departure of the Press Association to new offices in Victoria. The last
rites were administered by no less an authority than Journalist
magazine, which declared that the much-heralded End of Fleet Street had
become a reality with the loss of its last major news organisation.
Well, not quite. As the Journalist admitted, one small band of
reporters is still flying the flag of the Fourth Estate in its erstwhile
stronghold. They work in a narrow, red-brick building sandwiched between
the bookshop of the Protestant Truth Society and the ornate facade of St
Dunstan-in-the-west Church of England (which also serves the Romanian
Orthodox Patriarchal community).
On such hallowed ground at 185 Fleet Street stands the London outpost
of the D C Thomson empire, the Dundee-based company which produces 260
million newspapers and magazines each year. Four of its principal titles
are emblazoned artistically in mosaic on the front and exposed west side
of the building -- The Sunday Post, People's Friend, People's Journal,
and Dundee Courier.
For more than 50 years, it has also been publishing the Dandy and
Beano comics, the home of such perennial characters as Desperate Dan and
Corky the Cat. Thus the heritage of the street that witnessed great
battles between the forces of Northcliffe and Beaverbrook, and the
flight of Maxwell and Murdoch, has been left whimsically in the hands of
Dennis the Menace and his chums.
It is entirely appropriate that the D C Thomson building should be the
last bastion of journalism in Fleet Street since it appears to have
regarded the passage of time with polite indifference. The late
twentieth century, in return, has poked its nose into the warren of
little offices, endowed them with a few computer screens, and wandered
off. The result is a haphazard maze of cubicles on five floors,
connected by a narrow, wooden staircase, redolent with the musty scents
of old wood and newspapers and filled with Scottish east-coast accents.
It is a wonderful old place, evocative of the days when the facades of
nearby buildings were adorned with names such as News Chronicle and
Liverpool Post &amp; Echo.
Time is also a relative concept in its small conference room, where
the wall clock ticks along five hours behind GMT or seven hours ahead of
it, depending on your point of view. In keeping with this leisurely
attitude, the editorial staff of about 25 is less concerned with
''hard'' daily news than with feature stories about TV stars, members of
the royal family, and sporting personalities.
On a typical day last week, two fashion writers were preparing for a
trip to Florida, a reporter had gone to Essex to interview a woman whose
life had been saved by an emergency blood transfusion, and the royal
correspondent was trying to put together a piece about Mark Phillips.
''Something to do with horses, I suppose,'' she said.
It was hard to determine what the sports reporters were doing as they
were barely visible beneath mountain ranges of old magazines. The London
editor, Mr Ron Paton, was checking an interview with Joanna Lumley for
the Weekly News, and looking for diary items for The Courier.
Mr Paton, an amiable veteran journalist from Cupar, would not consider
himself an endangered species. However, he admits cheerfully to being a
rare bird -- the last remaining editor in Fleet Street. ''The street has
changed beyond all recognition in recent years but we still enjoy being
here,'' he said. ''We feel quite proud in a way. It is still a
prestigious address and it is a privilege to be able to work here.''
We are sitting in the conference room, beneath the paternal gaze of a
silver-haired David Coupar Thomson in a dark wooden frame. ''We have
become quite a tourist attraction,'' said Paton. ''A lot of tourist
buses stop in front of the building.''
As if on cue, an open-topped bus draws up outside the gothic-style
windows, a guide gestures towards us, and the video cameras focus on the
last newspaper office in Fleet Street. ''Perhaps we should apply for a
grant from the London Tourist Board,'' said Paton.
Yet, while there is still life in Fleet Street, the Scottish editor is
first to admit that the soul has gone out of it. ''It's entirely
different now. In the old days, you could hardly cross the street for
newspaper delivery vans and lorries bringing in the newsprint. The place
was buzzing round the clock with reporters and printers, and the pubs
were going hell for leather until the wee hours. Now the barristers and
bankers have moved in and it's deserted after six o'clock. Apart from
the occasional tourist, the street is dead at night.''
All of which leaves Mr Paton and his staff feeling a bit lonely at
times. ''A few of the older journos still come into El Vino's
occasionally to reminisce over a glass of claret but, generally, the
only time we meet colleagues on other newspapers is when we're out on
stories. They're not very happy in their new homes. They all miss the
street, which was like the heart of our profession. For many, it was
more than a place of work, it was a way of life.''
And so it was. From the day on which Wynkyn de Worde, the ''Father of
Fleet Street'', set up his printing press near St Bride's Church in
1500, it was a magnet for literary genius and all manner of colourful
characters seeking to enhance fame and fortune through the power of the
press.
One of its first authoritative news reports, from the King's Printer
at Blackfriars in September 1513, concerned an important event in
Scotland. The banner headline read: ''Hereafter ensue the trewe
encountre or Batayle lately don between Englande and Scotlande.'' The
dateline was Flodden.
The first daily newspaper, the Daily Courant, appeared in a bookshop
on Fleet Bridge on March 11, 1702. The new industry promptly received a
piece of salutary advice from Daniel Defoe. He said: ''Governments will
not be jested with, nor reflected upon. Learn this and you will
prosper.''
Then along came Samuel Johnson, critic, essayist, wit, and raconteur,
to lampoon the Government of the day with his elegant prose in
Gentleman's Magazine. Illuminated by this early torch-bearer of press
freedom, Fleet Street never looked back. The creed of ''publish and be
damned'' evolved long before Hugh Cudlipp coined the phrase. Voltaire
discussed interesting new theories with his chum, Lord Bolingbroke, in
one of the street's more notorious hostelries, Thomas Paine created a
sensation when a Fleet Street printer produced The Rights of Man, and in
1851 the New York Daily News appointed a Fleet Street correspondent who
was destined to make a name for himself. The name was Karl Marx.
By the end of the nineteenth century, a swarm of new publications had
transformed the narrow thoroughfare between the Strand and Ludgate Hill
into what Frederick Greenwood, proprietor of the St James's Gazette,
called ''a babel of competitive roarings''.
The era of the powerful press barons, the hard-nosed news hounds, and
the great foreign correspondents was in full swing. All along Fleet
Street, and in the maze of side streets leading down to Victoria
Embankment and spilling into Printing House Square, newspapers vied for
public attention with stories that created and destroyed reputations and
Governments. The power of the press had been firmly established by
William Howard Russell, whose dispatches from Crimea for The Times
brought down the Government of the day in 1855.
A century later, the likes of James Cameron and William Connor
(Cassandra) were setting standards of eloquence and integrity for
generations of cub reporters drawn to the most dynamic word factory in
the world.
It was Rupert Murdoch who signalled the end of Fleet Street in January
1986 when he defied the print unions and took four national newspapers
to Wapping. Other proprietors, anxious to take advantage of new
technology and cut costs, quickly followed his lead and by March 1989
none of the big national titles was left. One by one, they were followed
by the wire agencies, the magazines, and the radios.
Now all of the great printing presses, which once roared like the
engine rooms of coal-burning liners, are gone. The distinctive old Daily
Telegraph building at 135 Fleet Street is adorned with the discreet
brass plaques of banks and investment companies. A few yards away, one
of the saddest sights of all -- the black vitrolite and glass palace of
the Daily Express is empty and forlorn, its brilliance dulled by dust
and dirt, its brash self-assurance a fading memory.
The famous pubs -- the King and Keys, the Tipperary, the Punch, and
the Old Bell -- cater for a more abstemious and emotionally restrained
clientele of lawyers, bankers, and accountants, who go home long before
early closing times. A disgruntled Reuter correspondent, banished to the
agency's new offices in Gray's Inn Road, swears he will never return to
his favourite Fleet Street watering hole. ''Can't stand it anymore,'' he
said. ''It's full of pin-stripe suits hee-hawing at each other.''
Simmonds Bookshop opposite Fetter Lane still has textbooks on
Interviewing for Journalists, and Practical Newspaper Reporting, but
they are bought by students who will never work in Fleet Street.
Mr David Simmonds, the proprietor, laments the passing of what he
regarded as a press village. ''There used to be all sorts of eccentric
characters around. Now the bankers and barristers have moved in and it's
all sandwich bars and building societies. The vitality has gone. It's
just an ordinary commercial street now.''
So farewell then, Lunchtime O'Booze. The famed caricature of an
inebriated Fleet Street journalist, fiddling his expenses while his
editor burns with fury over missed deadlines, has wandered over Ludgate
Hill and far away.
All that remains of 500 years of illustrious history are a few statues
and busts -- of Johnson, Northcliffe, Reuter -- and, of course, the D C
Thomson outpost. In its conference room, Mr Paton said reassuringly:
''The company owns this building so there is no reason for us to leave.
We'll be staying. There is no chance of us moving out of Fleet Street.''
Dennis the Menace is, thankfully, as defiant as ever.

THE main economic indicator of the week is July's industrial
production, due on Wednesday.
James Capel's Adam Cole is looking for a rise of 0.5% helped by a
sharp recovery in North Sea oil output, which was hit by maintenance
work carried out in June.
The manufacturing component is expected to continue its recovery with
a 0.3% advance, but the annual rate of increase would fall from 2.3% in
June to 2.1%. The annual rate of growth in industrial production would
pick up from 1.7% to 1.9%.
Money supply figures, due today, should show that narrow money, M0,
rose by 0.9% last month, taking the annual rate up from 5.8% to 6.3%.
The movements are expected to be dominated by bankers' balances rather
than notes and coins in circulation. A $50m rise in the official
currency reserves has been pencilled in.
The meeting between the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Kenneth Clarke,
and the Governor of the Bank of England, Eddie George, takes place on
Thursday. The Governor may decide there is no point in repeating his
demand for higher interest rates.
TODAY -- M0 (August); Reserves (August).
TOMORROW -- None announced.
WEDNESDAY -- Industrial production (July).
THURSDAY -- CBI distributive trades survey (July).
FRIDAY -- None announced.

A STRING of major companies having December year-ends report their
first half-results this week, kicking off with Burmah Castrol and Rugby
Group today, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Recovery in chemicals, favourable currency factors and firm growth at
Castrol should translate into good figures from Burmah Castrol, with
analysts projecting between #56m and #62m against #50.5m last time. The
interim dividend should go up by around 10%.
There are expected to be some dull areas like fuels and liquefied gas
shipping but these will be easily outweighed by a good performance from
the premier brand in the portfolio, Castrol, and by the Foseco chemicals
business.
Rugby's management is well thought of but it is having to contend with
a weak construction market in the UK. The US and Australian interests
should be doing better and a small advance in profits to #38m is hoped
for. There may even be a small improvement in the interim dividend.
On Thursday figures from Blue Circle will make an interesting
comparison. Its dominance of the UK cement market, of which it has about
half, should enable it to weather the UK recession better but again it
will be the overseas activities which offset dullness at home so that
profits are expected to be a fifth higher at #106m.
Yet more gloom from the housebuilding sector is guaranteed when Wimpey
reports on Tuesday, with estimates going from break-even to #2.5m,
against #7.5m. But the interim dividend should be held at 2p. More
detailed news on the Scottish housebuilding scene will come with CALA's
full-year figures on Friday.

THE oil and gas industry focus during the coming week will be firmly
on Aberdeen as 1800 exhibitors from 22 countries put their expertise on
show at Offshore Europe 1995 but for many Scottish companies it could
provide a passport to a worldwide market.
There are huge opportunities opening up for companies who have
developed to meet the changing demands of the North Sea industry to
expand to developing frontiers where their capabilities are required.
This is the 12th Offshore Europe event and companies to a large extent
are trying to pinpoint their prospective customers or partners before
the event starts so that when the doors open they can get straight down
to the business.
Scottish Enterprise is trying to help in this area and although its
efforts continue all year round -- it has just entertained a
high-powered delegation from Vietnam -- Offshore Europe is a key event
for them.
''Increasingly we value inward missions because we can control them,''
said Hamish Dingwall, head of oil and gas for Scottish Enterprise
National. ''When you get them to Aberdeen you can direct them to
appropriate companies.''
It is bringing delegations from Venezuela, Azerbaijan and Russia who
will provide SEN with a technology breakdown of what they do in their
own countries and what they are looking for in Aberdeen.
SEN will then try to match them with appropriate companies in Aberdeen
so that their visit is as beneficial as possible. ''We have had several
examples of business being won, mainly in the drilling and oil services
and sub-sea engineering side,'' said Mr Dingwall.
''Scottish companies are increasingly receptive to exporting. Four
years ago the big message we tried to get across was: 'We think you
should export.'
''Now the companies are saying they accept the argument that exporting
is important for their future and asking: 'Where should we go?'
''We think an important role for us is to help them identify where to
go and to choose two or three specific markets.
''Small companies should be looking at three or a maximum of four
markets and focusing in on the areas of activity where there is the best
chance of winning work because it does take 18 months to two years
before something significant happens.
''The Venezuelans coming this time are returning after a successful
inward mission two years ago. Two of the six companies are returning for
more of the same and we find that really encouraging because they
wouldn't be coming back unless it was really worthwhile to them.''
SEN already has two joint venture offices in Moscow with Scottish
service and supply companies and one in Azerbaijan. Its next likely
location for an office is South-east Asia. ''That is the area showing
the highest growth rates for international spend and is an area of the
world which, when you do reviews of companies, is where they want to
go,'' said Mr Dingwall.
''However, for this Offshore Europe, we are concentrating on Russia,
Venezuela and Azerbaijan. In these parts of the world our strategy is to
tackle high barriers to entry but with high potential for business.
''There is little point in us helping companies to work in America
where they speak English or in Holland which is just across the water
but in places like Venezuela, you can add value to your activities.
''Other areas we are focusing on are Malaysia and Vietnam. The logic
behind that is that in Vietnam, for example, it is largely an offshore
market and in fairly deep water so technologically it is very
compatible.
''Companies working in the North Sea have a much easier way of
transferring their technology across to Vietnam. The Vietnamese appear
to us to be very competent, highly qualified and demonstrably clear
about the way they want to develop their offshore market.
''The companies are realistic because winning work is hard. It
requires human resource and spend and it also requires more and more to
understand the culture of the country you are working in. It is
important to realise that in South America things sometimes don't happen
as quickly as they happen here.
''If you are one of these people who gets uptight because a meeting is
running late, then forget it.''
Andres Revesz, manager of industrial promotions for the Venezuelan
State Oil company Petrolas de Venezuela, is in Aberdeen for Offshore
Europe and he said he welcomed the links which were being established.
Mr Dingwall said that the days of direct exports were over and the
companies were looking for trade development through joint ventures.
''Companies want to go back down to Venezuela and add value through
technology. When they have added value the Venezuelan and Scottish team
then want to go and sell in Argentina.
''It is a win-win situation. It is not about pushing equipment in a
one-way deal, it is about joint trade development and that way you can
use Scottish technology, local business infrastructure, local language
skills, local contacts to go and hunt together.''
Around 30,000 visitors from 70 countries are expected to attend the
event which opens tomorrow at the Exhibition and Conference Centre.

ROBIN and Fiona Wallace are a young couple, living in idyllic
surroundings, with two young sons. They have a beautiful home and their
own business.
There is a downside, of course. Blair, their three-year-old, is one of
those youngsters who from earliest days seemed to thrive on a minimum
amount of sleep. Mum and dad wilted under that regime. Now they have a
second son, only three weeks old and their fervent hope is that he will
develop a better sleep pattern.
The big thing missing from their lives, however, is not sleep but that
comparatively recent invention of the EU -- sheep quota.
Robin and Fiona farm at Mains of Collin, near Auchencairn on the
Solway coast, and would appear to qualify twice as victims of the
current sheep quota regulations. They fit into two sections of what is
known as category three -- that part of the regulations which stimulated
the National Farmers' Union in England to raise a High Court action
which successfully proved that the Government's interpretation of the
rules was ''unlawful''.
Most of the concern for quota victims has centred on category 3c --
people who wanted to increase the size of their flocks but were not
allocated additional quota to cover their development plans.
The Wallace's position is different. They represent categories 3a and
3b -- (a) people who moved on to land where quota had been removed by
the previous occupant and (b) new entrants claiming quota for the first
time.
In November 1993, at the age of 27, Robin was thrilled to get the
tenancy of Mains of Collin. He had served there first as the lambing
person and latterly as farm manager. The retiral of the then tenant
allowed him and Fiona to move into the big house as tenants in their own
right.
Life was good. They had 900 acres which qualified for 842 units of
sheep quota and 60 units for suckler cows. The departing tenant had
retained the quota but they were happy to lease it from him, confident
that in 12 months time they would get their own allocation from the
national reserve.
''The bank wasn't too keen on us without the quota,'' says Robin. The
bank's concern was to protect the cash flow which came from Sheep Annual
Premium -- paid only on ewes for which quota was held.
So Robin paid #11 a unit for 842 units. ''It meant that about half of
the money we got in SAP went on leasing quota,'' he said. ''At that time
I thought if I did get an allocation from the national reserve I could
recoup my costs by sub-leasing out my extra quota.''
He now feels he must have been very naive to think that. Having leased
in quota for 1994 and 1995 he is faced with the prospect of repeating
the exercise again -- by which time he will have spent enough money on
leasing to have financed an outright purchase.
He had developed a monthly routine of telephoning the Scottish Office
Agriculture Department at Pentland House in Edinburgh for an update on
his chances of receiving an allocation from the national reserve. ''I
was told I would be getting 75%-80% of my claim -- but the following
week it was announced that everything was frozen because of the outcome
of the English court case.''
Robin describes his plight as being akin to having to pay double rent.
It is galling, he says, to think that for the same money he could, in
theory at least, have a second farm. As it is, he is irritated at the
thought that money which could have been invested on maintenance,
repairs, machinery or hired help is being diverted into leasing quota.
Fiona shares his irritation but is sceptical about one of Robin's
proposed solutions -- that those farmers who already have quota should
be asked to forego 1% of it so that it can be re-distributed to people
in their position.
''It is something these producers were given at no cost to
themselves,'' she says. ''Just listen to the stink if it starts being
taken off them again. It seems that the Government was very shortsighted
when the regulations were drawn up. They didn't leave enough in the pot
for new entrants. I think it is shocking that quotas can be dished out
to farmers and overnight it becomes an asset.
''In a short time they can sell up and accumulate all that money from
nowhere. All they have done is fill in a form saying they have so many
sheep -- and they get thousands of pounds courtesy of the Government.''
Robin also argues that SAP should only be paid on ewes which are kept
to produce lambs -- not those which are bought in for finishing and
eventual consignment to the mart. Such a change, he argues, would
release a lot of quota.
The couple's problems have been compounded by the one quota allocation
they have been given -- for 60 suckler cows. They already have 45 cows
but will have to acquire another 15 in order to maintain their right to
quota. That means committing a further #12,000 or so of capital on top
of the #11 a unit they expect to pay for leasing sheep quota. They have
trimmed that back to 300 units, hoping still that they will receive some
sort of allocation from the reserve.
''We are being forced to decide between sheep and cows,'' says Robin,
although so far he has managed to keep the farm stocked at its previous
quota level.
Robin, whose working day can stretch from 5am to 10pm, says he is
becoming increasingly disillusioned. Sometimes he considers packing up
and emigrating. Less drastically, he contemplates a move back into farm
management. ''Here we are, all ready to go great guns and it is the
Government that is cutting us down at the knees,'' he says.
The couple contacted Ian Lang, then Secretary of State for Scotland,
who is also their local MP. ''He didn't tell us anything we didn't
know,'' says Robin. They have since written to the new Scottish
Secretary, Michael Forsyth, and to Agriculture Minister, the Earl of
Lindsay.
Fiona, who does the farm books and helps with lambing, has contributed
to their financial position through a bed-and-breakfast ''sideline''.
That is in abeyance at the moment following the arrival of their new
baby. It is the B&amp;B, she says, which put carpet on the floor and
provides what small luxuries they have.
''We deserve the chance to get going,'' says Fiona. ''How many other
industries would put up with hanging about like this? When we did our
sums before moving in here we thought sheep quota would have been sorted
out by now.
''The Government is supposed to be all for creating jobs in rural
areas to support the shops and schools and communities,'' says Robin.
''We want to take on another man and create a livelihood for another
family in this area -- but we can't afford to. For me now the choice is
between persevering with the farm, and missing out on the family, or
doing something else and enjoy my sons growing up.''
Fiona admits, however. ''It would break my heart to leave here. What
better place to bring up children.''

There's deer upon the mountain,
There's sheep along the glen,
The forests hum with feather,
But where are now the men?'
SO questioned Neil Munro, but he hadn't reckoned with Dan Dowell. Take
the morning air along the Commonty Beat on the River Dee near Banchory
and by good fortune you might encounter Dan, you having your rod cased
and about God's legitimate business, and he will tell you of the ways of
that river, the finest salmon river in the British Isles. If the gael is
on him he will tell you that Uisge Dhe, the Water of Deva is home to the
river goddess, the salmon's Highland Court.
True to its Gaelic name the Aberdeenshire Dee wells from a spring, the
Wells of Dee, in a wild corrie on the bleak, weather-beaten summit of
the Cairngorms, gathering its waters in a small burn through the defile
of the Lairig Glen, the Pass of the Druie Burn, remotest and highest
hill-pass in the whole of Scotland. In its descent the Lairig Burn meets
the Gharbh Choire Burn at the foot of Cairn Toul forming the river Dee
which flows down Glen Dee between Cairn Toul and Ben MacDui, a true
Munro.
The Dee continues its course through the Cairngorm Nature Reserve,
past The Forest of Mar and the Chest of Dee, where it turns east to be
joined by the Geldie Burn near the White Bridge. Within three miles it
tumbles into the Linn of Dee, a progression of small rocky gorges which
provide temporary shelter for salmon waiting the most favourable water
temperature before braving their migratory passage. The Linn is the only
natural obstacle on the river. From here to the sea the Dee presents no
further obstruction.
Highland winters can be severe and spring comes late to the glens. By
April the temperature of the river can rise enough to tempt fish to the
Linn. Another crucial factor is the river flow increased by the melting
snow from the high tops. The best of the Linn pools is the Rock Pool.
Eight miles separates the Linn from Braemar, famous for its Highland
Gathering. This stretch of the river is joined by several tributaries:
the Lui Water and the Quoich Water from the north; the Ey Burn and the
Water of Clunie from the south. Downstream from Braemar the Dee flows
through a pleasant green valley, in parts thickly wooded, giving privacy
to Balmoral.
Near Balmoral is Crathie where the royal family enjoy Sunday worship
with their friends and tenants. Along the foot of Lochnagar ranges the
famous ancient pine forest of Ballochbuie, home to the red squirrel and
pine marten. Wild cats make their lairs on the higher ranges.
The true wild cat like the pine marten suffered from the game
ascendancy of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and so great was
the reduction in numbers by the traps and guns, and even poisons of the
gamekeepers that by 1914 it was rare to see a specimen south of the
Great Glen. Chief among the enlightened landowners are the royal family.
The forest of Ballochbuie has never been felled due to the
intervention of Queen Victoria who purchased Balmoral in 1878. To her
the forest was ''the bonniest plaid in Scotland'', an allusion to its
exchange for the tartan plaid. The vast lonely sweeps of Lochnagar are
purpled by the heather in late August. Originally known as the White
Mounth, Lochnagar is derived from Loch nan Gobhar, the Loch of the
Goats, recently given nationwide publicity by Prince Charles' book, The
Old Man of Lochnagar.
Between Ballater and Aboyne the Dee has many fine pools where salmon
rise to fly and early in the year to the spinner. Opposite to Banchory
the Water of Feugh joins the Dee. This is one of the Dee's larger
tributaries, providing good sea trout runs. The Falls of Feugh are a
famous tourist attraction where the cascading picturesque waters come
alive with salmon battling their way through the turbulent waters. For
my money it would be Banchory for a short stay.
It was here that I first met the famous Dan over a glass of his
favourite tipple, MacAllans of Glenlivet. Dan is now 80-years-old and he
says that given enough of his golden therapy he will live for another
80. If Scotland had another 20 Dan Dowells, our tourist industry would
greatly benefit because once you know, that man Dan, you have to come
back for more of his wisdom. If he likes you he will present you with
the famous Dowell, a lethal spinner of his own invention.
Dan's biggest catch on the River Dee was 34lbs, with the fly, in 1989.
He told me that a great many fishers had their photographs taken with
the same salmon and then published in London magazines with the claim
that they had caught it. A man right out of Neil Munro.

THREE weeks and about 60 concerts ago, Claudio Abbado and the Gustav
Mahler Youth Orchestra opened the Edinburgh Festival with a performance
of Bruckner's Ninth Symphony that was all fire, vitality, guts, and
earthy commitment. On Saturday night, Gunter Wand and the NDR Symphony
Orchestra from Hamburg closed the Festival with a performance of the
same composer's Eighth Symphony that came from a different philosophical
standpoint, and from a different age.
Bruckner's music, with its multiple and cumulative climaxes, can be
played easily to the gallery. Focusing on the climaxes -- which are
long-range -- and aiming at them, can make for incredibly exciting
listening. Gunter Wand's version of the Eighth, predictably, eschewed
the short-term, quick fix, ready-thrill type of performance.
Conjuring up ghosts from the past -- great and solemn conducting
figures -- the remarkable octogenarian took the longest possible view of
Bruckner. The 90-minute symphony, though it is cast in four separate
movements, was a single span, epic and intense from its opening. Even
the relatively fast music of the Scherzo seemed to be accommodated
within Wand's patient and endlessly-spacious conception.
At the core of the symphony, the half-hour-long slow movement, the
full richness of the NDR Symphony Orchestra -- rather weak on woodwinds,
but with a fathomless depth of string sound -- spread through a
spellbound Usher Hall like a vast, plush carpet. Wand's sustaining of
the music through to the throaty eruptions of the finale was
extraordinary; you could almost sense him holding the shape of the
entire structure in his mind.
How does he do it? Ultimately it's indefinable. But you can hear the
meticulous preparation in every bar. The great man insists on a 10-day
rehearsal period for each concert, roughly five times as much as is
often the case. (Even the mighty Berlin Philharmonic, after some
protest, recently and finally succumbed to Wand's preconditions in order
to get him to Berlin.) It shows; in every fibre and pulse of the music.
A majestic end to one of the most interesting Festivals for years.

AS a performer, Joan Armatrading is like one of these people you take
an instant and perhaps irrational aversion to. On the surface, she has
done little to offend, surviving over 20 years with her outwardly
tasteful, apparently quality songs.
Such assumptions, perhaps those which mean someone with only two
serious hits in 21 years can still draw a sizable and enthusiastic
audience, are shattered by the evidence of this show. Superseded by just
about every female songwriter who has lifted an acoustic guitar in the
interim, Armatrading's weaknesses are all too apparent.
It's over half-an-hour in before Love and Affection brings the first
semblance of a tune to the proceedings. What has gone before is
musicianly overkill making up for the absence of anything memorable in
songs, a barrage of keyboards and percussion masquerading as someone's
idea of funk.
Even the old chestnut itself is badly performed -- pared down and
punctuated by bad backing vocals and a lengthy sax solo. After welcoming
us to the ''first night of her English tour'', she then embarks on a
seven-song trawl through her new album, What's Inside.
Accompanied only by keyboards, violin, and cello the musical setting
was at least more pleasing on the likes of Merchant of Love and Everyday
Boy, even if it also served to highlight the dearth of imagination and
lack of emotion in the often self-pitying songs and lyrics.
The closing Drop The Pilot, Show Some Emotion, and Me Myself I are
both crowd-pleasing and bombastic as the musicians contort their faces
in what looks like pain. Soulless and songless, this is almost certainly
the worst show the concert hall will play host to this year.

GRIEG, as we are reminded whenever a Scandinavian soprano decides to
champion him, was one of the great song writers. So it was to everyone's
profit that Solveig Kringelborn, replacing an indisposed Karita Mattila
on Saturday morning, devoted half of her programme to little-known Grieg
songs.
Kringelborn is not only Scandinavian, but Norwegian, which brought her
even closer to the music she was singing. In what might have been an
embarrassingly pastoral ''cow-call'', and in the eight songs that form
Haugtussa (The Mountain Maid), she showed how subtly Grieg could
transform rusticity into artistry, and how effectively she herself could
ring the changes between humour, romance, and melancholy.
In a selection of Nielsen, Sibelius, and Rangstrom songs, it was
Sibelius's frighteningly powerful, sombre, and obsessive Hostkvall
(Autumn Evening) that stood out -- music with the force of Munch's
Scream. Here, too, the young soprano seemed in her element, successfully
shedding the gustiness that damaged her account of two rather less
interesting Rangstrom songs at the start of her programme.
In a pair of Mozart operatic extracts, presumably included to give her
listeners something they already knew, she also sounded uneasy. Though
her printed biography claimed her to be an experienced Mozartian, these
arias from Figaro and Cosi were so unevenly voiced that her decision to
omit a promised excerpt from Idomaneo seemed wise. On Saturday's
evidence, the role one would really like to hear her sing would be Senta
in Wagner's Flying Dutchman.

TODAY will see the publication of Fisons' first defence document
against the #1700m offer from the French-owned Rhone-Poulenc Rorer (RPR)
of the US, writes CHRISTOPHER SIMS.
Chief executive Stuart Wallis will maintain that the offer badly
undervalues Fisons' asthma drug delivery systems and that the group will
do better with its strategy of concentration on marketing through buying
and licensing drugs made by others.
RPR says this strategy will not work. Much credibility would be added
to the group's plan if it could unveil an actual licensing deal. It is
thought that some are in the offing but may not be completed in time.
The defence document will not include Fisons' first-half figures which
will be published a few days later, helping to keep the group's name to
the fore.
RPR is believed to be anxious to talk with Fisons to discuss securing
agreement to a slightly higher bid and Mr Wallis has indicated he would
be prepared to consider a better price than the 240p cash per share on
the table.

THE doors of the church are locked. Is there anybody there? Howlings,
straight from the pages of Conan Doyle, can be heard. Coming nearer. The
doors part -- and the expected hound is, in fact, a man, barking and
yowling as he rounds us up.
Everything about this Gothic happening -- staged by Throttle Theatre
Company from Sydney, Australia -- is geared to disconcert. Dressed in a
variety of long, hooped skirts -- men too -- they present a brilliantly
crazy dance installation that exploits every aspect of the church
interior. They rise up from the hidden spaces between pews like unquiet
spirits. They enact strange meetings and partings, set up a bizarre
banquet, an operatic recital where the diva trills Wagnerian scribble.
And when they vanish, it's as if we awake from some strange, shared
dream.

Frankfurt, Sunday -- About 70,000 workers at Volkswagen were gearing
up for more strikes on Monday as the German car-maker said it was
discussing plans to possibly cut up to 30,000 jobs in the next four
years, writes JOHN GILARDI.
Volkswagen said today that the walkouts, ranging from an hour to a
full day over the past month, have cost the company around DM130m (#57m)
and has delayed production of at least 5000 of its Passat, Polo and Golf
models.
The job actions, planned before wage talks expected to resume on
Tuesday, will target all six of the company's west German production
plants and also its historic headquarters in Wolfsburg.
Officials of IG Metall, Germany's largest union and negotiator for
VW's 100,000 employees in west Germany, warned the company against
pressing what it called excessive demands. ''The patience of our
colleagues is at an end,'' said IG Metall deputy chairman Walter
Riester.
Other union officials have said a deal must be struck soon after a
month of failed talks or company workers would put up a fight the likes
of which management has never seen.
Volkswagen, trying to cut labour costs that its says have hurt its
international competitiveness, has called the walkouts unreasonable and
an unnecessary blow to production and urged workers to compromise.
The company said at the weekend it was still reviewing plans to
possibly cut about 30,000 positions in the next four years in a bid to
boost productivity by 30%.
Volkswagen spokesman Otto-Ferdinand Wachs said no concrete plans for
workforce reductions have been proposed but said cuts would occur at a
faster pace if the union stands by its demand that workers remain on the
current four-day work week.
The four-day work week was agreed two years ago as a measure to save
jobs at the car-maker, but the company still plans to eliminate about
6000 jobs in 1995 through attrition. -- Reuter.

A LOT of dance has passed under the seat of Douglas Hamby and Sandra
Lacy. Their biogs, on the back of the programme sheet, list the
activities of more than 20 years in the profession. So, they know what
they are doing, probably.
Fine. They are efficient dancers, she especially has an excellent
technique and the disciplined body to sustain it. But it's what they do
that gives them away. It somehow suggests that long-time experience
can't necessarily take the place of inspiration or creative
individuality. His choreography was competent but not -- even when set
to the glorious strains of Von Williams's hymn tunes -- particularly
expressive or compelling. ''Nice'' dance, danced nicely. I'm afraid it
isn't quite enough, especially when Edinburgh was alive with really
excellent dance.

ANOTHER solo pianist might have refused to continue with a broken
string but Gonzalo Rubalcaba used the resulting fuzzy twang in the
higher register for his own ends, here inserting it humorously, there
giving a phrase an odd piquancy.
Using the sound of the piano is what this Cuban is all about anyway --
in almost silently reflective as well as big rumbling moments. Neither
could he be called predictable: his progressions are often bewildering,
but he plays with such a lovely, spare touch that makes the suspense all
the more engrossing, his teasing out and eventual confirmation of the
Beatles' Here, There and Everywhere and his gleeful toying with
Perfidia's melody being but two splendid examples of a talent that, next
time, will surely play to a larger audience.

HE felt free without a bass, and away from his habitual power trio
format, he (and we) could concentrate on the glories of that voice.
Because it is glorious. Few others can invest a blues with such a potent
mixture of rejection, dejection, and defiance, or get these debauched
choirboy tones around the intricacies of the surprise encore Pieces of
Mind without sounding contrived.
As on his new album, Monkjack, this was Bruce as singer/pianist, with
the mighty Bernie Worrell smearing Hammond organ comments, chokes, and
churchiness around like Polyfilla. They are clearly still working on the
formula so there were occasional lapses into self-indulgence. But there
were many magical moments, none more so than Folksong, which 25 years

GLASGOW used to have a reputation for excellence in the visual arts.
Now it's gaining a name for perversity. The city is teeming with talent:
bright, award-winning, innovative artists, young and old, but their work
is ignored; never bought by Glasgow Museums.
Yet the city is offering flights and hotel accommodation to Scottish
journalists so they can go to London tomorrow to hear about Glasgow's
commitment to art and design. Is it all a sick joke? Certainly it's
making the city a laughing-stock.
Tomorrow -- in London -- Glasgow officials launch the city's Festival
of Visual Arts 1996. I hope it's a success -- but already I fear the
worst.
To make any art festival work, you must first involve artists. Seems
obvious. But a detailed trawl through Glasgow's artistic community, from
George Wyllie to Douglas Gordon and John Heuston, from Glasgow Print
Studio to Transmission and the Glasgow Galleries Group, drew a blank.
''What launch?'' they replied.
With the exception of a privileged four, no artists have been
consulted, much less invited. It makes a mockery of Glasgow's reputation
for grassroots involvement. This festival is definitely imposed from on
high.
So why? And why London? The fact is Glasgow's Festival of Visual Arts
is aimed at the tourist trade. It's an economic, not an artistic,
venture. In the 1980s the city's painters put Glasgow on the map. Now
officials are out to capitalise on that. They are using art and artists
to boost Glasgow's profile. Fine. But there should be some give and
take. So far it's a one-way street.
In the official race for accolades -- and cash -- Glasgow actually
lost the title of Visual Arts UK and is merely thumbing its nose at the
real winner, the Northern Region around Newcastle with its #80m budget
who held their launch at the Tate Gallery in May with Heritage Secretary
Stephen Dorrell, Tony Blair, and Melvyn Bragg. Glasgow's ''personality'
for tomorrow's launch was to be amateur English painter Beryl Cook. Now
it's a game-show hostess from Wheel of Fortune. Embarrassing to put it
mildly.
It also seems silly to try to drum up razzmatazz over a failed bid.
How would Glasgow have felt if say, Sheffield, had also decided to be UK
City of Culture 1990? But back in January 1992 when we lost the Visual
Arts UK title, Pat Lally announced, ''Glasgow will do it anyway.''
So what exactly are they going to do? So far things have not gone
smoothly. Ten days ago there was no fixed date or London venue; no hotel
for the 25 officials on this freebie; no cast list for the launch.
Every cloud has a silver lining -- so they say. Rabbits do pop out of
hats. Until tomorrow's London press conference things are officially
under wraps but The Herald can exclusively reveal that Adrian
Wiszniewski is decorating the top floor and restaurant of the new
Gallery of Modern Art, while London-based Scot, Bruce McLean, is going
to transform Argyle Street with catwalk, running track, seating, Irn Bru
bar, floating roof, dance-floor, and projection screens for film and
video on the shop facades: ''A space for Glasgow people to posture and
pose''.
The Famous Four -- Campbell, Wiszniewski, Currie, and Howson -- are
painting new pictures, all the same size, for Glasgow Royal Concert Hall
to replace Ian McCulloch's controversial 1990 murals. (Wiszniewski's
shows a colourful quartet of musicians; Campbell's Mount Rushmore with
heads of music personalities instead of politicians.)
Wiszniewski had 48 hours to produce an 11ft x 8ft oil painting to be
unveiled at the launch. ''Luckily I already had a canvas ready for a
picture I'm doing for Liverpool Cathedral.'' Our photograph shows him
sitting in front of it, just hours after it was finished, with the paint
still very wet, before being loaded on to a van for London. ''It's a fun
piece; bright -- like a poster or a school teaching-aid on picking tea
in Ceylon. It's called Art &amp; Philosophy and shows a tutor and students.
It's about ways of seeing: angles, elipses, spirals, intersections, all
the things you get taught about art. I've taken the micky with a
conceptual half-empty/half-full glass of water. The sculptural object on
the left? That's modern art!''
McLean is producing a screenprint as a promotional gift for tomorrow,
despite his printer, Brad Frain, moving workshops over the past seven
days.
The official document cites four main components of the ''programme of
events and activities taking place in 1996 which will further enhance
Glasgow's position as a major European city of culture''. They are the
opening of the Gallery of Modern Art (GOMA) in Exchange Square; the
largest-ever Mackintosh exhibition (which has been on the boil since the
mid-1980s); an International Festival of Design, and a community-based
programme.
''The projected economic impact of this activity forms part of an
ongoing art/tourism-led strategy in Glasgow -- an estimated 385,000
additional visitors, #9.7m spend, and 358 full-time equivalent jobs.''
Or so they hope.
GOMA's refurbishment is costing #7m and rising. It is due to open in
March or April, depending on which bit of bumph you read. Julian
Spalding, who is solely responsible for spending the #3m budget for
contemporary art, has a policy which is ''unashamedly populist'', or so
my August press conference invitation says. (This event was subsequently
cancelled at short notice.) The new art collection's ''ethos and style''
is described by Spalding as ''populist -- not like a lot of modern art
which is by con artists for con artists'', he says.
This presumably means anyone associated with the British Council or
the Tate, Tramway or Transmission (Charles Esche of Tramway was
allegedly excluded from the London launch) or who represented Britain at
the Venice Biennale over the past five years; famous people like Kate
Whiteford, Christine Borland, Louise Scullion, Callum Innes, and David
Mach.
Spalding's avowed aim is to make Glasgow's art collection different;
to avoid what he calls ''the same 50 artists patronised the world over''
by the likes of the Tate or top museums like Prato in Italy or MOCA in
Los Angeles. This is dandy -- if Glasgow's collection has its own
Scottish identity. But it does not.
The ''confidential'' list of GOMA pictures to be announced tomorrow
reveals nothing we didn't know already: it lacks consistency, it
demonstrates no real understanding of the art world, it takes no account
of internationalism. Moreover there are no new surprises, no
breathtaking works of excellence; above all no new Scots or
Scottish-based artists.
The pioneering 1980s figurative painters are merely represented by one
or two pictures: Howson's Patriots, Wiszniewski's Weeds, Campbell's
Migrants, Currie's Bathers, O'Donnell, Keane, Guy, Carlisle, one Cairns.
There's also one Banks and Halem, not listed. But nothing by Alison
Watt, Kate Whiteford, David Mach, Margot Sandeman, Monk, Barclay,
Starling, Sinclair, Buchanan, Coley, Richardson. Good enough for Europe
and the States. Not good enough for their native city. One could cry.
Spalding may have shot himself in the foot by including amateurs and
unknowns, token Aboriginals, Russians -- and kitsch. It's easy to
undermine Glasgow's credibility. With a slogan like ''Unashamedly
Populist'' GOMA will not be taken seriously. ''I'll make sure that
rubbish is not near my work,'' one artist told me. Others have already
forbidden their dealers to sell to Glasgow Museums.
GOMA is also commissioning five groups of furniture: seating, benches,
chairs, and also tiles for the loos. Mary Little is one invited English
artist. All the Scots I know have been rejected, but let's hope others
succeed. On Friday GOMA got #178,000 of Lottery money for furniture and
equipment.
David Mullane, from Warehouse, is the new director of next September's
International Design Festival with a #500,000 core budget. ''It won't be
parochial. People in London are interested.'' The twin focus is
industrial and educational with a design exhibition in GOMA.
Mullane, based at Scottish Design, is looking at ideas to ''go forward
with a design-led economy''. He booked the RSAMD as a centre for
seminars. ''It's a chance to invite top designers to Glasgow, but needs
to be meaningful, not just a talking shop.''
There are other problems. The Americans are unhappy with the budget
for the US Mackintosh tour. Where will Glasgow put the five restored
Mackintosh tearooms if the National Gallery's Glasgow venue fails? Who
will get a share of the #100,000 1996 Visual Art Fund (closing date last
Friday), for projects relating to the offical programme of events?
The fund states: ''A major marketing strategy is currently being
developed around Festival 1996 to maximise tourism potential and
encourage a wider appreciation of the range of visual arts in the
city.'' Note that tourism heads the list. I rest my case.
Artists good enough for Europe and the States are not good enough for
their native city

BRITAIN'S arms industry faces stiffer competition in a shrinking
market and must offer packages of equipment rather than individual
products, the Defence Ministry's chief salesman said yesterday.
Charles Masefield, head of the Defence Export Services Organisation,
said the world's top three exporters of military equipment -- the United
States, Britain and France -- all aimed to capture new trade in a market
likely to contract 25% in the next 10 years.
''Competitors have never been more aggressive. That is both their
industries and their governments,'' he told a conference to open
Britain's biennial Royal Navy and British Army Equipment Exhibition.
More than 1000 potential buyers from 80 countries are attending the
invitation-only show to inspect arms and military equipment made by 282
companies.
Mr Masefield, who works within the Ministry of Defence to support
commercial exporters, said British companies needed to put together
packages tailored to each customer country's needs. ''We are going to
concentrate on selling packages, not products,'' he said.
Britain, which won orders worth #5000m in 1994, had identified a list
of 20 countries where it would aggressively pursue deals, he said,
without naming them.
Mr Masefield also said the Government would no longer support more
than one British firm going for the same export deal. ''We don't want to
see companies that are not going to win muddying the water for those who
can,'' he said.
* BRITISH Aerospace, Britain's top exporter, said yesterday it hoped
to strike a key workshare deal on the #12bn Eurofighter combat aircraft
project this autumn with its European partners.
Speaking at the arms exhibition, the chairman and managing director of
BAe's defence unit, John Weston, said he expected a tough autumn's
bargaining as the German, Italian, Spanish and British firms developing
the plane try to decide who makes which pieces.
''The next important decision on Eurofighter is production investment
and we must get a proposal for that by early next year. To clear the way
we need to understand exactly who is doing what in the worksharing on
the programme,'' he said.
''I am very confident we will find our way through it.''

IN his immediately previous incarnation Michael Forsyth was the
Minister of State whose patch included prisons. He has therefore spent
more time inside than most other law-abiding citizens. Or at least long
enough, you might have supposed, to accept the logic of the conclusion
drawn by Douglas Hurd when he was Home Secretary that prison is an
expensive way of making bad men worse.
Instead, his enthusiasm for incarceration as a cure for society's ills
seems undimmed, an instinct not apparently shared by the new inspector
of prisons.
Mr Forsyth's old boss, Michael Howard, has spent most of his time in
office ignoring the advice of his own experts on penal reforms. The
events of the past 48 hours suggest the Scottish Secretary may have
picked up some of those bad habits. And they are dangerous ones.
His proposition is that since our prisons are over-crowded we should
build more.
That the courts should always have enough cells to play with. That
seems to me to be a classic example of peering down the wrong end of the
telescope. If the prisons are over-crowded let us first analyse the
population. And a cursory roll call of Scottish inmates will immediately
reveal many thousands of people for whom jail is entirely inappropriate.
Mr Forsyth accepts that sending fine defaulters to prison is
wrong-headed and fiscally counter-productive. But there are many more
people languishing there who pose no danger to society but who may be
persistent petty offenders.
They are living proof that prison regimes, as at present constituted,
have a hopelessly bad record of releasing people better equipped to cope
with life than when they went in.
In contrast there have now been many studies of those people who have
been sentenced to participate in community projects suggesting that the
re-offending rate from that option is considerably lower. An added bonus
for the taxpayer is that they are involved in some form of constructive
activity rather than costing #500 a week for no visible return. The age
factor is very important here.
Send a young offender into a worthwhile community programme and you
have a fighting chance of his acquiring useful skills and being made to
confront the damaging consequences of his previous behaviour. Put him in
custody and you have the cast-iron certainty that what he will learn
from that environment is how to commit more serious crimes. That is not
soggy liberalism: that is stark unpalatable fact. If we want fewer
crimes we must stop sending young offenders to finishing school.
Mr Forsyth is also properly concerned about the level of drug use
inside. That drug taking is commonplace is no longer in question. That
random checks will make a bad situation better is more dubious. Once
again the experts in the rehabilitation field have voiced a different
opinion. They feel more investment in more sophisticated rehab
programmes is a sounder bet than the kind of spot checks which will
almost certainly exacerbate existing tensions.
It is not a popular thing to say, but the fact is that while drugs in
one context are a problem, in another they have arguably helped keep the
lid on unrest. I'm not suggesting for a moment that drug use is
acceptable, merely noting the first-hand testimony of ex-convicts that
if they hadn't had access to drugs prison violence and vandalism would
be worse. The inspector's report, while deploring the prevalence of
drugs, notes also the small number of attacks on staff and the absence
of any full-scale unrest.
However, a much more urgent drugs problem to address is that of
alcohol abuse.
A vast proportion of serious crime, especially involving violence, is
drink-related.
Drink is a huge factor, for instance, in wife and child abuse. Yet the
in-house programmes for prisoners who have a dependency problem is
minimal. And, where it exists, it is done in such a public way that old
lags often embarrass younger inmates out of attending. Tackling alcohol
in a major way would not provide instant solutions, but several years
down the line it would be the single most effective way of reducing the
population in our jails.
The other important building block after changing behaviour is
offering opportunity. A man with no hope of legal employment is a man
more than likely to re-offend. A man whose contact with family has been
strictly limited is less likely to be released into a stable
environment. So prison has to be seen as part of a continuum towards
giving people the maximum number of options on release.
That means acquiring skills and education, neither of which is the
likely end product of the Boot Camp style of military prison apparently
being given enthusiastic consideration by the Home Secretary.
Certainly you can frighten people into good behaviour. And then you
can reap the classic rewards when super fit, alienated young men take
out their revenge on society at large on their release. A more
intelligent alternative is to prove to inmates that the good life does
not consist of sequential spells as a guest of Her Majesty. The
inspector of prisons, outlining the major problems of the present,
highlighted boredom as the most dangerous factor.  That does not suggest
there is much of a constructive nature happening inside Scotland's
nicks.

KARACHI: Violence in Karachi claimed at least six more lives yesterday
as Pakistan's ethnic Mohajir National Movement called for a one-day
protest strike in the southern province of Sindh. The Karachi-based

PARIS: A moderate Islamist leader and arch-enemy of hardline Muslim
fundamentalists said yesterday he would stand in Algeria's presidential
poll on November 16. Mohamed Nahnah, who is opposed both by Muslim
militants waging war against the army-backed authorities and by the main
secular political parties, told a press conference in Algiers that his
Islamic Society Movement has endorsed his candidacy.

THE game-show luxury of unimaginable wealth has been exercising minds
in the arts community since the success of the National Lottery became
apparent. Fantasy funding is, of course, a myth, but that does not mean
that the flow of cash into the coffers of the various committees set up
to distribute the money has abated.
On the contrary, the amount of money available as a result of the
nation's huge enthusiasm for small-scale gambling continues to exceed
expectations. In Scotland the arts council's national lottery committee
now has some #29m to disburse, #5m more than the Treasury gives the
council itself to support the arts.
That imbalance brings with it obvious problems. The experience of
other countries where lottery funds are used to finance the arts is that
central government support withers away and the lottery becomes the main
source of income to the arts.
Already there have been around half a dozen public-relations disasters
that have done the perception of the arts no favours at all. The large
and swift grants to the South Bank and the the Royal Opera at Covent
Garden, the mishandling of the announcement of the acquistion of the
Penrose Collection by the National Galleries of Scotland, and the money
spent on the Churchill papers have all conspired to add to the problems
of those charged with the responsibility of ensuring lottery receipts
are well spent.
It should be borne in mind, however, that these mistakes all emanated
from London. There has been clear evidence of a brand of metropolitan
arrogance about the dealings of some of the committees based there. The
National Galleries suffered from that and where non-devolved funds --
like those earmarked for marking the Millenium -- are concerned,
Scotland is powerless to do anything about it. Except, of course, be
grateful when some of the money comes our way.
The attitude of the Scottish Arts Council's lottery committee, under
chairman Douglas Connell, could not be more different -- and there are
signs that the Scottish Office and the council are working in the same
direction which is undoubtedly a cause for celebration. At the annual
''arts breakfast'' during the Edinburgh Festival, an event run by
Conservative Struan Stevenson's public affairs company, new Arts
Minister the Earl of Lindsay was full of talk of access to the arts for
the widest geographical and social spread of the population.
It was language that had the director of the arts council, Seona Reid,
beaming with approval and was a broad hint as to how the ''problem'' of
the lottery money may be solved.
When the guidelines for applications for lottery money were originally
issued, stating that grants would be given only for capital projects,
immediate reservations were voiced.
Certainly the physical infrastructure for the arts was in dire need of
attention, but within a very short space of time, it was argued, the
lottery would be constructing or refurbishing buildings when there was
no money to put on shows within them.
The broad interpretation of the guidelines that has been exercised in
Scotland has gone some way to allay fears. The anomaly of the inclusion
of film production has been exploited with, for example, the grant to
the making of a movie of Alasdair Gray's Poor Things. Public artworks
have also been interpreted as a capital expenditure in some cases.
In other cases, applicants have been encouraged to think on a grander
scale. The committee has not had to seek a wide geographical spread, it
has been presented with one. The latest tranche of grants, announced on
Friday, include awards to Shetland and Deeside as well as the Central
Belt and some of the island communities have set the pace in their
success in securing lottery for funds for new arts buildings.
The fact remains, however, that by the end of this year -- by which
time we can expect some of the very large applications to have been
dealt with -- the restriction to capital spending will begin to look
unsustainable.
Hence the focus on access to the arts in a wider sense. In what seems
a logical extension of the current policy, some of the lottery
committees -- including the arts ones in Scotland and Wales -- are
arguing that they should be allowed to give grants for anything that
would widen the appeal of the arts.
This could take in education work or the transportation of company to
audience, or audience to company. Marketing in a targeted way could
become something for which arts organisations could seek lottery monies.
All revenue-funded organisations have an obligation to maximise box
office but, understandably, artists prefer to put what resources they
have into the work and aim their marketing at the kind of people that
seem to want it. Extending beyond that is a luxury they can ill afford.
There is a gap there that could have wide social benefits as well as
direct financial ones to artists and arts companies.
There is also a clear overlap with the current funding by the regional
authorites in the arts, particularly through education departments,
which will disappear at the end of March next year, leaving Scottish
Arts Council revenue clients some #1.8m short. As the Citizens'
Theatre's Giles Havergal pointed out in The Herald a week ago, the
dangers inherent in that have to be mentioned loudly as often as
possible.
But Havergal would be the first to acknowledge that funding
partnerships in Scotland have given him an advantage over many working
in the theatre in England. One can only speculate as to why more sense
seems to prevail north of the Border.
Anyone who was in Edinburgh over the past three weeks trying to secure
a hotel room, a meal, or a cab knows how beneficial the arts can be to
the economy of a local area. Using the lottery's proceeds to spread that
benefit more widely makes sound economic sense.

SERIOUS politicking will get under way again this month. Labour's
summer holidays campaign against the Tories, while a bit more than a
phoney war, saw the attacking side take at least as many casualties as
the defenders and, as has not been unusual with Labour, some of the
wounds were self-inflicted.
Mr Blair has reaffirmed that Britain cannot be given a radical
shake-up by a party which resists a radical shake-up for itself. His
critics on the left murmur that he seems keener on making radical
changes in his party than in his country. The Tories, seizing on his
fondness for images like yesterday's ''going forwards not backwards''
which sound positive but lacks specificity keep asking ''where's the
beef?''
As the party machines crank up towards the party conferences they will
all be considering whether the next General Election, which we seem to
have been expecting for ever, will actually be as distant as April 1997
which has been pencilled in most diaries as a near certainty. It is
unusual for British Parliaments to run their full five-year span. The
1987 one did for all but a month or so.
At the time there was quite a lot of speculation that Mr Major would
go to the country in February 1991 having been in office long enough to
be both known but still reasonably fresh. However, the need to deal with
the poll tax and hopes that the economy would improve later on
prevailed. In the event the poll tax was dealt with successfully but the
economy got worse.
Almost tempted by a surprise upturn in the opinion polls, Mr Major
considered November 1991 but when Labour went back into the lead he
decided to soldier on to the bitter end. Fighting on the political
equivalent of a sticky wicket, he won to the surprise of almost everyone
but himself.
This time, around 30 points behind in the polls and with the public
resolutely refusing to feel good, it is a not unreasonable assumption
that he will again have to keep right on to the end of the road.
Two November Budgets, somehow dispensing goodies will be needed to win
back voters, it is argued. The longer Labour has to wait the more
vulnerable they will be to charges that they are all hype and no
policies. Or, alternatively, they will have to produce more detailed
policy which, like all policies, is susceptible to attack. The Tories
are also likely to make more serious efforts to dent Mr Blair's ''good
guy'' image.
For example, they may elaborate on analysis by respected independent
commentators like Mr Nick Jones of the BBC in his recent book about spin
doctors, on the closeness of Mr Blair to Mr Peter Mandelson. Mr
Mandelson is a talented man who had much to do with Labour's new image
before ever Mr Blair became leader, but if you were casting a detective
movie calling for a nice cop and a nasty cop partnership you would not
cast Mr Mandelson as the smiler. His command of the art of influencing
the media and others have led him to be deemed in the same class of
persuaders as Svengali and Rasputin.
To him was attributed the extremely rough Labour campaign in the
Littleborough and Saddleworth by-election and why, the Tories might ask,
was he not stopped by the nice, wholesome party leader?
Whether the Tories will be able to strip off any of Mr Blair's gloss,
who knows? Mr Major will have other things to worry about. His steadily
declining Commons majority, for example.
Only the sensible reluctance of Tory back benchers to emulate the SNP
MPs of 1979 as turkeys waiting for Christmas has saved the Government
from crashing already. Then, the support of the Ulster Unionist MPs may
be less reliable from now on although they must work out if their
interests would be better served by action that could substitute a
Labour Government which owed them nothing from the present one.
There is also the question of the great Euro summit -- son of
Maastricht -- which is due to open in autumn 1996. Whether the voters
will really be as excited by European issues as I, for one, think they
should be, is doubtful. But Mr Major will be driven both by his own
party's noisy Euro sceptic wing and the necessity of portraying Labour
as ready to sell Britain's birthright for a mess of Brussels potage, to
wrap himself in the flag. However incredible some of his followers find
the message, he will cast himself as the man fighting to save Britain
from further continental encroachments, from being absorbed into a
European superstate.
These will be much more exciting lines if he utters them while
actually battling away. No duration has been fixed for the summit but it
is pretty important for Mr Major that it should be in action during the
election campaign.
But other European leaders who know already what to expect from him
might resolve to wrap this one up fairly snappily and wait for happier
times like the advent of a Blair government and meet again in, say, 1998
which would not much put out the realistic timetable for more
Euro-union.
Of course, Mr Major could tell us ''there, you see. Nothing bad
happened -- because of me.'' But with voters out of sight is often out
of mind. That is why I suspect that if by mid-1996 the Foreign Office
sense that son of Maastricht could be a brief affair Mr Major might
either forswear a second Budget and face the voters in October 1996 or
have a very early Budget and treat us to the first November election
since 1935.
If he does, as I may well be travelling around the country with him, I
hope the weather keeps fine for us.

ENIGMA. By Robert Harris
Hutchison: #15.99
THERE is a literary precedent stating that when an author writes a
best-seller he is entitled to replace his middle name with the title of
his book. Deed polls are not required. If the author does not wish to do
so a journalist will be appointed to do it for him. Those re-christened
in print include Robert Jaws Benchley, Margaret Gone With The Wind
Mitchell, and Robert Psycho Bloch.
Inevitable drawbacks stretch further than the maitre d': ''Your table,
Mr Psycho Bloch, is across from Ms Wind Mitchell. Now, no temper
tantrums, please!'' Best-selling authors whose middle names are
exchanged often find, though the careers continue, the book title
remains the same. Can you name another book Robert Benchley wrote?
Three years ago journalist Robert Harris exchanged his full-time job
on the Sunday Times for that of a novelist. The publication of his first
novel erased an entire career in investigative journalism and political
commentary. Robert Harris was no longer journalist and author of five
non-fiction books, including Selling Hitler, a hilarious account of his
newspaper's fiasco with the Hitler diaries.
No, like a shining phoenix rising from a clutter of remaindered books
and yellowed newspaper clippings, he was reborn, clothed with a black
eagle cape. He was Robert Fatherland Harris, author of a best-seller
which sold four million copies and was translated into 25 languages.
Fatherland's key was asking a simple question: what if Hitler had won?
A global readership bought copies in search of the answer and found a
whip-lash novel which possessed the secret of a truly sensational
best-seller -- the ''gotta''. Stephen Carrie King identified the
phenomenon in his horror thriller Misery. It was, he said, the sensation
and momentum written into a book which meant that no matter the time,
place, or situation, a reader felt he or she had ''gotta'' finish it.
It is within these parameters that Enigma, the new novel by Robert
Fatherland Harris must be judged. Harris has previously demonstrated his
gift of the gotta, but can he repeat it? He undoubtedly feels he can,
choosing as he did to allow a BBC film crew to follow the book from
research through writing to print and publication. And Enigma is a
mystery which runs on rails. Direct, swift, it bears down on the reader
only to swerve unfortunately in the wrong direction.
That, however, is the end. Here is the beginning. Bletchley Park, the
spring of 1943, and inside Britain's codebreaking capital the
cryptanalysts are facing a scenario of the worst kind. A million tonnes
of merchant shipping, supplies, and men are steaming from America to
Britain and into a net of German U-boats, which is, in effect,
invisible.
The cipher of Enigma code in which German troops communicate has
changed leaving the cryptanalysts blind to the trails of static which
would indicate the location of the U-boats. The situation warrants the
return of Tom ''what a great name'' Jericho, the brilliant mathematician
who cracked a previous code then cracked himself.
In Bletchley Park Tom struggles against the interference of his
superiors and the work at hand, while also trying to trace his former
girlfriend, Claire Rommilly. She disappeared into a black-out after he
discovered German codes in her bedroom. (The names really are superb; to
Rommilly and Jericho, add Hester Wallace, the prim lesbian, and Douglas
Wigram, a Foreign Office investigator.)
The story is the literary equivalent of an old movie on a rainy
afternoon. The atmosphere is as familiar as tea and toast. The
characters are cardboard cut-outs from every old war movie you've ever
seen; the noble hero, his scatty girl-friend, the stern female friend
plus a host of upper-class twits. It's far from a fault, it's an economy
that offers no resistance to the remorseless pressure of plot driving
them on to each new discovery.
Harris is an intelligent writer whose great skill is in expressing
complex ideas such as code-breaking in simplistic but stylish terms.
Atmosphere is not a problem, the chill of Britain buried in  the Second
World War is prevalent on every page. And politics is the final
ingredient. A careful examination of the role of cryptanalysts becomes
comparable with the RUC in Northern Ireland, when it falls through
Harris's hands.
The key was never to allow the enemy to know that Britain could crack
their codes. If this meant allowing ships to be sunk rather than attack
U-boats which would give away the Allies' secret knowledge, then so be
it, and for the greater good. Similar tactics have been applied using
the informer's information in the fight against the IRA. Unfortunately
the novel's swing from salvation in the Atlantic is the rock upon which
it founders.
From a stirring thriller with enough sticky intrigue to bind Britain,
the US, and Russia together and still have some left over to lasso
sailors from a deep-sea grave, Enigma ties itself in internal knots.
Harris surprises the reader by turning away from the Atlantic; but he
turns towards a lesser goal. By focusing instead on the Russian front, a
collection of bodies, and a new spy at play in Bletchley Park, he
ignores a golden rule.
A film-maker once described the key to success as setting the audience
up, then giving them what they want. At the start Harris offers us a
race against time, then stops the clock. It is a lesser novel and a
slighter thrill for all that. Yet the word motor which drives the reader
on is too powerful to resist. It may not go where you want, but you
still read all the way. A triumph, but a slighter one, for what will
remain Mr Robert Fatherland Harris.

A 33-YEAR-OLD Spaniard briefly hijacked a French airliner today and
threatened to blow it up in protest over France's plans to resume
nuclear testing.
An airport official in Geneva where the man surrendered without a
struggle after releasing 298 passengers and crew described the man as
unbalanced.
The plane, an Air Inter Airbus A-300, was flying from Palma de
Mallorca in Spain to Paris when it was hijacked by a man carrying what
he said was a remote-controlled detonator.
The device turned out to be a mobile telephone with extra batteries
taped onto the outside. The passengers were released an hour after
landing at Geneva's Cointrin Airport. The hijacker later gave up without
a struggle.
''It seems to have been an isolated act by an unbalanced person,''
airport director Jean-Philippe Maitre said.
He added that a Swiss federal arrest warrant had been issued for the
man, who would undergo psychiatric tests. Swiss police refused to give
his name, but Spanish radio identified him as Carlos Santolaya.
The passengers, mostly French and Spanish but said by an airport
spokesman to include 11 Japanese, continued to Paris later.
Maitre said the hijacker handed a letter to an air hostess in which he
denounced the resumption of nuclear testing by France and condemned
''the complicity of the Spanish government''.
The decision by French President Jacques Chirac to resume underground
testing has been widely condemned, especially by Pacific nations.

IF Nato resumes bombing Serb positions in Bosnia tomorrow, it will be
to protect Sarajevo, not to push the Serbs towards the negotiating
table.
The Americans are relying on diplomacy to resolve the underlying
crisis, and on bombing to protect the ''safe areas'.
The assistant secretary of state who is conducting the negotiations,
Richard Holbrooke, said on television today that the main problem
remains the maps that will partition Bosnia.
He reported that all sides agree in principle that the division should
be 51% of territory for the Bosnian government and the Croats, 49% for
the Serbs. However, they were far from agreement on the details.
''When they show you their maps, it's more like 60-40 in their favour,
on both sides,'' he said.
Mr Holbrooke was meeting President Slobodan Milosevic again tonight in
Belgrade and hoped to make some progress. Furthermore, it seems that
when he says that everyone accepts the percentages, which would mean a
substantial Serb withdrawal (they now control about 70% of Bosnia) he
means President Milosevic, not the Bosnian Serb leaders, Radovan
Karadzic and General Ratko Mladic.
Nato headquarters in Italy has announced that the bombing will resume
tomorrow unless Mladic accepts the demand that all his artillery be
pulled back 20 kilometres from Sarajevo.
Mr Holbrooke said that the general's reply to the demand had been
completely unacceptable, hence the ultimatum.
He said that he was very sorry that Nato air forces had not been used
years ago to protect Bosnian cities. He avoided the question why nothing
had been done as the Serbs ''ethnically cleansed' so much of Bosnia, and
overran city after city.
He conceded that bombing might not work and offered no suggestion how
the parties might be forced to accept the 51-49 division -- which he
insists is still an absolute condition -- if they refuse.
* RAF pilots based in Italy today flew large-scale missions over
Bosnia to reinforce the political pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.
Seven Harriers and two Jaguars roared over the war zone from Gioia del
Colle, southern Italy.
Some of the Harriers carried laser-guided 1000lb bombs. The flight
plan included installations which would have been hit if the pilots had
received the order to bomb.

LEADERS of a grassroots women's forum decided to go ahead as planned
despite concerns over freedom of expression although Chinese police
today scuffled with demonstrators and punched a Canadian distributing
leaflets.
Organisers of the Non Governmental Organisations Forum on Women had
yesterday given Beijing 24 hours to ease up on heavy-handed security by
stopping surveillance and intimidation. They were also concerned about
access for the disabled.
A statement said participants ''indicate improvement in these areas as
well as a desire for the meeting to continue''.
The meeting in the rural Beijing suburb of Huairou was going well in
general, it said, enabling it to proceed in tandem with the UN's Fourth
World Conference on Women that opens in Beijing tomorrow and which the
forum hopes to influence.
However, it said: ''Remaining areas of concern include freedom of
expression''.
The committee demanded action from China on an incident in which
Chinese-language publicity material was confiscated from a tent used by
lesbians.
Over 25,000 women have gathered for the forum, which is focused on the
battle for equality for women.--Reuter.

A MASSACRE was narrowly averted in a crowded outdoor Paris market
tpnday when a powerful bomb packed into a pressure cooker misfired but
nonetheless injured three shoppers.
''If the bomb had gone off, it would have resulted in real carnage,''
said former cabinet member Georges Sarre, mayor of the 11th district of
the French capital where the incident took place.
The attempt followed two other attacks in the French capital,
including a bomb blast on a crowded Metro (underground railway) train on
July 25 which killed seven people and wounded some 80 others. Seventeen
people were hurt by a bomb near the Arc de Triomphe on August 17.
No-one is known to have made credible claims of responsibility for the
attacks.
But French officials have said they believed the prime suspects were
Algerian Muslim fundamentalist groups seeking to ''punish'' France for
its perceived support of Algeria's military government.
Detectives said today's attempt went wrong when the detonator went off
but failed to trigger the rest of the explosives.
Three women in the market situated along Boulevard Richard Lenoir near
the Bastille Square suffered second-degree burns when the detonator
caused a flame to shoot up from under the vegetable stand under which
the device was concealed.
French television said the explosive charge was also laced with nails
and bolts like the other bombs, packed in cooking gas canisters, which
exploded earlier in Paris.
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre rushed to the scene and said:
''There was an explosive device which did not go off as it should have.
One cannot say more. It is now going to be examined by our
specialists.''
A woman vendor said: ''It was like every Sunday, the market was full
to bursting. There was a loud explosion and a woman started screaming.
Then everybody just ran.''--Reuter.

A NATIONAL Health Service patient was the first in Scotland to benefit
from pioneering surgery carried out at the Health Care International
private hospital in Clydebank last week.
It was carried out there because the patient's NHS specialist said
there was no NHS hospital able to perform the treatment.
Retired Cowdenbeath policeman Andrew Lumsden, 61, had a metal tube,
called a stent-graft, inserted in the iliac artery in his leg to reduce
pressure on an aneurysm which threatened to burst.
Dr Chris White used keyhole surgery techniques for the first time on
an iliac artery in Scotland, which allowed the patient to be in hospital
for only a day.
The normal procedure would have meant a stay of up to a fortnight in
hospital.

THE crew of a New Zealand navy ship off France's two South Pacific
nuclear test sites said today they had recorded what they thought could
have been an underground blast on an underwater microphone.
But military officials in the Tahitian capital Papeete denied a test
had been held at either of the two sites, Mururoa and Fangataufa atolls.
A naval officer on the New Zealand ship Tui, speaking by satellite
telephone to Reuters in Tahiti, said the hydrophone had recorded a loud
noise in the water, followed by others over the next 10 minutes.
France is expected to resume nuclear testing within days and plans to
detonate up to eight nuclear devices between September and May 1996.
Meanwhile, French commandos boarded a French protest yacht just inside
the military exclusion zone around the test site today, the third
protest vessel in as many days to be seized by force.

A 23-YEAR-OLD female firefighter will accuse two male colleagues of
sexual discrimination when they are called before a disciplinary panel
today.
Ms Sharon McKenzie, of Duns, joined the Lothian and Borders brigade
amid high-profile publicity when she became Berwickshire's first woman
firefighter at the age of 19. Now she is alleging that two male
firefighters in the 11-strong, part-time fire team at Duns subjected her
to obscene remarks and denied her a pager and other essential equipment.
Today's hearing will be heard in private at the Lothian Regional
Council headquarters in Edinburgh before a panel of four members of the
Lothian and Borders Fire Board. If the decision goes against the men,
they face fines, a written warning, or dismissal.
The hearingfollows 11 months of investigations. The two male
firefighters have been suspended on full pay during this time and Ms
McKenzie has also been on extended paid leave.
The complaints originally involved a third fireman who has since left
the brigade because of eyesight problems. He said at the time: ''The
relationship between Sharon and most of the men is strained. She has
been treated no better or worse than any other firefighter.''
The case is the first of its kind to be brought in the Lothian and
Borders brigade. The lawyer for one of the firemen, Ms Shona Simon, of
the Edinburgh practice McKay Simon, said: ''The allegations will be
strenuously contested.''

24 and 30 years old.
The injured were taken to hospital in Athens, where doctors said that
only one was in serious condition but did not disclose his nationality.
Coastguard officials said the boat, from the British cruiser Maridome,
was running at full speed when it ran into the marina early in the

ISRAEL allowed two top Hamas men to meet their jailed leader, hoping
to foster an accord between the Muslim resistance movement and Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority, Israeli and PLO sources said today.
PLO official Hisham Abdel-Razik, a negotiator with Hamas, said he too
attended the meeting with Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin at a jail in
Israel last month.
Israeli security sources confirmed the meeting, saying it was in
Israel's interest to see an agreement between Hamas and the Palestinian
Authority to stop ''terrorism''.
Hamas, Arafat's bitter rival, has vowed to wreck the 1993 PLO-Israel
peace deal which launched self-rule in Gaza Strip and Jericho. It has
killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings.
''The fact that Israel allowed myself and two leading Hamas figures
from Gaza, Khaled al-Hindi and Ismail Haniyeh, to visit Hamas leader
Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in his prison in Israel was an indication of
Israel's interest to see us reach an agreement,'' Abdel-Razik, a senior
member of Arafat's Fatah faction, told Reuters.
He said Sheikh Yassin, the disabled Hamas leader jailed in 1989 and
sentenced in 1991 to life after admitting to ordering the killings of
Israelis, ''encouraged Hamas to open a dialogue with the authority and
affirmed the need to reach an accord''.
The Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth said today that Moshe Sasson,
adviser to Israeli Police Minister Moshe Shahal, had met Abdel-Razik and
recommended Israel tell the authority that ''Israel's position is not to
oppose an agreement with Hamas if Hamas commits to immediately stop
attacks on Israel.''--Reuter.

A SCOTTISH-based American is hopeful the sky will be the limit for an
invention he claims will muffle the sound of noisy jets during take-off.
Captain Tom Friedrich, 60, who has lived on Islay for 10 years, claims
to have patented a ''hush kit'' device that could be fitted to all older
commercial jet aircraft within the next two years for about #240,000 an
engine.
The unveiling of his project coincides with an increasing pressure on
commercial airline operators to cut noise emissions. European
legislation imposing tough international noise regulations has been
introduced with the intent of grounding older craft.
The highly decorated Vietnam fighter pilot and former test pilot has
worked on his invention for eight years.
He is keen to have it manufactured in Scotland and believes the
project can generate #5000m during the next four years.
He estimates it will cost #1m to take his hush kit, called a
Retractable Ejector Duct (RED), from the drawing board to the production
line.
Besides bringing the noise level of old-technology jets within legal
guidelines, it is claimed RED would improve the performance of aircraft
during take-offs and landings by augmenting thrust.
Mr Friedrich, who served for 16 years as chief pilot to General Khaled
Bin Sultan, of Saudi Arabia, said: ''Now that RED has been researched,
tested, and patented, I need a partner or sponsor with greater resources
than I personally possess to take the idea forward for implementation.
''There are about 20,000 jets in use with noisy engines. Even if we
could secure 20% of the modifications, that would be some pretty good
business for Scotland.''
Mr Friedrich said he had discussed his project with engineers at
Rolls-Royce, Gulfstream Aerospace, and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
Mr Friedrich developed RED with help from Mr Richard Adkins, principal
research officer at the aviation school of mechanical engineering,
Cranfield University, Bedford.
Mr Adkins, 56, who has worked at Cranfield for 27 years, said Mr
Friedrich's invention was a ''very worthy project'' which aviation
chiefs ''would do well to pay heed to''.
''The big advantage of Tom's idea is that it operates during take-off
when it is important to reduce noise levels, but when the aircraft is
cruising it is possible to turn off the new hush kit so that the
aircraft can operate close to its normal efficiency,'' Mr Adkins said.
''This contrasts with existing hush kits under development which have
to operate continuously, thereby affecting the performance and economy
of the aircraft.''
Mr Adkins supervised the construction of the hush kit scale model and
conducted tests at Cranfield.
A spokesman for Rolls-Royce confirmed the company had held discussions
with Mr Friedrich concerning his hush kit. He said, however, that the
nature and content of the discussions remained private.
* Five British airlines have received special permission to continue
flying old jet aircraft because of an exemption in the European noise
legislation.
Among the aircraft which will be able to fly until at least next April
-- and possibly until 2002 -- are a fleet of eight operating in British
Airways colours, three British Midland aircraft, five from British
World, and one belonging to the Ford Motor Company.

AMERICAN spy satellites have pinpointed the exact location of the four
Western hostages being held in Kashmir and have been following their
movements for several days.
The men, including Britons Keith Mangan and Paul Wells, a German and
an American, are being marched daily around the remote mountain region
and concealed in a complex of tunnels and caves at night in an attempt
to defeat surveillance from the air.
The latest batch of high-resolution photographs taken over the last
week shows the captives moving in single file, escorted by 17 armed
guerrillas, on mountain trails between hideouts.
It is understood that the intelligence information on their
whereabouts has been passed to the Indian authorities, but that New
Delhi is still refusing permission for a Special Forces' rescue mission.
A team from Delta Force, the US equivalent of the SAS, arrived in
northern India last week. Its weapons and equipment were impounded
immediately by Indian customs officials and its commander told that no
detailed maps of the area of potential operations existed.
A second rescue force from Britain's own SAS is also believed to be on
stand-by in the region. Neither team has been given the go-ahead to
mount an assault to free the captives and both are apparently being
bogged down by Indian red tape.
Indian authorities said yesterday that they had last been in contact
with the so-called Al-Faran kidnappers on Saturday, and that the
situation was ''one of uncertainty.'' All four hostages and one
guerrilla guard are reported to be ill after heavy rains in Kashmir.
As reported exclusively in The Herald over the last two weeks, there
is growing doubt in Western intelligence and diplomatic circles over
Indian claims that Al-Faran is a faction of one of Kashmir's militant
Islamic separatist movements, fighting for independence or affiliation
with neighbouring Pakistan.
Sources say the previously unknown Al-Faran may be part of an Indian
''dirty tricks'' operation aimed at discrediting Kashmiri separatists in
advance of November elections in the province.
All other known guerrilla groups have denounced Al-Faran's actions,
including the execution by beheading of a Norwegian hostage three weeks
ago.
All five prisoners were captured by armed men while backpacking in the
area nine weeks ago. They are ostensibly being offered in exchange for
the release of 15 hardline Kashmiri rebels in Indian hands.
Reuters reports: The guerrillas holding the four captives contacted
the Indian government yesterday and authorities held out hope for
another round of talks.
''We had contact today and are likely to have contact tomorrow,'' a
spokesman for the government of Jammu and Kashmir state said. ''We have
not given up hope.''
Authorities said they continued to be concerned about the welfare of
the hostages.
''But hope comes from the fact we are talking,'' said one official who
asked not to be identified. ''We want to prolong it. We want to keep
them alive.''
Asked if the government could reach a negotiated settlement with
Al-Faran militants, the official said: ''We haven't ruled out anything.
You never know whether or not there could be some kind of deal.''
Authorities have been in almost daily radio contact with Al-Faran for
weeks.
Near the murdered Norwegian's body was a note from Al-Faran
threatening to kill the four other hostages unless the government
released 15 jailed militants within two days. The deadline passed with
no apparent harm to the captive tourists.
India has ruled out freeing three jailed Pakistani militants from the
Harkat-ul-Ansar movement. Delhi says they are hardcore guerrillas who
would rejoin the separatist struggle in which police and hospitals say
more than 20,000 people have died.
But the government has indicated a certain number of separatists could
be released from jail as part of a regular administrative review of
their status.
It was not clear whether either side had climbed down from positions
which, according to authorities, had hardened in recent days, raising
worries over the hostages' fate.
Authorities and diplomats agreed talks had entered a crucial phase.
''There is a sense we are heading towards the end game on this,'' a
diplomat said. ''Patience is wearing thin on both sides.''
One Indian official held out little hope of a negotiated settlement,
saying Al-Faran did not appear to have realised the government would not
bow to its demands.
''It can go two ways now,'' a diplomat said. ''Either they (Al-Faran)
see sense or they do something foolish.''

THE fight over who will be the next Earl of Selkirk is to come before
the Scottish College of Heralds and the Lord Lyon, Sir Malcolm Innes.
Apart from the title, half a million pounds is at stake, which will go
to the next holder of the disputed earldom.
Pitted against each other are Scottish Office Minister, Lord James
Douglas-Hamilton, brother of the Duke of Hamilton, and his cousin
Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton, 55, known as the Master of Selkirk.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton confirmed that he had lodged a petition for the
right to bear the Arms of the Earldom and subsequently claim the title.
A lawyer and trustee specialist for the Bank of Scotland, he is named
as heir apparent in both Burke's Peerage and Debrett. He has been known
as the Master for the past 30 years.
He said: ''I'm sorry it's come to this but I suppose it is necessary.
Personally I thought the whole matter was quite clear, but others seem
to differ.
''I am confident that right is on my side.''
However, Lord James will question the claim on behalf of his
16-year-old son John Andrew. He had earlier formally renounced the title
to remain an MP, following the death of the 10th Earl, George
Douglas-Hamilton, a former First Lord of the Admiralty.
He said: ''I have not lodged the petition. It has been lodged by my
cousin and he is making a claim. As far back as 10 years ago I took
legal advice, and if it is correct, then on my death -- after lying in
abeyance -- the title would go to my son.''
The legacy, which comes to whoever succeeds to the title was not known
until the private family reading of the earl's will. No house or land
goes with the earldom.
Sir Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw will represent Lord James and his son
with Professor John Murray, the former Lord Dervaird, representing Mr
Douglas-Hamilton. The hearing, expected to last two days, will be a
formal court matter with both men giving evidence.
The Lord Lyon's office said that the case would not be heard before
December.
The counter-claims have arisen because the Earldom of Selkirk carries
the most complex remainder inheritance rules in the Scots peerage.
The outcome of the case may well rest on the interpretation of the
original creation of the title, written in Latin and then translated
back into English.
In 1646 Charles I made his cousin, the younger brother of the first
Duke of Hamilton, Earl of Selkirk. The terms were that the title would
automatically pass to the younger brothers of successive dukes.
In 1886 the earldom and dukedom were merged, but the arrangement was
revived in 1940 when the 13th duke died, through special remainder which
allowed the 14th duke's younger brother, George, to become the 10th
earl.
Lord James is the immediate younger brother of the present and 15th
duke.
Mr Alasdair Douglas-Hamilton's father, Malcolm, a former Tory MP who
died in 1962, was the younger brother, after George, of the 14th duke
who died in 1973.  Had he survived George, Malcolm could have been
expected to inherit the earldom.
Mr Douglas-Hamilton has always claimed that he has a letter from a
previous Lord Lyon stating ''in reasonably clear terms'' that he would
succeed when his uncle died.

<TEXT>
A MENACING pair of decoy eagle owls, set up on the Butt of Lewis
lighthouse to scare off birds which foul the dome, are being roosted
upon by the birds they were designed to deter.
The failure of the life-sized three-feet-high decoys could be serious
for Northern Lights, the body which maintains the area's navigational
aids. It wants to automate the 133-year-old lighthouse in a little over
two years, so an urgent search is on to find a more effective way of
keeping the roosting birds at bay.
The problem of the birds' droppings is so bad that the lighthouse dome
can be smeared to the point of opaqueness within hours, blotting out the
750,000 candlepower beam.
While it is still manned, lighthouse keepers tackle the hazardous job
of cleaning. They have to dangle from harnesses, 120ft up in winds which
often exceed 80mph.
At first the decoy eagle owls, moulded in plastic and filled with
cement, had seemed the perfect ''green'' solution.
Principal keeper Donald Michael came-up with the idea from a fellow
radio ham who had used them successfully to keep birds away from his
aerial.
''We were a wee bit sceptical that they could work at the lighthouse,
but at first they did,'' said Mr Michael.
''It was marvellous -- we did not have to go out in our harnesses to
clean the windows. But then the birds, mainly starlings, got more
confident.
''They moved closer and closer to the eagle owls until they sat on
them. They happily roost on the owls all the time. They have no fear at
all.
''I don't know what the answer is. One naturalist suggested sending us
a tape of the eagle owls' hunting cry, but then we have a problem with
outdoor loudspeakers here, with the winds and rain.
''We have even thought about robotic birds to make them more
life-like.''
Senior engineers at Northern Lights have been told to come up with a
solution that will work.
The lighthouse is not only a beacon to keep shipping away from
treacherous rocks. It marks a pit-stop for birds migrating between the
Arctic and Africa. The beam from the northerly windswept tip of Lewis is
the first sight of land after migratory flights from places such as
Greenland and Iceland.
There are also vast colonies of gulls, kittiwakes, and fulmars nearby.
Culling was ruled out because the seabirds are protected.
Mr Michael said: ''I don't think wire nets alone would work, and we
have the problem over introducing the real thing because of the
protection against culling.
''But the eagle owls are no good at all. Because of the layout of the
lighthouse we could not site their eyrie right on top of the structure.
Maybe they were not high enough to look down on the other birds. I don't
know.
''All I do know is that at the moment there are thousands of starlings
and other birds around. The sky is just black with them, particularly at
sunset.
''It is up to the lighthouse board and the engineers what they do now.
They realise they have a big problem with de-manning looming.
''No other lighthouse has the same problem to the same extent. It is a
bit of a one-off.''
The dummy eagle owls not only ended up attracting birds. They became a
magnet for flocks of sightseers and unpractised birdwatchers.
''At least they were a great attraction, if, as it turned out, a
folly,'' said Mr Michael.

Barclay McBain and Eleanor Houghton reveal how medical students are
particularly hard hit by the switch to student loans
HOW would you like to embark on your career with debt of more than
#12,000? It is not a hypothetical question for Stuart Ogilsby and Maggie
Currer, who graduated in medicine from Dundee University in July and who
have just begun work as junior house officers at Ninewells Hospital,
Dundee.
Debt is a reality for most students these days. Government policy is
to reduce public expenditure on student maintenance and, to that end,
grants have been reduced and index-linked student loans increased.
But medical students are having to borrow more because their courses
last at least a year longer than those in other disciplines. And they
have fewer opportunities to earn income from vacation work than other
students, as the British Medical Association recently confirmed.
The bottom line, the BMA argues, is that medical students are
accumulating so much debt during their studies that they should receive
a special allowance to ease their financial burdens.
Ogilsby and Currer agree. Five-figure debt is common among medical
graduates, built up to meet living expenses, the cost of compulsory
electives -- when they study and work abroad -- and the price of
specialist equipment and clothing for ward work. Like many other medical
students, their debt is a mixture of student loans, bank overdrafts, and
credit card bills.
While they are on a level playing field with other students in the
first few years of their undergraduate study, medical students lose out
in their clinical years, when they receive only about four weeks'
holiday.
Other students can work during the long vacations -- where jobs are
available -- to pay off overdrafts and save for the next session, while
medics are working in hospitals.
For the first two years of their course the expenses incurred by
Ogilsby and Currer were not much higher than other students'. While
their course followed normal university terms early on, they were able
to work during the holidays. ''I subsidised my first three years by
working as a waitress at Christmas, Easter, and in the summer,'' said
Currer. Ogilsby wrote software for a computer company.
Debt began to build up only when vacation work was no longer an
option. Ogilsby said: ''My brother has earned about #120 a week every
holiday for his entire course, but after third year we got no more than
a week at a time, so getting a job was out of the question.
''We got an extra grant which was supposed to cover the additional 20
weeks we studied each year but it was worth half the value of grant for
the rest of the time. You can't live on a normal grant anyway so I don't
know how we were supposed to manage.''
Currer tried to keep her head above water by working as a waitress in
the evenings. But medicine is a particularly rigorous course, and
studying eats into a great deal of free time. That means sacrifices. ''I
had no social life and my studying definitely suffered. In the end I had
to give the job up because I was expected to work evenings and nights in
the hospital and to travel to hospitals outside Dundee,'' she said.
That was another problem for Currer, who had to buy a car. ''I found I
couldn't cope without one. Coming home from the hospital on public
transport late at night was difficult and dangerous. Also, I had to
spend parts of the course in places as far away as Lochgilphead, which
would have been extremely difficult to reach by public transport. I come
from England, and my local authority did not meet my travelling
expenses, so I had to borrow money.''
Medical textbooks are expensive, between #20 and #30 each, while the
price of dissection kits and other equipment such as stethoscopes (about
#100), opthalmoscopes, and tendon hammers all add up. Being on the wards
has added costs, not just related to lab coats.
Ogilsby explained: ''We can't examine patients wearing clothes from
Oxfam and Army boots. I wore out about four or five shirts a year. I'd
say I spent about #250 a year on shirts and ties.'' Currer agreed:
''Shoes had to be fairly presentable and they got worn out quickly
because we were on our feet so much.''
One expense which, it could be argued, is self-inflicted is the
elective, the two-month period during which medical students are
required to study in a different area, traditionally the Third World.
The BMA said the extra allowance should also take account of the
elective period, since medical students contributed to health care in
their chosen country of study.
Ogilsby and Currer gained clinical experience on their electives.
Ogilsby spent part of his in Thailand, where he saw patients whose
illnesses were at a more advanced stages than would have been the case
in Scotland. Currer, who wants to specialise in oncology and
haematology, travelled to an international centre of excellence in these
areas in New Zealand.
Ogilsby's degree was made even longer because he took an extra year at
Dundee to study for a BMedScience, which the university encourages
high-achieving students to take.
''My parents were prepared to help out, but they just couldn't stretch
to six years,'' he said. ''I have six student loans to pay back. Knowing
I had all that debt put me under so much extra pressure on an already
demanding course. I always had the extra worry that if I failed my
finals I would have huge amounts of interest building up and no means to
pay back. It certainly didn't help my studies.''
But if Ogilsby's and Currer's overdrafts are bigger than other
students' so are the salaries they earn immediately after qualifying as
doctors, a basic #18,000 plus more for working extra hours. And, unlike
most students, medical students are guaranteed a job for the first year
after graduation.
However, as Currer pointed out, her pay reflects the high number of
hours she works. Under the guidelines, 72 hours is the maximum weekly
amount for which junior house officers are paid.
She said: ''I've studied for five years to earn less per hour than I
did as a waitress. If I keep on living like a student I should be able
to pay my debt off in two or three years. Luckily I don't have much
spare time for spending money.''

<HEADLINE>Royal Navy decides to test trimaran ship design</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>7</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976552160</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A PROTOTYPE warship is to be built with a trimaran hull.
The revolutionary concept is being taken seriously by the Royal Navy,
which is looking for frigate designs to go into service beyond 2010.
Companies are to be asked to bid for the design, construction, and
trials contract, which is expected to exceed #500m.
Successful tank tests on trimaran hull models have been carried out at
the British Maritime Technology's complex at Portsmouth.
The results, together with work by London University and the Defence
Research Agency, persuaded senior defence officials that the design
could be suitable for frigates.
The Ministry of Defence is asking companies to register their interest
within two weeks. Formal bids will be invited in mid-1996.
Recent studies have shown that the main advantage of a trimaran is low
resistance to the sea so a ship is able to move much more quickly while
using the same amount of power as a single-hull.
The Royal Navy is particularly interested in the flexible lay-out
which a trimaran design can provide. The cross-deck structure between
the main hulls can accommodate another full deck.
This can provide a much larger flightdeck than on single-hull frigates
and, because it is close to the pitching centre of the ship, motion is
significantly reduced and helicopters will be able to operate in rougher
seas.
Researchers also predict reduced running costs because of lower fuel
consumption and easier maintenance.
Southampton-based shipbuilder Vosper Thornycroft is already pressing
hard to build the prototype. It has designed a 100-metre trimaran
corvette for the export market.
The prototype programme will be part of studies into the type of hull
best-suited to a future frigate to be built after the Horizon ship now
being developed by Britain, France, and Italy.

BALDERDASH, bunkum, baloney, bad history, and big battles pretty well
sums up Braveheart, Mel Gibson's grandiose foolhardy epic movie about
William Wallace.
This is Hollywood film makers doing what they have always done --
changing the facts to suit themselves -- so perhaps one should grin and
bear the dramatic licence, although it is nearer a diabolical liberty.
To list all the historical errors would take up too much space. Not that
the film is totally terrible. Intermittently it is hugely entertaining,
although seldom for the right reasons.
Braveheart's trump cards are the cast-of-thousands battle scenes and
Mel himself. Gibson has overcome the inherent difficulties in making
battles before the invention of artillery exciting cinema, having, one
suspects, overdosed on El Cid and Olivier's Henry V and Richard III.
They move at speed and are very violent, although he is not a
particularly inventive strategist. One battle is pretty much like
another. Men die hideously, arrows fly, and horses are impaled on
stakes. The result is both heart-stopping and exciting, but things are
repetitive.
He does, however, essay a better Scottish accent than Liam Neeson in
Rob Roy, but otherwise is far too old to be called laddie and expect any
audience to keep a straight face. One look at the farouche fellow with
his fuzzy wig, cavernous wrinkles half hidden by anachronistic blue and
white face paint -- a case of one for the woad -- and hilarity reigns.
Wallace was a Big Man, Mel is a Wee Man. No matter, shoot him from
below. Wallace lost his wife, Marion Braidfute, renamed Murren for some
inexplicable reason, early in his career. No matter, keep the love
interest going by inventing a romance with the Princess of Wales (pretty
Sophie Marceau looking blank).
Nor as an actor is he up to an ending which would have been beyond
even a Wolfit. But surely Mel, while his innards are extracted, among
the other obscenities involved with being hung, drawn, and quartered,
could have managed a little more than the slightly pained expression of
a man who has forgotten his Rennies.
He dies, not screaming, as Wallace must have done, but shouting
''Freedom'' at the top of his voice. This piece of silliness is because
the film is being touted as about Scotland's fight for liberty --
something the SNP appears to have fallen for -- which is as improbable
as everything else in it.
Tacky sets -- Lanark, a royal burgh with a handsome stone church, in
which Wallace wed, would have been nothing like the gaggle of stone
crofts thatched with turf drowning in mud of the film.
Wallace, a Lowlander, born in Elderslie, married in Lanark, fought
many of his guerrilla campaigns over the terrain in Lanarkshire,
Ayrshire, Perthshire and wherever Stirling was at the time, whereas Mel,
plaid mini-kilt flapping in the breeze, gambols over Highland ridges and
glens like a staglet at bay.
There is also a battlefield moment so ill-judged it takes the breath
away. Wallace and his men lift their kilts and frighten the English half
to death! Did nobody on the set whisper Carry on Up the Khyber in Mel's
lug?
Braveheart, albeit entertaining bunkum, goes on far too long. The
opening section in which we meet the Boy Wallace and his relations could
be ditched entirely, as could the hanging, drawing, and quartering
scene. On the credit side, Patrick McGoohan as Edward I tries to inject
a little regal dignity into the generally ludicrous proceedings and a
gaggle of reliable Scots players -- Angus McFadyen, Brian Cox, and Ian
Bannen among them -- do their best to provide some authenticity.
Battles apart, the main reason for going is Mel who, like most ancient
monuments, is always worth a look.

MILITARY police have re-opened an investigation into allegations that
a senior Army officer misused a helicopter in order to get himself and a
colleague to an inter-regimental golf tournament.
While the Gazelle ferried Lieutenant Colonel Douglas Connon, a
Territorial Army commanding officer, and a fellow officer to Prestwick
from the north of Scotland, their golf clubs were taken to Ayrshire in
the back of an Army car.
Last night, Shadow Defence Secretary Dr David Clark said the
helicopter trip amounted to joyriding and he was writing to Defence
Secretary Michael Portillo ''to ascertain how wide this practice is''.
Dr Clark said: ''Many are fighting and putting their lives at risk in
Bosnia at this time and soldiers are being sacked. This is completely
unacceptable.''
Liberal Democrat MP Menzies Campbell, a member of the Commons Select
Committee on Defence, said: ''At a time when the defence budget is under
very severe scrutiny, it seems wholly inappropriate that taxpayers'
money should be wasted on something like this.
''When people are being made redundant, senior officers should surely
have a responsibility to manage resources as prudently as possible. Many
people will think this was a considerable error of judgment.''
Initial inquiries were made a few months ago when the authorities were
informed that anonymous letters containing the allegations were being
sent to the media.
At that time, in answer to press inquiries, the Special Investigations
Branch of the Military Police ruled the allegations out. However, a
fresh inquiry, instigated by Mr Portillo after a letter from Dr Clark,
has been launched.
Dr Clark said he, too, had made inquiries in July when the allegations
were first made and the MoD had said there was no substance to them.
''It appears they were trying to sweep this under the carpet,'' Dr
Clark said. ''It has taken time but at least they are now looking into
it.''
An Army spokeswoman in Scotland said yesterday: ''We can confirm that
the Special Investigations Branch are investigating allegations of
misuse of a helicopter by the commanding officer of a Territorial Army
battalion in Scotland.''
The helicopter, which was due to fly back empty to its Edinburgh base,
took Lieutenant Colonel Connon, of the 3rd Volunteer Battalion
Highlanders, and his colleague to Prestwick after they had attended VE
Day commemorations in the North-east.
Earlier this year after a spending row involving the RAF, defence
chiefs laid down strict directives about unnecessary expenditure.
No-one was available at Lieutenant Colonel Connon's home at Chappan
Hall, near Nairn.

ARCHBISHOP O'Brien (August 31) is in good company. The prophet Amos
roundly condemned the enemies of Israel and Judah for the atrocities
they had committed on his people; but he then rounded on Israel and
Judah themselves for the atrocities for which they in their turn were
responsible.
So must it be when religious leaders apply genuinely objective
standards of international morality.
I should add that I was drafted into the Royal Navy in the same month
Japan surrendered. I have cause to be grateful to the atom bomb for my
own personal safety, but that is still compatible with dismay at the
horrors war visits on guilty and innocent alike.

THE increasing use of drugs screening and random testing in the
workplace (August 30) should be of concern to both employers and
employees alike.
Clearly, random and with-cause testing raises serious isuses relating
to civil liberties, employment contracts, and the possibility of
victimisation of individual employees.
However, perhaps of more concern is the implicit message which
companies undertaking drugs screening must inevitably send to their
employees. To randomly test for drugs means not only to assert the right
of management to interfere in the personal lives of employees, but also
to loudly declare management's mistrust of, and contempt for, its most
valuable asset -- our people.
It is difficult to see how this can contribute to better motivating
staff.
Abuse of drugs (and alcohol) in the workplace is, of course, something
to be taken seriously by employers, employees, and also trade unions.
However, the way to tackle such issues lies with good management and
progressive personnel procedures, rather than the systematic humiliation
of the entire workforce.

JOHN MacLeod's startlingly nasty piece (Barrymore, August 29) has a
tiny redeeming feature in its last paragraph.
''Those who struggle with forbidding desires, those forced to address,
indeed, homosexual urges, and who are persuaded that the expression of
these is absolutely and in all circumstances wrong . . . I know of such
. . . few friends they have to trust. The very church itself . . . would
recoil from them. But theirs, in the end, is lasting fame and glory.
Theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.''
All we know about psychology, and what we know about Mr Macleod, tells
us that he can only be talking about himself.
One must feel sorry for him; but is it wise of The Herald to continue
to print his personal abreactions to the disgust and, yes, harm of the
general public?

ON the subject of Michael Fry's Rip-Van-Winkle article (August 30)
where on earth has he been hiding?
I'm sure no-one, except by now perhaps his hosts, would begrudge him
That Party, but That Article -- yes, as someone earning a living from
tourism, yes, I begrudge him that article.
Reading between the lines (as one does when someone is going on a bit)
I can't help thinking that perhaps the salmon wasn't the only thing
swimming around in the whisky.
It's always good to hear of someone praising quality and good service,
and encouraging more people to give of their best, but to present an
article that seeks to claim this as in some way an original thought is
more comic than impertinent.
The Scottish Tourist Board has been promoting the theme of quality and
good service for many years now, launching, to this end, the Taste of
Scotland scheme 20 years ago.
It's still going strong, on its well-founded reputation for fairness
to its members and subscribers, be they the grandest country-house hotel
or the simplest B&amp;B. It's not for the snobs, more for the discerning.
Nevertheless I think Michael Fry should go out more. He could start
with his own first recommendation, the delightful Peat Inn near St
Andrews. He will find directions in the '95 edition of the Taste of
Scotland Guide. They have, of course, been a member for many years.

E McIntosh must surely belong to that band of Imperial Britons who
shun progress or conformation and live in a bygone age (August 24). The
EEC and the EU, in their time, have enacted much silly and ridiculous
legislation but metrication is not one of them. Its slow introduction to
the UK has cost the taxpayer very little.
The metric system is now worldwide, adopted by almost every major
country, excepting only America, which learned its illogical imperial
weights and measures from us. Even there, however, metrication is
gradually being adopted and is normal in all science and technology.
In the UK the metric system has been taught in all schools for 20
years or more. The British Standards Institution adopted the
International System of Units (SI) in 1970.
Children have to be burdened with a knowledge of the anachronistic
imperial system because their parents and grandparents will not take the
trouble to adapt.

IT was interesting to read the reflections of Michael Bartlett, public
affairs officer for Transport UK, on ''the central role that buses play
in an integrated transport network'' (August 28).
Despite these fine words some of us have real problems with bus
transport. As a former minister in Hawick I return there from time to
time. The only way to make this journey by public transport from Glasgow
is by bus. But the Glasgow Bus Office cannot, or will not, help you.
Buses from Edinburgh to Hawick are ''another service,'' and the only
help that the Buchanan Street office can provide is to give you an
Edinburgh phone number.
There must be hundreds of Border folk in West Scotland who want on
occasion to go back to their roots in Gala, Selkirk, Hawick, or
Jedburgh. They should not waste their time by seeking information from
the Glasgow Bus Office.
Does not this lack of what Mr Bartlett calls ''an integrated transport
network'' make nonsense of his claim to be running ''a consumer-led
industry''?

Why all the bruhagh over the Scottish National Party's decision to
exploit the Braveheart film? Is it not perfectly logical for a party
that supports the return of Scottish sovereignty to the Scottish people
to follow in Wallace's footsteps?
The SNP do, after all, hold annual Wallace rallies and events and do
sell literature about Wallace, the Wars of Scottish Independence, 1057
till 1560, and Scottish history in general.
The results have been a slow raising of Scottish consciousness and
resistance to the Anglo-Unionist propaganda of the anglicised
universities in Scotland, where Scottish teachers are not taught their
own history and therefore unable to teach the next generation. The
results of that system are all too painfully obvious in our
institutions.
Criticism, or soor grapes, from the London-based unionist parties in
Scotland are given credence by the English-owned media in Scotland.
No-one asks why the modern Proud Edward's loyalist parties do not have
annual Sir John Menteith rallies.
They could gather at Robroyston, where he was betrayed, turn the
bannock and march to Dumbarton Castle, where he was interned, then
finish up with one of their beloved rallies in London, where he was
executed.
The equivalent of the modern-day Judas money paid to Wallace's
captors, and in 1707 to the North Brit lords and present North British
MPs and quango merchants' salaries, could be spent in a celebratory
banquet at their beloved Westminster Ha'.
Lordships, Knichthoods, OBEs, etc, could be granted for annual
services to the English throne. The rally speakers could then tell the
assembly that Wallace fought only for a wee bit o' devolution and a
toom-tabard, empty-jaikit parliament controlled from Westminster.

I NOTE with some amusement the backgrounds of the five people on the
all-women shortlist for selection as Labour parliamentary candidate in
Ayr. Three out of five work in the public sector, a fourth works for a
charity, and I have seen no information as to the profession of the
fifth. As far as I can tell, then, none of the candidates works for a
private sector company.
This is consistent with the backgrounds of sitting Labour MPs, only 8%
of whom have business backgrounds, according to Butler and Kavanagh's
The British General Election of 1992.
Does the Labour Party truly wish its MPs to reflect the diversity of
British life? If so, perhaps it should adopt all-business-person
shortlists in 50% of winnable seats.

THERE is a real danger in the phoney political war which has been
raging back and forth across the political divide for much of the
summer. It is this: we are substantially short of the time for the real
General Election campaign to begin but already the issues are being
overworked. This is better than not having a debate at all, but there is
at least an even chance that the present distaste for politics and
politicians may turn into a weary determination not to listen to them
under any circumstances.
Into this overworked category must go Dr Mawhinney's juvenile attempts
to revive the ''Loony Left'' campaigns of the past and the Labour
Party's equally persistent efforts to dredge up Tory sleaze. Yes, there
are Labour councils which behave unwisely and there are certainly Tory
adherents whose activities are doubtful, but political effort should be
reserved for genuinely worthy cases lest over exposure harden the
general public to the genuine abuses. A further danger lies in the
possibility that the really serious issues of the day may not be treated
with the seriousness which they deserve.
Rail privatisation is one of these, although the entire process is in
such a terminal mess that it is difficult to avoid the constant stream
of problems and absurdities which it presents with such regularity. This
may, or may not, weary people but as one of the worst examples of
political dogma triumphing over common sense it should most assuredly
not do so; especially when the issue under discussion is rail safety.
Fewer than three weeks ago we were grappling with a leaked memo written
by Railtrack's track manager in charge of safety assessment. In it Mr
Jack Rose warned of the substantial danger of another Clapham disaster.
His conclusions were not dealt with satisfactorily by either Government
spokesmen or the Railtrack loyalists who were given the task of putting
the best gloss on their safety procedures. This morning we appear to be
in the throes of yet another allegation of deficient safety procedures
on the part of Railtrack. True, it is a campaign skillfully worked by
Labour, and particularly by Mr Hugh Bayley MP who believes that large
areas of signalling modernisation, apparently called for by the
unpublished Hesketh Report in the aftermath of the Clapham rail
disaster, have not been carried out. Mr Bayley has several good points
to make but he is leaning on an open door as far as the Hesketh Report
is concerned.
The Government insists that it is a purely internal document and
declines to publish it while the position of Railtrack is that the
Hesketh Report is three years old and that its findings have been
overtaken by later recommendations made as a result of more scientific
research work commissioned by Railtrack last year. These assertions, on
the part of both Government and Railtrack, have more holes in them than
the finest Brussels lace. This problem could be resolved by publishing
both the Hesketh Report and the later recommendations in which Railtrack
places such faith. If this is done the work of both reports can be
examined by experts and conclusions drawn which could be acceptable to
the rail industry, to those City figures who are contemplating investing
in the rail system and, most importantly, by those who travel on trains.
There is no need to hold a full-scale independent inquiry as Labour
wishes. This is a solution which is demanded far too frequently. A
little honesty is all that is needed here. If we are given the facts of
the matter it will be possible to make a considered judgment. Until
then, and against a background of a failing and irresponsible rail
policy, the public will have to make up its own mind. The Government
need have no complaints if that collective mind is sceptical.

THE plight of Salman Rushdie, the author whose book, The Satanic
Verses, outraged much devout Muslim opinion, has not much changed in the
six years he has been under threat of death. The threat was pronounced
formally by the late Ayatollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian
Revolution and the head of its government. The Ayatollah was in the main
a religious leader (and made Iran a religious state). His pronouncement
against Mr Rushdie was of a religious nature, and was widely held by
other Islamic clerics to be incapable of withdrawal.
Though its implementation was thought likely to have been accomplished
by a religious fanatic, a substantial financial reward was also included
to encourage others of a more material turn of mind. Mr Rushdie has had
police protection and lived in hiding ever since. There is little reason
to doubt the reality of the risk he endures, and every reason to
sympathise with the frustration he feels. Yet it is hard to see exactly
what the pressures of Western government can do to end the affair.
Yesterday Mr Rushdie said that unless the Iranian Government came up
with assurances that the threats had been abandoned it was time to start
losing patience and use some strong measures against it. Unfortunately,
the position is far more complicated than that would suggest. The
present Iranian Government would like to lift the threat which has
turned out to be an economic impediment to Iran's progress. In its
diplomatic activities with the European Union (and individual member
states, including the UK) the Iranian Government has made this clear,
but it really has been unable to translate any intention into action. It
lacks the confidence to take an open step to withdraw the threat (Fatwa)
and ''strong measures'' to compel it are not likely to work, for the
politicians involved clearly suspect that they would merely attract the
threat of assassination to themselves, and leave Mr Rushdie unaffected.
At a more mundane level, assuming a less apocalyptic outcome, too open a
show of their more liberal hand might simply end their political
influence. The difference between diplomacy, where all can be fluid for
long, and politics, which demand decision, has seldom been more clearly
illustrated. The fact is that the Iranian politicians do not feel they
can afford to decide in Mr Rushdie's favour, although as they concede
diplomatically, that is what they would prefer.
Some Western leaders -- Sir Edward Heath is one -- clearly think Mr
Rushdie asks too much. A more practical question is whether his position
would really change if the Iranian Government could summon up the
collective courage to change its mind. Perhaps withdrawing the monetary
element in the inducement to murder would deter many would-be killers.
Time cools all passions, and it could therefore be that a formal
governmental-inspired withdrawal is not completely unthinkable, but it
is in the nature of religious fanaticism to be unreasonable. A large
number of religiously inspired murderers will almost certainly survive
any attempt to withdraw the Fatwa, and no attempt at counter-coercion
from the West  will restore Mr Rushdie to the position of safety he
enjoyed before his book appeared. His position remains charged with the
tragic elements which have informed it from the beginning. It is not his
fault. His work need not be interpreted as fundamentalists have done;
and he has sought repeatedly to make clear his lack of ill intent
towards Islam (though his latest book just published has now upset
extreme Hindus). What he faces is immovable religious prejudice, not
normally a quality capable of elimination by the sort of state
proclamation which gave it its original being.

I SINCERELY hope that Matthew Smith (August 30) does not think that I
condone the actions of the young lady's fiance but there is little that
can be done. If a father decides to run off and abandon his embryonic
child, there is little anyone can do to stop him.
If he doesn't acknowledge the child as his, nothing short of long,
expensive, and distressing legal action can rectify the situation,
during which I can guarantee the reputation and feelings of the
abandoned mother will be left in tatters.
Of course absent fathers should be called to account (though to help
their children rather than the Treasury) but as all too frequently is
the case, the law serves to protect the perpetrator rather than the
victim.
I have been led to believe that the offence of breach of promise no
longer exists: a grave mistake.

WHERE has Michael Fry been for the past few years?
How can Scotland effectively project a confident quality image while
we have journalists bent on attempting to destroy any positive
initiative to improve tourism before they have even had a chance to
start?
Instead of dwelling on what might have been 10 years ago Mr Fry would
do better to research the real situation in 1995.
Taste of Scotland now represents over 400 quality establishments all
trying to improve the visitor experience by offering excellent Scottish
produce.
He would also do well to note that David Wilson has again renewed his
membership of Taste of Scotland for 1996, as have the vast majority of
quality caterers in Scotland.
Instead of prodding from the sidelines why doesn't Mr Fry use his
allocated space in your paper to report on the positive developments in
Scotland?

THE very first time I crossed the Scottish Border to England I was
heading by train for Liverpool.
It was the 1940s and I was a teenage lad intrigued by the aura of the
big city. I remember venturing through the portals of the impressive
Adelphi Hotel and finding myself carried away by the swell of a large
string orchestra in the main lounge.
I sat down to listen -- and sent up a request for a popular tune of
the day. It was Love's Last Word is Spoken, a mellow modern waltz which
no doubt said something about the mood of that period.
For some extraordinary reason, I have hardly been back in Liverpool
since then. Not, that is, until last week when I boarded a train once
more, changed at Preston, and brushed past familiar names like Wigan, St
Helen's, and Huyton before grinding through the gloomy approach to Lime
Street Station.
That much at least I remembered. But beyond that, I recognised
practically nothing of Liverpool, which has no doubt undergone the same
physical change as every other big city in the post-war world.
What I may well be saying, however, is that the experience of
Liverpool merely symbolised my inability to recognise so much of the
life which now surrounds us.
For sure, so much has changed that there will no longer be an
orchestra to entertain guests at the Adelphi Hotel.
And if there is music at all, it will be unlikely to express such a
tender emotion as Love's Last Word is Spoken.
It will no doubt be put down to the onset of old age but I am finding
difficulty in recognising not just the tenor of living but the structure
of so many human beings who are dictating it.
On that train journey to Liverpool, I tried hard to understand the raw
vulgarity of a couple of youthful fellow-passengers who sat drinking
from their cans, with feet on a seat and snarling expressions which
radiated menace at every turn.
Behind me sat the female counterpart, two girls who seemed to regard
their foul language as the normal currency of conversation.
All four could have been creatures from another planet, a species I
neither knew nor would want to.
It is the reckless disregard for other people's rights which is
worrying. By a modern philosophy of
do-your-own-thing-and-to-hell-with-other-people, they claim their own
total freedom at the expense of everyone else's.
So many crazy things are happening around us that you wonder what has
got into people. It would be too simplistic to lay it at the door of
unemployment, except that that affords much time to absorb the
influences which a now-dangerously commercial world provides.
There is time to linger over the vicious videos and sordid satellites
which are becoming an obsession with so many in vulnerable age-groups.
Minds are being poisoned.
It doesn't take much imagination to see how the accompanying craze for
drugs can stimulate a desire in an unstable mentality to turn those
fantasies of film into the reality of the street.
So we get the kind of horrendous behaviour which spatters blood across
our morning headlines day after day.
Just last month, yet another pair of thugs went to jail for life after
kicking a Glasgow youth to death. They stamped on his head and, as he
lay unconscious in a pool of blood, paused for another swig of their
Buckfast stimulant before resuming the final kicking.
Ironically, that brand of wine, so popular with the young and said to
be causing mayhem in many a community, is made by monks in Devon who
have refused the overtures of Helen Liddell MP to tone down the fire in
their water.
Worse still, a man who markets the stuff strikes a sick note of
facetiousness when quoted as saying that he owes Mrs Liddell ''a
commission cheque for all she has done for the company''. He described
her as a lovely lady who had pushed up their sales.
I wonder what the family of young Alex McNee thought about that -- the
lad who took a last breath as his face was pulverised by a Buckfast
bottle. Is there no sensitivity left?
I took such depressing thoughts with me on that train to Liverpool
last week, on a day which itself offered little hope of better feelings.
For I was there to attend the joint funeral of Robbie Gee and Paul
Barker, the couple of 13-year-olds who went off to fish in a local pond
during their school holidays and were later found stabbed to death.
I watched as Kathy Gee dropped a single red rose into the grave of her
only child and turned away with a brave face towards home. But home to
what? To a life now blighted for ever, offering at best the hope that
she and her husband will find the strength to live with their fate.
The earnest hope beyond that is that, somehow, the current tide will
turn back from what looks dangerously like a path to anarchy.
It is a sad day in human history if we can no longer allow our
children to go fishing at a local pond. A time of fresh hope and
optimism must surely come.

Alasdair MacColl faces 29 charges in Switzerland where it is alleged
he obtained money for arranging loans that did not materialise. George
Hume examines the accusations
AN Edinburgh solicitor twice disciplined for duping clients out of
funds and then allowed to stay on the official register of the Law
Society of Scotland provided he did not practise in this country faces
trial in Switzerland on fraud charges amounting to more than #6m.
Alasdair MacColl is recorded in the current Scottish Law Directory as
a Writer to the Signet. His last practising address was at a basement
flat at 42 Coates Gardens in Edinburgh. But that property, where his
mother lived, has been sold, Mr MacColl has been unsuccessfully sought
in connection with Court of Session proceedings which allege fraud, and
Swiss police say he faces seven years in jail if convicted of the
charges against him.
The trial, set down for five days next March before the Tribunal du
District de Vevey, will hear allegations that Mr MacColl fraudulently
obtained huge sums of money in ''arrangement'' fees for loans that never
materialised.
Mr MacColl, held in prison in Switzerland for 12 months before being
released on bail and disappearing, struck the stay-on-the-directory deal
at his second appearance before the Scottish Solicitors' Discipline
Tribunal in the mid-1980s. Fined #500 for taking fees without consent,
Mr MacColl negotiated to keep his name on the directory to allow him to
earn his living overseas -- undertaking in return not to practise in
Scotland.
Earlier this week the Law Society of Scotland was heavily criticised
over its investigation of complaints against a Hamilton-based law firm
and was ordered to pay the aggrieved client compensation. The Scottish
Legal Services Ombudsman, Mr Garry Watson, described the Law Society's
investigation as ''thoroughly unsatisfactory''.
According to the Law Society of Scotland, Alasdair MacColl pays a
retainer to be on the current register although he does not hold a
practising certificate, the last one having expired on October 31, 1990.
Of the deal that underwrites Mr MacColl's good name by allowing it to
stay on the directory, Mr Kenneth Pritchard, the society secretary,
said: ''Since the 1986 disciplinary tribunal finding, the Law Society,
despite its knowledge of criminal investigations by Austrian and Swiss
police, has had no evidence to take further steps against Mr MacColl. We
await the outcome of the Swiss trial with considerable interest.''
Within months of the 1986 discipline tribunal -- he had been fined
#1000 by the same body the previous year for misuse of clients' funds
and charging grossly excessive fees, one female client being stung for
#8000 -- Mr MacColl became a familiar figure in many of Europe's top
hotels.
There he met businessmen to arrange loans that, allegedly, were not
forthcoming. Police say that German brothers Reinhard and Albert Kusel,
spoken to by a number of those who allege they lost money, will be tried
at the same time as Mr MacColl. In all, there are 29 charges.
More than 50 European, American, and Israeli businessmen who have been
interviewed by police in the course of their investigation into the
activities of Mr MacColl say he made much of his standing as a Writer to
the Signet.
The monies allegedly obtained by Mr MacColl are said by Swiss police
to have been paid by businessmen or companies in the form of an advance
guarantee fee following his offer to arrange multi-million dollar loans.
According to Detective Inspector Marcel Coquerand of the Lausanne
fraud squad, most dealings with Mr MacColl were made by businessmen
unable to get funds from conventional banking sources. Meetings were
held in different countries, says the inspector, to muddy the issue of
legal jurisdiction.
Pursuing Mr MacColl in the Court of Session is the Panamanian
incorporated company Mach Marketing International SA -- its address,
ironically, at El Dorado -- which is seeking #50,000 and $100,000 with
interest, in both cases, at 15% back-dated eight years. A story of
international wheeling-dealing, an allegedly fabulously wealthy trust, a
disappearing doctor, and a vanishing professor has been unfolded in
court documents over the past five years. The case goes before the court
in January.
The directors of Mach Marketing come from Welwyn Garden City. They,
and a businessman from Haddenham in Buckinghamshire, set up a venture
which required, according to court documents, ''a loan of at least
several million pounds. Having attempted to obtain loans from more
conventional sources without success the said venture were contacted by
a Dr Toma who introduced them to the defender (MacColl).''
There followed, it is alleged, a series of meetings between members of
the venture and MacColl, first in the Hotel de L'Horizon in Jersey, then
the Hotel Schloss in Salzburg, followed by the Amstel Hotel in
Amsterdam.
The alleged meeting at Salzburg was not without acrimony. A financial
expert taken along by members of the venture was, they claim
''rubbished'' by MacColl, who allegedly told them to contact a Professor
Urban for independent advice. Neither Dr Toma nor Professor Urban can be
traced.
When, on December 9, 1987, a contract was allegedly signed, MacColl,
it is claimed, revealed that his clients -- who would put up the money
-- were the Nikon Trust Corporation, registered in the Turks and Caicos
Islands, which had a connection with the Japanese conglomerate.
According to documents before the Court of Session: ''The pursuers
(Mach Marketing) were not allowed to take away a copy of the contract
prior to production by them of $100,000.'' Mach Marketing claims the
advance money was transferred to Mr MacColl's notary's account where,,
under the terms of the contract, it should have been held for 30 banking
days but was transferred by Mr MacColl the day after he got it.
The members of Mach Marketing have now learned, they say, that the
Nikon Trust had no funds and was not connected to the Japanese
conglomerate; that Mr MacColl was an officer of the trust and was well
aware that the trust had no money and would not be able to provide a
loan.
Defending the action, Mr MacColl agrees that the $100,000 was paid
over but says the conditions of the agreement requiring production of
bankers' guarantees by Mach Marketing were not implemented.
According to a firm of private investigators in Bonn which is handling
several dozen cases in which Mr MacColl is alleged to have dealt with
companies seeking loans, some $2000m has been promised from a ghost
Japanese trust fund since November 1988.
Mr MacColl's last-known address in Scotland was Keithock House near
Brechin, Angus. The isolated 15-room mansion, set in 58 wooded acres,
was sold in November 1990 for #320,000. Part of that money was used to
provide #80,000 bail to have Mr MacColl released from the prison of
Boisegois Mermet in Lausanne where he had been held since his arrest in
Geneva the previous December.
According to Inspector Cocquerand, Mr MacColl will have his #80,000
bail returned if he turns up for trial. ''If he does not, he loses the
money and will be placed on the wanted list,'' he said.

WITH all the benefit of hindsight, and a selective and subjective one
at that, Ian Hamilton launches into a diatribe against Christianity in
general and Presbyterianism in particular and displays something of that
very aggression of which he accuses Christians (August 31).
He conveniently ignores the fact, known in happy marriages, that one
can disagree in certain principles or particulars and yet be amicably
related in personal terms.
Likewise he overlooks the glorious fact that the Reformed and Roman
Catholic Churches, despite significant differences, have and enjoy much
more in common -- above all and below all: the pale Galilean who
conquered and conquers love.
Now to some other chiels that winna ding. The Scottish Reformation,
while failing to produce a Scots Bible as it did a Scots Confession
(albeit the Church is not a linguistic society), did put an end to the
constant and costly wars with England; something vastly more important
than the imagined ''wine and wax and theatre-going and glee''.
The Scottish Reformation with its emphasis on education meant that our
little land was to produce far more than its fair share of men of
genius; compare famous Scots before and after 1560.
Ian Hamilton strangely ignores the ''Scotland in Europe'' factor --
for example that the sad treatment of ''witches'' was a European
phenomenon often enshrined in civil law; that the Covenanters operated
in an awareness of tyranny and terrible persecutions of a Louis XIV, and
in the hour of their triumph killed no-one.
He forgets that the Enlightenment, including David Hume (possibly a
closet Christian), flourished in moderate Presbyterian Scotland.
Likewise, too, maybe not having read the small print, he forgets that
the Westminster Confession abounds in proof texts.
He ignores the fact that the Church supported marriage and had to
support the children of those born out of wedlock -- hence Burns, a
member of the Church using the reformed confessional, paid his dues.
Strangely, Mr Hamilton ignores a basic fact of Presbyterianism: that
religion is too important to be left to a clerical caste and that elders
bear an equal share -- the great Montrose was an elder, and one of the
most ardent Presbyterians was a lawyer, Johnston of Warriston.
Sure, the Church has had its dark pages but many more glorious ones.
Sure, as John Whyte replied to the heckler's accusation that the Church
is full of hypocrites, ''Yes, but there's always room for one more!''
Sure, our beliefs may seem absurd but it is an absurdity that makes
sense of an often absurd world -- a folly that is wisdom!
And assuredly, the Faith provides excitement and encouragement and
energy to those who would follow Him who can make ''ordinary people'' as
Mr Hamilton terms himself, extraordinary and indeed more human.

SOON after Nelson Mandela was released from prison, his old friend
Desmond Tutu stepped out of the limelight. After years of striding in
the front ranks of the anti-apartheid crusade, the irrepressible church
leader withdrew from the political arena to devote himself to spiritual
affairs. The time had come for Mandela and his comrades in the African
National Congress to get on with the job of governing a non-racial South
Africa.
Now, to the discomfort of some prominent ANC figures, he is back -- to
remind them of the dangers of being corrupted by the legacies of the
power they fought to overthrow. As perceptive and outspoken as ever, the
Anglican Archbishop of Southern Africa has been stirring lively debates
over the conduct of some members of the government, the immorality of
selling arms to other African countries -- and whether Mandela should
get a new tailor.
During a break from leading the Scottish Episcopal Church conference
in St Andrews at the weekend, he explained why: ''We've struggled to get
these guys where they are, and we're not going to let them fail. We
didn't swallow all that tear gas, and be chased around, and be sent to
jail, and into exile, and killed, for failure. We paid too heavy a price
for the thing to collapse now.
''The worst possible thing we could do for democracy in our country
would be to become kowtowing lapdogs. We need a vigorous group of people
to express a kind of critical solidarity with the government; that is to
support them fully in the many good things they do, but to speak out
when they fall short of what is required.''
Whatever else the Most Rev Desmond Tutu has been charged with in his
turbulent career, nobody has ever accused him of being a lapdog. The
terrier snapping at the heels of apartheid has become a watchdog for the
conscience and aspirations of the new ''rainbow nation''.
If he had been a professor grading the government, he says he would
have given it an alpha minus for its performance so far -- minus because
of the ''gravy-train affair'', and arms sales to Rwanda.
When the archbishop approvingly quoted an ANC activist late last year
as saying that some ANC leaders had stopped the gravy train only long
enough to get on it, he was merely expressing a growing concern among
many of their constituents.
''It's not that there is corruption or inefficiency in government, but
there is perhaps a whiff of it. There is a first tinge of public
cynicism that some of the people who have got into the corridors of
power are not much different than the ones they replaced. Unfortunately
the miasma of corruption of the old dispensation is very overpowering,
and it can overwhelm you. It is insidious, and our people need to watch
out. So I have told Madiba (Mandela's clan-name) that we are going to be
watching them. We've told them we're not going to give them any
respite.''
The archbishop's measured approach to the government's overall
performance does not extend to its dealings in the arms market, which he
abhors. An admission by the South African state arms corporation,
Armscorp, that it had sold weapons to Rwanda opened a can of military
worms.
''Which one of us can ever hold our head up high knowing these arms
were used in the genocide? Almost all of our trade is with Third World
countries, and the general pattern is that they can't afford what they
are spending on arms, most of which are used against their own people.
Almost everywhere, and certainly in Africa, armies are not for the
defence of the citizenry; they are instruments of repression, gobbling
up valuable resources. Having got on to the moral high ground with our
transition to democracy, why should we undermine that by continuing to
sell weapons to such people?''
The South African government responded to widespread criticism last
week by establishing a Cabinet committee to supervise arms sales, but
Archbishop Tutu and his supporters are far from satisfied.
''It still doesn't deal with the problem of the principle we're
attacking. What we want ultimately is to see Africa demilitarised. If
you have countries that claim to be democratic, and are friendly with
one another, what do you need huge armies for? We should start by
dismantling Armscorp.''
Having said all that, the archbishop is heartened by a new sense of
pride and freedom in his beloved country. He regrets that not much has
changed in material terms -- most of the land is still owned by whites,
millions of blacks are still without decent homes and basic amenities,
and the police force is still having difficulty adapting to the
post-apartheid era. Much needs to be done quickly to improve the quality
of life of most South Africans. However, it is an unusual experience for
them to have a head of state who is universally admired -- even if he
does insist on wearing the same style of light cloth shirts all the
time.
''Among the positive things is just the sense of being free. It's not
easy to compute, I mean you can't put a value to what it means suddenly
to feel, hey, I'm me, and when I see a policeman I no longer have to pat
my pockets and wonder if I've got my pass with me. That is a very
important achievement.''
Another important achievement this year was South Africa's victory in
the Rugby World Cup which involved, according to the archbishop, a
measure of divine intervention. ''We had to work hard on our hot lines
to you know where,'' he revealed. ''We organised that.''
Unfortunately, time is running out for this remarkable man to organise
such miracles, at least in his present capacity -- he is due to retire
next June, and he plans to devote the ensuing year to theological
writing. He will be sorely missed, not least by new friends in Scotland.
As he wandered off to a plenary session of the Episcopal Church
conference, dressed in casual clothes and training shoes, an official
said: ''He's wonderful. Everyone gets kind of lifted up by him.'' It is
an experience familiar to millions of South Africans.

THE Queen Mother braved chill winds and rain for a warm reception from
10,000 wellwishers at the Royal Braemar Gathering on Saturday.
Torrential rain throughout the day sparked rumours that only the
Queen, patron of the Braemar Royal Highland Society, would attend.
But a huge roar went round the rain-soaked showground as the Queen
Mother, dressed in a rain cape and pale green hat, emerged and waved to
the crowds.
The event, which was first held in 1817, is the highlight of the
Scottish Highland Games calendar and senior members of the royal family
attend each year during their summer holiday at Balmoral.

THE threat of widespread disruption in the NHS was stepped up
yesterday as two more organisations representing health workers
announced ballot results showing strong support for industrial action.
The latest results were announced on the eve of talks being held in
London today between the NHS executive and leaders of about a dozen
trade unions and professional associations whose members have rejected
the Government's offer of a 1% pay rise topped by up to 2% locally.
The GMB union, whose members include workers in ambulances and
ambulance control rooms and auxiliary staff in hospitals, yesterday
revealed that its ballot has produced a vote of 72.5% in favour of
industrial action.
Mr Mick Fisher, the union's national officer for health workers, said:
''This result is a resounding message to the Government that health
workers will not accept its pay offer or local bargaining.
''We wish to avoid any industrial action but, if the employers do not
come back with a reasonable offer in response to our pay claim, we will
be forced to cause disruption to the health service.''
The Community and District Nursing Association also announced a strong
mandate for industrial action. A ban on unpaid overtime was supported by
73.4% of its members. Other health workers who have already backed
industrial action include members of the Society of Radiographers who
warned last week that they would carry out emergency duties only on
selected days later this month. Earlier last week, 30,000 therapists
voted to strike on September 21.
The biggest union in the NHS, Unison, is due to announce the result of
its industrial action ballot this week.

HEROIC efforts were required all round to enable the Braveheart
premiere to go ahead at Stirling's MacRobert arts centre last night.
It was an epic struggle. It may not have involved any loss of blood --
but it did mean the loss of a venue originally booked by hundreds of
blood experts.
For the arts centre on the Stirling University campus was supposed to
be part of the accommodation for a Scotblood/British Blood Transfusion
Society conference.
That was the plan until just a few weeks ago, when the campus was
selected for the premiere, and the MacRobert building suddenly found
itself having to swap scripts and prepare for a much more glamorous
role.
The university worked flat out to provide alternative facilities for
the 700 delegates attending the blood conference. It created four
temporary conference theatres, in the sports hall and the Gannochy
National Tennis Centre, for the event which began on Saturday and ends
today.
A university spokesman yesterday confirmed that the MacRobert centre
had been part of the conference's original booking.
But he said the conference organisers had been very co-operative about
the change of plan.
If the change of plan has created any bad blood, the conference
organisers are not letting on. A spokesman said: ''It has required a bit
of effort in terms of organisation, but in terms of the people attending
it has not been a problem at all.''
At the conference yesterday, the former regional director of the
Glasgow and West of Scotland Blood Transfusion Service, Dr Ruthven
Mitchell, was presented with the Oliver Award in recognition of his
distinguished and committed work.

EMPLOYMENT Service staff could lose their chance of promotion if they
do not persuade enough unemployed people to drop their claims for
benefit, according to Labour's Scottish employment spokesman, Mr John
McFall.
He said yesterday that the agency was concentrating too much on
deterring people from claiming benefit rather than actually helping
those who needed assistance.
He is critical of an instruction which the Employment Service has
given its staff to achieve a target of 9% of people who are expected not
to pursue a claim after making contact with the agency. Last year some
430,000 people, or 10%, abandoned their claims.
Mr McFall said the targets were an incentive to staff to dissuade
people and, if they did not do so, they could be passed over for
promotion.
He contrasted the enthusiasm for this target with the agency's
inability to pay sufficient numbers of claimants their benefit on time.
Originally, a target of 75% of claimants being paid within 10 days was
set but that had now drifted to 12 days since the Government cut staff
numbers.
''The Government frequently and sanctimoniously stress the need for
private industry to be more aware of the necessity of meeting customer
needs but apparently this does not apply to the unemployed,'' he said.
''What we are witnessing is a service which is now being orientated
towards discouraging people from applying for what they are entitled
to.''

<HEADLINE>Labour demands rail safety inquiry</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>4</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976552187</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
LABOUR last night demanded a full-scale independent inquiry into rail
safety amid claims that vital signal repairs were being shelved in the
dash for privatisation.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher said the rail sell-off
should be halted pending an investigation by the railway inspectorate of
the Health and Safety Executive.
The call came as figures compiled by Labour MP Hugh Bayley -- and
hotly contested by Railtrack -- appeared to show that three-quarters of
a #170m repair programme was either seriously behind schedule or
shelved.
Mr Bayley claimed that Railtrack was trampling roughshod over the
recommendations of the Hesketh Report into signalling safety, published
after the Clapham Junction rail disaster which left 39 dead.
The disclosures raised new fears that passenger safety has dropped
down the list of priorities in the rush to sell off the rail network.
But Railtrack fiercely denied it was cutting corners on safety and
said it was in the middle of a #362m programme to modernise old
signalling.
Research by Mr Bayley appeared to show large areas of repair work
recommended as urgent in the Hesketh Report were being allowed to slip
as signalling engineers were laid off.
The report catalogued extensive problems in signalling equipment on
busy commuter lines across the country, ranging from decaying wiring and
poor insulation to corrosion and leaks on electrical circuits.
Mr Bayley said: ''No wonder the Government wants to suppress this
report. It shows the decrepit state of signalling on congested commuter
routes and regional railways, and reveals the full effects of
Railtrack's cuts in investment for replacing defective signals -- just
when the Government is trying to sell Railtrack.
''The Government is determined that nothing should stand in the way of
rail privatisation, even when it compromises the safety or reliability
of rail travel.''
Mr Meacher said: ''Clearly there are disasters waiting to happen. The
whole record is a devastating indictment of the incompetence of
Railtrack to handle rail safety.''
Mr Jimmy Knapp, general secretary of the Rail Maritime and Transport
union, said: ''The awful tragedy of Clapham appears to have been
forgotten in the face of the Government's determination to privatise at
any price.''
Mr Knapp said skilled workers who could have used their expertise in
essential signalling work were being ''thrown on the scrapheap''.
A spokesman for Railtrack said the findings of the Hesketh Report,
carried out in 1992, had been overtaken by later recommendations in more
scientific research commissioned by the track authority last year.
Railtrack insisted it was ''nonsense'' to suggest that safety was no
longer a priority.

SURGEONS are preparing to use a robot device to restore hearing.
Their own dexterity will still be needed to direct the super-sensitive
''intelligent'' drill.
It is to be used for the first time in trials with volunteer patients
in Bristol's NHS hospitals at the end of this year.
The surgeon's target is the body's smallest bone, the stapes, which
plays a crucial role in carrying sound transmissions from the ear drum
through the middle ear to the inner ear.
The self-propelling drill enables the surgeon to create a small hole
to attach a minute piston. It links bones to the middle ear to mimic the
function of the diseased stapes.
The drill was developed at Bristol University as part of a two-year
project by the Advanced Manufacturing and Automation Research Group. The
Bristol team included two local leading surgeons.

AN animal lover has offered a reward for the arrest of the person who
slashed a pet cat across the head, possibly with an axe, and left it to
die.
A passer-by found the cat in a pool of blood in the stairwell of a
block of flats in Galashiels and sent an SOS to Jill Solway of the
Borders Animal Welfare rescue centre.
Galashiels vet Colin Lyons operated on the long-haired grey for 90
minutes to correct a smashed nose bone and a cut deep in the skull that
had severed eye muscles.
''Another centimetre towards the eye and he would have been blinded,''
Mr Lyons said.
''There was a lot of blood pumping out of arteries and the cat would
almost certainly have bled to death if he had not been found.
''The injuries were caused by blows with something very sharp like an
axe or heavy knife and must have been delivered with a lot force.''
Yesterday Jill Solway discounted the possibility of an accident.
''The police are investigating the incident and I will put up #50 of
my own money as a reward for information that leads to the conviction of
whoever did it,'' she said.
When the cat, called Poos, has recovered, she will find him a home.
''There won't be a problem,'' she said. ''The offers have started
pouring in already.''

<HEADLINE>Call for end to breast cancer screening. Expert says scheme saves too few lives.</HEADLINE>
<EDITION>3</EDITION>
<PAGE>2</PAGE>
<RECORDNO>976552190</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
A LEADING breast cancer expert was at the centre of a controversy last
night after calling for the scrapping of the national screening
programme he helped to set up.
Professor Michael Baum now believes the X-ray tests performed on more
than one million women a year are ''not worth doing'' because they save
too few lives, cost too much, and cause thousands of women needless
worry by wrongly suggesting they may have cancer.
He called for more money to be spent instead on efforts to find
treatments that could help the majority of cancer patients.
Professor Baum, consultant surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital,
London, and former director of clinical research at the Institute of
Cancer Research, is understood to have resigned from the NHS breast
cancer screening advisory group so he can air his concerns in public.
The group advises the Department of Health on how the programme should
be run and sets guidelines for Ministers.
Last night, the professor's stance was opposed by Dr Kenneth Calman,
the Government's chief medical officer, who insisted the #27m programme
could save the lives of 1250 women a year and was ''a very important
investment''. Breast cancer kills 13,000 women in Britain every year.
Dr Calman said: ''All the evidence shows that the breast screening
programme is working well. Fifteen thousand cancers in England alone
have been detected in the first three years. Early detection means a
much better chance of effective treatment. We are concerned about all
cancers and are in the middle of a major review of cancer services that
will improve care.''
Dr Calman said Professor Baum's contribution in the field had been
''very important'' and added: ''Clearly his views are important to us
too, so we have to take him very seriously. But we have, and it's a
matter of how you view the data. Clearly there will be some women -- and
it's a very small number according to our figures -- who may turn out to
have a false positive or a false negative.''
However, he maintained the evidence suggested that screening did pick
up breast cancer early, giving women the opportunity for the earliest
and best possible treatment.
Asked if the money could be more usefully spent on other areas, Dr
Calman said: ''We do have a high incidence of breast cancer in this
country and that is why it is very important we do something about it,
and the screening programme is a part of it.''
It was not true that no money was being spent on other aspects of the
disease, he said. ''We have just, for example, produced a very important
report on the way in which cancer services are provided. That, I think,
will do something tremendous to help every patient with cancer, not just
with breast cancer.''
The Cancer Research Campaign, which spends up to #10m a year on breast
cancer research, strongly supported the screening programme.
A spokeswoman said: ''Undoubtedly the screening programme is detecting
early cancers and has the potential to save lives. There's no way the
screen programme will come to an abrupt halt.''
She said it would be ''foolish'' to halt the programme before it had
been properly evaluated. ''You can question the cost but it depends how
much value you put on a life.
''Undoubtedly lives are being saved. How many, we're not sure, but
every life that's saved is somebody's granny or somebody's mother.
''Life is precious. There's no point in cutting the programme half-way
through when you don't know what the outcome is going to be.''
Other members of the advisory group are understood to disagree
strongly with Professor Baum.
Another member who helped pioneer breast screening in Britain, Dr Joan
Austoker, of the Cancer Research Campaign, is known to be an avid
supporter of the programme.
Professor Baum helped launch Britain's first breast cancer screening
programme in 1990. It offers three-yearly X-ray examinations to look for
pre-cancerous lumps in women in the highest risk 50 to 64 age group. The
programme is still under review.
He is known to be concerned over studies in Europe that have raised
doubts over the effectiveness of screening programmes.
The Cancer Research Campaign spokeswoman pointed out that many of the
studies involved younger women than those who qualify for screening in
Britain. ''You are not comparing like with like,'' she said.
Professor Baum was not available for comment yesterday. A spokeswoman
for the Institute of Cancer Research, based at the Royal Marsden
Hospital, said that, although Professor Baum had the honourable title of
emeritus professor at the institute, he was no longer employed there.
She added: ''These are very much the individual views of Professor
Baum speaking as an individual and not on behalf of the institute or the
Royal Marsden Hospital.''

THE Labour Party wants local authorities to set up special telephone
lines so that people can report vehicles which emit too much exhaust.
In a report published today, Labour wants more motorists penalised for
excessive exhaust emissions and for local authorities to persuade people
to shift to using public transport, cycling and walking instead.
It also calls on the Government to consider making vehicle taxes or
license fees more expensive the larger the vehicle is.
Shadow Transport Secretary Michael Meacher claimed that although
catalytic converters had reduced exhaust emissions, increasing vehicle
use would cancel out the gains.
''The health and quality of life of millions is affected by excess
traffic and the absence of a planned and integrated transport
strategy,'' he said.

Unions and party set for clash on minimum wage.
LABOUR leader Tony Blair could be on a collision course with the trade
union movement over the establishment of a national minimum wage and
moves to reduce further its influence on Labour Party decision making.
He made clear to his critics in the party, yesterday, that he wants no
let-up in the pace of internal reform.
Interviewed on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Blair said Britain had
to move forward if it is going to be successful.
That would only be achieved ''by a party that has the courage to face
up to change itself'', he said, adding: ''We are not an amateur party,
we are a professional party which is about winning power for the people
to change this country for the better.''
He did not contest a suggestion that the trade union share of Labour
conference votes could be reduced below the new figure of 50%, which
will be enacted at this autumn's party conference.
Almost immediately, the leader of the General, Municipal and
Boilermaker's union, Mr John Edmonds, said on BBC Radio 4's World This
Weekend that he did not think the party should move further on union
representation.
He said: ''50-50 is a good balance between the constituency parties
and the trade unions.''
Some unions suspect that Mr Blair's long-term aim is to abolish the
union vote completely, and have voting done by local parties alone,
whose representation would include large numbers of trade unionists as
individual members.
Mr Blair again refused to put a figure to a minimum wage which a
Labour government would introduce, although he said he supported the
principle.
He condemned hourly rates as low as #2.50, but would not endorse the
TUC objective of a #4.15 rate, a level he has been advised that would
cause significant job losses.
Mr Edmonds, together with Mr Bill Morris of the Transport and General
Workers' Union, and Mr Rodney Bickerstaffe of Unison, launched a
campaign yesterday for ''more than four''.
He said this was not a retreat from #4.15, and was aimed at low paying
employers rather than the Labour leadership.
Mr Edmonds said that more than 90% of GMB members were already above
the #4 threshold, and efforts would be concentrated on taking the rest
through this year.
Companies high on the GMB target list included clothing companies such
as Claremont Garments, Dewhursts, and the Baird Group, all currently
paying #2.86 an hour, the Asda supermarket group, which pays check out
staff #3.67, and those local authorities whose rates still fall below
#4.
Playtex and Levis, both in Strathclyde, pay their machinists more than
#5 an hour, and were among companies singled out by Mr Edmonds as an
illustration of employers that could pay a decent living wage and run an
efficient business.
With just a week to the opening of the annual Congress in Brighton,
TUC officials later today will make renewed attempts to persuade
firefighters' leader Ken Cameron and construction union UCATT's general
secretary, Mr George Brumwell, to drop amendments to motions inserting
the figure of #4.15 an hour.
The union leaders are calling on Mr Blair and his front bench
spokesmen to support the ''more than four'' campaign, which may put them
in an embarrassing situation.
Home Secretary Michael Howard said Mr Blair continued to offer only
bland phrases. He was asking the people of Britain for a blank cheque on
issues like the minimum wage.
Since returning from his summer holiday, Mr Blair has been more
concerned by the media coverage of the views of Labour critics than the
views themselves.
This is because most of the critics have always opposed modernisation
and changes like the reform of Clause Four. Their views and the other
summer embarrassment, the suspension of Walsall Labour Party, received
fuller publicity because of the dearth of other political news.
Mr Blair said some party members felt free to criticise because they
thought the next election was already ''in the bag'', but that was not
true.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister will begin a series of regional tours on
Tuesday, during which he will meet party activists before the
Conservative Party conference in October.
He will also hold a ''political'' Cabinet at Chequers later this
month, at which Ministers will concentrate on the economy and taxation
policy, as well as considering welfare, education, and crime.
Mr Major also hopes to win over doubters to a national identity card
scheme, which could be announced at the conference. Some Ministers would
still like cards to be restricted to welfare claimants and other groups,
rather than made compulsory for all.

<RECORDNO>976552193</RECORDNO>
<TEXT>
AN inquiry was launched yesterday into an oil spill in Orkney as
conservationists warned that seabirds could be put at risk.
Oil gushed on to the main road through Kirkwall after a power station
pipeline ruptured. Torrential rain washed some of the fuel into drains
leading to Kirkwall Bay.
Firefighters and pollution control experts mopped up most of the oil,
but some found its way into the sea.
Mr Eric Meek, Orkney's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds
officer, said heavy fuel oil had ended up in crevices among the rocks
along a 100 yard stretch of the shoreline.
In six weeks time Goldeneye ducks will have migrated to Orkney from
the Arctic.
Mr Meek said: ''They feed on the sea close to here. Our concern is
that all this residual oil will gradually leach into the sea for some
considerable time.
''If that's still happening six weeks from now these Goldeneye could
well be at risk.''
Orkney's oil pollution officer, Captain Bob Sclater, said a relatively
small amount of oil had reached the sea.
He said heavy seas during storms should clean up the affected
shoreline, while naturally-occuring bacteria would also eat away at the
oil.
Mr Phil White, Hydro-Electric's district manager in Orkney, said
''several hundred litres'' of oil had escaped from the fractured
pipeline.
The oil covered a 200 yard section of Junction Road.
Shops, garages and a restaurant had to be closed, while other stores
suffered damage to carpets as customers walked in with oil on their
shoes.
Mr White said an inquiry team would try to assess what caused the
rupture and a helpline would be set up to advise businesses affected by
the spill.

UNISON'S deputy general secretary yesterday made his demands of a
future Labour government.
Mr Dave Prentis said after a seminar in Glasgow, involving councillors
and local activists, that there was a need for a ''revival of local
democracy'' and a system of financing which would enhance the
independence and accountability of local government.
He called for an end to compulsory competitive tendering, and said:
''From day one of a Labour government, no local authority should be
forced to contract out any service.''

LABOUR accused the Government of trampling over guidelines to clean up
public life after it emerged at the weekend that a former Trade Minister
was about to join the board of a leading company.
Mr Richard Needham, 53, is expected to join GEC within two months of
stepping down.
It will be next month before rule changes recommended by the Nolan
Committee on standards in public life are ratified by Parliament.
Mr Brian Wilson, Shadow Trade Minister, said the move appeared to show
it was ''business as usual'' in Government circles despite claims by Mr
Major that he is encouraging the highest standards among MPs and
Ministers.
Lord Nolan called for ex-Ministers to be subjected to the same
scrutiny as civil servants by an advisory committee on appointments if
they wanted to take jobs in the private sector within two years of
leaving office.
The Sunday Express said Mr Needham, MP for Wiltshire North, was
expected to be given a six-figure salary and placed in charge of the
company's export drive. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to former
Cabinet Minister Lord Prior, now GEC's chairman.
Mr Wilson said: ''Mr Needham's seat at the DTI is still warm as he
moves effortlessly to the board of a company which is closely involved
with the same department . . . which tells us a lot about how seriously
the Tories are taking Lord Nolan.''
Labour also maintained last night that the taxpayer lost out by up to
#55bn in the sale of former publicly owned companies.
Figures compiled by Darlington MP Alan Milburn show the value of the
privatised utility companies has trebled since they were floated on the
stock market.
Mr Milburn, chairman of Labour's back-bench Treasury Committee, said
the analysis showed that the water, gas, electricity, and telephone
companies were drastically undervalued.
Figures compiled from the Commons library valued the utilities at the
time of sale at #26.8bn, compared with a total stock market value last
month of #82.2bn.
''The British public has paid through the nose, both as consumers and
taxpayers, for the Conservatives' obsession with privatisation,'' said
Mr Milburn.
''The privatised utilities have been allowed to abuse their monopoly
position to fund bumper boardroom pay and profits.''
He called on the National Audit Office to conduct an inquiry into the
under-pricing of former public assets as a matter of priority.
The figures show:
* British Gas valued at #5600m at privatisation, now worth #12.6bn.
* A trebling in value for the regional electricity companies from
#5200m to #16.8bn.
* A six-fold rise in the value of British Telecom from #3900m in 1984
to #24.7bn last month.
The disclosure came as the Observer claimed the privatised companies
showed an immediate rise in value of #8000m in the first month after
flotation.

THE TUC will today call on Chancellor Kenneth Clarke to put jobs
before tax cuts in his November Budget by investing #6.3m to create
100,000 jobs and 600,000 training and work placements.
Housing, the regions, training, and public sector work schemes are
seen as the areas most in need of investment.
In its Budget submission, the TUC says the money should come from
allowing public borrowing to fall less quickly than previously planned,
as well as from next year's Government financial reserves of #3000m. In
addition, local authorities should be allowed to release some capital
receipts and the #5000m they hold from previous house sales.
The Government is also encouraged to promote more private finance in
public products without reducing the public contribution.
The TUC maintains these measures would restore confidence, restart the
economy, and reduce unemployment -- while generating extra tax flows and
reducing benefit payments.
In a bid to influence the special ''spending cuts'' Cabinet meeting
called for next week, the TUC has focused its proposals on what the
Chancellor could achieve within the Government's current economic and
financial constraints and what could be applied without any radical
departure from its economic policy.
TUC general secretary Mr John Monks said Britain urgently needed a
high level of economic investment and the TUC had shown the Government
how it could be achieved.

THE Scottish head of conservation group Plantlife, yesterday warned
that the erection of a sheep fence on Ben Lawers, in Perthshire, may
have damaged a rare plant found only on marshy patches on that mountain.
Mr Michael Scott said yesterday that he did not accept that attempts
by Scottish Natural Heritage, the Government's conservation agency, and
the National Trust for Scotland, which owns part of Ben Lawers, to
minimise damage to the bristle sedge were sufficient.
He said: ''With relatively little effort, the damage could have been
avoided altogether.''
Eighteen months ago, Major General Charles Ramsay, the owner of
Inverinian estate, which forms part of the Ben Lawers National Nature
Reserve, asked for permission to erect fencing to keep sheep off his
land along the boundary, or march, between the two estates.
Discussions were held between representatives of the Inverinian estate
and members of the Ben Lawers management committee, which is made up of
the National Trust for Scotland, SNH, and local farmers with grazing
rights.
The talks were necessary because of the area's designation as a
National Nature Reserve, because of the rare plants found there.
Mr Robin Satow, the trust's factor for Ben Lawers, said: ''Legally
speaking, either owner in a march fence situation has the right to erect
a fence, even if the other party does not wish to have it erected.
''Given that, the trust, SNH, and the adjoining landowner, through his
agent, conducted negotiations to pick a line for the fence. It had to be
as near as possible to the march to be legally competent, and had to
minimise damage to the rare plant interest.''
He said that, with the technical assistance of SNH employees, the
fence was erected ''with minimal damage'' three weeks ago.

A RETIRED council worker has been charged by detectives investigating
the suspicious deaths of 16 men at a homeless hostel with the murders of
two residents.
West Midlands police arrested the 65-year-old at his Birmingham home
last Thursday night after an eight-month investigation into the deaths
of elderly men at the Summerhill hostel in the Ladywood area of
Birmingham.
The man, understood to be a former care worker at the hostel, was
questioned over the weekend by detectives called in after the city's
social services department launched an internal inquiry into alleged
physical abuse.
The home, which has cared for the city's elderly vagrants since 1947,
was run by Birmingham City Council's social services department between
1974 and 1993 when the man charged was employed.
Police were granted a 36-hour custody extension on Saturday after
revealing that the man was being questioned about more than one death at
the home.
Police still refuse to say exactly how many deaths they are
investigating.
Last night a police spokesperson said: ''A 65-year-old Birmingham man
will appear before city magistrates tomorrow charged with the murders of
a 75-year-old man in 1988 and an 83-year-old man in 1989 both of whom
were residents at the Summerhill residential home in Ladywood.
''Inquiries are still continuing and it is likely that he will be
interviewed further about other allegations.''

PRESSURE on British and Irish governments to set a date for the start
of all-party talks on Northern Ireland intensified last night.
The peace process was now at the crossroads, Sinn Fein president Gerry
Adams declared.
''Responsibility for which road we take, that of peace or the dark
journey back from where we have so recently come, is a matter for both
governments,'' he said.
Prime Minister John Major's meeting with the Irish premier, Mr John
Bruton, at Chequers on Wednesday is expected to confirm the setting up
of a disarmament commission and the start of a new round of preliminary
talks involving all sides in Northern Ireland.
Ulster Secretary Sir Patrick Mayhew is due to see the Irish foreign
minister, Mr Dick Spring, in Dublin before returning to Belfast for a
crucial meeting with Mr Adams at Stormont later today.
Downing Street denied that Mr Major was ready to water down the
Government's stance on the decommissioning of IRA arms before Sinn Fein
could take part in all-party talks.
A spokesman said: ''This is utterly untrue. We are still looking for
agreement on principle on the modalities of decommissioning and a
tangible beginning of the process. That is as true today as it was last
week or last year.''
One report had earlier said Mr Major and Mr Bruton had agreed a
compromise under which the arms commission would seek an unequivocal
political commitment from the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries never to
use violence again.
This would mean Sinn Fein going into substantive negotiations without
the Provisionals handing over any guns.
Republican sources in Belfast said yesterday they were unaware of the
alleged compromise plan. On Friday, an IRA source warned that they would
not hand over their weapons, ''through either the front or back doors''.
Mr Adams said the Belfast and Dublin meetings, as well as Wednesday's
summit, were ''potentially the most pivotal and crucial'' in the last 13
months, and he blamed Britain's refusal to move to all-party talks as
the cause for what he described as ''the deepening crisis''.
He said: ''Sinn Fein is totally committed to building a lasting peace,
but we have no room to manoeuvre on the British precondition on
decommissioning. John Major's current strategy appears to be aimed at
getting the Irish government on the decommissioning hook.''
What was now required after this week's meeting was an unambiguous
commitment for the start of all party talks.
The Sinn Fein president added: ''What the peace process does not need
is a summit which reproduces the British agenda. That would spell
disaster for the peace process . . . Sinn Fein is absolutely committed
to helping to take all of the guns permanently out of Irish politics.
''This peace strategy is the correct strategy. But it will not succeed
without all sides being prepared to take risks and engage positively.''
Mr Bruton called on all political parties to ''take risks for peace''
and insisted Mr Major constantly had the peace process ''at the very top
of his political agenda''.
He would not comment on whether Wednesday's summit would produce a
compromise on the IRA arms decommissioning issue.
He underlined the need for all-party talks, but warned: ''Having them
without success is actually a step backwards rather than a step
forward.''
* Labour leader Tony Blair will be among politicians caught up in this
week's hectic round of talks.
Ahead of Wednesday's British-Irish Chequers summit, the Opposition
leader will get briefings on the peace moves on both sides of the Irish
border.
He will meet Mr Spring in Dublin today and Mr Bruton on Tuesday.
On Wednesday he will meet Ulster and Democratic Unionists, the
Alliance Party, RUC Chief Constable Sir Hugh Annesley and trade union
leaders.

Close surveillance placed on Nimrods' safety record after the Lake
Ontario tragedy.
A SAFETY record cultivated over 25 years sank with the seven bodies of
a Nimrod crew in Lake Ontario on Saturday.
There have now been four accidents this year involving the plane. As
RAF aviation experts fly to Canada to inspect the wreckage, questions
are being asked about the plane's age and continued flying ability.
The Ministry of Defence has already invited tenders for the #1000m
contract to replace Britain's fleet of 23 Nimrod aircraft, 20 of which
are based at Kinloss. The end of the aircraft was signalled in January
by Defence Procurement Minister Roger Freeman when he announced the new
contract which will not be completed until 2002.
Yet before this year the Nimrod had an enviable safety record which
had only been disrupted twice in the 25 years since its creation.
In 1980, a Nimrod lost all four engines on take-off from the RAF base
at Kinloss as it ran into a flock of seagulls. The plane crashed into
woods at the end of the runway, killing the pilot and co-pilot.
In 1984, another Nimrod crash-landed at RAF St Mawgan in Cornwall. No
crewmen were injured.
Perhaps the most serious incident, before Saturday's tragedy, took
place in May this year when a Nimrod's starboard engines burst into
flames at 15,000ft. The aircraft was on its first flight after a series
of maintenance checks. The pilot managed a controlled landing in the sea
three miles off Lossiemouth. The seven-man crew was picked up by
helicopter within minutes.
The Nimrod quickly sank but was recovered for inspection. Yet 24 hours
later on May 17, another Nimrod MR2 was hit by engine trouble. The plane
was on patrol eight miles off Ireland when the fault developed.
Airports were put on full alert but the plane managed to limp back to
Kinloss. As recently as June 27, a Nimrod was forced to land at
Stornoway airport after a fire started under the floor on a flight
south-west of Tiree. The crew quickly extinguished the fire, but an
emergency landing was necessary.
It is against this backdrop that the latest accident took place on
Saturday. However, Jim Ferguson, aviation journalist with Rotor and Wing
magazine, defended the aircraft's safety record. ''This is only the
second fatal crash in 25 years,'' he added.
He said there were a number of possible reasons for the plane's crash,
but it was too early to say what had happened. The suggestion that the
crash was caused by birds being sucked into the engines, which caused
the previous fatal crash involving a Nimrod, was possible.
''There were a lot of birds around. If birds hit the engine then it
can cause the turbine discs to break, sending out shrapnel like
fragments. Also the sheer weight of birds in the engine can cause it to
fail.
''The Nimrod did appear to be climbing rather slowly, but against that
is the fact that the Nimrod is a large aircraft and the effects of scale
would of course apply.
''The Nimrods operate in a very rough environment, flying very low
over sea and they have been troubled by corrosion. A small number have
been taken out of service, but apart from that they have performed
extremely well.''
It has been said by senior air force officers that if the Nimrod
aircraft had been part of Churchill's arsenal, the Battle of the
Atlantic would not have taken place, such is the effectiveness of the
aircraft's anti-submarine capabilities. Designed in 1969 and based on
the de Havilland Comet -- the first jet passenger plane -- the Nimrod
evolved to replace the Shackleton as the maritime reconnaissance
aircraft of RAF Strike Command.
Since the Nimrod was put in military service it has performed a twin
use, alternating between war and peace. During times of war, as
demonstrated during the Falklands and Gulf conflicts, the Nimrod has
operated for maritime reconnaissance and as an anti-submarine weapon.
The aircraft is capable of dropping both sonar locating buoys and depth
charges.
During the Gulf war, it regularly flew over Iraq compiling information
on the enemy's electronic equipment. It is claimed that the Allied
success owed much to the information the Nimrods collected on the
enemy's missile sites, radar bases, and arms dumps.
During peacetime, the aircraft is equipped with sonar buoys and is
used for co-ordinating rescue operations. The electronic sensors can
locate vessels and people. Nimrods are also used to direct helicopters
during rescue operations.
Although 13 people make up a standard operational crew, just seven are
required for take-off. Nimrods are serviced every five years, a
six-month process which involves the removal of the aircraft's four
Rolls-Royce Spey engines.
The maintenance of Nimrods was privatised earlier this year. Two
English firms beat off a joint bid by the staff at Kinloss and British
Aerospace. The contract is expected to begin before the end of the year.
At a cost of #30m each, the Nimrod can cruise at 425 knots. During
high-altitude patrols, all four engines are in use, two can be turned
off during low-speed patrolling.
The 90-tonne aircraft was nicknamed the Mighty Hunter in a reference
to the Biblical quotation from Genesis which categorises Nimrod as:
''The first on earth to be a mighty man. . . he was a mighty hunter
before the Lord.''
In a few days, the staff at RAF Kinloss will seek further meaning in
their Bibles at the funerals of their seven colleagues.

SCOTLAND'S oldest and largest Aids charity is to close its Glasgow
office and cut services in Strathclyde with the loss of seven jobs
because of financial cutbacks, it was announced yesterday.
Scottish Aids Monitor (Sam), which provides help and support to HIV
and Aids sufferers, said it had been forced to cut services because
Strathclyde Regional Council and four west coast health boards had
withdrawn #250,000 funding.
Director Ruth Morgan Thomas said the Woodlands Terrace office would
close on October 1. The job cuts will affect the majority of the
region's services, including prison work, the roadshow service, gay
men's rights workers, welfare and administrative staff.
In a separate development, the chief executive, Mr Marwan Ash, has
tendered his resignation.
Ms Thomas said the Edinburgh-based organisation would try to maintain
services by using volunteers.
The council and all four health boards in Strathclyde -- Greater
Glasgow, Lanarkshire, Argyll and Clyde, and Ayrshire and Arran --
switched funding to the newly-formed Project for HIV and Aids Care and
Education (PHACE West) because of a lack of west coast personnel on
Sam's boards.
But Ms Thomas said the move would affect services in the region. She
said: ''We are sad and angry that the board of Scottish Aids Monitor has
had to take these decisions as they should not be seen as a reflection
on the quality, effectiveness or competence of any of the services or
staff within the projects concerned.
''The quality of people's lives will be affected by this move. Funding
should not be cut at a time when the number of people with HIV and Aids
is increasing.''
She stressed that services in Lothian and Tayside, as well as some
work in Ayrshire and Arran, would not be affected by the cuts. Ms Thomas
added that the organisation would continue to try to attract funding for
services in Strathclyde.
She said: ''We have been running this service for 12 years at a level
and quality which can't be matched by anyone else. PHACE West will try
to duplicate the services we have been providing but I'm not sure they
have the experience to do so.''

THE incessant rain did not dampen the spirits of almost 6000 people
who yesterday came to catch a glimpse of the QE2 on only her third visit
to the Clyde since she was launched at Clydebank in September, 1967.
Ma, pa and the weans, not to forget a few grannies and grandpas, waved
and cheered along the esplanade at Greenock and a pipe band played as
the Cunarder slipped away from the town's Ocean Terminal.
Sirens blared as hundreds of small craft accompanied the grand old
lady past the Tail of the Bank.
The 73,000-tonne vessel, carrying 1560 passengers, had visited the
Clyde as part of an eight-night Circling Britain cruise.
Businesses in Greenock appeared to benefit from the liner's visit with
most shops breaking with tradition to open on a rainy Sabbath.
The onlookers included Mr Alex McBride, 62, a retired engineer from
Greenock, who worked on the liner when it was in dry dock at Kincaid's
Engine Works, in 1968.
Mr McBride, whose uncle was chief engineer with Cunard and oversaw the
vessel being built at Clydebank, said: ''I am not surprised at the
turnout today. People remain very proud that the QE2 was built on the
Clyde. It is always good to have her back.''
The first captain of the QE2, Mr William Warwick, 83, was among the
passengers on the round-Britain cruise. His son, Captain Ronald Warwick,
is commander of the vessel.
Mr Warwick, who is on the cruise with his wife Evelyn, 86, was in no
doubt yesterday that the old ship was still in good shape.
''It's certainly changed quite a bit since my day and the changes are
very much for the better,'' he said. Mr Warwick, who was captain of the
ship from 1969 to 1972 by which time his son had joined Cunard, added:
''It's very thrilling to think that Ronald is now in charge. He is doing
a wonderful job. He certainly doesn't need my advice -- he's managing
very well on his own.''
Thousands are expected to turn up today when the QE2 docks at
Invergordon for seven hours.

WORLD church repre-

former Yugoslavia.
At the closing session of their conference in Scotland the World
Alliance of Reformed Churches' European members also launched a fierce
attack on the resumption of nuclear testing by France and China, calling
it ''a retrograde step in the search for a peaceful and nuclear-free
future''.
A final bulletin voiced solidarity with churches in central and
eastern Europe in the fight against ''the outburst of nationalism,
chauvinism and xenophobia'' after the fall of Communism in 1989.
There needed to be open conversation and genuine debate about the
roles played by the churches, their representatives and ecumenical
bodies in relation to the communist regimes, said the Alliance's
European area council.

AFTER the Nato pounding and the Serbs' continued taunts with mortar
and sniper fire, the Bosnian conflict has taken a psychological twist as
the world waits for Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic to capitulate to
UN demands.
A UN spokesman said the Bosnian Serb forces had until 10pm tonight to
agree to a set of conditions including the withdrawal of heavy artillery
and the opening of Sarajevo airport. If they refuse or stay silent the
skies above Sarajevo will again be filled by Nato aircraft on bombing
raids. Nato has also reserved the right to start bombing if any ''safe
area'' is threatened.
While the clock ticked, UN forces unilaterally opened a road into
besieged Sarajevo, defying the Bosnian Serbs by refusing to ask their
permission and forcing the first crack in the Serb stranglehold over
Sarajevo.
In another development, five European Union monitors, initially
reported killed last week in the Nato blitz but later shown alive in
Bosnian Serb custody, were finally released yesterday and crossed the
border into Serbia.
The war seems to have come to a crucial juncture. East Lothian MP John
Home Robertson, who is part of an Edinburgh Direct Aid relief convoy,
said in Split yesterday that it was crucial that the West was prepared
to stand firm.
''If Nato and the UN are prepared to see this thing through, it's
really good news. . . but it's complicated because it depends on how
Serbia is going to react. But I'm delighted that the UN and Nato have
made the military effort to assert authority -- it's about bloody
time,'' said the Labour MP.
In the longer term, Mr Robertson said the conflict had flagged up the
lack of an integrated European military response and he added that there
were numerous lessons to be learned.
''The story here underlines the urgent need to establish a European
security structure and integrated European forces.''
Mr Robertson and the EDA representative have so far been unable to
take a convoy into the Bosnian capital. Stuck on the road at the town of
Tarcin, near Mount Igman on Friday, Mr Robertson said they were hailed
by a group of Scots soldiers who were delighted to be able to react to
the Serb aggression.
''They have seen the evidence of ethnic cleansing. They must have been
aware of the contempt from the local population who have been saying you
are not prepared to lift a finger to deal with this situation. Now at
least they are getting a chance to do what they came here to do and they
are taking a pride in it.''
Meanwhile, as the attention continues to focus on Sarajevo, the
conflict is still flaring elsewhere in the former Yugoslavia. Fighting
re-erupted in Bihac recently with the Bosnian army raining shells on the
near-by Serb lines.
There are also dark tales emerging from Krajina of Croats continuing
to slaughter elderly Serbs who had stayed on after the refugee exodus
last month. Observers returning from the region spoke of citizens in
their 80s whose throats had been slit and houses burned to the ground.
On Saturday, the Croatian army staged a celebratory parade in the
centre of Split to welcome back the fourth brigade from the Krajina
offensive. Mr Robertson refused to watch because he could not stomach
the spectacle. ''The Krajina region confirms our worst fears that they
have an ethnic cleansing agenda just like the Serbs.''
Privately, many Croats believe it was Krajina and the Serbian
president Slobodan Milosevic's unwillingness to intervene on behalf of
his Bosnian Serb brethren which marked the turning point in the war.
With four years of such a confused and bloody conflict, Mr Robertson
said it was not possible to speculate how the different factions of the
former Yugoslavia could learn to live together.
''It's going to have to be resolved, but it's difficult to say how it
will work out. The next generation are going to have to do it, all of
these little kids out there are going to have to find a way.''
But on the streets in Split, in Mostar, and in the towns and villages
which lead to Sarajevo for every child who greets you with a smile there
are more who shape their arms into an imaginary rifle, point it at you
and pull the trigger.

THE location of four Western hostages in Kashmir has been pinpointed
by American spy satellites.
Photographs taken last week show the captives, including Britons Mr
Keith Mangan and Mr Paul Wells, being marched around the mountain
region.
It is understood the information has been passed to the Indian
authorities but that New Delhi is refusing permission for a rescue
mission.
A team from Delta Force, the US equivalent of the SAS, arrived in
India last week. The SAS is also believed to be on stand-by.

MEL Gibson and Michael Forsyth, both resplendent in full Highland
dress, tied for first place in the audience reaction stakes at the gala
premiere of Braveheart in Stirling last night.
More than 1000 fans cheered wildly as the Hollywood actor entered the
town's MacRobert Arts Centre for the star-studded event. The Scottish
Secretary was unceremoniously booed and jeered as he did likewise
minutes before.
''I think,'' said Mr Forsyth, ''the welcome was in good humour.'' On
the night his was the bravest heart of all.
The truth is that if John Major had announced a snap election
yesterday then the Tories would have lost the Battle of Stirling. The
town would have turned tartan and voted SNP. Thanks to a blockbuster
movie Scotland was a nation once again. If only in Stirling and only for
a day.
Halfway through the screening the projection equipment broke down and
left the screen blank for 10 minutes. As the embarrassed audience sat in
silence, Gibson broke the ice by shouting out: ''Does anyone know any
good jokes?''
Braveheart was more than just a night at the pictures. It was a huge
showbiz event -- with more celebrities than you could shake a claymore
at. Stirling Castle, specially floodlit and adapted for the glittering
occasion, was the ultimate party venue.
But more than that Braveheart was an excuse to celebrate William
Wallace, the man who cuffed the English on the battlefield.
The celebrity count was sky high. From the movie's cast there were Ian
Bannen, James Cosmo, Angus Macfadyen, Catherine McCormack, and of course
Mel Gibson himself. From television and film there was Catherine Zeta
Jones, John Leslie, John Gordon Sinclair, Blythe Duff, Muriel Gray, and
Patsy Kensit. From sport there was Gavin Hastings (who received the
second loudest cheer of the night), Kenny Logan, Jackie Stewart and Ally
McCoist. And from politics, as well as Mr Forsyth, there was Shadow
Scottish Secretary George Robertson and Alex Salmond, leader of the SNP,
who arrived during a shower of rain and covered up with a huge black and
yellow SNP brolly.
Gibson appeared genuinely overwhelmed by the adulation of the crowd,
many of whom had stood for hours in the pouring rain. He favoured the
Buchanan tartan and went for the top of the range outfit which came
complete with over-the-shoulder plaid.
As the crowd screamed he was asked what if felt like to be Scotland's
hero. ''Great,'' he said. ''For a day.'' And the kilt? It was
''comfortable''.
Mr Forsyth, on the other hand, appeared underwhelmed by the crowd's
response. Perhaps the charm offensive was not going quite according to
plan. Commenting on a private dinner he had with Gibson and film
executives the previous evening, he said: ''Mr Gibson gave us some
useful advice on how we can get more films made in Scotland and
encourage our own talent.
''He thought that tax breaks were not so important and said we should
try to create a one-stop shop offering all the facilities for
film-makers.''
The most eloquent remark about the night came from Scots actor James
Cosmo.
''This is the best and most important film Scotland has ever made,
both politically and emotionally. I took great pride just driving down
to Stirling today and seeing the Wallace Monument looming over the
town,'' he said.
More than 750 people attended last night's premiere for Braveheart,
which cost #80m and was directed by Gibson.
After the screening of the three-hour film guests made their way to
Stirling Castle for a spectacular party. En route they passed the
floodlit Stirling Bridge where Wallace fought one of his bravest
battles. In the distance the Wallace Monument had been especially lit in
honour of both the hero and the occasion.

A TEAM of experts from RAF Kinloss will fly to Canada today to help
try to determine the cause of the Nimrod crash which killed the
aircraft's seven crew.
Thousands of aircraft enthusiasts saw the Nimrod from 120 Squadron at
the Morayshire base plunge from 800ft into Lake Ontario as it neared the
end of its four and a half minute display at the Canadian National
Exhibition Airshow on Saturday.
Spectators had just watched the #30m aircraft fly low past the crowds
lining the shore of the lake. It banked left and, as it turned, nose
dived into the water around one mile offshore only yards from numerous
pleasure craft on the lake.
There were suggestions the pilot may have guided the diving aircraft
away from the boats.
All the crew lived in or near the Kinloss base, and four children will
be left fatherless as a result of the disaster.
The pilot was 31-year-old Flight Lieutenant Dom Gilbert, a former
press liaison officer at RAF Kinloss. He had been at the base for 10
years and was married with one child.
The co-pilot was Flight Lieutenant Glenn Hooper, who was 25 and
single.
The other victims were air engineer Sergeant Gary Moxham, 32, who was
married, navigator Flight Lieutenant Nick Brooks, 26, who was married,
air electronics operators Sergeant Richie Williams, 28, single, Sergeant
Craig Barnett, 32, married with one child, and air electronics officer
Flight Lieutenant Bernie Worthington, 37, married with two children.
Squadron Leader John Horrocks said yesterday at RAF Kinloss that the
Canadian authorities would also be launching an inquiry into the crash.
Millions of people around the world saw the last seconds of the flight,
which were recorded by Canadian television.
During its normal display routine, the Nimrod carries out a flypast of
the crowd at 300ft, performs two 360-degree turns, two banking turns,
and a climb to nearly 3000ft.
According to eyewitnesses, it nosedived at the end of a descent from
800ft to 300ft. It was thought to have hit the water at more than
230mph.
Many of the thousands of spectators who saw the crash claimed to have
heard the engines cut out moments before it went out of control at the
end of its four-and-a-half minute routine. There were also suggestions
that there were problems with flocks of birds in the area.
However, Squadron Leader Horrocks said there had never been a case of
all four engines cutting out at once and the theory was ''extremely
unlikely''.
Nimrods have been performing flying displays throughout the world for
around 26 years and are one of the most popular aircraft with aviation
fans.
Squadron Leader Horrocks added: ''Display pilots are specifically
selected and trained. There is a rigorous series of supervised practice
flights.
''We have been using the four-and-a-half minute display for the last
20 years. It is not a taxing sequence. It is relatively
straightforward.''
He said the television video footage would be of great assistance in
the investigation into the cause and said the Canadian authorities were
trying to track down any amateur video of the tragedy.
The Mighty Hunter, as the Nimrod is known, was developed from the
basic airframe of the De Havilland Comet, the world's first jet
airliner, and was designed primarily for long-range maritime
reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare.
It is also equipped for search and rescue missions and the RAF fleet
has been involved in countless sea rescues.
In 1980, the pilot and co-pilot of a Nimrod were killed when it
crashed into dense forest only one mile from RAF Kinloss after hitting a
flock of birds during take-off.
The Mark Two Nimrod No XV 239 involved in the Canadian crash was
23-years-old and had completed 12,000 flying hours, the equivalent of
almost 18 months in the air.
The RAF yesterday was refusing to speculate on the reasons for the
disaster, the first involving a Nimrod during a public flying
demonstration.
A spokesman said: ''It would be entirely improper of us to speculate
in any way on what went wrong or to apportion blame. Anything that is
being said by outside civilians is nothing more or less than pure
speculation. The reasons for the loss of this aircraft and its crew are
properly matters for the board of inquiry to determine.''
The RAF inquiry will focus on a number of possibilities. These may
include a bird strike, a serious mechanical or control malfunction, or
pilot error.
The RAF spokesman said bird strikes were a regular occurrence about
which little could be done and jet aircraft coped badly with them.
However, it would be extremely unusual for all four engines to be
affected.
Divers quickly found the wreckage of the Nimrod, which had broken into
four main sections and was lying in 70ft of water. Attempts were being
made last night to recover the wreckage and the bodies from Lake
Ontario.
Toronto police said the search and rescue operation had been
suspendedearlier in the day to allow the air show to continue.
Local journalist Bob Mitchell, who was watching the display, said:
''The Nimrod had done one low-level pass of the crowd lining the shores.
It banked over to the left and turned and then the engines appeared to
shut down. There were hundreds of sailing and pleasure boats out in the
lake and I had the impression that the pilot deliberately tried to avoid
them and make a controlled landing on the surface of the lake.
''Then there was a huge splash of water about three quarters of a mile
offshore and bits and pieces of aircraft debris flew about in all
directions. It literally only took four or five seconds to sink and
disappear from view completely. The spectators who were on a happy day
out by the lake were totally stunned by what they saw.''
Another witness said: ''There is no question in my mind that it lost
power.''
At RAF Kinloss, from where the crew left on August 23, their
colleagues were also stunned by the tragedy.
Squadron Leader Horrocks said that clearly the families of the
deceased were distraught.
''Kinloss is a close-knit community within the air force. All of the
crew were well-known to us all here and this loss will weigh heavily on
all the personnel here and with the townsfolk of Forres, to whom many of
them were also known,'' he said.
Yesterday, many of the 2000 serving airmen at Kinloss attended church
services with their families at the base. Prayers were said for the
families of the dead crew.
Yesterday morning, the RAF took a decision to fly the members of the
official board of inquiry to Toronto. They will go today either by
Nimrod or on a civilian flight if that can be arranged more quickly.
This means that the 15 other Kinloss-based airmen who were over on
detachment in Canada with the ill-fated aircraft will remain there until
they have been interviewed.
The board of inquiry team, which was appointed yesterday, consists of
senior RAF officers and flying and engineering experts on the aircraft
which was manufactured by British Aerospace.
The base's commanding officer, Group Captain Bob Joseph, carried out
the difficult task of informing next of kin of the tragedy and a
specialist team are counselling the families of the men who died.
Specialists are also flying to Canada to counsel the remaining 15 men
in the Nimrod team, many of whom are in shock at losing their
colleagues.
The ground crew had finished preparing the aircraft at its take-off
point 10 miles away at Lester B Pearson International, in Toronto,
Canada's busiest civilian airport, minutes before the tragedy.
It was the Nimrod's second event in Canada. Last week, it took part in
a show in Shearwater, Nova Scotia.
Squadron Leader Horrocks said that, although the tragedy would lead to
a review of the RAF decision allowing Nimrods to take part in air shows,
there was no question of the whole fleet being grounded.
However, a display due to take place this afternoon at a south of
England air show by a Nimrod was cancelled.
A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman said the appearance of the Nimrod at
the Shepway Air Show, at Folkestone, Kent, would have been inappropriate
so soon after the tragedy.
She said: ''It was decided that the Nimrod should not take part out of
respect for those who died in Canada.''
